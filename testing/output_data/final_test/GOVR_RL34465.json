It represents significant legislation since the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, focusing on renewing user fee programs like PDUFA and MDUFMA. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA; P.L. 110-85) was signed into law in 2007, reauthorizing FDA programs and expanding the agency's authority for drug and food safety. It includes provisions to enhance drug safety, develop pediatric medical devices, improve food safety, and impact public health. Several provisions authorize funding, create new responsibilities for federal agency personnel, and have sunset dates in 2012 or early 2013. FDAAA's impact on FDA is important for ongoing policy discussions. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA; P.L. 110-85) was signed into law in 2007, reauthorizing FDA programs and expanding the agency's authority for drug and food safety. FDAAA's impact on FDA is important for ongoing policy discussions regarding additional legislation to refine the agency's regulatory role and the regulation of medical products in the health care system. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The FDA regulates drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs for safety and effectiveness. Products requiring premarket approval must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before entering commerce. The agency has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding, especially in light of media coverage on food, drug, and medical device safety issues. Congress is concerned with balancing the need for premarket approval with FDA oversight. The central issue for Congress is balancing the need for the FDA to speed safe and effective products to market with its ability to prevent unsafe products from entering or staying on the market. Key issues for products not requiring premarket approval include FDA's ability to ensure product safety and protect public health. Prior to the introduction of H.R. 3580, Congress had passed comprehensive FDA reauthorization and reform legislation. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 had similar provisions, but S. 1082 included additional provisions on food safety, prescription drug importation, and domestic pet turtle market access. Only the food safety provisions were adopted in FDAAA. FDAAA consists of eleven titles, each discussed in detail in the report, with comparisons to previous laws. Title X, Food Safety, is briefly described in this report but covered more extensively in a separate CRS report. The report also clarifies that the Commissioner refers to the FDA Commissioner, and the Secretary refers to... The report clarifies acronyms used, provides tables comparing FDAAA with previous laws, and explains how table text across different laws indicates reauthorization or interaction with preexisting laws. Title I of FDAAA, known as PDUFA IV, extends FDA's authority to collect user fees from drug manufacturers and expands the use of fee revenue. PDUFA fees have been a significant source of FDA funding, increasing from 9.7% in FY1994 to 44.7% in FY2007. Before PDUFA's enactment in 1992, FDA, consumers, and manufacturers aimed to reduce the time between application submission and approval decision. PDUFA provided FDA with funding to expedite new product reviews, leading to a decrease in review times from 29 months in 1987 to 17 months in 1994. However, there was a perceived imbalance between resources for premarket and postmarket activities, prompting Congress to allow some fee revenue to be used for postmarket safety activities during reauthorizations in 1997 and 2002. Title I of FDAAA addresses various types of fees collected from manufacturers of drugs and biological products, including application fees, establishment fees, and product fees. The legislation also authorizes fee revenue usage, new fees for advisory review of direct-to-consumer TV ads, reauthorization and reporting requirements, and effective dates. FDAAA establishes fee revenues for drug safety activities totaling $225 million over five years. The law expands the use of fees for postmarket safety activities, including adverse-event data collection systems, analytical tools, and FFDCA requirements for postapproval studies and clinical trials. FDAAA establishes new user fees for drug safety activities, including postmarket safety measures and adverse event reporting. It also introduces a fee for FDA's advisory review of prescription-drug TV ads, with manufacturers paying for pre-dissemination reviews. The law sets a minimum fee requirement, and if not met, the program will not start, and fees will be refunded. FDAAA codifies core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, including annual performance and fiscal reports to Congress. It also requires the Secretary to consult with various stakeholders for PDUFA reauthorization, effective October 1, 2007. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2007 (MDUFA 2007) reauthorizes FDA's authority to collect user fees from medical device manufacturers. This authority initially granted in 2002 with the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA) established user fees for various types of premarket device reviews and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. In FY2007, medical device user fees generated $35,202,000, an increase of 144.7% from FY2003. FDA's authority to collect these fees was reauthorized in MDUFA 2007, adding new types of user fees and making changes to the regulation of medical devices. MDUFA 2007 introduced new types of user fees for medical devices, including establishment registration fees, annual fees, and 30-day fees. These fees are meant to provide a predictable base of income for the FDA. The shift towards annual fees aims to create a more reliable revenue stream, similar to the approach taken for drugs and biological products under PDUFA. Despite lower individual fee amounts in FY2008, the total fee revenue is expected to increase from previous levels. MDUFA 2007 introduced new types of user fees for medical devices, including establishment registration fees, annual fees, and 30-day fees. The total fee revenue generated will increase from FY2007 levels, offsetting revenue lost in reduced fee amounts with revenue from new fees. MDUFA 2007 changes provisions related to specific fees, setting fee amounts as a proportion of the cost of submitting a PMA. The law also allows for adjustments to fee amounts, such as the establishment fee, to ensure sufficient revenue. Additionally, MDUFA 2007 modifies the law regarding reduced fees for small businesses. MDUFA 2007 reduced fees for small businesses by waiving certain fees and reducing others. It also allowed foreign firms to qualify as small businesses and provided the possibility of refunds for modular applications withdrawn at different points. Additionally, it extended a trigger requirement indefinitely to ensure user fees supplement direct appropriations. MDUFA 2007 amended provisions on the collection and use of medical device user fees. Excess fees can now be carried over to cover shortfalls in subsequent years. The fees are dedicated to expediting device application reviews and ensuring device safety and effectiveness. MDUFA 2007 amended provisions on medical device user fees, allowing excess fees to be carried over for future use. The law requires annual performance and fiscal reports, consultation with various groups, and public input in developing performance goals. MDUFA 2007, effective from October 1, 2007, specifies revisions to recommendations based on public comments, requires transmittal to Congress, and incorporates performance goal-related requirements into the FFDCA. It authorizes specific appropriations for postmarket safety information on medical devices from FY2008 to FY2012. The law also extends the authority for third-party review of premarket notifications and mandates annual registration of device producers with the FDA. MDUFA 2007 amends regulations for device registration, electronic filing, unique identification system, reporting requirements for serious injuries or deaths, and inspections by accredited third parties. MDUFA 2007 revises requirements for inspections by accredited third parties, reducing administrative requirements, expanding participation, and allowing device companies to submit reports assessing conformance with international quality standards. The FDA considers these reports for inspection priorities. The Comptroller General conducts studies on the use of premarket notification for device safety and nosocomial infections, while the FDA conducts a study on... The FDA is required to study the relationship between indoor tanning device use and skin damage for possible label changes. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 addresses the need for pediatric medical devices due to differences in children's physiology and activities. The act introduces new reporting requirements and incentives to encourage the development of pediatric devices. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act (PMDSIA) introduces reporting requirements for pediatric devices, offers incentives to manufacturers, and allows FDA to mandate postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices. PMDSIA applies to applications under FFDCA sections 515 and 520(m), governing PMAs for class III devices and humanitarian device exemptions (HDEs) respectively. HDEs allow marketing without proving effectiveness for devices targeting less than 4,000 U.S. patients, aiding rare disease patients. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act (PMDSIA) introduces requirements for pediatric devices under FFDCA sections 515 and 520(m). It mandates reporting on pediatric devices, offers incentives to manufacturers, and allows FDA to require postmarket studies for approved pediatric devices. PMDSIA aims to assist patients with rare diseases and conditions by creating incentives for manufacturers to develop pediatric medical devices. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act (PMDSIA) provides incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric medical devices by exempting specified manufacturers from the general HDE prohibition on selling devices for more than their costs. It also gives the Secretary enforcement and inspection authorities related to pricing exemptions and requires reporting on adverse events. Additionally, PMDSIA mandates a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development with an authorized funding of $6 million. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act (PMDSIA) authorizes $6 million per year for a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. It requires the NIH Director to designate a contact point for funding, the Secretary to submit a plan for expanding pediatric medical device research, and incorporates postmarket surveillance measures for pediatric devices. It expands conditions for postmarket studies for class II or III devices used in pediatric populations. The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act (PMDSIA) allows for postmarket surveillance of pediatric devices and includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved products for children can lead to ineffective or harmful outcomes due to differences in drug metabolism and side effects in pediatric populations. The FDA and Congress developed two approaches to facilitate pediatric research: the Pediatric Research Equity Act (mandatory) and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (voluntary). These programs aim to address unique side effects in children and encourage pediatric studies in new drug applications. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) mandates manufacturers to submit pediatric testing data with new drug applications. In 2003, Congress gave FDA authority to enforce PREA requirements, covering new drug applications for various criteria. The Act includes provisions for deferrals and waivers, and allows the Secretary to require pediatric assessments for already approved drugs. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 strengthened PREA. The Research Equity Act of 2007, part of FDAAA, strengthens PREA by enhancing standards for required tests, deferrals, labeling, and public information. It mandates an internal FDA committee for reviewing pediatric plans, assessments, deferrals, and waivers. The law also includes a dispute resolution process for labeling changes, reporting requirements for adverse events, and mandates reports from the Institute of Medicine and the Government Accountability Office. Title V of FDAAA reauthorizes and changes legislation first passed in 1997, providing drug manufacturers with a financial incentive to conduct pediatric use studies on their patented products. If a manufacturer complies with an FDA request for a specific pediatric study, FDA adds six months to market exclusivity for that product. This is the second approach taken by FDA and Congress to encourage pediatric drug research, with the first being required pediatric assessments of new products. Title IV of FDAAA, known as BPCA 2002, reauthorized exclusivity provisions for pediatric research on off-patent products and established an off-patent research fund at NIH. It also allowed FDA to refer drugs needing pediatric studies to the Foundation for the NIH if manufacturers declined requests for studies. The 2002 BPCA included provisions for pediatric studies, priority status for supplemental applications, establishment of FDA Office of Pediatric Therapeutics, definition of pediatric age groups, and a review of regulations and evidence-based research involving children. FDAAA reauthorized the pediatric exclusivity program, encouraged research on off-patent products, and strengthened labeling requirements based on pediatric studies. FDAAA strengthens labeling requirements for pediatric studies, authorizes additional marketing exclusivity after completing requested studies, and mandates sponsors to propose pediatric labeling based on study results. The FDAAA strengthens labeling requirements for pediatric studies, authorizes additional marketing exclusivity, mandates sponsors to propose pediatric labeling based on study results, and sets time frames for required actions. Public notice requirements are expanded, and a new dispute resolution process is introduced, including referral to the Pediatric Advisory Committee. The FDAAA strengthens pediatric labeling requirements, mandates review by an internal committee, tracks pediatric studies and labeling changes, requires submission of adverse event reports, refines study scope, and excludes drugs with expiring exclusivity. It amends PHSA Section 409I to list approved drugs needing pediatric studies and changes the annual list requirement. The FDAAA updates pediatric labeling requirements, establishes a priority list for pediatric therapeutics every three years, mandates studies for drugs lacking pediatric information, and creates the Reagan-Udall Foundation to support FDA's product development mission. The FDAAA establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation to support FDA's product development mission by appointing a Board of Directors and directing the Foundation to coordinate with federal programs and award grants to advance goals. The Foundation is funded annually by transferring $500,000 to $1,250,000 from FDA appropriations. The FDAAA mandates the establishment of an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA to oversee research programs and collaborate with educational organizations for medical product innovation and safety. Title VII of FDAAA, Conflicts of Interest, revises FDA's approach to conflicts of interest among advisory committee members. FDA uses advisory committees for independent advice on drugs, devices, and food. The agency must address conflicts of interest to maintain credibility, but expert members often have ties to the industry, creating potential conflicts. Prior to the passage of FDAAA, FDA advisory committees were reported to have biases in favor of drug approval and many members had conflicts of interest. The law required committee members to be free from conflicts of interest, with exceptions allowed under specific circumstances. Conflicts of interest required disclosure, refraining from voting, and/or not participating in a committee. The law was primarily articulated in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, FDA advisory committee policy, and laws governing special government employees. FDAAA, effective October 1, 2007, changes the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting for advisory committee members. It expands requirements to all FDA-regulated products, defining advisory committees and financial interests as per FACA and 18 USC 208(a) respectively. FDAAA, effective October 1, 2007, changes the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting for advisory committee members. It expands requirements to all FDA-regulated products, defining advisory committees and financial interests as per FACA and 18 USC 208(a) respectively. The Act requires full financial disclosure from committee members before related meetings and restricts participation by those with conflicts of interest unless exempted by the Office of Government Ethics. Waivers of voting restrictions may be granted if necessary. The FDAAA Act, effective October 1, 2007, changes the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting for advisory committee members. It restricts the percentage of committee membership with financial conflict exceptions and requires public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers. Title VIII of FDAAA, Clinical Trial Databases, expands requirements for clinical trial registration and result publication. It emphasizes the importance of scientific inquiry and objective findings in medical product development. Medical product development relies on traditional scientific methods, with sponsors being typically business enterprises. They must demonstrate safety and effectiveness through clinical trials before marketing. However, there is reluctance to publish trial results that do not show products outperforming a placebo or raise safety concerns. In 2004, concerns were raised about the undisclosed unfavorable trial results of FDA-approved products. This led to a push for public access to all trial results, regardless of findings, culminating in the enactment of FDAAA requiring clinical trial registration for certain life-threatening drug trials. Title VIII of FDAAA addresses criticisms of the initial requirement for clinical trial registration by expanding the scope to include trials for drugs, devices, and biologics beyond Phase I. It mandates the submission of specified information by the trial's responsible party to the NIH Director for public availability online, with enforcement mechanisms for noncompliance. FDAAA authorizes $10,000,000 annually for clinical trials database provisions, expanding clinicaltrials.gov to include drug, device, and biologics trials registration with specific information requirements. The FDAAA authorizes $10,000,000 annually for clinical trials database provisions, expanding clinicaltrials.gov to include drug, device, and biologics trials registration with specific information requirements. The NIH Director is required to ensure that trial information is easily searchable and comparable, with submissions due within 21 days of the first patient enrollment. Drug and biologics trial information must be posted within 30 days of submission, while device trial information is posted after FDA approval or clearance, but within 30 days. The FDAAA requires the Secretary, through the NIH Director, to expand clinicaltrials.gov to include results of applicable clinical trials. Three categories of results information are to be added within specific timeframes, with the first category to be added 90 days after FDAAA enactment. The FDAAA requires expanding clinicaltrials.gov to include results of applicable clinical trials within specific timeframes. Results include existing FDA and NIH documentation, basic demographic and outcome information, and scientific point of contact details. The FDAAA mandates the submission of basic results information for FDA-approved trials to the Secretary within one year of completion. Rulemaking within three years will expand the registry to include additional results information. The FDAAA mandates submission of basic results for FDA-approved trials to the Secretary within one year of completion. Rulemaking within three years will expand the registry to include additional results information, adverse event reporting requirements apply to drugs, biologics, and medical devices. The Secretary must determine the best method for including appropriate information on serious and frequent adverse events in the registry and results database within 18 months of FDAAA enactment. If no action is taken within 24 months, specified adverse-event related elements must be included. The FDAAA includes enforcement and compliance requirements for submitting clinical trial information to the FDA. It specifies civil penalties for noncompliance, including requirements for federal grant funding, drug submissions, and truthfulness of information. The NIH Director must notify if required clinical trials are not submitted. FDAAA enforces penalties for failing to submit clinical trial information to the FDA, including civil monetary penalties. It also requires updates to informed consent regulations and state clinical trial databases. The Act prohibits states from requiring registration of clinical trials in a database. It clarifies that submission of off-label use trial information does not imply a new intended use. FDA gains new authorities under Title IX of FDAAA to ensure drug safety and effectiveness. Since the 1938 FFDCA passage, drug manufacturers must demonstrate safety and effectiveness to FDA for approval. FDA cannot guarantee complete safety but assesses if a drug is safe enough for intended use. Monitoring for new information is crucial as rare adverse effects may not surface until widespread use. FDAAA allowed FDA to mandate postmarket studies for initial drug approval. The FDAAA allowed the FDA to require postmarket studies for initial drug approval, but did not authorize the FDA to add requirements after approval. The law also did not allow the FDA to review drug advertising material before dissemination or impose civil penalties. The Secretary can require postmarket studies or clinical trials based on new information after a drug is on the market. The FDAAA authorizes the Secretary to require postmarket studies or trials to assess serious risks, mandate labeling changes based on new safety information, and implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies when necessary. These requirements include dispute resolution procedures and timelines for assessments. The FDAAA authorizes the Secretary to require postmarket studies or trials to assess serious risks, mandate labeling changes based on new safety information, and implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies when necessary. Any approved REMS must include a timetable of assessments, instructions to patients and clinicians, and restrictions on distribution or use. FDA practice has long included most elements of a REMS. FDAAA gives FDA authority for structured follow-through, dispute resolution, and enforcement through the REMS process. FDAAA expands misbranding definition to include failure to comply with REMS, postmarket studies, and labeling requirements. It establishes civil monetary penalties for violations, with maximum penalties ranging from $250,000 to $10 million. A new FFDCA Section 503B authorizes the Secretary to review television advertisements before dissemination. The Secretary may review drug ads for specific population impacts and recommend changes. Required disclosures in ads include serious risks and approval date. Civil penalties are imposed for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads, with a maximum of $250,000 for the first offense. The FDAAA imposes civil penalties for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads, limited to $250,000 for the first violation and $500,000 for subsequent violations in a three-year period. It requires a study on DTC advertising's impact on health information access and disparities, collaboration with various entities to develop a postmarket risk analysis system, and protection of health information. Additionally, it authorizes $25 million appropriations for FY2008. Title IX of FDAAA addresses communication of risks and benefits to the public, including the use of REMS and unique symbols in drug labeling. DTC prescription drug ads must include a statement encouraging reporting of side effects to FDA. Increased appropriations are authorized for drug safety provisions. The new law increases PDUFA revenue by $225 million for drug safety activities over FY2008-FY2012. Subtitle B of FDAAA Title IX covers drug safety topics, including guidance for antibiotic drug trials, physical security of drug products, and communication with the public and expert committees. The Secretary is required to communicate with the public, expert committees, and others about agency actions and plans. They must maintain a website with drug safety information, publish a list of authorized generic drugs, provide public access to product approval packages, establish an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication, and report on FDA's response to drug safety recommendations. Additionally, the Secretary must screen the Adverse Event Reporting System database weekly and report quarterly on new safety information or potential risks. Title X of FDAAA, entitled Food Safety, enhances FDA's authority to ensure the safety of the food supply in response to outbreaks of food-borne illness. FDAAA prohibits certain drugs in food and sets requirements for generic drug application reviews. The Food Safety section of FDAAA enhances FDA's authority to ensure food safety by establishing processing and ingredient standards, updating labeling requirements for pet food, and creating an early warning system for identifying adulteration and outbreaks. It also requires the establishment of a registry for reportable food safety issues, alerts for problematic foods, and attention to aquaculture and seafood inspection. Subtitle A of Title XI of FDAAA covers a range of topics including FDA employee publications, tropical disease treatments, genetic tests, NIH, and severability of FDAAA. The Secretary is required to establish clear policies for agency clearance of employee scientific publications. Subtitle A of Title XI of FDAAA introduces a timeline for agency review of employee publications and the introduction of a priority review voucher for medical products treating tropical diseases. The voucher is for diseases listed in the law or designated by the Secretary, focusing on diseases affecting poor populations with limited market treatments. This provision expands the FDA's priority review mechanism. The FDAAA introduces a priority review voucher for tropical disease products, allowing sponsors to transfer or sell the voucher. The Secretary will establish a user fee program for sponsors of human drug applications with a voucher. Additionally, the regulation of genetic testing is addressed, requiring a report from the Secretary's Advisory Committee or a study by the IOM if the report is not completed by July 2008. The Secretary will contract with the IOM to conduct a study and issue a report on technical amendments to the PHSA. These amendments include adding minority health disparities to data collection for NIH research priorities and including postdoctoral training in research activities cataloged by the NIH Director. The FDAAA addresses antibiotic access and innovation by amending the FFDCA and the PHSA. It also includes provisions for reporting postdoctoral training funded through research grants and specifies that leaves of absence should be subtracted when calculating the average time between graduate study and receipt of a doctoral degree. Additionally, it includes a provision for severability, stating that if any part of the Act is found to be unconstitutional, the rest of the Act will remain in effect. The FDAAA amends the FFDCA and PHSA, linking antibiotic regulation and orphan drug incentives. It requires a GAO report on the impact of these changes and extends the Secretary's authority to issue grants for orphan drug development. Additionally, it allows sponsors to consider certain chemical variants as the same active ingredient. The FDAAA amends the FFDCA and PHSA, linking antibiotic regulation and orphan drug incentives. It allows sponsors to consider certain chemical variants as the same active ingredient and requires the Secretary to make clinically susceptible concentrations of bacteria publicly available. Additionally, it includes authorized appropriations and action items with deadlines for government officials. The chart includes federal agency personnel deadlines with specific dates only, not listing deadlines for non-governmental personnel or actions without specific deadlines. The title of the person required to take action is bolded for user ease. Recurring actions like annual reports are listed by date, with the requirement for recurrence specified in the text. Appendices include authorities with sunset dates and an alphabetical list of acronyms."
