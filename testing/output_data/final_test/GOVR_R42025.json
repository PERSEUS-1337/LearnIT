    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, signed into law on November 25, 2002. It was created from components of 22 different government agencies and began operations on March 1, 2003. DHS has undergone restructurings to improve effectiveness, but many homeland security functions remain in other executive branch agencies. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002 from components of 22 government agencies. Some missions of the Department are not officially \"homeland security\" related, such as the Coast Guard's environmental missions. Issues like the role of the military in law enforcement and foreign policy fall within the four mission study areas for the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review mandated by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 covers Counterterrorism, Security Management, Border Security, Trade Immigration, Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery, as well as management issues at DHS. The U.S. government has spent $636 billion on homeland security post-9/11, with a 300% increase in spending from 2001 to 2011, peaking at $74 billion in FY2009. Funding for homeland security activities increased annually from 2001 to 2011, reaching a peak of $74 billion in FY2009. The budget request for FY2012 is $71.6 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion from the peak. In 2010, neither the House nor the Senate completed work on appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the first time. The resolution for FY2011 provided $41.7 billion in discretionary appropriations, giving the department less explicit direction from Congress compared to previous years. The Budget Control and Deficit Reduction Act of 2011 defines security spending as a newly categorized area, including funding for various departments and agencies. These accounts will be limited to $684 billion in FY2012, with growth restricted to $2 billion in FY2013. The current budget environment poses challenges for the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges in the current budget environment as it competes for limited funds with other government agencies. The potential impact of the budget changes is discussed throughout the report, with a focus on addressing transnational terrorism, particularly actions against Al Qaeda. The Administration's National Strategy for Counterterrorism, released in June 2011, primarily focuses on addressing threats from Al Qaeda and its affiliates. Understanding the global nature and capabilities of these terrorist groups is crucial for formulating effective strategic policies. Recent years have seen an increase in terrorist actions by entities claiming affiliation with Al Qaeda. Recent global terrorist attacks have been carried out by individuals or small cells claiming affiliation with Al Qaeda. U.S. officials believe that counterterrorism efforts have significantly weakened Al Qaeda's ability to launch major attacks. Some experts argue that Al Qaeda has evolved into a philosophical movement, making it harder to combat. Security experts warn that Al Qaeda and its affiliates will remain a threat, especially as the nation's budgetary situation could impact security measures. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross believes that as the national debt rises, spending cuts may weaken the U.S.'s ability to combat Al Qaeda in multiple countries. John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, is concerned about the long-term fiscal implications of counterterrorism policies in response to Osama bin Laden's global terrorism objectives. The terrorist threat to U.S. global interests remains a critical issue for the Administration and 112th Congress, with individuals arrested for attacks and planning terrorism-related activities. Attacks, successful and unsuccessful, have been transnational in nature, ranging from lone shooters to terrorist organizations planning large-scale destruction. The 112th Congress has taken steps to address these threats. The 112th Congress has been reviewing various counterterrorism efforts, including public diplomacy, sanctions, terrorism financing, and the relationship between domestic and international terrorism activities. The second session may assess the Obama Administration's strategies and programs to determine if additional guidance or legislation is needed, considering the balance between U.S. global security interests and fiscal challenges. Since May 2009, there has been a rise in homegrown jihadist terrorist plots in the United States, with over 30 arrests made by American citizens or legal residents. This spike in activity, compared to the period after 9/11, suggests that some Americans are susceptible to ideologies supporting violent jihad. Since May 2009, there has been a rise in homegrown jihadist terrorist plots in the United States, with over 30 arrests made by American citizens or legal residents. The trend in jihadist terrorist activity has shifted away from core members of significant terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. Plots have involved individuals interested in various ways to harm U.S. interests, including becoming foreign fighters, planning attacks using explosives or firearms, and funding jihadist activities. A minority of homegrown jihadists show interest in martyrdom and have varying operational capabilities. Lone wolves have carried out successful attacks since 9/11. The Obama administration recognizes the homegrown jihadist threat in recent strategy documents, focusing on Al Qaeda and its affiliates. John Brennan described the strategy as emphasizing the homeland as a primary area of concern. The Obama Administration's strategy for combating violent extremism focuses on countering radicalization, including that of violent jihadists. The domestic approach emphasizes protecting civil rights and federal cooperation with local leaders. However, the strategy lacks specific details compared to other nations, such as the UK's \"Prevent\" strategy, which is over 100 pages long and outlines numerous programs. The U.S. strategy to combat violent extremism lacks specifics and is described as \"very aspirational\" by experts. Critics point out the absence of a national estimate of domestic terrorist threats, intelligence collection plan, and coordination. Congress may need to oversee the development of a national domestic intelligence framework as part of a unified strategy. Law enforcement's focus on preventive policing post-9/11 aims to disrupt terrorist plots before they occur. The FBI faces challenges in gauging the transition from radicalized beliefs to violence to detect and disrupt terrorist plots. Controversy surrounds the 2008 revision to the Attorney General's Guidelines for FBI Operations, allowing assessments without factual predication. Civil libertarians have raised concerns, leading to further revisions. To counter violent jihadist plots, law enforcement agencies use innovative tactics such as the \"Al Capone\" approach and employing \"agents provocateurs\" to arrest suspects before terrorist acts are committed. Cooperation from the public is crucial in preventing terrorist attacks. The cooperation of the public, especially American Muslim communities, is essential in preventing terrorist attacks. Government agencies work with these communities to deploy medical countermeasures after CBRN attacks. Despite efforts, the pharmaceutical industry has developed few new countermeasures, raising concerns about distribution post-attack. The 112th Congress is considering reauthorizing programs to enhance the government's ability to procure and distribute medical countermeasures. The Project BioShield Act was passed in 2004 to encourage the private sector to develop CBRN medical countermeasures by providing a guaranteed federal market. Congress allocated $5.6 billion for acquisitions from FY2004-FY2013, with $2.563 billion already obligated. Additional funds were removed from the account, and the President requested transferring $765 million for CBRN development in FY2012. Congress is considering extending the program authority, changing the account structure, and determining the funding for acquisitions beyond FY2013. In 2006, Congress passed the Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417) to improve government efforts for CBRN countermeasure research, development, and procurement. Congress is considering changes like moving stockpiling programs to ASPR, allowing more flexibility in using Project BioShield funds, and requiring new countermeasure and budget plans. The President has requested the creation of a new program. The President has requested the creation of a nongovernmental strategic investment firm to support small companies developing medical countermeasure technologies. Distribution of medical countermeasures remains a challenge, with questions about the sufficiency of federal programs to distribute stockpiles during emergencies. The 112th Congress is considering improvements in this area. The 112th Congress is evaluating the efficiency of transferring the CDC's Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to ASPR for better coordination in countermeasure development and distribution programs. They are also assessing federal programs to enhance state and local stockpiling efforts, considering alternative distribution methods like home or business stockpiling and postal service distribution. These proposals aim to improve distribution but raise concerns about costs, misuse of stockpiles, and local implementation challenges. Additionally, Congress is reviewing HHS's request for expanded authority to use unapproved countermeasures. HHS has requested changes to its authority to use unapproved countermeasures in emergencies, aiming to improve distribution flexibility. Congress is also considering incorporating terrorist watch list checks into firearms background check processes to address counterterrorism concerns. Before 2004, the FBI did not check terrorist watch lists during background checks for firearms. However, in February 2004, the FBI started querying these lists for both firearms and explosives transfers. This change was made to address concerns about persons of interest in counterterrorism investigations obtaining firearms improperly. Additionally, there is a discussion about prohibiting known or suspected terrorists on watch lists from possessing firearms and explosives. The NCIC \"hot file\" queried by NICS contains \"hot files\" on individuals of interest to U.S. law enforcement agencies, including those prohibited from possessing firearms or explosives. The terrorist watch list records are now downloaded into the Known and Appropriately Suspected Terrorist (KST) file. Information on NICS-generated terrorist watch list hits is shared with the FBI Counterterrorism Division and Joint Terrorism Task Forces for validation and to check for firearm possession prohibitions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that individuals on the terrorist watch list have obtained firearms and explosives despite screening measures. Legislative proposals have been made to grant the Attorney General authority to deny transfers based on watch list status, raising constitutional concerns. Senators Collins and Lieberman share concerns about known terrorists accessing weapons. Collins and Lieberman are concerned about known terrorists acquiring firearms legally despite being on the watch list. Legislation has been introduced to prevent dangerous terrorists from obtaining firearms and explosives. The bill (S. 34 / H.R. 1506) aims to prevent individuals involved in terrorism from obtaining firearms or explosives. Supporters believe it provides necessary redress, while opponents, like the NRA, argue it violates constitutional rights. The current chunk discusses government continuity planning to ensure recovery from operational interruptions. It includes preparedness capacities, agency response plans, employee training, and infrastructure repair. This is crucial for maintaining civil authority and supporting recovery efforts in emergencies. The current chunk discusses government continuity planning to ensure recovery from operational interruptions, including acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attacks. The authority for executive branch continuity programs is provided in a 2007 National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 51 on National Continuity Policy, which aims to maintain essential government activities under all conditions. Executive Order (E.O.) 12656, issued in 1988, assigns national security emergency preparedness responsibilities to federal executive agencies. E.O. 12656, issued in 1988, assigns national security emergency preparedness responsibilities to federal executive departments and agencies, requiring them to ensure continuity of essential functions in any national security emergency through succession planning, safekeeping of resources, and establishment of emergency capabilities. Congress could review current authorities to align with government organization and goals, assess costs, potential conflicts, and extent of compliance with different authorities. In FY2009, the government's real property comprised over 900,000 assets, including multi-tenant federal buildings housing federal courthouses and congressional offices. The security of federal facilities, managed by the Federal Protective Service, is crucial for the safety of federal employees and the public. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for protecting federally owned and leased buildings, property, and personnel. FPS undertakes security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures like vehicle barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, and emergency education programs. FPS also assists federal agencies like the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events. Agencies protected by FPS pay a fee established by the Office of Management and Budget. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) charges a fee set by the Office of Management and Budget to address security threats. FPS employs law enforcement officers, investigators, and contract security guards. Criticisms include the use of private security guards, management practices, and coordination of security. FPS plans to enhance threat identification, proactive monitoring, and security measures at protected facilities. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) aims to improve security measures at protected facilities by enhancing threat identification, proactive monitoring, and service provided by contract security guard forces. Congress will oversee FPS management and operations to ensure necessary staffing, resources, and funding. The U.S. Marshals Service has primary responsibility for the security of federal judges and court officials at court facilities in the U.S. and its territories. The U.S. Marshals Service is responsible for security at federal judicial districts and the District of Columbia Superior Court. They oversee security with court security officers and have seen an increase in threats against judges and protectees. Congress has passed legislation to enhance court security, such as the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. In 2005 and 2006, Congress enacted legislation for home intrusion detection systems for judges. In 2011, H.R. 1059 was introduced to provide permanent authority for redacting financial disclosure reports to protect personal information. This authority expires at the end of 2011. H.R. 1059 passed the House in September 2011. After a security incident in Las Vegas in 2010, the U.S. Marshals Service convened a National Security Review Committee to assess security procedures. The committee is reviewing court security procedures nationwide, with a report expected in September 2011. Congress allocated $10 million in 2010 for increased security in federal courts, particularly along the U.S. southwest border. Additional resources may be needed if more terrorism suspects are tried in federal courts. In the 112th Congress, there is a focus on providing additional security and resources for the federal judiciary to carry out its constitutional responsibilities. Interest has grown in preventing intentional contamination of food since the 2001 terrorist attacks, which can have serious economic effects and sicken hundreds of people. Coordination with law enforcement and intelligence agencies may be necessary in such trials. The 2001 anthrax attacks and unintentional foodborne disease outbreaks have shown that intentional food contamination, especially if it's an act of terrorism, can have serious economic consequences. The responsibility for food safety primarily lies with the FDA and USDA, with state and local authorities assisting in inspection and outbreak response. The complexity of the nation's food and agriculture sector, accounting for 15% of the economy, is noted by DHS. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) focuses on regulating food consumed in the United States, with FDA overseeing 80% of domestic food and $15 billion of imported food. The law aims to prevent intentional and unintentional food contamination through various provisions, including developing food safety standards and requiring comprehensive food safety plans from producers and processors. FDA also provides guidance to state and local authorities overseeing restaurants, grocery stores, and other food outlets. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) expands FDA's authority to inspect foods and food facilities, issue recalls, and protect against intentional contamination. It also requires the development of a National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy. Implementation of FSMA's regulatory authorities is ongoing, but some Members of Congress debate the need for increased FDA funding for activities like more frequent inspections. Additionally, pipelines across the U.S. transport natural gas, oil, and hazardous liquids to support the country's energy supply. Pipelines in the United States are crucial for transporting hazardous liquids and are connected to key infrastructure like power plants and airports. While generally safe, they have been targeted by terrorists and organized crime globally. Despite foiled plots post-9/11, the current federal threat assessment indicates a low terrorist threat to the U.S. pipeline industry. The federal threat assessment indicates low terrorist threat to the U.S. pipeline industry, with no specific or credible information on active plots. TSA leads pipeline security activities through voluntary industry compliance with security guidance and best practices since 2003. TSA's pipeline security activities include the Corporate Security Review (CSR) program and Critical Facility Inspection Program (CFI) for the largest pipeline systems in the U.S. By 2011, TSA aims to complete CFIs for all 125 pipeline operators, covering approximately 600 critical facilities. Congress has ongoing concerns despite TSA's efforts to strengthen U.S. pipeline security. Despite TSA's efforts to strengthen U.S. pipeline security, Congress has ongoing concerns about the adequacy of the agency's pipeline security standards, resources, and CSR program. Questions have been raised about the voluntary nature of federal pipeline security requirements and the lack of sufficient staff in TSA's pipeline division. The GAO recommended specific actions to improve TSA's pipeline security processes, but as of now, there has been no federal legislation directly addressing these concerns. The 112th Congress may address pipeline security issues and consider extending DHS authority to regulate security at chemical facilities. Stakeholders have criticized the content and pace of DHS regulation, recommending changes to the underlying statute. The 112th Congress may address pipeline security issues and consider extending DHS authority to regulate security at chemical facilities. Recommended changes include broadening the regulated community, enabling the federal government to require adoption of particular security measures, and increasing access to vulnerability information. Industry representatives support an extension of existing authority without changes, while environmental groups advocate for requirements for facilities to adopt safer technologies and disseminate security information. The regulated industry opposes granting DHS the ability to require implementation of inherently safer technologies or specific security measures. Challenges for policymakers include extending or changing statutory authority, balancing security information dissemination, and addressing costs of implementing security measures. The DHS regulatory program is still in early stages. The DHS regulatory program for chemical security measures is experiencing implementation delays, with no facility fully complying yet. Changes to the program may cause further delays, and early adjustments could be more effective than later ones. The nation's water supply infrastructure is vulnerable to various terrorist attacks, including physical disruption, bioterrorism, and cyber attacks. This includes thousands of wastewater and drinking water facilities, as well as miles of pipes and sewer lines. Congress and policymakers are considering initiatives to enhance the security of water infrastructure facilities, including wastewater utilities. There is a focus on whether to include wastewater and water utilities in chemical plant security regulations implemented by DHS. DHS has the responsibility to coordinate information to secure the nation's critical infrastructure, including the water sector. Presidential Directive 7 designates the EPA as the lead agency for protecting wastewater and drinking water utility systems. Congress has required vulnerability analyses for drinking water systems serving over 3,300 people, but similar requirements for wastewater treatment facilities have not been enacted. Legislation has been considered to establish security standards for chemical plants, which may include provisions for water utilities. The debate surrounds whether water utilities should be included in security standards for chemical plants, particularly regarding the use of hazardous substances like chlorine gas and the implementation of safer technology. There is also discussion on the roles of EPA and DHS in overseeing homeland security at water utilities, with concerns about creating a dual regulatory arrangement. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress, such as H.R. 901, H.R. 908, and S. 473, address the debate over regulatory responsibilities between EPA and DHS for water utilities. These bills maintain the exemption from DHS chemical facility standards and do not mandate inherently safer technology. S. 711 includes provisions for safer technology but does not change EPA's lead role in the water utility sector. Senate legislation, S. 711, includes provisions for safer technology in wastewater and drinking water facilities under DHS rules. The water utilities sector has been enhancing security measures since 2001. Cyberspace is vulnerable to various threats from state actors, criminal syndicates, terrorists, and others aiming to disrupt information flow. Cyber threats involve stealing, modifying, or disrupting information flow in cyberspace, leading to consequences like financial loss, economic competitiveness, and hindering federal agencies' missions. There are concerns about catastrophic failures in industrial processes, impacting life, property, and the environment. The Department of Homeland Security plays a key role in defending cyberspace, focusing on protecting non-national security information systems and critical infrastructures. The complexity of national risks and stakeholder relationships exceeds the capacity of a single agency. The Obama Administration's Cybersecurity Review guides current efforts to address complex stakeholder relationships in cybersecurity. Near term goals include improving defenses, information sharing, awareness programs, training skilled personnel, and agile security management. Mid-term activities focus on enhancing software security, analyzing vulnerabilities, and promoting international cooperation through treaties. Activities in securing cyberspace involve international treaties, cooperation in criminalizing cyber perpetrators, research for new network protocols, and restructuring incentives for security. The executive branch, Congress, federal agencies, and private sector partnerships work together to monitor and communicate about network security. Government and private firms have established cyber response teams and are funding R&D, awareness, and training programs for cybersecurity. Some key issues include the role of the National Security Agency, Department of Defense's involvement in cyber conflicts, and emergency powers for the President. Several bills have been proposed in Congress to address cybersecurity policy issues. Several bills have been proposed in Congress to address cybersecurity policy issues, including the establishment of a high-level office for coordinating cybersecurity policy, modification of the Federal Information Security Management Act, penalties for cybercrimes, national breach notification standards, research and development, workforce development, and emergency powers for the President. Only H.R. 2096 has been reported out of committee so far, but there is interest in pursuing comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in both the House and Senate. Senate Majority Leader Reid's office is drafting comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that would involve multiple committees. Senate Minority Leader McConnell's office is interested in participating in the effort. The House Republican leadership has formed a cybersecurity task force to present findings to Speaker Boehner by October 2011. Congress has given TSA responsibility for transit security oversight and created a transit security grant program under DHS. The DHS Inspector General's Office recommended that TSA provide more support to transit rail stakeholders in preparing for emergencies. Recommendations were made for improvements in TSA's evaluation of transit agency security practices. TSA is developing a new training program for inspectors. TSA is developing a new training program for its inspectors and an improved database tool. Regional workshops are being held by TSA in collaboration with the Federal Transit Administration to promote knowledge sharing and coordination among transit rail providers, emergency managers, and first responders. The OIG recommended more funding for these workshops, with TSA willing to provide additional support but FTA not seeking it. TSA agreed to enhance coordination efforts with state and federal partners for transit rail preparedness. Development of training programs by TSA to prepare frontline transit employees for responding to security threats, with a focus on law enforcement management. The OIG recommended more courses tailored to transit agency personnel and firefighters, specifically addressing improvised explosive devices (IEDs). TSA is organizing regional security exercises to train for prevention and response to acts of terrorism. The OIG found that TSA had offered limited intermodal security training exercises for transit rail stakeholders, focusing on classroom training. They recommended more exercises with live field drills involving transit rail agencies and firefighting agencies. TSA planned to increase the number of exercises in 2010, including law enforcement officers and first responders, with realistic field drills. The rising violence in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border has garnered attention from the government and media. The U.S. government and media are focused on the security issues at the border, including drug trafficking violence in Mexico. Estimates show over 34,500 drug trafficking-related deaths in Mexico between 2006 and 2010. Mexican drug trafficking organizations are in conflict with each other. Mexican drug trafficking organizations are engaged in violent conflicts with each other and with law enforcement along the U.S. border. The elevated risks and profits in the illegal drug market lead to violence as the primary means of settling disputes. Concerns have been raised that the violence in Mexico could spill over into the United States, particularly in cities like Ju\u00e1rez and Nuevo Laredo, which may affect neighboring U.S. cities like El Paso and Laredo. The Department of Homeland Security issued a safety alert warning that drug trafficking organizations and gangs may target U.S. law enforcement in the area. The 2010 National Drug Threat Assessment highlights Mexican DTOs as the greatest drug trafficking threat to the United States. They transport or produce drugs and smuggle them across the border for distribution and sale within the U.S. The illicit proceeds may be laundered, used to purchase weapons in the U.S., or smuggled back into Mexico. The U.S. sustains a multi-billion dollar illegal drug market, partially fueling the drug trade. The DTOs generate income from various illegal activities besides drug trafficking, such as smuggling humans and weapons, counterfeiting, piracy, kidnapping, and extortion. Concerns about spillover violence in the United States arise from these crimes, with differing opinions on its definition. The debate on spillover violence in the United States is centered around the definition and prevention of such violence. Experts suggest options like increasing border enforcement, aiding Mexico in disrupting organized crime, reducing drug demand, and legalizing certain drugs to address the issue. Illegal money flows pose challenges to law enforcement and have connections to homeland security policies. The sale of illegal drugs in the United States generates billions in annual proceeds for Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking organizations. Money from these illegal activities is moved south across the border into Mexico, fueling criminal activities. Funds are laundered through methods like bulk cash smuggling and the Black Market Peso Exchange. The National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) reports that Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are increasingly using new technologies like stored value cards and mobile banking systems to conceal and move their illicit proceeds. This allows traffickers to transfer profits quickly and discreetly, bypassing traditional methods like bulk cash smuggling. Additionally, profits from the sale of Colombian cocaine can now be sent directly from the United States to the source country without intermediaries. Criminals use stored value cards to avoid reporting cash over $10,000 at the border. Current regulations do not consider these cards as monetary instruments, exempting them from international transportation rules. Various agencies are responsible for combating drug-related activities and illicit proceeds along the Southwest border. Many agencies work together to combat drug-related activity and illicit proceeds along the Southwest border and throughout the United States, with a focus on money laundering and bulk cash smuggling. Efforts also target southbound firearms smuggling, which may involve individuals smuggling cash proceeds from drug sales. Illegal gun trafficking from the United States is seen as a significant factor in Mexico's drug-related violence, prompting increased enforcement of domestic gun control laws by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The ATF has increased enforcement of domestic gun control laws in Southwest border states through \"Project Gunrunner.\" Illegal guns flow from the US to Mexico, including semiautomatic rifles and pistols. \"Operation Fast and Furious\" in Phoenix, AZ, under scrutiny in 2011, revealed ATF whistleblowers' allegations to Congress. \"Operation Fast and Furious\" involved ATF allowing suspected straw purchasers to amass firearms and transfer them to gunrunners without proper surveillance or arrests. Firearms linked to the operation were found at crime scenes, including the shooting of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Questions also arose about a firearm used to murder U.S. ICE Special Agent Jamie Zapata in Mexico. The ATF Project Gunrunner investigation led to the trafficking of firearms used in deadly attacks in Mexico. Mexican traffickers use cross-border tunnels to smuggle contraband into the US, with over 150 tunnels discovered since the 1990s. The sophistication of these tunnels has increased over time. Sophisticated tunnels are used by Mexican traffickers to smuggle contraband into the US, with some tunnels tapping into existing infrastructure like storm drains. The most extensive tunnel found in Otay Mesa, CA in 2006 was 85 feet below the surface, stretched three-quarters of a mile, and had lighting, ventilation, and drainage systems. In November 2010, the San Diego Tunnel Task Force uncovered two tunnels between Tijuana, Mexico, and Otay Mesa, CA. U.S. law enforcement uses various tactics like sonic equipment and seismic technology to detect cross-border tunnels. Despite limitations in technology effectiveness, tunnels are mainly discovered through human intelligence and tips, highlighting the value of U.S. \u2013 Mexican law enforcement cooperation. U.S. officials value U.S. \u2013 Mexican law enforcement cooperation in detecting cross-border tunnels. The 112th Congress may consider improving bi-national partnerships to enhance investigations of transnational criminals. U.S. Customs and Border Protection employs a layered security approach to screen maritime cargo containers at seaports. The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act) directed the Department of Homeland Security to pilot an integrated system in foreign ports to scan 100% of containers destined for the United States. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 amended the SAFE Port Act to require screening of 100% of containers originating outside the U.S. before leaving a U.S. seaport facility. The SAFE Port Act of 2006 mandated scanning 100% of containers destined for the United States in foreign ports before departure. The law also requires 100% screening of containers loaded on vessels in foreign ports bound for the U.S. by July 2012, with concerns raised about the feasibility and effectiveness of this requirement. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) is a key program in the layered approach to maritime and cargo security, using advanced technology and partnerships to identify and screen high-risk containers in foreign ports before they are loaded on U.S.-bound ships. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) screens over 80% of maritime containers bound for the United States in 58 ports. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) scans 100% of containers at participating ports using radiation portal monitors and imaging systems. Data is provided to CBP officers for further examination. The Administration has requested reductions to both CSI and SFI in recent funding cycles. The Administration has requested reductions to CSI and SFI in recent funding cycles, including a 49% reduction from the FY2011 base funding level and a 58% reduction in overall funding for FY2012. CBP concluded that 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound maritime containers is possible on a limited scale in low volume ports, but difficult to achieve in many ports. The Administration proposes to remove CBP officers from most CSI ports and rely more on remote risk-based targeting at the NTC-C and reciprocal inspections agreements with foreign governments. Congress may need to assess the NTC-C's ability to handle increased workload resulting from changes to CSI and SFI. Congress may need to examine the impact of proposed changes to CSI on U.S.-bound container security, shifting focus from 100% scanning to remote screening for high-risk shipments. DHS strategy includes radiation portal monitors and imaging equipment, but experts criticize its effectiveness in detecting smuggled nuclear material. The DHS has faced challenges in developing next-generation detection equipment for nuclear material. The Government Accountability Office and other groups have questioned the efficacy of the efforts by the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) in this area. Congress may need to examine the impact of proposed changes to container security, focusing on remote screening for high-risk shipments. The DHS has faced challenges in developing next-generation radiation detection systems. Congress has restricted procurement until a significant increase in operational effectiveness is certified. DHS has not met the requirement to scan all containerized cargo for nuclear material, raising concerns about their approach. Shortages of key neutron detection material may lead to a reevaluation of current nuclear detection methods. The DHS is responsible for coordinating federal efforts in detecting smuggled radiological and nuclear materials at the U.S. border as part of the global nuclear detection architecture. The GAO has identified weaknesses in the strategic plan for this architecture, and oversight from the 112th Congress may continue regarding the development, testing, and procurement of nuclear detection equipment. The economic consequences of a maritime terrorist attack are also a concern due to the bulk of U.S. overseas trade being carried by ships. The economic consequences of a maritime terrorist attack could be significant, as a key challenge for U.S. policymakers is prioritizing maritime security activities among numerous potential attack scenarios. Port security issues before Congress include implementing a port worker security card, addressing threats from small craft, and establishing harbor interagency operational centers. On January 25, 2007, TSA and the Coast Guard implemented the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) at U.S. ports. Port workers must apply for a TWIC card for unescorted access to port facilities. The card uses biometric technology for identification, and TSA conducts security threat assessments. Workers pay a fee of about $133 for the card. Port facility operators will deploy card readers at gates. TSA is testing card reader technology at ports. A recent GAO audit found internal issues with the program. The GAO audit identified weaknesses in TWIC card enrollment and background checks at ports, undermining its effectiveness in screening out unqualified individuals. Concerns include terrorists using smaller vessels to smuggle weapons or conduct attacks, with challenges in tracking small boats and skepticism about the Coast Guard's ability to prevent an attack. Recreational boaters oppose tracking due to cost and privacy issues. The Coast Guard is establishing interagency operational centers in major U.S. ports to share maritime intelligence and coordinate responses, especially for boarding higher risk vessels. These centers will be co-located with existing Vessel Traffic Service stations. Congress is concerned about the pace of setting up these centers post-9/11 attacks. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress created the TSA to federalize airline security, focusing on screening passengers, baggage, and air cargo for explosives. Challenges remain in effectively screening for threats, utilizing watchlists and intelligence, protecting against missile attacks, and regulating airport security measures. Effective regulation and oversight of airport security measures and access control technologies have improved since the 9/11 attacks. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated 100% screening of checked baggage on domestic and international flights, while the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act required physical screening of all cargo on passenger flights. TSA has met the cargo screening requirement domestically through its Certified Cargo Screening Program. The TSA has improved airport security measures since 9/11, but more work is needed for U.S.-bound international flights. Recent focus has been on improving explosives screening of passengers due to threats, such as the attempted attack by Umar Farouk Abdulamutallab in 2009. Al-Qaeda has shown interest in attacking U.S.-bound airliners, as seen in previous incidents like the 2006 trans-Atlantic flight plot and the Richard Reid shoe bombing. The Obama administration accelerated deployment of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) screening devices in response to the Northwest Airlines flight 253 incident and the 9/11 commission recommendation to improve explosives detection on passengers. Next generation screening technologies for airport checkpoints include x-ray systems for carry-on baggage, bottled liquids scanners, and portable explosives trace detection equipment. Privacy concerns have been raised regarding the intrusiveness of AIT. Privacy concerns have been raised regarding the intrusiveness of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), especially for primary screening, children, the elderly, and individuals with medical conditions. Recent modifications to pat-down procedures have also raised privacy issues. TSA addresses these concerns by requiring remote screening of images, forbidding recording or storage of AIT images, and implementing automated threat detection to eliminate the need for screeners to view images. Other concerns include screening time and potential medical risks from backscatter x-ray systems. Some suggest a risk-based use of AIT in coordination with other programs. The failed bombing attempt of Northwest Airlines flight 253 on December 25, 2009, raised policy questions regarding the effective use of terrorist watchlists and intelligence information to identify individuals that may pose a threat to aviation. Specific failings to add the suspect to either the no-fly or selectee list prompted reviews of the intelligence analysis and terrorist watchlisting processes. On May 3, 2010, Faisal Shazad, a suspect in the attempted bombing in New York Times Square, was allowed to board a flight to Dubai despite being on the no-fly list. He was removed from the plane and arrested after the airline checked the passenger manifest with CBP's National Targeting Center. This incident led to TSA changing security directives to require airlines to check the no-fly list within two hours of urgent updates. The event also accelerated the transfer of watchlist checks from airlines to TSA under the Secure Flight program, which was completed by November 2010. DHS announced that all passengers flying to or from U.S. airports are vetted using the Secure Flight system, which checks passenger name records against the Terrorist Screening Database. Criticisms include not checking each passenger against all available government data on terrorist threats. Key issues for Congress include updating watchlists, utilizing all available terrorist information, and improving threat detection for airline passengers and workers. The TSA is focusing on detecting potential threats among airline passengers and workers, improving identity fraud detection, and establishing a trusted traveler program for expedited screening. Coordination with international partners and providing redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats are also key concerns. The planned trusted traveler program aims to enhance existing CBP programs and address previous shortcomings of the Registered Traveler program. The planned trusted traveler program aims to enhance existing CBP programs and airline frequent flyer programs. Questions remain about its effectiveness in directing security resources and expediting screening. TSA is also investing in a behavior detection program to identify potential threats based on observed behaviors, including passenger interviews similar to those used in Israeli airports. Privacy concerns have been raised about potential profiling despite efforts to prevent it. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles to civilian aircraft remains a major concern for aviation security specialists. Efforts to reduce MANPADS stockpiles have made progress, but some weapons may still be in the hands of insurgents. The threat of shoulder-fired missiles to civilian aircraft remains a major concern for aviation security specialists, especially in conflict zones and high-risk areas. The Counter-MANPADS program by the DHS aimed to protect airliners against heat-seeking missiles, but the systems have not been deployed due to high costs and limitations in protecting against all potential threats. Proponents argue that aircraft protection systems are effective against heat-seeking MANPADS, but airlines are reluctant to invest due to costs. Policy discussions focus on funding limited units for Civil Reserve Aviation Fleet. Other options like ground-based missile countermeasures and escort planes with antimissile tech face operational challenges. Improving airport security and reducing vulnerability to MANPADS attacks pose challenges due to limited resources and large geographic areas. Major airports partner with law enforcement agencies, but vulnerabilities remain. TSA handles passenger and baggage screening, while airports are responsible for physical security and access control measures. The adequacy of airport access control measures and physical security has been scrutinized following security breaches in 2010, such as the incident at Newark Liberty Airport. Policy response focused on increasing penalties for violators breaching security measures. In 2010, security breaches at airports raised concerns about access control measures and physical security. Incidents included a man crashing a stolen truck through a gate at Dallas Love Field and a woman being shot at Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. These events highlighted the need for better regulatory oversight of airport security measures. In 2010, concern over firearms at airports sparked debate following consideration of state legislation in Georgia to allow firearms in public transit facilities, including airport terminals. The smuggling of firearms at Orlando International Airport in 2007 raised concerns over the lack of screening for airport workers. TSA's current approach includes background checks and random screenings for workers. TSA conducts various screening tests for airport workers, including random and targeted screenings, but design limitations and poor documentation hindered conclusive results. Identity authentication for airport workers, airline workers, and law enforcement officers is challenging. TSA is testing crew identification systems but has no plans for universal access credentials. The TSA does not plan to implement universal access credentials for airline and airport workers, leaving it to individual airports to issue credentials and develop TSA-approved access control systems. General aviation operators face issues with redundant background checks and credentialing processes at multiple airports. TSA has implemented guidance for transient operators to gain escorted access to their aircraft and airport facilities, but multiple credentials are often required for regular use. Immigration policy includes border control, visa security, legal immigration, documentation, verification, and interior enforcement. The report summarizes immigration issues related to border security and passenger screening at ports of entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP's Office of Field Operations (OFO) conducts immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections at ports of entry to identify and intercept high-risk individuals or goods while facilitating access for low-risk travelers and commerce. CBP conducts immigration inspections at ports of entry to identify high-risk individuals while facilitating access for low-risk travelers and commerce. Travelers must present a passport or equivalent document, along with a visa or proof of eligibility for admission. Foreign nationals undergo security checks before receiving a visa or travel authorization. CBP officers verify the authenticity of documents and confirm travelers' identities at ports of entry. The US-VISIT system confirms travelers' identities through biometric checks, matching fingerprints with visa application information. CBP faces pressure to process individuals quickly at ports of entry, but rapid growth in travel and trade has outpaced infrastructure investment, leading to congestion and missed threat interdiction opportunities. One perennial issue for Congress is how to allocate resources for port of entry infrastructure, including maintenance, improvement, and construction. CBP has implemented trusted traveler programs requiring background checks, interviews, and biometric data submission. Ineligibility factors include criminal history, false information, warrants, violations, or inadmissibility. Trusted travel enrollees undergo regular security checks and additional screening when entering the US or renewing their membership. CBP operates four trusted traveler programs: Global Entry for expedited airport screening, NEXUS for US-Canada crossings, SENTRI for US-Mexico border crossings, and FAST for commercial trade. The Trade Program (FAST) allows expedited screening for U.S., Mexican, and Canadian commercial truck drivers at 55 land ports on the northern and southern borders. Legislation since 1996 requires an automated entry-exit system to track departures and identify nonimmigrants who overstay their visas. DHS has collected biometric data since 2004. Since 2004, DHS has collected biometric data, including digital photographs and fingerprints, from travelers entering the U.S. through the US-VISIT system. The system has expanded to various ports of entry and upgraded its data collection to ten prints for increased accuracy in identification. The US-VISIT program collects biometric data from non-U.S. citizens entering the United States, except for certain exemptions. The entry-exit system aims to track travelers leaving the U.S. to identify visa overstays and gather intelligence data, but implementing the exit component has been challenging. The ADIS database uses biographic information from I-94 forms to match entry and exit data, but cannot confirm departing travelers' identities. Collection of biometric data from exiting travelers would confirm their identity, but has proven difficult. US-VISIT tested pilot programs to collect biometric data from departing air passengers, but the pilots provided limited information. The US-VISIT system tested a pilot program in 2009-2010 to collect biometric data from departing temporary workers at land ports in Arizona. However, the system has not developed an integrated approach for a Comprehensive Exit solution. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes to cancel funding for biometric air exit programming and focus on entry-exit matching of biographic data. Delays in implementing the exit-tracking system have been a concern for Congress. The Border Patrol enforces U.S. immigration and federal laws along the border, preventing unlawful entries of terrorists, aliens, and contraband. They patrol 7,494 miles of borders and coastal waters. After 9/11, a new strategy focused on intercepting terrorists was implemented in 2004. The Border Patrol's National Strategy aims to achieve \"operational control\" over the border by deterring illegal entries, apprehending smugglers, and leveraging technology. The Secure Border Initiative (SBI) was introduced in 2005 to secure U.S. borders and reduce illegal migration. The Secure Border Initiative (SBI) aims to achieve operational control of the northern and southern borders within five years by focusing on increased staffing, improved detention and removal capacity, surveillance technology, tactical infrastructure, and interior enforcement. The concentration of resources on the southwest border is designed to make it harder to cross between ports of entry and to raise the costs of apprehension for unauthorized immigrants. Congress may reconsider resource allocation for border enforcement strategy, as effectiveness is hard to measure based on apprehensions. Apprehensions fell in FY2010, but this may be due to economic factors. Data does not capture aliens who successfully enter the US undetected, raising concerns among some members of Congress about potential adverse consequences of border enforcement. Some members of Congress are concerned about the adverse consequences of border enforcement, including humanitarian impacts, environmental harm, effects on border communities, and U.S. foreign relations. Others advocate for increased investment in border enforcement as a precursor to immigration reform. Questions may arise about the priority given to the southwest and northern borders, with security experts warning about vulnerabilities on the northern border in terms of terrorism and homeland security threats. The integrity of CBP agents and security at U.S. ports of entry is a concern for Congress due to attempts by criminals to infiltrate CBP and enroll officers on their payrolls. DHS has increased internal investigation efforts to counteract these threats. Congress has taken steps to improve the integrity of CBP officers by providing retirement benefits to deter corruption. Additionally, FEMA provides disaster assistance funded by the Disaster Relief Fund, which Congress appropriates annually to ensure funding for recovery projects and emergencies. In recent years, there have been shortfalls in the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), leading to additional budget authority provided through emergency supplemental appropriations. Congress has provided extra funding for the DRF nine times from FY2005 to FY2010, raising concerns about reliance on emergency appropriations. Policymakers see emergency appropriations as a backup for unexpected situations, as they are not subject to spending caps. While some emergency funds were for major incidents like Hurricane Katrina, there is debate over the increasing use of these appropriations. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has faced shortfalls, leading to reliance on emergency supplemental appropriations. The enacted amount for the DRF does not reflect the true cost of disasters, with an average monthly expenditure of $350 million compared to an average annual appropriation of $2 billion. Emergency funds are not subject to spending caps, raising concerns about budget deficits and discretionary spending. Congress may consider reforms to reduce federal expenditures. Congress may consider passing reforms to reduce federal expenditures for disaster assistance, including using offsets, changing criteria for federal assistance eligibility, and lowering the federal to state cost-share percentage. State and local governments, responsible for public safety functions, may reduce contributions due to budget constraints, impacting national preparedness levels. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal within 180 days, in coordination with various levels of government. This goal must address specific threats and vulnerabilities, define core capabilities, and prioritize objectives to mitigate risks. This directive supersedes a previous homeland security directive issued after 9/11. The HSPD-8 directive issued after 9/11 established a national preparedness goal to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist attacks and disasters. Additional grant programs were created to enhance state and local preparedness, including the SHSGP and CCP. In FY2012, federal funding was requested for various grant programs including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, Stonegarden, Transit Grants, Port Security, BZPP, and EMPG. State and local governments receive federal assistance for preparedness activities, but this funding only makes up a small percentage of their overall spending on public safety. Total state and local government expenditures for public safety amount to $218 billion annually, with federal grants for homeland security preparedness totaling $4.1 billion in FY2010, $3.3 billion in FY2011, and a requested $3.8 billion in FY2012. These grants make up less than two percent of public safety costs, highlighting the critical role of state and local governments in national preparedness efforts. Congress established federal firefighter assistance grant programs within DHS to provide support for local fire departments during fiscal challenges. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) was created in 2000 to offer grants for firefighting equipment and training, with expanded scope and funding after the 9/11 attacks. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the AFG program saw increased scope and funding. The SAFER program was established in 2003 by the 108th Congress to provide grants for firefighter staffing. The 112th Congress debates funding levels for AFG and SAFER within appropriations and reauthorization processes, considering economic downturn and concerns over federal discretionary spending. Another issue involves SAFER waivers since FY2009. The appropriations issue involves SAFER waivers, with Congress including language in bills since FY2009 to waive restrictions on SAFER grants. Concerns about the financial burden on grant recipients have led to discussions on the appropriate funding responsibility between states/localities and the federal government. Reauthorization legislation for AFG and SAFER was passed by the House in the 111th Congress but not by the Senate, while the most recent authorizations for AFG and SAFER expired in 2009 and 2010 respectively. In the 112th Congress, identical versions of House and Senate bills from the previous session have been introduced for the SAFER program. Debate over AFG reauthorization centers on funding competition between different types of fire departments. Congress may consider altering SAFER rules to make participation more economically feasible. Emergency Communications involve delivering critical information before, during, and after disasters, evaluated on three tracks: emergency alert system, 911 services, and first responder communications. The technologies supporting emergency communications are converging towards a common platform using Internet Protocol, integrating response and recovery across various functions of emergency management. IP-enabled networks will be crucial in managing communication-based systems to prevent loss of life and property, such as next-generation 911 systems and smart grid management by utilities. The current emergency alert system is being redeveloped to utilize next-generation information technologies. The redeveloped emergency alert system will use sensors for daily traffic monitoring and integrate new communication technologies for public safety. The transition to 4G wireless technologies is key, supported by the 112th Congress for nationwide wireless broadband network development. Proposed legislation focuses on protecting public safety and meeting first responders' needs. The bills in both chambers are in agreement on the need for federal governance to coordinate planning and deployment of a nationwide network for first responders. Capital investment and start-up costs are projected to be substantial, with access to suitable spectrum being essential. Differences exist in the allocation of spectrum, form of federal governance, and funding sources. Efforts are ongoing to find a compromise. The all-hazards approach to emergency management has evolved since the formation of FEMA, with a focus on intergovernmental relationships. President Bush signed directives after 9/11 to improve emergency management. President Obama updated HSPD-8 to PPD-8, focusing on national preparedness and key capabilities. PPD-8 calls for a national preparedness goal and system. The PPD-8 calls for a national preparedness system with frameworks for prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. Currently, only the National Response Framework is in use, with the National Disaster Recovery Framework still in draft form. Congressional concerns may arise regarding the potential duplication and fragmentation of emergency management activities within the system of frameworks. The nation's public health emergency management laws have expanded significantly in the past decade, influenced by events like the 2001 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. Recent incidents like the H1N1 influenza pandemic and the Japan earthquake have highlighted gaps in readiness, including limited technology for threat assessment and inadequate medical countermeasures. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA, P.L. 109-417) and other laws have enhanced public health and medical preparedness in response to mass casualty incidents. Funding and distribution of countermeasures may be limited, and the federal government's influence on preparedness efforts is constrained by the private sector and state/local governments. The 112th Congress is reauthorizing laws related to public health and emergency preparedness, focusing on improving federal programs for countermeasures. Funding for incident response is a challenge, with limited appropriations to the Public Health Emergency Fund. Assistance under the Stafford Act helps with public health activities, but there is no federal program specifically for uninsured or uncompensated healthcare costs. The Stafford Act authorizes special assistance for emergency-related healthcare costs after disasters, but there is debate on whether this should be a federal responsibility. Congress has provided aid to address healthcare costs in mass casualty incidents, with emergency declarations triggering aid to protect public health and safety. After disasters, a major disaster declaration allows federal agencies to provide assistance to help state and local governments, families, individuals, and nonprofit organizations recover. Individual Assistance (IA) includes housing, unemployment assistance, counseling, and other programs. The Individuals and Households Program (IHP) offers direct financial aid to disaster victims, with FEMA distributing over $7 billion in IHP payments since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA has distributed over $7 billion in IHP payments. In 2010, the DHS Office of Inspector General found 160,000 potentially improper IHP payments totaling $643 million. Improper payments include payments to ineligible individuals, duplicates, and payments for expenses covered by insurance or other agencies. Some payments were based on incorrect information provided by applicants, such as listing vacant lots or cemeteries as damaged properties. FEMA has distributed over $7 billion in IHP payments since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2010, the DHS Office of Inspector General found 160,000 potentially improper IHP payments totaling $643 million. The largest portion of improper payments was made under disaster declarations for hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with $621.6 million in IHP payments. FEMA began recouping improper IHP payments in March 2011, working back to payments made for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Congress may wish to consider how recoupments are carried out and how Section 312 of the Stafford Act is executed in the current recoupment process. The Homeland Security Appropriations bill funds the management functions of the Department of Homeland Security, which have grown over the years. In FY2003, $195 million was allocated for management accounts, increasing to $839 million in FY2011. This growth is attributed to various factors, including criticisms of the Department's oversight capabilities. The management accounts of the Department of Homeland Security were funded at $839 million in FY2011, with growth attributed to factors like staff increases, rising costs, technology investments, and real estate expenses. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for FY2012 at $674 million and $692 million respectively, with concerns raised about the House funding levels. The funding for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management in the bill could lead to a reduction-in-force. Despite warnings, House amendments decreased the funding by $332 million from the committee's recommendation. DHS has faced financial challenges since its inception, with difficulties in transferring budgets between agencies. Inherited financial management issues at major components like the Coast Guard, FEMA, and ICE added complexity. The department's attempts to develop an in-house financial management system failed, leading to a second unsuccessful attempt through outside developers. The Department of Homeland Security attempted to implement a department-wide system through contracting with outside developers under the Transformation and Systems Consolidation initiative, but the project was shelved after GAO ruled that the initial $450 million contract was improperly awarded. Progress has been made in reducing material weaknesses in the department's financial controls, with the number of material weaknesses decreasing from 18 to 6 as of May 2011. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, a legacy of its rapid consolidation from 22 federal agencies. Fragmentation of headquarters leads to inefficiencies and increased costs. The Department of Homeland Security approved a $3.4 billion master plan to create a new headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, funded by DHS and GSA. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard facility, is nearing completion with funding from Congress. The Administration requested $215 million for headquarters consolidation through the DHS budget and $217 million through GSA. The House and Senate had differing funding approaches for the DHS headquarters project at St Elizabeths in Anacostia. The Senate allocated $56 million for the Coast Guard facility and required DHS to provide an expenditure plan within 60 days. Legislative action in the 112th Congress will determine the future of the project amid budget constraints. The President and Secretary of Homeland Security implemented departmental reorganizations from 2003 to 2007. Congress limited funds for reorganizations in 2007. The Department of Homeland Security faced limitations on reorganization funds from FY2007 to FY2010, with provisions continuing into FY2011. The scope of these limitations was questioned in a 2008 Government Accountability Office opinion. The Department of Homeland Security has authority to organize and manage its department, including redelegation authority and authority under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 301. The decision to carry over limitations in appropriations acts arises annually, with potential amendments to Section 872 being considered during reauthorization. Congressional decisions on the impact of Section 872 and appropriation limitations on department management may influence future changes. Human resources management is crucial for DHS mission and performance. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer plays a critical role in supporting the department's Workforce Strategy. The CHCO position has transitioned from a political appointment to a career appointment. Congress may oversee HRM issues such as workforce planning, leadership development, and human resources technology. DHS aims to recruit a diverse workforce and retain an engaged workforce. The four-day summit in May 2011 focused on strategic workforce planning for the Department of Homeland Security, including identifying key occupations, workforce planning indicators, and measuring employee competencies. A prototype is being developed to report on emerging trends and characteristics of the DHS workforce, with indicators such as staffing needs, hiring goals, attrition rates, and employee survey results. A competency model library is also being developed for the DHS Workforce Planning Council. The DHS Workforce Planning Council is developing a SharePoint site and focusing on building a diverse cadre of leaders. Plans include developing executive resource requirements, establishing mentoring and rotation programs, creating a succession plan for Senior Executive Service positions, and delivering comprehensive leadership and workforce training programs for all personnel. The DHS is focusing on building a diverse cadre of leaders and addressing gaps in employee competencies critical to their mission. Legislation was introduced in Congress to create an Office of the Chief Learning Officer for DHS, which may be reconsidered in the future. A long-term strategic plan for HRIT is being redefined and implemented. The DHS is redefining and implementing a long-term strategic plan for HRIT, focusing on enterprise solutions for human resources. Efficiencies in HR service delivery and oversight by Congress are key goals, with suggestions for regular review of the OCHCO. The DHS is working on a long-term strategic plan for HRIT, aiming for efficiency in HR service delivery. Congress could request an easily understood crosswalk table to show how workforce planning aligns with national security strategy. Initiatives like fostering a unified DHS culture and improving collaboration are ongoing. Congress may review collaboration mechanisms annually as part of DHS budget considerations. The Department of Homeland Security ranked seventh in procurement spending in FY2010, with significant growth from FY2002 to FY2010. DHS spent $1.1 billion in FY2002 and $13.6 billion in FY2010. Approximately 22 executive branch organizations were consolidated to form DHS, leading to a legacy structure in procurement operations. Eight DHS components have their own contracting activities. The Department of Homeland Security has two contracting activities: Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and U.S. Secret Service. Concerns have been raised about the shared responsibility structure between the chief procurement officer and other components, creating ambiguity in acquisition decisions. The federal acquisition workforce, including DHS, faces challenges in size, skills, and experience according to the Services Acquisition Reform Act Panel and Government Accountability Office. DHS lacks adequate staff for effective contract planning and execution. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges in its acquisition workforce, with concerns raised about ambiguity in acquisition decisions. DHS needs to engage in long-term strategic workforce planning and address its acquisition workforce needs. The department's FY2012 budget request included $24.2 million for an acquisition workforce initiative, but funding was declined by the House Committee on Appropriations. DHS announced a review to achieve a proper balance between federal and contractor employees for agency functions. The Department of Homeland Security is implementing the balanced workforce initiative to ensure that inherently governmental functions are performed by federal employees. They have developed a tool called the balanced workforce strategy tool to aid in this process. This initiative aims to reduce reliance on contractors and improve service quality. The 112th Congress may have questions regarding this initiative. The 112th Congress may have questions about the Department of Homeland Security's acquisition function, workforce initiative, and balanced workforce initiative. Key questions include concerns about dual accountability, consequences of funding issues, impact on acquisition tasks, discovery of contractor employees performing governmental functions, and the agency's efforts to achieve a balanced workforce. The U.S. government consolidated and expanded terrorist watch lists under HSPD-6 post-9/11 to better screen individuals at entry points. Misidentifications have been a recurring issue for Congress, initially with TSA and now also with CBP. TSA implemented the Secure Flight program in December 2010. The TSA fully implemented its Secure Flight program in December 2010 to reduce terrorist watch list misidentifications. The Department of Homeland Security established a \"Watchlist Service\" to mirror the FBI's database, moving towards a consolidated terrorist watch list. This arrangement further diffuses responsibility for watch list records, previously split between different agencies under HSPD-6. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) are responsible for identifying and maintaining information on international and domestic terrorists. The NCTC manages the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) for international terrorists, while the FBI and TSC handle the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) for both international and domestic watch list records. The TSC tailors watch list records for frontline screening agencies. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) tailors watch list records from the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) for frontline screening agencies. The TSDB contains information on 422,674 individuals known or suspected of being terrorists, with over 1.7 million records due to aliases and name variants. The TSC provides operational support for encounters with terrorists and shares watch list records with various government agencies and foreign governments. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) manages the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) with over 1.7 million records due to aliases and name variants. The TSC Director is responsible for policies on including terrorist identities in the TSDB and addressing misidentifications, erroneous entries, and privacy concerns. However, the TSC does not collect intelligence and is limited in addressing certain issues due to restrictions on divulging classified information. The DHS, TSA, and CBP face limitations in handling terrorist watch list records based on classified intelligence. Despite this, Congress mandated appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats in the TSDB. DHS was also required to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for those wrongly identified as threats and seeking redress for travel delays. The DHS established the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) to address watch list misidentification issues and unfair delays in security screening. However, concerns remain about the ability of TSC and DHS to provide timely redress for individuals wrongly identified as terrorists. In 2010, a secure system was established for transmitting terrorist watch list records from the FBI/TSC to DHS/TSA. The DHS established the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) to address watch list misidentification issues and unfair delays in security screening. In 2010, a secure system was established for transmitting terrorist watch list records from the FBI/TSC to DHS/TSA. The TSDB contents are now available to DHS in near real-time through the \"Watchlist Service (WLS).\" Privacy concerns were raised regarding the exemption of WLS from the Privacy Act of 1974, prompting calls for a transparent redress process. Stakeholders emphasize the importance of research and development (R&D) in creating technologies to defend against homeland security threats, with differing visions between the Administration and Congress on R&D performance. The Administration and Congress have differing visions on DHS R&D investments. Congress denied DHS's request to consolidate R&D activities in FY2011 and is considering the FY2012 request. Stakeholders expect more effectiveness and efficiency from DHS. The 112th Congress may focus on the appropriate rewards of homeland security R&D investments, balanced portfolio distribution, and funding levels during fiscal constraints. DHS R&D activities aim to meet the needs of component agencies and external customers. Stakeholders debate optimal approaches to maximizing DHS R&D effectiveness, with some advocating for increased research investments for technology breakthroughs, others suggesting a focus on technology development, and some calling for a shift towards long-term research activities. Some propose a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy. Some stakeholders suggest a high-risk, high-reward investment strategy similar to DARPA for advancing terrorist capabilities. The DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology faces challenges in coordinating federal homeland security R&D activities and lacks a strategy. Congress may oversee new strategic approaches by DHS to address coordination barriers and meet the needs of DHS components and first responders. The DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology is facing challenges in coordinating federal homeland security R&D activities. Congress has not approved the transfer of research and development activities within the DHS, which may impact the productivity of R&D activities criticized for having little to show for federal investment. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill for FY2012 would reduce appropriations for R&D in the S&T Directorate by 42% compared to FY2011. The House-passed DHS appropriations bill for FY2012 would reduce appropriations for R&D in the S&T Directorate by 42% compared to FY2011, indicating dissatisfaction with the slow rate of return on investments."
