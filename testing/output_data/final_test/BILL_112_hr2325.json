    "content": "The Act titled \"Delaware River Basin Conservation Act of 2011\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that the Delaware River Basin is a national treasure of great cultural, environmental, and ecological importance, spanning over 12,500 square miles across four states. The Basin is home to over 8,000,000 people who rely on it for economic, recreational, and wildlife habitat purposes. Additionally, it provides clean drinking water to more than 15,000,000 people, including New York City and Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Water Department conducted a study showing that forest clearing in the Upper Basin poses a significant threat to the city's drinking water supply. The Basin is home to almost 180 special status species, including sturgeon, eastern oyster, and red knots. It provides habitat for over 200 fish species, supports recreational fisheries, and is a key source of eastern oyster, blue crab, and American horseshoe crab populations. Oyster landings in the Delaware Bay have decreased to 100,000 bushels. The Delaware Bay oyster landings have decreased to 100,000 bushels due to water pollution and disease. The Basin has a large concentration of shorebirds and significant wetland acreage, providing essential ecosystem services. The remaining natural landscape in the Basin is at risk of further degradation due to ongoing development. The Delaware River gains 14 square miles of developed land annually, leading to increased polluted runoff. It is the longest undammed river east of the Mississippi and critical for flood mitigation and wildlife habitat. Governors of multiple states have called for natural flood damage reduction measures. The Delaware River Port Complex, spanning Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, is the world's largest freshwater port. The Port of Philadelphia handles the most international tonnage and 70% of East Coast oil shipments. The Port of Wilmington is the busiest terminal on the Delaware River, managing over 400 vessels annually with a cargo tonnage exceeding 4,000,000 tons. The Delaware Estuary, a significant estuary in the National Estuary Program, sees the mixing of freshwater from the Delaware River with saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean. The Partnership for the Delaware Estuary aims to enhance environmental health. The Delaware River Basin Commission oversees water management projects in the Delaware Estuary to improve environmental health. Restoration activities are supported by Federal and State agencies, with funding continuing for important programs and the establishment of the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program to coordinate funding mechanisms at various levels.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms related to the Delaware River Basin, including the Basin, Basin State, Director, Foundation, and grant program. Delaware River Basin restoration grant program established under section 5. The term \"program\" refers to the Delaware River Basin restoration program under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director. The term \"Service\" refers to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Delaware River Basin restoration grant program is established under section 5, with the program referring to the Delaware River Basin restoration program under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director, and the term \"Service\" refers to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Secretary will establish the \"Delaware River Basin restoration program\" within 180 days of funding availability. The program will involve collaboration with various management entities to identify, prioritize, and implement restoration and protection activities in the Basin. An investment strategy will be adopted to support shared restoration and protection activities. The Secretary will establish a grant program for cost-effective conservation projects and measurable conservation efforts. Coordination with federal agencies will be done, including the Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, Natural Resource Conservation Service, and the Chief of Engineers of the United States. Technical assistance will also be provided in accordance with the Act. The program aims to coordinate restoration and protection activities in the Delaware River Basin among various federal, state, and local entities, as well as conservation partners. It involves the participation of key stakeholders such as the Governors of the Basin States, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, the Delaware River Basin Commission, fish and wildlife joint venture partnerships, and other relevant public agencies and organizations. The program aims to sustain and enhance habitat restoration, water quality improvements, water management, flood damage mitigation, public access, recreation, land use planning, and public outreach in the Delaware River Basin. The program aims to sustain and enhance habitat restoration, water quality improvements, water management, flood damage mitigation, public access, recreation, land use planning, and public outreach in the Delaware River Basin by providing competitive grants for technical assistance to carry out restoration and protection activities with priority given to activities with multiple benefits. SEC. 5. GRANTS AND ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will establish the Delaware River Basin restoration grant program to provide competitive grants for various entities to carry out activities focused on fish and wildlife habitat restoration, water quality improvement, and pollution reduction. The Delaware River Basin restoration grant program will fund projects focused on reducing pollutants, managing water volume, including priority needs, and restoration activities with multiple benefits. The Federal share of project costs will not exceed 75%, and the non-Federal share can be provided in cash or in-kind contributions. The Secretary may partner with organizations like the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to manage the grant program, providing advance funding for each fiscal year to support partnerships between the public and private sectors. The Secretary may provide technical assistance on a nonreimbursable basis to various entities to carry out the grant program established under the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act, detailing funded projects. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will use existing funds to carry out the Act, allocating at least 75 percent for grants and technical assistance."
