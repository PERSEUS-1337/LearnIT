    "content": "Political and economic developments in Cuba and U.S. policy towards the island nation have been significant congressional concerns for many years. Congress has actively shaped U.S. policy towards Cuba through legislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, which tightened economic sanctions but also provided roadmaps for normalization of relations. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 partially modified sanctions, allowing for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. In 2009, Congress eased restrictions on family travel and marketing of agricultural exports to Cuba. The Obama Administration further lifted restrictions on family travel, remittances, educational and religious travel in 2011. President Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba in 2014, moving towards engagement and normalization of relations. This led to the restoration of diplomatic relations and the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state. The easing of restrictions on travel and commerce with Cuba led to mixed reactions in Congress. In the 114th Congress, some bills aimed to further ease sanctions while others sought to block the policy shift. President Trump's new policy in 2017 partially rolled back efforts to normalize relations and imposed new sanctions, including restrictions on educational travel and transactions with Cuban military-controlled companies. In the 115th Congress, there were mixed reactions to easing sanctions on Cuba, with some wanting to tighten sanctions and others wanting to ease them. The only legislative action taken was a provision in the 2018 farm bill that allowed funding for U.S. agricultural exports promotion programs in Cuba, marking the first slight easing of sanctions in almost a decade. The report examines U.S. policy toward Cuba in the 116th Congress, focusing on Cuba's political and economic environment, U.S. policy toward Cuba, and selected issues in U.S.-Cuban relations. In the 116th Congress, legislative initiatives regarding radio and television broadcasting to Cuba, migration issues, antidrug cooperation, property claims, and U.S. fugitives from justice in Cuba are noted. The report also includes links to U.S. government information and reports on Cuba. Relevant legislative measures and bills are highlighted, with a focus on U.S. policy towards Cuba. Additionally, historical background on Cuba's independence in 1902 is provided. Cuba gained independence in 1902 after being a Spanish colony until the Spanish-American War in 1898. The United States ruled Cuba for four years before granting independence, retaining the right to intervene to preserve stability. The Platt Amendment, part of the Cuban Constitution of 1901, allowed the US to establish a naval station at Guantanamo Bay in 1903. Cuba's political system post-independence was marked by authoritarian figures, including Gerardo Machado and Fulgencio Batista. Batista's rule turned into a brutal dictatorship after a bloodless coup in 1952. Fidel Castro rose to power after leading a revolutionary movement in Cuba, overthrowing the Batista dictatorship in 1959. He ruled for 47 years until stepping down in 2006 due to poor health, handing power to his brother Ra\u00fal Castro. Despite promising democratic rule, Fidel Castro instead consolidated his power and repressed dissent. Fidel Castro consolidated his rule, repressed dissent, and aligned with the Soviet Union, leading to deteriorating relations with the United States. He declared the Cuban revolution socialist, proclaimed himself a Marxist-Leninist, and ruled by decree until becoming president in 1976 under a new constitution establishing the Cuban Communist Party as the leading force in society. After Fidel Castro stepped down in 2006 due to poor health, his brother Ra\u00fal took over as provisional president. Ra\u00fal was later chosen as president by Cuba's National Assembly and served two terms until 2018. Fidel continued to influence Cuban politics through essays criticizing Ra\u00fal's rule. Ra\u00fal's government focused on gradual economic reforms and faced resistance from hard-liners in the party and government bureaucracy. The Cuban government implemented market-oriented economic policy changes and improved bilateral relations with the Obama Administration. President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel Berm\u00fadez succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro in 2018. D\u00edaz-Canel was selected as president of Cuba's Council of State, making him the head of state and government. He is seen as the \"heir apparent\" and represents a move towards generational change in Cuba's political system. He became the official constitutional successor in 2013 and is an engineer by training. In 2003, D\u00edaz-Canel held top positions in the PCC in two provinces and served as the higher education minister from 2009 to 2012. Cuba's 2018 political transition marks the first time a Castro is not leading the government since the 1959 revolution. Ra\u00fal Castro's departure signifies a generational leadership change, with D\u00edaz-Canel expected to take over as first secretary of the PCC. The composition of the 31-member Council of State includes Salvador Vald\u00e9s Mesa as first vice president. Salvador Vald\u00e9s Mesa, 72, was selected as first vice president by the National Assembly, making him the first Afro-Cuban in such a high government position. The Council of State has 45% new members, 48% women, and 45% Afro-Cuban or mixed race. Despite some older leaders remaining, the average age of members is 54, with 77% born after the 1959 revolution. President D\u00edaz-Canel faces challenges in reforming the economy and meeting citizens' demands for more freedom. Ra\u00fal Castro had initiated economic reforms, opening up Cuba to the world. President D\u00edaz-Canel faces challenges in reforming the economy and meeting citizens' demands for more freedom. The liberalization of some individual freedoms under Ra\u00fal Castro has increased Cubans' appetite for access to information and more social and political expression. Observers did not anticipate immediate major policy changes under D\u00edaz-Canel, but in December 2018, he made decisions demonstrating independence from the previous government. D\u00edaz-Canel demonstrated independence from the previous government by easing forthcoming harsh regulations on the private sector and backing away from full implementation of controversial Decree 349. The government also eliminated a proposed constitutional change for same-sex marriage after public criticisms. The Cuban government faced public criticism for eliminating a proposed constitutional change for same-sex marriage. Ra\u00fal Castro will lead the PCC until 2021 and has influenced government policy. President D\u00edaz-Canel appointed new ministers in 2019, replacing some holdovers from the previous government. In February 2019, almost 87% of Cubans voted on constitutional changes. In February 2019, almost 87% of Cubans approved a new constitution in a national referendum, with changes made after public suggestions and debates. One controversial change was the elimination of a provision redefining matrimony as gender neutral, opposed by evangelical churches and Cuban Catholic bishops. The Cuban Catholic bishops issued a pastoral message against a provision in the new constitution redefining matrimony as gender neutral. The commission decided to remove the provision entirely, leaving the constitution silent on the issue. Other provisions include the appointment of a prime minister, age and term limits for the president, the right to own private property, and recognition of foreign investment. The state still maintains control over the economy and centralized planning, with the Communist Party remaining the only political party. The Cuban government has a poor record on human rights, sharply restricting freedoms since the early years of the revolution. Organizations like Ladies in White and Patriotic Union of Cuba work for civil liberties. In 2018, the government imprisoned UNPACU leader Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ferrer arbitrarily for 11 days. In recent years, Cuba has made some advances in human rights, including lifting bans on Cubans staying in hotels previously restricted to foreign tourists and eliminating the requirement for exit permits and letters of invitation for travel abroad. Despite these changes, the human rights situation in Cuba remains poor. The Cuban government has made changes to travel restrictions, allowing dissidents to travel abroad. Internet connectivity has also improved. Short-term detentions for political reasons decreased in 2017 and 2018. The US called attention to Cuba's political prisoners in 2018. In January 2019, the Cuban Commission for Human Rights estimated that Cuba held 130-140 political prisoners, including 96 opponents of the regime and 24 accused of violence. The government refused access to prisons for international organizations and monitored domestic human rights groups closely. The report highlighted the lack of governmental transparency in Cuba, citing systematic violations of due process rights. Dr. Eduardo Cardet, a political activist and prisoner of conscience, has been imprisoned since November 2016 for criticizing Fidel Castro. Amnesty International called for his immediate release, stating he was jailed for peacefully expressing his views. In 2018, two political prisoners were released after hunger strikes, including Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola. Short-term detentions for political reasons in Cuba increased significantly from 2010 through 2016, with the number growing annually from at least 2,074 in 2010 to at least 9,940 in 2016. However, since 2017, there has been a significant decline in short-term detentions. Dr. Ariel Ruiz Urquiola and UNPACU activist Tom\u00e1s N\u00fa\u00f1ez Magdariaga were among those who faced imprisonment for political reasons. In 2017, short-term detentions in Cuba dropped to 5,155, almost half of 2016's numbers and the lowest since 2011. The decline continued in 2018 with 2,873 detentions, a 45% decrease from 2017 and the lowest since 2010. Cuban bloggers like Yoani S\u00e1nchez and independent media outlets have gained international attention for criticizing the Cuban government. Founded in 2010 by human rights activist Antonio Rodiles, the group aims to promote open debate on cultural, social, and political issues. Despite hosting various events and activities, they have faced government harassment. Other notable online forums and independent media outlets in Cuba include Cuba Posible, Periodismo del Barrio, El Toque, OnCuba, and Tremenda Nota. Cuba was placed on the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, marking the fourth consecutive year on the list. Cuba was placed on the Tier 2 Watch List in the 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report, indicating that the government has made significant efforts but still does not fully comply with minimum standards. Tier 3 status is for countries not fully compliant and not making significant efforts. Cuba received a waiver in 2017 to remain on the Tier 2 Watch List for three consecutive years. In the 2018 TIP report, Cuba received a waiver to stay on the Tier 2 Watch List for the fourth year. The State Department acknowledged Cuba's efforts in prosecuting traffickers and assisting child victims, but noted a lack of increasing efforts compared to previous years. The government was criticized for not criminalizing most forms of forced labor or sex trafficking. The State Department criticized Cuba for not criminalizing most forms of forced labor or sex trafficking for children ages 16 or 17, and not providing specialized services to identified victims. Recommendations were made for Cuba to enact a comprehensive antitrafficking law. U.S. and Cuban officials have increased engagement on antitrafficking issues, including signing a memorandum of understanding on law enforcement cooperation in January 2017. Cuba and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding on law enforcement cooperation to combat transnational crimes, including trafficking in persons. Cuba's economy is mainly state-controlled, with key sectors like tourism, nickel mining, and biotechnology contributing to foreign exchange. Cuba's economy relies on key sectors like tourism, nickel mining, and biotechnology. Remittances from the US are a significant source of hard currency. The sugar industry has declined due to various factors, with the 2017-2018 harvest dropping by almost 44%. Cuba has depended on Venezuela for oil for almost 20 years. Cuba's reliance on Venezuela for oil has decreased since 2015, leading them to seek oil from other suppliers like Algeria and Russia. The setback in becoming a net oil exporter in 2012, combined with Venezuela's economic troubles, has raised concerns about the security of support from Venezuela. Cuba now receives about one-third of its oil consumption from Venezuela, down from two-thirds in the past. Ra\u00fal Castro implemented economic policy changes, but more extensive reforms were desired. At the PCC's seventh party congress in April 2016, he emphasized Cuba's gradual economic updates. Some economists urge for greater reforms, criticizing the government's central planning and trade monopoly. The economy grew 1.8% in 2017 and an estimated 1.2% in 2018. President D\u00edaz-Canel plans to continue austerity measures in 2019 due to reduced support from Venezuela and the end of Cuba's medical program in December 2018. The Cuban economy is facing challenges due to the end of the medical program in Brazil and reduced aid from Venezuela. The private sector is growing, with more self-employed individuals, but analysts suggest the government should do more to support its development. The Cuban government restricted private-sector development by halting new licenses for various occupations and implementing regulations to limit business licenses and categories of work. These actions were aimed at curbing illicit activities and improving the functioning of the private sector. The Cuban government restricted private-sector development by reducing the number of permissible work categories and limiting the size of private restaurants. The new regulations aimed to increase taxation oversight and control wealth concentration, but were seen as stifling private-sector growth. President D\u00edaz-Canel later announced changes to ease restrictions, including allowing individuals to engage in multiple licensed activities and removing limits on restaurant seating. The Cuban government reduced the amount of money in bank accounts for tax payments and limited certain employment categories. President D\u00edaz-Canel's willingness to make policy changes shows a commitment to public opinion and support for the private sector. The new foreign investment law in 2014 aimed to attract more foreign capital by cutting taxes on profits, exempting companies from taxes for the first eight years, and streamlining approval processes for small projects. In 2014, Cuba established the Mariel Special Development Zone (ZED Mariel) to attract foreign investment. ZED Mariel has approved 43 investment projects, including Rimco and the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center joint venture for cancer therapies. Cuba's ZED Mariel has attracted over $5.5 billion in investment since 2014, with $1.5 billion in 2018. The Cuban government has updated its wish list for foreign investment, totaling $11.6 billion in various sectors. During the Cold War, Cuba received substantial subsidies from the Soviet Union to sustain its economy and support foreign policies. After the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuba had to abandon its revolutionary activities abroad due to the loss of financial support. This led to Cuba opening up its economy and diversifying its trading partners, with Venezuela becoming a key partner for oil imports. In 2017, Venezuela, China, and Spain were the main sources of Cuba's imports, while Canada, Venezuela, Spain, and China were the top destinations for Cuban exports. Relations with Russia also diminished significantly during this time. Relations with Russia have strengthened somewhat over the past several years. In 2014, Russia agreed to write off 90% of Cuba's $32 billion Soviet-era debt. Trade relations between Russia and Cuba have grown, with Russian exports to Cuba reaching almost $373 million in 2018. Russian energy companies are involved in oil exploration in Cuba, and Rosneft began shipping oil to Cuba in 2017. Russia welcomed the improvement in U.S.-Cuban relations under the Obama Administration. In 2014, Russia forgave 90% of Cuba's $32 billion debt. Trade between the two countries has increased, with Russian exports to Cuba reaching $373 million in 2018. Russian energy companies are involved in oil exploration in Cuba, and Rosneft started shipping oil to Cuba in 2017. The Obama Administration's improvement in U.S.-Cuban relations was welcomed by Russia. Under the Trump Administration, as U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated, Russia sought to strengthen ties with Cuba through high-level meetings and increased economic, military, and cultural engagement. This included a bilateral cooperation agreement to help modernize Cuba's defense sector until 2020. A deepening of relations with Russia could benefit Cuba economically, particularly in the oil sector, and serve as a counterbalance to the Trump Administration's rollback of engagement policies. President D\u00edaz-Canel's trip to Russia in November 2018 did not yield significant results, with Cuba receiving a $50 million credit line for military purchases and contracts for power plant modernization. Concern in Congress about Russia's role in Latin America led to a report on security cooperation between Russia and Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Among the areas of cooperation noted was a plan to construct a. The Russian-Cuban announcement in 2017 of a plan to construct a GLONASS satellite navigation station in Cuba, along with a 2013 Russia-Cuba agreement permitting Russian military vessels to refuel and resupply in Cuban ports, has led to the Russian Navy using Cuban ports for maintenance, repairs, and refueling. China and Cuba have strengthened bilateral relations over the past 15 years, resulting in increased trade and high-level visits between the two countries. President Xi Jinping called for a long-term plan to promote the development of China-Cuba ties during a visit by President D\u00edaz-Canel in November 2018. President Xi Jinping called for a long-term plan to promote the development of China-Cuba ties, welcoming Cuba's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. Both countries are urged to enhance cooperation on trade, energy, agriculture, tourism, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Economic linkages and cooperation are the most significant components of bilateral relations, with total Cuba-China trade in 2017 valued at almost $2 billion. This marked a decrease from 2016, with Cuba exporting $364 million to China and importing almost $1.7 billion. China's imports from Cuba have decreased by almost 30% compared to 2016, reflecting Cuba's economic challenges due to reduced Venezuelan support. The Cuban government has responded by cutting imports and conserving resources. Despite previous reluctance, China has started investing in Cuba, with projects in telecommunications, manufacturing, and infrastructure. Planned Chinese investments include pharmaceuticals, tourism, and infrastructure development. The European Union and Cuba reached a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement in 2016, covering political, trade, and development issues. The agreement was endorsed by the European Parliament in July 2017, emphasizing the importance of human rights dialogue. The agreement will enter into force after ratification by all EU member states, replacing the EU's 1996 Common Position on Cuba. The EU and Cuba reached a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement in 2016, emphasizing human rights dialogue. The agreement includes provisions on democracy, human rights, and good governance. In October 2018, the first human rights dialogue was held, addressing various rights issues. Cuba has received support from Venezuela for over 15 years, with oil subsidies and Cuban personnel sent to Venezuela. Estimates suggest around 40,000 Cuban professionals, mainly healthcare workers, were in Venezuela. Cuban personnel also included teachers, sports instructors, military advisers, and intelligence operatives. The number of Cuban military and intelligence advisers in Venezuela varied. Some Cuban medical personnel claimed their services were used to influence votes for the Maduro regime. The impact of declining Venezuelan oil exports to Cuba and Venezuela's economic crisis on the level of Cuban personnel in Venezuela is uncertain. Since Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013, Cuba has been worried about Venezuelan financial support due to Venezuela's economic crisis under President Maduro. Oil exports to Cuba have dropped, leading to austerity measures and slow economic growth. Cuba's relations with Brazil have soured, with missed payments on loans for the Mariel port development project. Cuba's deployment of doctors to Brazil for the Mais M\u00e9dicos program has also faced challenges. Cuba's medical assistance program in Brazil faced challenges under President Bolsonaro, who criticized the program and demanded changes. Cuba responded by bringing back its medical personnel, ending the program. Cuba has a history of sending medical personnel overseas and actively participates in international forums like the United Nations. They have received support from organizations like the United Nations Development Programme and hosted the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean's 37th session in May 2018. Cuba actively participates in international forums like the United Nations and has a history of sending medical personnel overseas. The U.N. General Assembly has annually criticized the U.S. embargo on Cuba since 1991. In 2018, the UNGA approved the resolution by a vote of 189-2, with the U.S. and Israel opposing it. Cuba is a founding member of the World Trade Organization but not of the IMF, World Bank, or Inter-American Development Bank. They are a member of CELAC, established in December 2011. The CELAC, established in December 2011 to boost regional cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean, excludes the United States and Canada. Cuba, previously excluded from the OAS due to its Marxist-Leninist ideology, saw the OAS overturn this policy in 2009. Despite welcoming the decision, Cuba stated it would not rejoin the OAS. Tensions between the U.S. and Cuba escalated in the 1960s as Castro established a communist regime and aligned with the Soviet Union. The U.S.-Cuban relationship has been marked by tense events such as covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, and the shootdown of U.S. civilian planes. Beginning in the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba was largely hostile. In the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards Cuba included imposing economic sanctions, such as a trade embargo and financial restrictions. President Kennedy declared the embargo in February 1962 under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, later expanding it with the Trading with the Enemy Act in March 1962. The Treasury Department replaced Cuban Import Regulations with Cuban Assets Control Regulations in July 1963. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) replaced Cuban Import Regulations in July 1963 under the authority of TWEA and the FAA. The CACR prohibit most financial and trade transactions with Cuba, administered by OFAC, and require licensing for exports to Cuba under the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, and Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 strengthened sanctions on Cuba. The CDA prohibits U.S. foreign subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts entry of vessels involved in Cuban trade. The LIBERTAD Act increases pressure on Cuba and provides for assistance during a transition to democracy, codifying the Cuban embargo as permanent. The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, and Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 strengthened sanctions on Cuba, including codifying the Cuban embargo as permanent law. The law prevents the executive branch from lifting the embargo without congressional approval until certain democratic conditions are met. Title III of the law holds accountable those who traffic in confiscated Cuban property, allowing for monetary damages in U.S. federal court. The Trump Administration recently allowed limited lawsuits under Title III. The Trump Administration recently allowed limited lawsuits under Title III of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which holds accountable those who traffic in confiscated Cuban property. This act also includes prohibitions on U.S. assistance, private financing, and tourist travel to Cuba. Additionally, Congress has enacted various provisions over the years imposing sanctions on Cuba for alleged ties to international terrorism. The Obama Administration rescinded Cuba's designation in 2015 for alleged ties to international terrorism. U.S. policy includes support measures for the Cuban people such as humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and radio and television broadcasting. The enactment of TSRA by the 106th Congress made the U.S. one of Cuba's largest commercial suppliers of agricultural products. Authorization for purposeful travel and cash remittances to Cuba has been debated in Congress. Despite strained relations, there have been instances of bilateral cooperation in areas of shared national interest. Bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Cuba has occurred in areas like alien migrant interdiction, counternarcotics, and oil spill prevention. In 2014, the Obama Administration shifted towards engagement and normalization of relations with Cuba, ending decades of failed sanctions. This policy change included the rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The policy change towards Cuba in 2015 included the rescission of its state sponsor of terrorism designation, restoration of diplomatic relations, and easing of restrictions on travel and trade. This led to bilateral agreements in various areas such as marine protection and the environment. The United States and Cuba signed bilateral agreements in various areas including marine protected areas, environmental cooperation, direct mail service, civil aviation, agriculture, health cooperation, counternarcotics cooperation, federal air marshals, cancer research, seismology, meteorology, wildlife conservation, animal and plant health, oil spill preparedness and response, law enforcement cooperation, and search and rescue. They also signed a treaty delimiting their maritime boundary in the eastern Gulf of Mexico in January 2017. President Obama visited Cuba in March 2016 to build on progress towards normalizing relations and support human rights. He emphasized the importance of democracy and citizens' rights during his visit, stating that the Cuban people should be free to decide their own future. In October 2016, President Obama issued a directive on the normalization of relations. In October 2016, President Obama issued a directive on the normalization of relations with Cuba, outlining six medium-term objectives including government interaction, expanded commerce, and respect for human rights. In January 2017, the Obama Administration ended the wet foot/dry foot policy for Cuban migrants entering the United States. Under the 2017 policy change, Cuban nationals attempting to enter the US illegally are now subject to removal. President Trump rolled back some of Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, imposing new sanctions and calling for the Cuban government to address human rights issues. President Trump's new policy towards Cuba aims to end the abuse of dissidents, release political prisoners, and stop jailing innocent people. The policy keeps many Obama-era changes in place, including diplomatic relations and eased sanctions for travel and commerce. The wet foot/dry foot policy for Cuban migrants has also been ended. President Trump's NSPM includes restrictions on financial transactions with Cuban military-controlled companies and eliminates people-to-people educational travel. The Cuban government criticized the policy changes but expressed willingness to continue dialogue on mutual interests. The State Department was tasked with identifying entities for restrictions on transactions with the Cuban military. The State Department identified entities controlled by the Cuban military, including Grupo de Administraci\u00f3n Empresarial S.A. (GAESA), involved in various sectors of the Cuban economy. A list of \"restricted entities\" was issued in November 2017 and updated in November 2018 and March 2019, totaling 210 entities, including ministries, holding companies, subentities, hotels, and tourist agencies. The Treasury Department prohibits financial transactions with certain Cuban entities, including hotels, tourist agencies, marinas, stores, and defense sectors. Exceptions include transactions related to travel, trade, agricultural and medical commodities, telecommunications for the Cuban people, and authorized remittances. These new restrictions limit U.S. economic engagement with Cuba, especially in travel and potential investments. People-to-people educational travel must now be organized by specialized organizations. The Obama Administration had authorized individual travel to Cuba in March 2016, leading to an increase in Americans visiting the country. However, new Treasury Department regulations have caused a decline in U.S. travel to Cuba. In January 2018, the State Department established a Cuba Internet Task Force to explore expanding internet access and independent media in Cuba. In February 2018, two subcommittees were formed to develop recommendations on media, freedom of information, and internet access in Cuba. The U.S. and Cuban governments have continued engagement on bilateral issues through meetings and dialogues, including semiannual migration talks and Bilateral Commission meetings. During the Bilateral Commission meetings in 2017 and 2018, the US and Cuba discussed various areas for engagement, including trafficking, aviation safety, law enforcement, agriculture, maritime safety, and environmental challenges. The US emphasized the need to address attacks on diplomats, arbitrary detention of journalists and human rights defenders, and repatriation of Cubans with removal orders. Cuba acknowledged progress in repatriation but was urged to accept more returnees. The meeting between the US and Cuba criticized aspects of US policy, including the intensification of the embargo and alleged health cases used as a pretext to reduce embassy staff. Both countries engaged in professional exchanges on topics like search and rescue, law enforcement dialogues on fugitives and repatriation of Cuban nationals with removal orders in 2017 and 2018. Additional bilateral meetings and exchanges were held in 2018. In 2018, bilateral meetings were held on various topics such as cybersecurity, counternarcotics, counterterrorism, anti-money laundering, trafficking in persons, search and rescue, and agriculture. From November 2016 to May 2018, 26 U.S. Embassy community members in Havana suffered unexplained injuries, leading to the departure of nonemergency personnel in September 2017. The U.S. investigation has not determined the causes or sources of these injuries. In September 2017, the U.S. Embassy reduced staff by two-thirds due to safety concerns. In October 2017, 15 diplomats from the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC were ordered to depart. Cuba denies responsibility for injuries to U.S. diplomats. The staff reduction has impacted embassy operations and bilateral engagement. National Security Adviser John Bolton criticized Cuba's human rights record in a November 2018 address. In a speech, John Bolton criticized Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua as a \"troika of tyranny\" and referred to their leaders as \"three stooges of socialism.\" He blamed the Cuban dictatorship for enabling repression in Venezuela. The Trump Administration has increased criticism of Cuba for supporting the Maduro regime amidst deteriorating political situation in Venezuela. In March 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo criticized Cuba for supporting the Maduro regime in Venezuela, accusing Cuban military and intelligence services of providing physical protection and training Venezuela's secret police in repressive tactics. The Trump Administration escalated sanctions on Cuba by allowing lawsuits against those trafficking in confiscated property under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act. Secretary Pompeo suspended the right to file lawsuits under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act for an additional 30 days, allowing lawsuits against entities on the \"Cuba Restricted List\" controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services. Lawsuits can be brought by any U.S. national, including those who were not U.S. nationals at the time of the confiscation, but not against third-country foreign investors in Cuba. Some U.S. nationals can file lawsuits under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act against entities on the \"Cuba Restricted List\" controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security services. Different schools of thought exist on U.S. policy towards Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, while others support constructive engagement and normalization of relations. In 2006, Fidel Castro stepped down as head of government, leading to calls for a reevaluation of U.S. policy towards Cuba. Two main approaches were proposed: maintaining isolation while supporting the Cuban people, or engaging with the Cuban government and society. The Obama Administration shifted towards engagement and normalization of relations, causing divisions in Congress. Some members supported the change as beneficial for the U.S., while others criticized the lack of concessions from Cuba. Some Members criticized the President for not obtaining concessions from Cuba to advance human rights, while others introduced legislation to normalize relations by lifting the embargo. Divisions in Congress over Cuba policy were highlighted by the Trump Administration's rollback of Obama-era changes and new sanctions on Cuba. Public opinion polls show majority support for normalizing relations with Cuba, but the Cuban American community in South Florida has shown increased support for normalization. In 2018, a poll by Florida International University showed a shift in Cuban American support for the U.S. embargo on Cuba, with 51% in favor of continuing it and 49% opposed. Advocates for easing sanctions argue that increased travel, trade, and dialogue could lead to peaceful reform in Cuba and prevent a mass exodus to the U.S. Supporters of changing policy towards Cuba argue for a more pragmatic approach to bring about change, citing international support for lifting the U.S. embargo and missed business opportunities. They emphasize the suffering of the Cuban people due to the embargo and advocate for consistency in policies towards communist governments. Opponents of lifting U.S. sanctions maintain that isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best way to achieve political change. Supporters of changing policy towards Cuba argue that the LIBERTAD Act outlines steps for Cuba to normalize relations with the U.S., emphasizing the need for concrete reforms. They believe that softening U.S. policy without Cuban reforms strengthens the communist regime. Critics of loosening sanctions argue that Cuba's economic policies, not the U.S. embargo, are to blame for difficult living conditions. Those in favor of stronger sanctions point to Cuba's support for the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious part of U.S. efforts to isolate the country. The U.S. embargo regulations on travel to Cuba have been contentious for over 50 years, with restrictions on financial transactions related to Cuba. Changes to the restrictions have occurred over time, with increased enforcement under the George W. Bush Administration. In 2009, Congress eased restrictions on family travel and travel related to U.S. agricultural and medical sales. The Obama Administration further lifted all restrictions on family travel in 2009 and eased travel related to religious and journalistic purposes in 2011. The Obama Administration eased travel restrictions to Cuba in 2011, allowing for religious, journalistic, and educational activities. In 2014, there was a further shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, including an easing of travel restrictions. The Treasury Department amended the regulations in 2015 to include general licenses for permissible travel categories, eliminating the need for specific licenses. Travel agents and airlines can now provide services for travel to Cuba without specific licenses, and authorized travelers no longer have per diem limits on expenditures. Travelers no longer have per diem limits for expenses and can bring back goods from Cuba for personal use. Recent changes in travel regulations now allow for professional media or artistic productions in Cuba, as well as authorization for professional meetings, performances, clinics, workshops, competitions, and exhibitions. Individual people-to-people educational travel to Cuba was permitted in March 2016, but authorization for this was eliminated by President Trump in June 2017. Travel to Cuba for tourist activities remains prohibited, with regulations requiring people-to-people educational travel to be organized by specialized organizations. Regular air and cruise ship services between the United States and Cuba have expanded, but travel for tourist activities is still not allowed under Section 910(b) of TSRA. The number of U.S. travelers to Cuba increased significantly from 91,254 in 2014 to 619,523 in 2017, with additional visits from Cuban Americans and Cubans living outside the country. However, the number of U.S. visitors began to decline in late 2017 due to Hurricane Irma, tighter travel restrictions by the Trump Administration, and health concerns for U.S. diplomatic personnel in Cuba. In the first half of 2018, U.S. visitors to Cuba declined by 24%, but by the end of the year, there was a 1% growth. The recovery was driven by a 48% increase in cruise ship arrivals. The change in the U.S. travel advisory for Cuba from Level 3 to Level 2 also contributed to the recovery, allowing schools to include Cuba in their exchange programs. Commercial medical and agricultural exports to Cuba have been authorized since the early 1990s. Commercial medical and agricultural exports to Cuba have been authorized since the early 1990s, with restrictions and licensing requirements. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, but denies access to U.S. financing or credit. The 2018 farm bill permits funding for U.S. agricultural export promotion programs. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, but denies access to U.S. financing or credit. The 2018 farm bill permits funding for U.S. agricultural export promotion programs, including the Market Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Cooperation Program for U.S. agricultural products in Cuba. Regulatory changes in 2015-2016 facilitate commercial exports to Cuba, allowing U.S. financial institutions to open correspondent accounts at Cuban financial institutions and permitting private export financing for authorized trade, except for agricultural goods exported under TSRA. Payment for U.S. exports to Cuba can now occur before the export shipment is offloaded in Cuba. Shipment leaves a U.S. port for authorized exports to Cuba, including goods for private residential construction, agricultural equipment for small farmers, and items for civil aviation, telecommunications, and environmental protection. Licenses for certain exports are approved under specific categories, while others are considered on a case-by-case basis for state-owned enterprises and organizations. In November 2017, the Commerce Department amended the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to restrict export licenses for items to state-owned enterprises in Cuba associated with the military, police, intelligence, or security services. However, exports of consumer communication devices, software, applications, hardware, and services are authorized, as well as items for telecommunications and internet access. Authorized goods and services for export to Cuba include internet services, infrastructure upgrades, and consumer goods for personal use. U.S. companies can have a physical presence in Cuba, and certain contingent contracts are allowed. Cuba purchased $6 billion in U.S. products from 2001 to 2018, mainly agricultural products, with exports peaking at $712 million in 2008 due to increased food needs after natural disasters. U.S. exports to Cuba have fluctuated over the years, with a significant increase in 2016 and 2017. In 2018, exports amounted to nearly $276 million, primarily consisting of poultry, soybean products, corn, and aircraft parts. The USITC reports on the effects of U.S. restrictions on trade with Cuba, highlighting issues such as the inability to offer credit, travel, or invest in Cuba. Cuban nontariff measures and government control of trade may also limit U.S. exports and investment if restrictions are lifted. The USITC report highlights factors limiting U.S. exports to Cuba, including government control of trade and investment decisions. If U.S. restrictions were lifted and Cuban barriers lowered, exports could reach $2.2 billion annually. Two bills in the 116th Congress aim to address export restrictions to Cuba. Two bills in the 116th Congress aim to address restrictions on exports to Cuba. S. 428 (Klobuchar) would repeal certain provisions in the CDA, the LIBERTAD Act, and TSRA as well as regulatory provisions in the CACR and EAR that restrict trade with Cuba. H.R. 1898 (Crawford) would modify the prohibition on U.S. assistance and financing for certain exports to Cuba under TSRA. The United States has provided assistance to increase the flow of information on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba since 1996, with funding totaling $364 million from FY1996 to FY2019. The Trump Administration did not request democracy and human rights assistance funding for Cuba in FY2018, but Congress provided $20 million. In FY2019, the Administration requested $10 million, but Congress again provided $20 million. The State Department has been allocated more funding than USAID in recent years for Cuba assistance, with a portion transferred to NED. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy, civil society development, and human rights in Cuba. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) receives funding from the U.S. government to support democracy and civil society in Cuba. From FY2014 to FY2017, NED received $15.9 million for its Cuba program. In FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $10 million for democracy assistance in Cuba, while Congress allocated $30 million for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba. In FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $10 million for democracy assistance in Cuba, while Congress allocated $30 million for promoting democracy and civil society in Cuba. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ultimately provided $20 million for Cuba democracy funding. For FY2020, the Trump Administration has requested $6 million for Cuba. The Trump Administration has requested $6 million for Cuba democracy funding in FY2020, a 70% cut from previous years. U.S.-government-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to Cuba began in the 1980s and 1990s. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) became the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) in August 2018. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) manages Radio and TV Mart\u00ed from Miami, FL. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) in Miami manages Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, reaching 11.1% of Cubans weekly with audio, video, and digital content. Radio Mart\u00ed and TV Mart\u00ed have the largest audiences, while online content reaches a smaller audience. OCB also administers a shortwave transmitting station in Greenville, NC, with newer transmitters helping increase Radio Mart\u00ed's presence in Cuba. The government funds broadcasting to Cuba, with recent funding around $27-$29 million annually. In FY2019, $29.1 million was provided for Cuba broadcasting, despite a proposed cut by the Trump Administration. In October 2018, concerns were raised about a TV Mart\u00ed program that made anti-Semitic remarks about George Soros, prompting Senator Jeff Flake to call for an investigation into the program's production and approval process. Senator Jeff Flake called for an investigation into a TV Mart\u00ed program that contained anti-Semitic content about George Soros. OCB Director Tom\u00e1s Regalado removed the program from the website, acknowledging a lack of balance. USAGM's CEO Lansing placed those responsible on administrative leave pending an investigation into misconduct and ordered a full content audit to identify unethical reporting patterns. The full content audit identified unethical reporting patterns at the network, leading to a letter of apology from Lansing to Soros for anti-Semitic and biased journalism. Offensive stories were removed from the website, and a 'standards and practices' editor was hired to ensure adherence to professional journalism standards. In September 2018, offensive content was removed from the website. By February 2019, one employee and three contractors were terminated due to an anti-Semitic video segment. An independent audit of OCB's Spanish coverage was commissioned, with a final report expected in three months. TV Mart\u00ed program raised concerns about broadcast standards and audience targeting. The Voice of America must adhere to U.S. broadcasting standards, ensuring objectivity, accuracy, and balance in its programs. These standards include serving as a reliable news source, representing a variety of American views, and presenting U.S. policies clearly and responsibly. These principles are outlined in U.S. law and international broadcasting standards. The State Department reported that 26 U.S. diplomatic community members in Havana suffered unexplained health injuries from November 2016 to May 2018. Symptoms included hearing loss, cognitive issues, dizziness, and fatigue. The cause of these \"attacks\" remains unknown. In response to alleged health incidents in Havana, the U.S. Department of State reduced staffing at the U.S. Embassy, operating it as an \"unaccompanied post\" without family members. The embassy continues to function with minimal personnel for core diplomatic functions. The staff reduction at the U.S. Embassy in Havana has led to the suspension of most visa processing. Cubans must now apply for nonimmigrant visas at a U.S. embassy in another country, while immigrant visa applications are handled in Georgetown, Guyana. In addition, 15 Cuban diplomats were ordered to leave the Cuban Embassy in Washington, DC due to concerns over the protection of U.S. diplomats in Havana. The U.S. is seeking assurances from Cuba regarding these incidents. The United States is seeking assurances from the Cuban government regarding the \"attacks\" on diplomatic personnel before considering the return of personnel. The State Department issued travel warnings for Cuba due to the risk of injury, with the advisory level fluctuating from Level 3 to Level 2. In May 2018, a U.S. government employee in China experienced a similar health incident, leading to the establishment of a Health Incidents Response Task Force by Secretary of State Pompeo. The establishment of a multiagency Health Incidents Response Task Force by Secretary of State Pompeo to coordinate activities related to identifying and treating affected personnel and family members abroad, investigating and mitigating risks, messaging, and diplomatic outreach. 14 Canadian diplomats and their family members in Havana have experienced health symptoms since 2017, leading to changes in the designation of the Canadian embassy and a reduction in diplomatic staff. The cause of the health incidents remains unknown. Scientists and experts doubt that the incidents involving health symptoms in diplomats were caused by a sonic device, citing unlikely physics laws for ultrasound to harm personnel. Other possible scenarios include exposure to toxins or psychogenic factors triggering symptoms. Data on ultrasound weapons' effects on human health is limited. In February 2018, a study in JAMA reported brain injuries in U.S. Embassy individuals in Havana without a history of head trauma. The cause of the injuries was inconclusive, with caution against drawing conclusions due to evaluations conducted 203 days after symptoms onset. In August 2018, letters in JAMA raised questions about the study, including the possibility of mass psychogenic illness. In March 2018, a report by University of Michigan scientists suggested that the sounds recorded in Cuba may have been caused by eavesdropping devices. In December 2018, doctors from the University of Miami and the University of Pittsburgh proposed that diplomats' symptoms were due to ear damage, not brain injury. In January 2019, biologists from the University of California Berkeley and the University of Lincoln studied recordings of alleged sounds heard by U.S. Embassy employees. The study analyzed sounds heard by U.S. Embassy employees in Cuba, suggesting they matched a Caribbean cricket's call. Speculation on the cause of health injuries includes rogue Cuban security factions or third countries like Russia. Cuba denies responsibility for the injuries. The Cuban government denies responsibility for the injuries of U.S. personnel, stating it would never allow its territory to be used against diplomats. Cuba protested the U.S. action, emphasizing ongoing investigations have reached no conclusion on the incidents. Cuba permitted U.S. investigators to visit and expressed willingness to cooperate. Cuban scientists visited the U.S. in 2018 for meetings on the issue. Dr. Mitchell Joseph Vald\u00e9s-Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center stated that Cuban scientists have not found evidence of a high-tech weapon being used on U.S. diplomats who fell ill. The Cuban delegation is disappointed with the lack of medical data shared by U.S. officials. In a letter coauthored with a professor from the University of Pennsylvania, it was mentioned that there is insufficient evidence to speculate on the cause of the health issues experienced by the diplomats. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy for Cuban migrants entering the US has been ended. Cuban nationals attempting illegal entry are now subject to removal, with the Cuban government agreeing to accept their return. President Trump's NSPM on Cuba stated that the policy encouraged risky travel to the US. Background on the 1994 and 1995 Migration Accords between Cuba and the US. In 1994 and 1995, Cuba and the United States signed migration accords to address the mass exodus of Cubans. President Clinton changed U.S. immigration policy in 1994, stating that Cubans rescued at sea would be taken to Guantanamo Bay. Talks between the two countries ensued due to the continued large numbers of fleeing Cubans. In early September 1994, Cuba and the United States reached a bilateral agreement to control the flow of Cuban migrants to the U.S. by boat. The agreement ensured safe and legal migration, with a minimum of 20,000 legal Cuban migrants per year. In May 1995, another accord was reached to parole over 30,000 Cubans from Guantanamo to the U.S. and intercept future sea migrants, returning them to Cuba. By January 1996, all intercepted Cubans had left Guantanamo. Since the 1995 migration accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to their country. Under the wet foot/dry foot policy, most interdictions resulted in a return to Cuba, while those who reached U.S. shores could apply for permanent resident status. Critics argued that this policy encouraged risky migration and alien smuggling. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea fluctuated annually. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard fluctuated annually, influenced by economic situations in Cuba and the United States. From FY2010 to FY2016, interdictions increased each year, reaching a peak of 5,230 in FY2016. The surge in maritime migrants in 2015 and 2016 was due to concerns about changes in U.S. immigration policy towards Cuba. After the policy change in January 2017, interdictions dropped significantly, with 2,109 in FY2017 and 384 in FY2018. Undocumented Cuban migrants began arriving around FY2013. Since FY2013, undocumented Cuban migrants favored land-based routes to enter the US via ports of entry from Mexico. The number of undocumented Cubans entering by land increased significantly until the change in US immigration policy in January 2017. In FY2016, the number peaked at 58,269, but declined to 20,955 in FY2017. By August 2018, 6,044 undocumented Cubans arrived, marking a 70% decrease from FY2017. The Obama Administration ended the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program in January 2017, which allowed Cuban medical professionals in third countries to enter the US. Some Members of Congress are urging the Trump Administration to reinstate the program. Some Members of Congress are calling for the reestablishment of the CMPP program and for Cuba to be downgraded to Tier 3 status in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report due to its treatment of Cuban medical professionals in foreign missions. The 2018 TIP report highlighted allegations of coercion in the program, but also noted that some participants considered their postings voluntary and well-paid compared to jobs in Cuba. The downsizing of the U.S. Embassy in Havana has led to the suspension of most visa processing, making it difficult and expensive for Cubans to visit family in the United States and for private sector workers to travel for business purposes. Visa applications are now being handled at the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana. The United States has changed visa policies for Cubans, requiring them to travel to a third country for visa renewals. Multiple entry visas have been replaced with single entry visas for a two-month stay, affecting family travel and business engagements. The downsizing of the U.S. Embassy in Havana has made visa processing difficult and expensive for Cubans. The U.S. embassy staff reduction has impacted the issuance of travel documents for Cubans under the 1994 migration accord. In FY2018, only 4,060 Cubans received travel documents compared to the annual commitment of 20,000. The Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program (CFRP) played a significant role in issuing travel documents, but arrangements for processing applications are now being determined. Cuba's location and shoreline make it vulnerable to narcotics-smuggling operations, with drugs entering the market through onshore wash-ups or smuggling by boats and aircraft. The government has implemented measures such as stiffening penalties for traffickers, training counternarcotics personnel, and cooperating with other countries on antidrug efforts. Operation Hatchet focuses on maritime and air interdiction and recovering narcotics washed up on Cuban shores. Since 2003, Cuba has actively pursued internal enforcement against its emerging drug market with a nationwide prevention campaign. U.S.-Cuban cooperation on antidrug efforts has varied, with increased collaboration since 1999. Cuba cooperated with the U.S. in seizing cocaine in 1996 and accepted upgrades to communication links for border control. Since 2003, Cuba has been actively enforcing its drug market with a prevention campaign. U.S.-Cuban cooperation on antidrug efforts has increased since 1999, including the stationing of a U.S. Coast Guard drug interdiction specialist in Havana. Cooperation has further increased since the reestablishment of diplomatic relations in 2015, with dialogues and exchanges on counternarcotics issues. Talks have been held to stop the illegal flow of narcotics, and Cuban security officials visited the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South in Key West, FL in April 2016. Cuba and the United States have signed a counternarcotics arrangement to facilitate cooperation and information sharing. They share tactical information related to vessels suspected of drug trafficking in Cuban territorial waters. Cuba has 40 bilateral agreements for antidrug cooperation with countries worldwide. The U.S. DEA and Cuban counterparts have established direct communications for drug investigations and cooperation. Cuba has assisted in U.S. prosecutions by providing evidence and information, showing willingness to cooperate on law enforcement matters. Bilateral discussions on law enforcement and drug control cooperation continue between the United States and Cuba. Cuba's compensation for expropriation is an important issue in normalizing relations. The issue in normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba revolves around compensation for the expropriation of U.S. properties in Cuba dating back to the 1960s. The Foreign Claim Settlement Commission has certified 5,913 claims valued at $1.9 billion, with accrued interest totaling around $8 billion. This includes claims from U.S. citizens and companies whose properties were confiscated by the Cuban government. Various options for restitution or compensation are being considered. Cuba and the U.S. are in negotiations for compensation of expropriated U.S. properties. Cuba disputes the FCSC valuation of $1.9 billion, proposing $1 billion based on taxable value. They also claim $134.5 billion in damages from U.S. sanctions. Meetings have been held to address these issues. Meetings on claims issues between December 2015 and January 2017 included discussions on FCSC-certified claims of U.S. nationals, unsatisfied U.S. court judgments against Cuba, and claims related to the U.S. embargo. A second meeting in July 2016 in Washington, DC allowed for an exchange of views on historical claims-settlement practices. A third meeting in January 2017 in Havana addressed Title III of the LIBERTAD Act, holding accountable those trafficking in confiscated Cuban property. In January 2019, the U.S. federal court allowed the suspension of the right to file lawsuits in Cuba for an additional 45 days, citing the need to review factors such as human rights violations and support for authoritarian regimes in Venezuela and Nicaragua. In March 2019, Secretary Pompeo partially suspended the right to file lawsuits against entities on the \"Cuba Restricted List\" controlled by the Cuban military, intelligence, or security service. The State Department will continue to study the impact on human rights in Cuba, allowing lawsuits by any U.S. national, except against third-country foreign investors. Pompeo considered concerns from allies in the EU, Canada, and elsewhere in the decision-making process. Some U.S. businesses and foreign companies are worried about potential lawsuits under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act, which aims to prevent foreign investment in properties confiscated by the Cuban government. The suspension of the right to file lawsuits could impact foreign companies conducting business in Cuba. The potential impact of lawsuits under Title III of the LIBERTAD Act on foreign companies in Cuba is a concern. Some foreign governments have objected to the Act and may take countermeasures. There are worries about U.S. federal courts being overwhelmed with lawsuits if Title III is fully implemented, with estimates of thousands of claims by Cuban Americans. The LIBERTAD Act may lead to tens of billions of dollars in claims by Cuban Americans. The Act excludes certain transactions and properties, with a $50,000 threshold for lawsuits under Title III. Cuba has been criticized for harboring fugitives wanted in the United States, as mentioned in the State Department's annual terrorism report. The United States provides limited support to individuals wanted for serious violations of U.S. criminal laws in Cuba. U.S. fugitives in Cuba include convicted murderers and hijackers, such as Joanne Chesimard, who escaped to Cuba in 1984 after being convicted for the murder of a New Jersey State Police officer in 1973. In 1979, William \"Guillermo\" Morales escaped from prison in New York after being convicted on weapons charges. He fled to Cuba in 1988 and has been living there since. Despite an extradition treaty between the United States and Cuba dating back to 1905, Cuba has not used it to extradite fugitives. Instead, they have returned wanted individuals to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis. Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the United States on a case-by-case basis, including a husband and wife wanted for murder in New Jersey in 2011, a Florida couple who kidnapped their children in 2013, and a U.S. fugitive wanted for ecoterrorism in 2018. Additionally, Cuba cooperated in prosecuting a Cuban national for a murder in Florida in 2015. However, Cuba generally refuses to extradite fugitives to the U.S. In the 116th Congress, H.Res. 92 calls for the extradition of convicted felons William Morales and Joanne Chesimard from Cuba to the United States. Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel succeeded Ra\u00fal Castro as president in April 2018. Cuba has returned wanted fugitives to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis but generally refuses extradition. Ra\u00fal Castro, 87 years old, continues as first secretary of Cuba's Communist Party until 2021. The new constitution in Cuba solidifies market-oriented economic reforms while maintaining state sector dominance and Communist Party control. President D\u00edaz-Canel faces challenges in implementing economic reforms and addressing public concerns, especially with potential oil supply cuts from Venezuela. President Trump's policies have limited U.S. business engagement in Cuba and strained bilateral relations. The downsizing of the U.S. Embassy in Havana has made cooperation more difficult. The implementation of Title III of the LIBERTAD Act has escalated tensions between the two countries. The current outlook for positive government-to-government engagement between the United States and Cuba appears dim. Debate over Cuba policy is likely to continue in the 116th Congress, especially regarding U.S. economic sanctions and human rights concerns. Legislative Initiatives in the 116th Congress include the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6). The Senate approved a conference report on February 14, 2019, which was signed into law the next day. The report allocated $20 million for Cuba democracy assistance and $29.1 million for Cuba broadcasting. The bill also included provisions prohibiting direct funding for the government of Cuba and restrictions on assistance for Cuba. Additionally, a bill called the Baseball Diplomacy Act was introduced to waive certain prohibitions for Cuban nationals playing professional baseball in the United States. H.R. 1898 (Crawford) and S. 428 (Klobuchar) are bills introduced in 2019 to modify restrictions on U.S. assistance and financing for exports to Cuba. H.Res. 92 (King) calls for the extradition of convicted felons receiving safe harbor in Cuba. Resolution S.Res. 14 (Menendez) and H.Res. 136 (Sires) aim to address fugitives from justice in Cuba and the country's medical missions, suggesting downgrading Cuba to Tier 3 in the Trafficking in Persons Report and reinstating the Cuban Medical Professional Parole program. Introduced in January and February 2019, these resolutions are currently under review by the respective committees on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations. The text chunk provides links to various government web pages related to Cuba, including reports on human rights practices, sanctions information, and foreign operations budget justifications. The curr_chunk provides links to government reports on Cuba, including international religious freedom, narcotics control, money laundering, Cuban imports, and trafficking in persons. The curr_chunk provides a link to the Trafficking in Persons Report 2018 for Cuba, issued by the Department of State in June 2018."
