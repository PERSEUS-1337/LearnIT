    "content": "The Act titled \"Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2003\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by adding a section on wastewater treatment works security. The \"Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2003\" defines vulnerability assessment as an evaluation of a treatment works' vulnerability to actions that disrupt its operation or impact critical infrastructure, public health, or the environment. This includes reviewing facilities, systems, and devices used in the treatment process. The \"Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2003\" defines vulnerability assessment as evaluating a treatment works' vulnerability to disruptions or impacts on critical infrastructure, public health, or the environment. This includes assessing various aspects such as storage, treatment, recycling, equipment, chemicals, and operation procedures. Countermeasures and equipment can be identified to reduce vulnerabilities. The Administrator may provide grants for vulnerability assessments and security enhancements to reduce vulnerabilities in treatment works. This includes conducting assessments and implementing security measures based on the assessment findings. The Administrator may provide grants for security enhancements to reduce vulnerabilities in treatment works, including purchasing and installing equipment for access control, intrusion prevention, detection of intruders, and hazardous substances. This includes barriers, fencing, gates, security lighting, cameras, metal grates, and wire mesh. The security enhancements for treatment works include metal grates, wire mesh, outfall entry barriers, securing manhole covers, installation of doors and locks, and detection systems for smoke, chemicals, and explosives. Additionally, improvements for electronic systems involve access control, intrusion prevention, and system backup. Training programs are also included. The Administrator may provide grants for security enhancements such as training programs, manuals, security screening, and additional enhancements not specified in the initial paragraph. Applicants must submit an application describing the security enhancement and obtain approval from the Administrator. The Administrator may provide grants for security enhancements, with applicants needing approval for their applications. Grants cannot be used for personnel costs or facility maintenance. Applicants are not required to disclose vulnerability assessments to the Administrator. The Federal share of funded activities shall not exceed a certain amount. The Administrator may provide grants for security enhancements for publicly owned treatment works, with a maximum grant amount of $150,000. Technical assistance is available for small treatment works serving populations under 20,000 individuals. The Administrator may provide grants to nonprofit organizations for vulnerability assessments and security enhancements for publicly owned treatment works. Technical guidance and assistance may include training and engineering evaluations. Nonprofit organizations can participate in achieving the goals of this subsection. The Administrator may provide grants to nonprofit organizations for improving vulnerability assessment methodologies and tools for publicly owned treatment works, including those in combined public wastewater treatment and water supply systems. Eligible activities for the grants include developing software upgrades, enhancing technical support functions, expanding information libraries on threats and countermeasures, and implementing user training initiatives. The Administrator may provide grants for improving vulnerability assessment methodologies and tools for publicly owned treatment works. Services funded by the grants must be provided at no cost to recipients. Authorization of appropriations includes $200,000,000 for grants, $15,000,000 for assistance, and $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2003 through 2007. SEC. 223. RESEARCH AND REVIEW: Title II of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include provisions for research and review. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like 'covered treatment works' and 'harmful intentional act', which refers to intentional acts intended to disrupt treatment works, damage infrastructure, or harm the environment. The Administrator, in coordination with Federal agencies, will research means of carrying out harmful intentional acts and alternative processes for wastewater treatment in case of destruction of treatment works due to intentional acts. Means of carrying out harmful intentional acts on treatment works include destroying conveyances, facilities, and systems used for wastewater treatment to prevent meeting public health standards. The text discusses the need to protect treatment works from threats to public health, safety, and the environment, including intentional acts and terrorism. It also mentions securing systems from being used for transportation and preventing disruptions to information systems at treatment works. The Administrator will review treatment works to assess vulnerability to disruptions by terrorists or other groups. The review will consider various sizes and geographic areas, including the National Capital Area. Information on the review results will be shared with treatment works through appropriate means. Funding is authorized for this purpose. \"Funding of $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to assess vulnerability of treatment works to terrorist disruptions.\""
