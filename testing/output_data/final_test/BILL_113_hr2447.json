    "content": "The \"American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2013\" is also known as the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Strategic Plan. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 amends Section 102 to develop a national manufacturing competitiveness strategic plan every 4 years to enhance government coordination and provide guidance for federal programs supporting US manufacturing competitiveness. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 requires the Secretary of Commerce to chair a Committee to develop a strategic plan for US manufacturing competitiveness. The goals of the plan include promoting growth, supporting a skilled workforce, enabling innovation and investment, and enhancing national security. The plan must specify near-term and long-term objectives to achieve these goals. The strategic plan for US manufacturing competitiveness must include research and development objectives, anticipated timeframe, metrics for assessing progress, progress from prior plans, roles of Federal agencies, and fostering transfer of research results into new technologies. The development of new manufacturing technologies in the United States aims to benefit society and ensure national security, energy security, and economic security. Federal agencies and centers will strengthen manufacturing education and training programs, assist small- and medium-sized manufacturers, and consider analysis and recommendations in their efforts. The Committee developing new manufacturing technologies in the United States will consider recommendations from various stakeholders, including representatives from different sectors, academia, and federal advisory committees. They will conduct a preliminary analysis of factors impacting competitiveness and growth as part of the strategic plan development. The Committee will consider factors affecting the competitiveness and growth of the US manufacturing sector, such as research, innovation, workforce capabilities, trade policies, financing, and emerging technologies. The Committee will analyze manufacturing promotion efforts of competing nations and use existing information for the report to be submitted within a year of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2013 enactment. The President must include information in the budget regarding its consistency with the goals and recommendations of the strategic plan developed for that fiscal year."
