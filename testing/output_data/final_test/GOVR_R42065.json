    "content": "Financial stress faced by dairy farmers has prompted Congress and the industry to reconsider how to address volatile farm milk prices and the financial outlook for dairy farmers. In the 112th Congress, legislation has been introduced for alternatives to current federal programs expiring in 2012. These alternative policies could be included in the next omnibus farm bill, enacted separately before program expiration, or integrated into the work of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. This report gives an overview of federal dairy policy and reviews legislation introduced in the 112th Congress to support dairy farmers. The current dairy policy has evolved over 75 years to support dairy farmers and stabilize markets, with five main components outlined. The federal cost of dairy programs varies depending on market conditions, ranging from zero in FY2008 to $1 billion in FY2009. The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) allows the government to purchase dairy products at specified minimum prices to support farm milk prices. The program was extended through December 2012 under the 2008 farm bill. Some producers see it as a low-cost stabilizing influence, while others note its declining effectiveness as a price floor. Critics argue that price supports like the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) Program may hinder dairy product innovation by guaranteeing the purchase of certain products, not necessarily in demand globally. Under MILC, participating dairy farmers receive a federal payment when the Boston Class I price falls below the target price of $16.94 per hundredweight. The payment is limited to 2.985 million pounds of annual milk production. Under the 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246), the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program is administered by FSA, with a payment percentage rate declining to 34% and an eligible production limit of 2.4 million pounds in September 2012. Large dairy farm operators have concerns about the payment limit affecting their income, as smaller operations benefit more from MILC coverage. Additionally, Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) are authorized to balance market power between farmers and milk handlers. Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMOs) aim to stabilize fluid milk markets, support local milk production, and ensure fair benefits for producers. Producers and processors have concerns about how minimum prices are calculated, as they may not accurately reflect the market for milk. The market for milk is influenced by tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP). TRQs limit dairy imports with high tariffs above certain quantities, while DEIP provides cash bonuses to U.S. dairy exporters. Some believe that federal funds could be better spent on other aspects of dairy farm support. Several bills introduced in the 112th Congress aim to improve dairy farm support by replacing current programs with new ones to protect producers during market downturns. Additionally, there is interest in reforming dairy pricing under marketing orders to enhance price discovery and reduce volatility. H.R. 3062 proposes replacing dairy price supports, MILC, and DEIP with two new programs to support farm income and mitigate adverse effects of severe dairy price fluctuations. The bill introduced by Representative Peterson and others aims to support farm income and mitigate adverse effects of dairy price cycles. It includes payments to producers when margins decline, penalties for producing above certain levels, and changes to federal milk marketing orders. The Dairy Producer Margin Protection Program provides payments to producers when the national margin drops below $4 per cwt, with an administrative fee based on milk production levels. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program is a feature of the Dairy Producer Margin Protection Program, aimed at discouraging milk production during low margin periods by redirecting excess revenue to the federal government for purchasing dairy products and increasing demand. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program aims to increase demand for dairy products by redirecting excess revenue to the government. Farmers would receive reduced market revenue during low margin periods, with the program suspended if U.S. prices exceed world prices by 20%. Proponents believe the program would better protect producers and reduce overall dairy program costs. The Dairy Market Stabilization Program aims to increase demand for dairy products by redirecting excess revenue to the government. Supporters believe the program will better protect producers and reduce overall dairy program costs. The Congressional Budget Office has scored net savings of $131 million over 10 years compared with current law. Critics argue that provisions to reduce milk production could harm the competitiveness of the U.S. dairy industry, limit innovation, raise consumer prices, and decrease demand for dairy products. The draft bill H.R. 3062 has raised concerns about mandatory participation for all producers, potentially penalizing farms with growth potential. There are worries about increased market volatility due to time lags between program activation, producer response, and market effects. University research suggests the bill could reduce volatility in dairy farm income but may result in lower average income levels for all sizes of U.S. dairy farms. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) analysis indicates that the margin program could offer better price protection during low-margin times and cover a greater share of production, potentially leading to larger payments for producers. The draft bill H.R. 3062 aims to improve price protection for dairy producers by potentially offering larger payments during low-margin times. It also proposes replacing current milk pricing formulas with a competitive price model, subject to a producer referendum for approval. The draft bill H.R. 3062 proposes changes to federal milk marketing orders, including the elimination of end-product pricing for Class III to simplify the system. Supporters argue that the current pricing mechanism and revenue pooling system encourage overproduction. Senator Casey has introduced two bills with different approaches to support the dairy industry, while dairy processors advocate for the elimination of minimum pricing in federal orders to promote innovation and reduce price volatility. Senator Casey has introduced two bills to support dairy farmers. S. 1640 would use milk cost of production to set minimum milk prices under FMMOs, aiming to increase prices and farm returns. On the other hand, S. 1682 would promote risk management tools by offering a subsidy for producer purchase of a gross margin insurance product. S. 1640 would change the current 4-class marketing order system to two classes based on production costs, shifting pricing from market-based to production-cost-based. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for USDA to reduce prices to limit milk production if necessary. The Dairy Advancement Act of 2011 (S. 1682) aims to eliminate the Dairy Product Price Support Program and provide a subsidy for dairy farmers to purchase margin insurance policies. This change could lead to higher prices for dairy farmers initially, but critics are concerned about the long-term competitiveness and stability of the U.S. dairy industry. The Dairy Advancement Act of 2011 (S. 1682) proposes a MILC program with a subsidy available at the $1.50-per-cwt level for up to 3 million pounds of production. It aims to help the industry upgrade its capital base and adjust to changes by providing loan guarantees for dairy processors and cooperatives to acquire new equipment and technologies. The bill also expands mandatory price reporting to include more products reported daily for improved market transparency. The Dairy Advancement Act of 2011 (S. 1682) proposes changes to federal milk marketing orders, including replacing the current 4-class system with two classes and analyzing economic impacts of pricing formula changes. IDFA supports the bill for focusing on risk management for dairy farmers, while NMPF supports a different approach (H.R. 3062) due to concerns about MILC program effectiveness. Senator Gillibrand introduced two dairy policy bills in October 2011 to support dairy farmers. The first bill aimed to extend and enhance the MILC program, while the second bill, similar to the Dairy Security Act of 2011, included a stabilization program with exceptions for certain producers. The Dairy Producer Income Protection Act of 2011 extended MILC for five years, preventing a drop in payment parameters and including a monthly adjustment to the target price based on the Consumer Price Index for increased producer protection. The bill aims to protect dairy farmers from declines in milk prices by tying payments to the Consumer Price Index. It proposes replacing end-product pricing with a competitive pay pricing system and would save $21 million over five years. The bill might appeal to smaller farms as it limits payments to a certain amount of production. The Dairy Pricing Reform and Farmer Protection Act of 2011 (S. 1715) establishes a voluntary margin program with payment limits based on production amounts and national margin levels. It offers greater protection for smaller producers compared to H.R. 3062 and includes a mandatory nationwide Dairy Market Stabilization Program. The proposed dairy legislation aims to establish a mandatory nationwide Dairy Market Stabilization Program, which would only reduce individual farm revenue in specific circumstances. The industry is divided on the approach to dairy farm price and income support, with some calling for significant changes to the federal marketing order system. Cost considerations and familiarity with existing programs play a role in developing dairy policy in the 112th Congress."
