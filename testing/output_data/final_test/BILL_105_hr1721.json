    "content": "The \"Church Insurance Protection Act\" condemns arson attacks against churches and prohibits insurance companies from canceling or declining to renew fire insurance for religious properties. An insurer cannot cancel or decline to renew fire insurance for a religious property based on factors such as the race, color, religion, or national origin of the congregation, the property's status as a religious property, previous arson occurrences, or threats of arson. An insurer cannot charge higher premiums for fire insurance for a religious property based on factors such as race, religion, property status, previous arson incidents, or threats of arson. Enforcement is through the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice is responsible for investigating and enforcing violations of the Act, allowing individuals to file complaints for alleged violations. The Attorney General can also take actions to ensure compliance with the Act. Civil action can be taken as well. The Attorney General can initiate civil action in a US district court if there is reasonable cause to believe a violation of the Act has occurred. The court can grant preventive relief such as injunctions and assess civil penalties against violators. Violators of the Act can face fines of $50,000 for a first violation, $250,000 for a second violation, and $500,000 for a third or subsequent violation. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.
