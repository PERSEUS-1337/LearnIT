    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the Federal Communications Commission has mandated closed captioning for television programs, with deadlines for full captioning in English by 2006 and Spanish by 2010. Over 28 million Americans are deaf or hard of hearing, requiring captioning for participation. Additionally, around 24,000 children are born in the US each year with hearing loss. According to the Department of Health and Human Services and a study by the National Council on Aging, a significant percentage of older Americans are hearing impaired. The study also suggests a link between hearing loss and depression in older adults. Empirical research shows that captions can improve reading performance for various groups, including remedial readers and young children learning to read. Over the past decade, student enrollment in programs training realtime writers and closed captioners has decreased by 50 percent, despite 100 percent job placement upon graduation. This decline is concerning given the significant number of young children learning to read, illiterate adults, and individuals for whom English is a second language. Authorization of grant program to promote training and job placement of realtime writers. The Secretary of Commerce will provide grants to eligible court reporting programs to train individuals as realtime writers for closed captioning of video programming. Eligible entities must meet educational and financial standards and be accredited by a recognized agency. The Secretary of Commerce will prioritize grants for eligible entities with the most capability to increase training for realtime writers, promising collaborations with local institutions or innovative approaches for training and job placement. The grant duration is two years with a maximum amount of $1,500,000 for eligible entities. SEC. 4. APPLICATION. To apply for a grant under section 3, an eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary of Commerce with specific information including the training and assistance to be funded, performance measures for evaluating progress, and details on increasing the number of realtime writers. The eligible entity must describe how scholarships will ensure employment as realtime writers, continue training post-grant, collaborate with workforce boards for local goals, and provide additional eligibility information. The eligible entity must provide additional information on eligibility for priority grants and any other information required by the Administration. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. An eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must use the funds for recruitment, training, job placement, and mentorship of individuals, including those who have completed a court reporting training program, as realtime writers. This includes scholarships, distance learning, curriculum development, mentorship for successful training completion, job placement assistance, and encouraging individuals with disabilities to pursue a career in realtime writing. The scholarship amount for realtime writing services is based on financial need and recipients must agree to provide services for a specified period. The Secretary of Commerce will establish requirements for coursework and employment. The Secretary of Commerce will establish requirements for coursework, employment, and repayment of scholarship amounts for recipients of scholarships. Administrative costs for grants under the program are limited to 5 percent. Grant amounts under the program are meant to supplement, not supplant other funding. Grant amounts under this Act are meant to supplement, not supplant other Federal or non-Federal funds for promoting the training and placement of individuals as realtime writers. SEC. 6. REPORTS. Each eligible entity receiving a grant under section 3 must submit an annual report to the Secretary of Commerce detailing the use of grant funds and assessing the effectiveness of activities in increasing the number of realtime writers. The final report should also include a description of the best practices. The Inspector General of the Department of Commerce conducts an annual review of grants to assess management, efficiency, and effectiveness. The grants aim to increase the number of individuals trained, employed, and retained as realtime writers. The Act authorizes $20,000,000 for fiscal years 2006-2009 for training court reporters and closed captioners. The Act is set to be repealed on October 1, 2009."
