    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14549.2 of the Public Resources Code is amended to allow the department to pay a market development payment to certified entities or product manufacturers for empty plastic beverage containers collected for recycling in California. The department will provide a market development payment to certified entities or product manufacturers in California for empty plastic beverage containers collected for recycling in the state. This payment is made if the containers are processed into a usable form and used in manufacturing within the state. The department determines market development payments for certified entities and product manufacturers, not exceeding $150 per ton. Factors considered include funding levels to encourage in-state recycling and manufacturing using plastic beverage containers. The department may provide market development payments to certified entities and product manufacturers for empty plastic beverage containers. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2018, unless extended by a later statute. Funds from the Public Resources Code will be used for handling fee payments and curbside programs. The department may expend $10,500,000 annually for beverage container recycling and litter cleanup activities in cities and counties. Eligible activities include curbside recycling programs, public education, litter prevention, and cooperative regional efforts. Funds must be used for beverage container recycling or litter reduction only. To receive funds for beverage container recycling and litter cleanup activities, cities, counties, or city and county entities must submit a funding request form specifying the intended use of the funds. The form, distributed annually by the department, outlines the eligible amount of funds and must be returned within 90 days to qualify for the funding cycle. The department may withhold payment to any city, county, or city and county that has prohibited the siting of a supermarket site, caused a supermarket site to close its business, or adopted a land use policy that restricts or prohibits the siting of a supermarket site within its jurisdiction. $1,500,000 may be expended annually in grants for beverage container recycling and litter reduction programs. The department shall establish separate processing fee accounts in the fund for each beverage container material type for which a processing payment is required. Funds are allocated to reduce processing fees and promote recycling through a public education campaign. The money in processing fee accounts is continuously appropriated for processing payments. Up to $5 million annually can be used for a recycling promotion campaign. The department can expend up to $10 million annually for quality incentive and market development payments for empty glass and plastic beverage containers until January 1, 2018. Additionally, the department can calculate and spend an additional amount for market development payments for plastic containers. The department annually determines if the funds needed for processing payments for plastic beverage containers are less than the previous year. If so, they calculate the difference and can spend up to 50% of that amount for specific purposes. If the department finds excess funds allocated for plastic market development, they can carry them over to the following year. If there are insufficient funds for market development payments and required deposits, the implementation of certain subparagraphs will be suspended. Subparagraphs (B) and (C) will only be in effect until January 1, 2018. The department may reduce or eliminate expenditures from funds if there are inadequate funds for required payments. If insufficient funds are found, all payments will be reduced proportionally. Subparagraphs (B) and (C) will only be in effect until January 1, 2018. The department must convene an advisory committee before spending funds on an education campaign. They will retroactively pay in full any reduced payments made between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2010, subject to fund availability."
