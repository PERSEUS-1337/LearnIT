    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty Preservation Act of 2017\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The term \"INF Treaty\" refers to a specific treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. The \"New START Treaty\" and \"Open Skies Treaty\" are specific agreements between the United States and other countries, with defined dates of signing and entering into force. The term \"intelligence community\" is defined in the National Security Act of 1947. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the United States has determined that the Russian Federation violated the INF Treaty by possessing ground-launched cruise missiles with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km. The INF Treaty prohibits the use of certain missile launchers. Concerns about Russia's noncompliance have been raised since 2008 but no progress has been made in bringing them back into compliance. The Department of Defense reported military requirement gaps due to INF Treaty restrictions. General Breedlove emphasized the need to address any INF-violating weapon capabilities introduced in Europe. The United States faces restrictions under the INF Treaty, hindering the development of ground-launched cruise missiles. Russia's advancements in this area pose a national security concern. If Russia breaches the treaty, the US can suspend its operation. SEC. 4. COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT REGARDING RUSSIAN VIOLATIONS OF THE INF TREATY. The United States policy states that the actions of the Russian Federation violate the INF Treaty, allowing the US to suspend the treaty as long as Russia remains in breach. The US should take actions to encourage Russia to return to compliance. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 authorizes the establishment of a program for a dual-capable road-mobile ground-launched cruise missile system with a range of 5,500 kilometers. Additional missile defense assets are being sought in Europe to protect against Russian ground-launched missile systems in violation of the INF Treaty. Authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2018 for the development of active defenses, counterforce capabilities, facilitating acquisition and transfer of missile systems, and countervailing strike capabilities to enhance US capabilities. $100,000,000 is authorized for activities related to section 5, including research and development. An offset of $500,000,000 is made from the National Nuclear Security Administration's budget for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation in fiscal year 2018. Development of INF range ground-launched missile system is authorized with $100,000,000 allocated for research and development activities. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish a program to develop a ground-launched cruise missile system with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. A report on the feasibility of modifying existing missiles for ground launch within this range must be submitted to congressional defense committees within 120 days. SEC. 6. Notification requirement regarding Russian Federation's development of noncompliant systems. The Director of National Intelligence must report to congressional committees and the President every 90 days for five years on whether Russia has tested, produced, or deployed systems inconsistent with the INF Treaty. SEC. 7. LIMITATION ON FUNDS FOR NEW START TREATY AND OPEN SKIES TREATY. None of the funds for the Department of Defense can be used to extend the New START Treaty past 2021, allow Russian flights over the US or allies under the Open Skies Treaty, or approve new decisions under the Open Skies Treaty without Russia eliminating INF Treaty-violating missiles. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on Aegis Ashore sites with anti-air warfare capability in Asia and Europe to defend against Russian ground-launched missiles. Additionally, a review of the RS-26 ballistic missile is required. The Secretary of State, with input from the Secretary of Defense and Director of National Intelligence, will review the RS-26 ballistic missile of Russia. A report must be submitted to congressional committees within 90 days, determining if the missile violates treaties. If the RS-26 ballistic missile is determined to be covered under the New START Treaty, the Russian Federation must agree to limitations and an exhibition of the system. Failure to comply will result in the United States considering it a violation of the INF Treaty. SEC. 10. UNITED STATES ACTIONS REGARDING MATERIAL BREACH OF INF TREATY BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. Congress declares that due to the Russian Federation's violations of the INF Treaty, including prohibited systems, its actions constitute a material breach. The President must report on Russia's possession of prohibited missiles within a specified range. If the report shows that the Russian Federation has tested or possesses prohibited missiles, the President will suspend the INF Treaty with the US and notify other state parties of Russia's breach."
