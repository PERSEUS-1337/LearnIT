    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Daniel Keysar Memorial and Childhood Consumer Product Safety Act of 1999\". It includes findings related to consumer product safety. The Congress finds that a defective crib led to the tragic death of Linda Ginzel and Boaz Keysar's 16-month-old son, Danny, despite the crib being recalled by the CPSC in 1993. This incident was not an isolated case, as twelve children had already died in similar cribs nationwide. The CPSC, established in 1972, aims to protect the public from unreasonable injury risks. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) aims to protect the public from risks associated with consumer products. Despite having jurisdiction over 15,000 products, its budget is insufficient compared to other regulatory agencies. The CPSC's budget has not kept up with inflation, leading to a shortfall in resources. Manufacturers are required to report safety issues, but only a small number of reports are filed annually. Inspections consistently find a high percentage of products in violation of safety regulations. The CPSC recalls about 200-300 products each year, mainly children's products or toys. In 1998, 38 million units of children's products were recalled. Despite efforts to remove recalled products from retail stores, it is challenging to remove them from consumers' homes and secondary markets. Only 10 to 30 percent of recalled products are repaired or returned, leading to potential injuries or fatalities from unrepaired products. SEC. 3. RECALLED PRODUCTS. The Consumer Product Safety Act is amended to include a section on recalled products. The Commission must create a list of children's products recalled in the past 15 years and make it accessible to the public. Commission announcements of corrective actions must be labeled as recalls. The Commission must clearly state the nature and extent of product hazards in recall announcements, including the number of deaths, injuries, and incidents. The announcements should use language that motivates consumers to participate in the recall. Additionally, the Commission will establish a pilot program to work with manufacturers and retailers to obtain consumer identities. Manufacturers and retailers must provide consumer identities for specified juvenile or children's products for recall notifications. The Commission will report annually to Congress on the effectiveness of recalls, making information available to the public through various channels. Section 4 of the Consumer Product Safety Act authorizes appropriations of $100 million for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2003."
