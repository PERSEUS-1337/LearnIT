    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2004\". Congress finds that over 110 million orphans in developing regions face significant disadvantages, including lack of basic necessities like healthcare and education. Additionally, around 121 million children globally, especially young girls, do not attend school, with orphans being less likely to be in school and more likely to work full time. School food programs in developing countries serve as strong incentives for children to stay in school and improve their education, reducing hunger and enhancing cognitive abilities. Financial barriers, such as school fees, prevent vulnerable children in developing countries from attending school. Providing free primary education with adequate resources for teacher training and infrastructure can help more children obtain a quality education. The trauma of losing a parent can lead to behavior problems and negatively impact a child's school performance and social relations, especially for children affected by HIV/AIDS or orphaned by AIDS. Orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries often face stigmatization and discrimination due to HIV/AIDS. Providing culturally appropriate psychosocial support can help them accept and adjust to their circumstances. Inheritance rights for women and children are often difficult to claim and enforce, leading to challenges in accessing property. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has worsened poverty in communities and had a devastating impact on children. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has led to a significant increase in orphans worldwide, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children are the hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost one or both parents to AIDS, and by 2010, over 25,000,000 children are expected to be orphaned by AIDS. Approximately 2,500,000 children under 15 have HIV/AIDS globally, with 2,000 more children getting infected daily. Without treatment, most children born with HIV do not survive past age two. Children born with HIV have a low chance of survival without treatment, but with sustained drug therapy, their chances of long-term survival and a productive adulthood greatly improve. However, there is a lack of focus on pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment in developing countries due to various reasons such as perceived low priority, lack of healthcare professionals, and misconceptions about pediatric treatment. Despite efforts from organizations, extended families and local communities remain the primary support for vulnerable children. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is creating a crisis for orphans, leading to the evolution of community-based resource centers as alternatives to traditional orphanages. The implications of the AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa extend globally, requiring an urgent response from the international community, as highlighted in the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act of 2003. Less than 10 percent of HIV/AIDS assistance funds for fiscal years 2006-2008 are allocated for orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS. Various US and local organizations, including faith-based ones, have applied for increased grants to support these children in developing countries. The United States Government, along with private organizations including faith-based ones, aims to provide greater protection for orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries. A comprehensive approach is needed to ensure access to essential services such as basic care, psychosocial support, education, and HIV/AIDS treatment. Assistance for orphans and vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS is best provided through a comprehensive approach that ensures coordination between Federal agencies and the private sector to prevent duplication of efforts. Community-based programs are prioritized to keep children connected to their families and traditions. Assistance for orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries is addressed in a new section added to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Congress finds that there are over 110 million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, with 14 million children losing parents to AIDS. The orphan crisis, exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, is deepening poverty and affecting human welfare and political stability beyond the region. Extended families and communities are struggling to meet the basic needs of orphans and vulnerable children. The United States provides assistance to orphans and vulnerable children by offering food, healthcare, education, and clothing. This support reflects the humanitarian concern of the American people. Definitions for terms like AIDS, children, HIV/AIDS, orphan, and psychosocial support are outlined in this section. The President is authorized to provide psychosocial support, including care for psychological and social problems, to individuals, families, and caregivers. Assistance can be provided through international or nongovernmental organizations for programs in developing countries to support orphans and vulnerable children by establishing community-based organizations. The President is authorized to provide assistance for orphans and vulnerable children, including basic care, school food programs, primary school enrollment, employment training, inheritance rights protection, psychosocial support, and culturally appropriate services. The President is authorized to provide assistance for orphans and vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS through pharmaceuticals, training individuals for pediatric treatment, and purchasing pediatric-specific technologies. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, with funds remaining available until expended. The President is authorized to provide assistance for orphans and vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS through pharmaceuticals, training individuals for pediatric treatment, and purchasing pediatric-specific technologies. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, with funds remaining available until expended. Funds may be used for assistance regardless of other provisions of law. The United States will implement a strategy as outlined in Section 4. The President must develop a strategy for coordinating assistance programs for orphans and vulnerable children within 180 days of this Act. The strategy should consult with USAID field missions, not impede program efficiency, and address indigenous populations' needs. It must identify federal agencies providing assistance for orphans. The Federal Government is providing assistance for orphans and vulnerable children in foreign countries. Efforts are being made to coordinate this assistance with other agencies and nongovernmental entities. A coordinated strategy is being developed to provide the authorized assistance, including coordination with other donors. Additional coordination mechanisms and a monitoring system with performance goals are being analyzed. The Federal Government is developing a coordinated strategy for providing assistance to orphans and vulnerable children in foreign countries. This includes setting performance goals in an objective and quantifiable form, as well as defining performance indicators to measure the achievement of these goals. The President must submit an annual report on the implementation of the Act to the appropriate congressional committees defined as specific Senate and House committees."
