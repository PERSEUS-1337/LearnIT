    "content": "President Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice David Souter. The Senate confirmed her by a vote of 68-31, and she was sworn in on August 8, 2009. Prior to her appointment to the Second Circuit, she served as a federal district court judge and worked as a prosecutor and attorney in private practice. This report analyzes selected cases authored by Judge Sotomayor during her tenure on the Second Circuit, including opinions in areas of legal significance. Judge Sotomayor's opinions as an appellate judge show a tendency to favor plaintiffs in cases involving individuals with disabilities and international concerns. She adheres to the doctrine of stare decisis and upholds past judicial decisions. Judge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy aligns with the doctrine of stare decisis, showing respect for past precedents. She meticulously evaluates case facts and statutory interpretation, preferring plain text meaning but considering intent in ambiguous situations. She dislikes judicial overreach and upholds the appropriate role in cases. In a dissenting opinion in a Fourth Amendment case in May 2009, Judge Sotomayor criticized the court for delving into case facts involving a denial of a motion for summary judgment. She highlighted the difference in roles between circuit court judges and Supreme Court justices, noting that the latter often deal with issues of \"first impression\" without relevant precedents. As a Second Circuit judge, she mainly reviewed cases from federal courts in Vermont, New York, and Connecticut. During her time on the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor reviewed cases from federal courts in Vermont, New York, and Connecticut. The jurisdictional area and nature of the Second Circuit influenced the range of subjects she dealt with. She wrote opinions on various issues, including the First Amendment and free speech. As a Supreme Court Justice, she will be involved in deciding significant free speech cases. Judge Sotomayor, as a Supreme Court Justice, will be involved in deciding significant free speech cases. One such case involves the constitutionality of a federal law criminalizing depictions of animal cruelty, which may lead to the recognition of a new category of exempted speech. Her decisions on the Free Speech Clause are not controversial, with a focus on meticulous recitation of facts and application of precedent. Judge Sotomayor's opinions do not reveal a specific ideology regarding the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. In a case involving the \"Mexico City Policy,\" she dismissed a First Amendment challenge, citing precedent that the policy did not violate free speech rights. In U.S. v. Quattrone, Judge Sotomayor overturned a gag rule as a prior restraint on the press, citing First Amendment protection. In Doe v. Mukasey, she declared parts of the USA PATRIOT Act unconstitutional, specifically regarding national security letters. The panel in a case involving national security letters (NSLs) applied Supreme Court precedent related to prior restraints, emphasizing deference to the Executive Branch. The Supreme Court precedent in Freedman v. Maryland outlined procedural protections against impermissible censorship. The Second Circuit partially invalidated provisions of an act related to national security letters, citing that the burden of proof in court must be on the government and not based solely on government certification. The panel remanded the case for further review. In Pappas v. Giuliani, Judge Sotomayor upheld the decision to fire an officer for racist speech, ruling it did not violate the First Amendment. The officer's speech was unrelated to his employment, and public employees can challenge adverse actions for expressing opinions on public matters. In Pappas v. Giuliani, the court ruled that the police department's interests outweighed Officer Pappas' free speech rights, as public knowledge of his racist attitudes could undermine the department's mission. Judge Sotomayor dissented, arguing that Pappas' job nature and anonymity should have favored his speech rights. Judge Sotomayor argued that Pappas' job nature and anonymity should have favored his speech rights, despite finding his speech offensive. She emphasized that his private opinions about race, expressed away from work and anonymously, would not undermine the NYPD's function. Judge Sotomayor found that the employer's investigation and decision to publicize the employee's speech could set a dangerous precedent for government employers to fire employees for anonymously expressed views. She believed this went against the reasonable belief standard. In another case, Singh v. City of New York, Judge Sotomayor ruled against the employee in a retaliation suit involving government employee speech. Judge Sotomayor ruled against the employee in a retaliation suit involving government employee speech. Singh, a fire alarm inspector, believed he should be compensated for travel time but Sotomayor found his speech did not address a matter of public concern. In another case, she showed deference to prison officials in making security decisions. In an opinion by Judge Sotomayor, the Second Circuit allowed prison officials to restrict a prisoner's mail due to the provocative title of a book, granting officials discretion to limit First Amendment rights for security reasons. Sotomayor also participated in cases involving student speech rights, applying Supreme Court precedents that restrict non-school sponsored speech only if it disrupts school functions. In Guiles v. Marineau, Judge Sotomayor ruled in favor of a student wearing an anti-President Bush T-shirt, stating it did not disrupt the school function. However, in Doninger v. Niehoff, she sided with the school in disciplining a student for off-campus speech that caused disruption. This suggests she does not have a clear preference between student free speech rights and school discipline. In her first term, she will review Salazar v. Buono, a case involving a challenge to a Latin cross display in Mojave National Preserve. The case involves a Latin cross display on federal land within the Preserve, with questions on standing to challenge the display and the validity of a land transfer to a private entity to address Establishment Clause concerns. Sotomayor's past opinions on religious freedom were not controversial. Judge Sotomayor authored a dissent in a case involving the scope of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). She argued that the court misapplied RFRA and violated judicial restraint principles by applying it in a dispute between private parties. Judge Sotomayor agreed with other circuits on the ministerial exception to anti-discrimination laws for religious organizations. The issue of religious organizations' hiring independence, even if it violates anti-discrimination laws, has not yet reached the Supreme Court. The Department of Justice under the Bush administration used RFRA to protect religious organizations' hiring decisions, claiming anti-discrimination laws burdened their religious exercise. The debate over religious organizations' hiring rights, especially when receiving public funding, remains controversial. An organization received public funding for social service programs. Judge Sotomayor wrote opinions in prisoner free exercise cases, favoring the prisoners. Free exercise cases require a sincere religious belief and a substantial burden on that belief. Judge Sotomayor emphasized the importance of using a subjective definition of religion in evaluating beliefs in prisoner free exercise cases. She argued that the freedom to exercise religious beliefs should not be contingent on the objective truth of those beliefs. Sotomayor also discussed the current circuit split on applying the substantial burden test in such cases but did not express a preference. The standards for measuring a substantial burden are a central issue in a non-prisoner case before the Court. In a non-prisoner case before the Court, Judge Sotomayor addressed the issue of substantial burden in relation to religious beliefs. She rejected a narrow definition and emphasized the importance of whether the belief is central to the individual's practice of religion. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. In Heller, the Court declared three provisions of the District of Columbia's Firearms Control Regulation Act unconstitutional, affirming the right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. The decision raised questions about the standard of scrutiny for gun laws and whether the Second Amendment applies to the states, a topic extensively debated in post-Heller cases. The Court's previous rulings in United States v. Cruikshank and Presser v. Illinois held that the Second Amendment does not constrain state law, but these decisions were made before modern incorporation principles. The Court in Heller briefly discussed the issue of incorporation, noting that previous cases held the Second Amendment only applied to the federal government. However, it could be interpreted that the Court may support applying modern incorporation principles to the Second Amendment. Since Heller, three federal appellate circuits have addressed the application of the Second Amendment. Three federal appellate circuits have addressed whether the Second Amendment applies to the states. In Maloney v. Rice, the plaintiff challenged a New York law on nunchukas, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. The court, citing Presser v. Illinois, held that the state law did not violate the Second Amendment as it only applies to federal limitations on the right to bear arms. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Nordyke v. King held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment against states and local governments, citing three doctrinal ways for incorporation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit incorporated the Second Amendment under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stating that the right is deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition. This decision was made in the case of National Rifle Ass'n of America v. City of Chicago and Village of Oak Park on June 2, 2009. The Seventh Circuit, like the Second Circuit, ruled that the Second Amendment does not apply to the states. They emphasized the importance of Supreme Court decisions in the case. Judge Sotomayor will participate in a case involving the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The case will address the constitutionality of a federal statute regarding the civil commitment of \"sexually dangerous\" individuals. The Supreme Court may limit the application of a statute for civil commitment of \"sexually dangerous\" individuals, as most sexual violence crimes violate state, not federal law. Judge Sotomayor addressed commerce clause issues in the Second Circuit, including a case where a mayor was convicted for soliciting sex with minors using interstate communication facilities. The Giordana case analyzed the constitutionality of using interstate commerce to transmit contact information for illegal sexual activity involving minors. The Supreme Court's Commerce Clause analysis in United States v. Lopez identified three categories of regulation, including regulation of instrumentalities of commerce. Lopez struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act for regulating possession of firearms in school zones. The Court in Lopez found that the Gun-Free School Zones Act did not have a substantial effect on commerce and did not regulate interstate commerce. The analysis focused on the \"effect\" category of Commerce Clause analysis, not the \"channels\" or \"instrumentalities\" of commerce categories. In the case of Giordana, Judge Sotomayor did not address the alternative line of analysis regarding regulation and commercial activity in the highly regulated interstate instrumentality of the telephone network. This alternative line of reasoning was not considered relevant in another case decided by the Second Circuit, United States v. Harris, which involved the possession of child pornography transported in interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has not adopted changes to its Commerce Clause doctrine related to the transportation of pornography in interstate commerce. Other circuits have found that regulating mere possession of pornography without commercial activity is insufficient under the Commerce Clause. The Court's decision in Gonzales v. does not support these changes. The Court's decision in Gonzales v. Raich suggests that a prohibition against possession of illegal contraband may fall within the Necessary and Proper Clause. Judge Sotomayor's decision in Harris did not directly address the alternative line of cases striking down 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), but instead relied on prior Second Circuit precedent. In United States v. Holston, the Second Circuit upheld a prohibition on production of pornographic depictions, with Judge Sotomayor noting no distinction between possession and production for Commerce Clause analysis. In recent years, the Supreme Court has focused on cases involving national security and executive authority in conflicts with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Judge Sotomayor's views on national security have garnered interest, as she may play a crucial role in future Supreme Court decisions. However, her opinions do not clearly reveal her judicial philosophy on executive authority in national security matters. Judge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on executive authority in national security matters remains unclear. She has heard only a few cases related to national security during her time with the Second Circuit. In Cassidy v. Chertoff, she upheld suspicionless searches for commuter ferry passengers' baggage to deter terrorist attacks. Additionally, she joined a decision in 2008 that struck down provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act on First Amendment grounds. These cases offer limited insight into her broader stance on national security issues. Judge Sotomayor's civil rights rulings show a mix of decisions in discrimination cases, with no clear pattern detected. In Ricci v. DeStafano, she was involved in a case of alleged reverse discrimination by white firefighters. In Ricci v. DeStafano, a case involving allegations of reverse discrimination by white firefighters, Justice Sotomayor did not issue a written opinion. The Second Circuit panel she was on affirmed the district court's decision, which was later overturned by the Supreme Court. The case involved city officials in New Haven, Connecticut declining to certify a promotional test where black and Hispanic firefighters performed poorly compared to white firefighters, leading to a lawsuit claiming discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. City officials in New Haven, Connecticut defended their actions in Ricci v. DeStafano, arguing they were trying to comply with Title VII by refusing to certify test results with a disparate impact on minority firefighters. The district court ruled in favor of the city, stating that their motivation to avoid promoting based on racially disparate test results did not constitute discriminatory intent under Title VII or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court rejected the plaintiffs' Title VII claim and equal protection claim in Ricci v. DeStafano, ruling that the city's actions to remedy the disparate impact of the test did not constitute discrimination. The Second Circuit panel affirmed the district court's decision, stating that the city was fulfilling its obligations under Title VII by invalidating the test results. The Supreme Court recently reversed the Second Circuit's decision in a case involving reverse discrimination allegations. The Court established a new standard for evaluating intentional discrimination to avoid disparate impact liability under Title VII. Judge Sotomayor ruled in the case before this standard was in effect. Judge Sotomayor's decision in Ricci was made before a new standard for evaluating intentional discrimination was established by the Supreme Court. In other civil rights cases, she has ruled in favor of parties claiming discrimination, such as in Raniola v. Bratton where she reversed a lower court's dismissal of sex discrimination claims made by a female police officer. Judge Sotomayor examined evidence of verbal abuse, sex-based disparate treatment, and workplace sabotage in Raniola v. Bratton. She concluded that there was enough evidence for a jury to find that the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment and retaliated against for complaining. The case was remanded for trial, leaving the final decision to a jury. In Cruz v. Coach Stores, Judge Sotomayor upheld most of the plaintiff's claims of race and sex discrimination but reversed the district court's decision on the hostile work environment claim. The plaintiff provided evidence of racial slurs and sexual harassment by her supervisor, leading to a genuine dispute on this claim. Judge Sotomayor upheld most of the plaintiff's claims of race and sex discrimination in Cruz v. Coach Stores. She reversed the district court's decision on the hostile work environment claim, citing evidence of racial slurs and physical and verbal sexual harassment by the supervisor. Sotomayor emphasized the threatening nature of the supervisor's behavior, leading to a remand for trial on the hostile work environment claim. In Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education, Judge Sotomayor dissented from the majority's ruling that the plaintiff's claim of a discriminatory transfer lacked merit. The plaintiff alleged intentional discrimination through deliberate indifference to racial hostility in the classroom and a mid-year transfer from first grade to kindergarten. All three judges agreed there was insufficient evidence for racial hostility, but Sotomayor disagreed on the discriminatory transfer claim. Judge Sotomayor dissented in Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education, believing the plaintiff's claim of a discriminatory transfer had merit. She found evidence of disparate treatment based on race, leading her to conclude that a trial on the transfer issue was warranted. In contrast to other cases, she has also ruled against claims of discrimination in some civil rights opinions. In Williams v. R.H. Donnelly Co., Judge Sotomayor affirmed the district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the employer in a case involving race and sex discrimination claims by a black female employee. The plaintiff failed to prove she was qualified for promotions, show discrimination in the refusal to create a management position, or establish a denial of transfer as adverse employment action. In Norville v. Staten Island University Hospital, Judge Sotomayor rejected race and age discrimination claims by an older black female nurse. She found insufficient evidence for race discrimination and that the hospital's actions were not a pretext for age discrimination. In Washington v. County of Rockland, a group of black corrections officers alleged various claims against prison officials. In Washington v. County of Rockland, black corrections officers alleged race discrimination by prison officials in pursuing disciplinary proceedings. Judge Sotomayor affirmed that the claims were filed too late, citing statute of limitations. In Hankins v. Lyght, a minister's Age Discrimination in Employment Act claim was considered, with a panel majority reversing the district court's dismissal based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In Hankins v. Lyght, a minister's Age Discrimination in Employment Act claim was reconsidered under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) standards. Judge Sotomayor dissented, arguing that RFRA did not apply to the dispute and criticized the majority for examining RFRA's constitutionality. She disagreed with the majority's legal conclusions regarding the applicability of the statute, suggesting that the ADEA does not apply to employment discrimination lawsuits by clergy members or other employees serving primarily religious roles. Judge Sotomayor believed that remanding the case was a wasteful expenditure of judicial resources. Judge Sotomayor's civil rights opinions show a balanced approach, as she rejects some claims while accepting others. Her rulings do not indicate a particular sympathy or hostility towards discrimination victims. She examines evidence, applies precedent, and renders verdicts without straying from legal principles. Judge Sotomayor has written decisions on civil rights for individuals with disabilities under federal statutes like the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She addresses discrimination issues without straying from established legal principles. Judge Sotomayor has written decisions on civil rights for individuals with disabilities under federal statutes like the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. She has also decided cases related to the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), generally supporting claims under these statutes but not always ruling in favor of plaintiffs with disabilities. In Bartlett v. New York State Board of Bar Examiners, she anticipated discussions surrounding the ADA Amendments Act. Judge Sotomayor analyzed the ADA Amendments Act in Bartlett v. New York State Board of Bar Examiners, emphasizing that self-accommodations do not negate disability. She highlighted the importance of not defining disability based solely on outcomes, especially for individuals like Dr. Bartlett with learning disabilities who use alternative methods to succeed academically. Sotomayor's examination of statutory language and legal arguments aimed to uphold the overall intent of the ADA. In Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities v. Hartford Board of Education, Judge Sotomayor ruled that the Connecticut Protection and Advocacy system should have access to investigate abuse and neglect at a nonresidential school for children with serious emotional disturbances. She emphasized the importance of protecting the legal and human rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, regardless of specific statutory provisions. Judge Sotomayor's decisions on discrimination related to dyslexia and foreign language requirements were closely examined. She arrived at different rulings on ADA's statute of limitations, considering statutory language, regulations, and guidance. Described as mainstream in K-12 education cases, she will participate in a campaign finance decision on limiting corporate campaign expenditures. This case was ordered to be reargued in 2009. The Court will consider whether to overrule two prior decisions on limits on corporate expenditures and election law. Judge Sotomayor has not written extensively on election law, making it difficult to infer her philosophy in this area. Her approach to statutory interpretation in a case involving the Voting Rights Act revealed careful consideration of facts and reliance on past precedent. In Rivera-Powell v. N.Y. City Board of Elections, Judge Sotomayor's opinion rejected a claim by a judicial candidate regarding ballot removal based on petition irregularities, citing existing case law and precedent to support the decision. Judge Sotomayor's opinion in Rivera-Powell v. N.Y. City Board of Elections determined that the judicial candidate received a pre-deprivation hearing that met due process requirements. Additionally, the candidate had the opportunity for complete judicial review through expedited designation proceedings, satisfying due process. The opinion also rejected a First Amendment claim as being virtually indistinguishable from the due process claim. Judge Sotomayor's opinion in Rivera-Powell v. N.Y. City Board of Elections concluded that the candidate's First Amendment claim was closely tied to the question of procedural adequacy in the electoral process, as she did not challenge specific state laws or regulations. The opinion emphasized that the plaintiff's challenge was not based on the invalidity of laws or regulations but on the alleged illegal application of limitations by the Board of Elections. In Rivera-Powell v. N.Y. City Board of Elections, Judge Sotomayor's opinion emphasized that the plaintiff's First Amendment claim was not based on challenging specific laws or regulations, but on the alleged illegal application of limitations by the Board of Elections. The opinion cautioned against allowing any plaintiff to obtain federal court review of election disputes by adding a First Amendment claim to a due process claim, as it would undermine the court's stance that intervention in \"garden variety\" election disputes is inappropriate. In Hayden v. Pataki, an en banc Second Circuit decision rejected a challenge under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to a New York statute disenfranchising currently incarcerated felons and felons on parole. The VRA does not cover felony disenfranchisement provisions as Congress did not intend for it to apply to such statutes, according to the court in Hayden v. Pataki. Judge Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the VRA should apply to all voting qualifications, including state laws disqualifying certain individuals from voting. Judge Sotomayor's dissent in a case involving state law disqualifying certain individuals from voting expressed deference to Congress. The Second Circuit characterized the case as complex and noted the need for Supreme Court resolution without congressional clarification. The court highlighted conflicting rulings from different circuits on whether the VRA covers felony disenfranchisement, emphasizing the importance of interpreting statutory language. The court analyzed the broad language of Section 2 of the VRA and concluded that Congress did not intend to include felony disenfranchisement within its coverage. Judge Sotomayor dissented, emphasizing deference to Congress in interpreting the statute. Judge Sotomayor dissented, stating that the Voting Rights Act clearly applies to all 'voting qualifications' and that the New York felony disenfranchisement law disqualifies a specific group from voting. She emphasized the duty of judges to follow the law without questioning its plain terms and criticized the majority's reliance on legislative history. Judge Sotomayor dissented, emphasizing that the Voting Rights Act applies to all 'voting qualifications' and criticized the majority's reliance on legislative history. She pointed out the absence of explicit Congressional statements on felony disenfranchisement laws and stated that Congress should make any necessary changes instead of courts. Additionally, she has addressed issues related to abortion, such as foreign funding restrictions on nonprofit organizations and forced abortions in asylum applications. In the context of asylum applications, Judge Sotomayor showed concern for precedent and adherence to legal standards. In Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush, the Second Circuit considered a challenge to the Mexico City Policy by a nonprofit organization promoting reproductive rights. The policy restricted U.S. government funds for foreign organizations that perform or promote abortion, limiting freedom of speech and association. City Policy discouraged foreign NGOs from collaborating due to abortion concerns. Second Circuit upheld dismissal of CRLP's claim, citing First Amendment rights. Judge Sotomayor referenced Planned Parenthood case, stating it controls the current case. No Supreme Court precedent alters its value. The Second Circuit upheld the dismissal of CRLP's claim, citing First Amendment rights and referencing the Planned Parenthood case. The court reasoned that a court can proceed directly to the merits of a case without addressing jurisdiction if a similar constitutional challenge has already been rejected. The Mexico City Policy was found not to implicate any constitutional rights. Domestic nonprofit organizations can use their own funds for abortion-related activities abroad. The decision not to collaborate with CRLP due to their acceptance of U.S. government funds did not violate the constitution. In Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, the Second Circuit reviewed BIA's denial of asylum applications for unmarried partners of individuals forced to have abortions in China. The BIA concluded that only spouses, not unmarried partners, could qualify for asylum under federal immigration law. The Second Circuit reviewed the BIA's interpretation of \u00a7 601(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to determine if it was entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC. This involved assessing whether the definition of \"refugee\" encompassed individuals who were forced to undergo abortion or sterilization. The Second Circuit reviewed the BIA's interpretation of \u00a7 601(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to determine if it was entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC. The court held that unmarried partners of individuals threatened with forced abortion or involuntary sterilization were not eligible for asylum, as Congress had unambiguously defined who may be deemed a refugee for asylum purposes. The Second Circuit ruled that individuals threatened with forced abortion or involuntary sterilization do not automatically qualify for refugee status, including their spouses and unmarried partners. Judge Sotomayor criticized the majority opinion for lacking judicial restraint. Judge Sotomayor criticized the majority opinion for not focusing on the limited question of whether the BIA's denial of asylum to unmarried partners of women forced into abortions or sterilization was unreasonable. She argued that Congress did not specify the level of harm required for persecution under asylum protection, and the BIA's interpretation should be respected if reasonable. Sotomayor questioned why forced abortion or sterilization was considered persecution only for the individual undergoing the procedure and not their spouse. Judge Sotomayor criticized the majority opinion for not focusing on the limited question of whether the BIA's denial of asylum to unmarried partners of women forced into abortions or sterilization was unreasonable. She argued that Congress did not specify the level of harm required for persecution under asylum protection, and the BIA's interpretation should be respected if reasonable. Sotomayor questioned why forced abortion or sterilization was considered persecution only for the individual undergoing the procedure and not their spouse. Forced abortion can be devastating for both spouses, akin to the killing of a child, and the unique biological nature of pregnancy should be considered in asylum cases. The immigration judge and BIA denied the petitioner's asylum application based on the belief that IUD implantation did not constitute persecution. Judge Sotomayor remanded the case to the BIA to clarify their position on whether forced IUD insertion can be considered persecution. Judge Sotomayor criticized the BIA for not clarifying whether the involuntary insertion of an IUD constitutes persecution, noting the lack of guidance for asylum applicants. She also authored two FOIA opinions upholding government record withholding based on Supreme Court precedent. Judge Sotomayor's opinions primarily focused on FOIA exemptions 5 and 6, regarding inter- and intra-agency memoranda and disclosures invading personal privacy. She noted that FOIA exemptions should be narrowly construed based on Supreme Court precedent. FOIA's Exemption 5, as interpreted by Judge Sotomayor, includes the deliberative process privilege and attorney work-product privilege to protect advice, recommendations, and litigation strategies from disclosure. The privileges aim to promote candid discussions, prevent premature disclosure, and ensure agencies are judged by their final decisions. In Tigue v. Department of Justice, Judge Sotomayor ruled that a memorandum prepared by an Assistant United States Attorney for a commission reviewing the IRS's Criminal Investigations Department was protected by the deliberative process privilege under FOIA Exemption 5. The memorandum was considered an inter-agency communication between the U.S. Attorney's office and the IRS. In Tigue v. Department of Justice, a memorandum prepared for a commission reviewing the IRS's Criminal Investigations Department was protected by the deliberative process privilege under FOIA Exemption 5. The court found that the memorandum, prepared for use by the commission in assisting the IRS in decision making, fell within the pre-decisional prong of Exemption 5. It was not exempt from disclosure as inter-agency or intra-agency communication. In Sears, Roebuck & Co., an agency may need to disclose a document if it's expressly adopted or incorporated in a final opinion. Judge Sotomayor found that minor references to a memo in a report didn't constitute adoption in a final opinion, preserving the deliberative process privilege. The memo wasn't considered a final opinion as it wasn't written by IRS officials. In Wood v. FBI, Judge Sotomayor also upheld the attorney work-product privilege for a prosecution memorandum under Exemption 5 of FOIA. In Department of State v. Washington Post Co., the term \"similar files\" has a broad meaning and applies to detailed government records on an individual. Exemption 6 requires a balancing of private and public interests. In Wood, Judge Sotomayor used a two-part test to determine if Exemption 6 protected documents containing names of government investigators. In Department of State v. Washington Post Co., Exemption 6 requires balancing public's need for information against individual's privacy interest. Judge Sotomayor's opinion concluded that any personal information in files similar to medical or personnel files is subject to this balancing analysis. The court considered the investigators' privacy interest against possible harassment and embarrassment, weighed against the public's interest in shedding light on an agency's performance. Judge Sotomayor's opinion in a case involving the disclosure of investigators' identities concluded that the public's interest in knowing their names was minimal and did not significantly contribute to understanding the agency's performance. The Court has granted certiorari in two Florida cases to examine juvenile life imprisonment without parole and the Sixth Amendment rights regarding deportation consequences and confrontation clause in criminal cases. The confrontation clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right to confront the preparer of a forensic laboratory analysis certificate introduced as evidence in trial. Judge Sotomayor's participation in a upcoming case could potentially impact the recent Melendez-Diaz decision. The Court will also examine whether the Fifth Amendment requires police officers to advise a defendant of his right to counsel during questioning. The Court will review decisions on the right to habeas corpus and interpret federal criminal statutes during its 2009 term, including cases on the \"honest services\" provision in the federal mail fraud statute and the RICO statute. Judge Sotomayor has ruled on these matters. Judge Sotomayor has ruled on criminal cases as an appellate judge, including cases involving the Fourth Amendment and the exclusionary rule. Some speculate she may lean towards ruling in favor of police or prosecutors, but her opinions on the Second Circuit show a mix of rulings for and against the government. She has also written dissenting opinions when in disagreement with her panel colleagues. Judge Sotomayor's appellate opinions in criminal justice cases demonstrate her strong adherence to precedent, particularly in cases involving the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment provides protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring a reasonableness inquiry when the government invades privacy or interferes with possessory interests. While probable cause and a warrant are generally required, courts may balance reasonableness in certain circumstances, such as when a \"special need\" is demonstrated. During her time on the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor wrote opinions on Fourth Amendment cases, focusing on the reasonableness of searches and seizures. In cases like United States v. Gori and N.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut, she dissented for stronger protection against unreasonable searches. In Gori, she argued for stricter limits on police actions based on informant tips. The officers conducted a full search of the apartment after obtaining consent from the occupants. The appeal questioned whether the Payton v. New York case applied, which established a heightened standard for police entry into a home. The majority ruled that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement did not apply because the occupants had opened the door, exposing the interior to the officers. Judge Sotomayor dissented in a case involving strip searches of adolescent girls in a juvenile detention facility, arguing against the majority's reliance on the \"special needs\" doctrine for upholding the searches. She emphasized the importance of protecting the home under the Fourth Amendment. Judge Sotomayor disagreed with using the \"special needs\" doctrine to justify strip searches of adolescent girls in a juvenile detention facility. She emphasized the Fourth Amendment's protection of privacy rights, citing a case where she upheld the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures even in government roles. In a case involving unreasonable searches and seizures, Judge Sotomayor applied a Supreme Court precedent to justify a government search of an employee's office computer. She emphasized the employee's reasonable expectation of privacy but deemed the search justified due to suspicions of misuse. In another case, Cassidy v. Chertoff, she showed deference to government actions in the context of national security, upholding the U.S. Coast Guard's security measures, including searches of passengers' belongings on specified vessels. In a case involving searches on ferry passengers' belongings, Judge Sotomayor applied the special needs doctrine, ruling that the government's interest in the searches outweighed privacy concerns. In another case, United States v. Howard, she upheld a warrantless search based on probable cause from phone calls discussing cocaine. The exclusionary rule is a remedy for Fourth Amendment violations, prohibiting the use of evidence obtained from an unconstitutional search or seizure. The good-faith exception, introduced in United States v. Leon, allows evidence if police acted with \"objectively reasonable reliance\" on a later invalidated warrant. Arizona v. Evans extended this exception to evidence obtained after an arrest based on a valid warrant that was not shown to be quashed. Judge Sotomayor authored opinions that some say expanded precedents. Judge Sotomayor applied the good-faith exception in United States v. Falso, allowing the prosecution to use evidence obtained from a search warrant granted without sufficient probable cause. Judge Sotomayor applied the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule in United States v. Falso, allowing the prosecution to use evidence obtained from a search warrant granted without sufficient probable cause. The court held the warrant invalid due to lack of evidence linking Falso to the illegal activity, but allowed the evidence to be used in Falso's conviction based on the officers' good faith actions. Judge Sotomayor applied the good-faith exception in United States v. Falso, allowing evidence from a search warrant without sufficient probable cause to convict Falso. In a previous case, United States v. Santa, an officer mistakenly arrested Santa based on an invalid warrant, leading to the discovery of crack cocaine on Santa's person. In Santa, Judge Sotomayor ruled that the exclusionary rule could not bar evidence seized during an arrest without probable cause. This decision has been compared to the Supreme Court case United States v. Herring, but there are key distinctions between the two cases. The court's holding in Santa, as explained by Judge Sotomayor, emphasizes the difference between judicial errors and police errors, contrasting with the case of Herring where the error was committed by police officers. Both opinions highlight the distinction between errors made by judicial branch personnel and police, noting that the exclusionary rule historically aims to deter police misconduct. Judge Sotomayor's approach to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is uncertain based on her past cases. While she has shown respect for conservative precedents without narrowing them, she also values stare decisis. Her opinions on police immunity cases during her time on the Second Circuit remain ambiguous. In police immunity cases, officers can be immune from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 if their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights. Judge Sotomayor authored opinions granting immunity in cases where the constitutional guarantee was not deemed \"clearly established.\" An example is Smith v. Edwards, where a false arrest claim under \u00a7 1983 was brought by John Smith. Judge Sotomayor applied a Second Circuit precedent regarding a police officer's arrest of Smith for alleged sexual abuse of his daughter. The officer's omission of relevant proceedings in the warrant affidavit was deemed material, but the court did not reach a conclusion on the legitimacy of the allegations. As a result, Smith's \u00a7 1983 claim was dismissed. Judge Sotomayor dismissed Smith's \u00a7 1983 claim due to lack of probable cause, citing a previous case involving police responding to a 911 call and seizing a woman with Downs syndrome without a warrant. The officers were sued for Fourth Amendment violations. The Second Circuit held that officers were entitled to qualified immunity for seizing a person for involuntary hospitalization based on a 911 call indicating danger. In Rolon v. Henneman, Judge Sotomayor ruled that a police officer testifying in a hearing had absolute immunity from civil suits related to the testimony. The Second Circuit held that officers were entitled to immunity for damages arising from the search of a Connecticut town resident's home and arrest. Judge Sotomayor authored opinions denying immunity in some cases. The Second Circuit held that police were immune for searching and arresting Walczyk, but not for searching his mother's home due to \"stale information.\" Judge Sotomayor concurred but disagreed with the court's reasoning on immunity, questioning the two-step approach used. Judge Sotomayor expressed concerns about widening the limits of qualified immunity for police officers, emphasizing the importance of adhering to precedent. In a case involving a protest demonstration by the Onondaga Nation, she issued an opinion that was least favorable to police officers. State police charged into a demonstration, arresting protesters and using excessive force, leading to a \u00a7 1983 claim for violations of First and Fourth Amendment rights. Judge Sotomayor's opinion emphasized the need to consider all circumstances in determining if police force is excessive. Judge Sotomayor's opinions on habeas corpus cases involve various aspects of Sixth Amendment law, showing a recognition of its importance and a willingness to provide defendants with a right to appeal. She relied on Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent in addressing habeas and the Sixth Amendment. Many cases require federal courts to evaluate decisions made by state courts under the \"deference\" provision of the Antiterrorism. Under the \"deference\" provision of the AEDPA, federal courts cannot overturn state judgments easily. They may only do so if the state decision goes against Supreme Court precedent or is applied unreasonably. The Second Circuit has deferred to state court decisions in some cases, like in Galarza v. Keane where the issue was about peremptory challenges to potential jurors. In Galarza v. Keane, the defendant's counsel raised a Batson challenge due to the prosecution striking Hispanic jurors. The trial judge required non-racial explanations for the strikes, which the defense objected to as pretextual. Despite some explanations being credited, all strikes were allowed to stand. Galarza appealed his conviction on equal protection grounds, alleging racially discriminatory jury selection. Judge Sotomayor, in the majority opinion, addressed the issue. Judge Sotomayor found that the trial court failed to fulfill its obligations under Batson in a racially discriminatory manner. The majority deferred to the trial court's findings on some prospective jurors but found deficiencies in the record for three other challenges. Sotomayor's opinion rejected the prosecution's assertion that the defendant was procedurally barred from raising his Batson claim in federal court. In Gilchrist v. O'Keefe, the Second Circuit rejected an inmate's claim of being unconstitutionally deprived of counsel during sentencing. The trial judge refused to appoint a new attorney after the defendant assaulted his previous counsel. The defendant appeared without counsel and received a 48 to 144-month sentence. The court vacated the denial of Galarza's habeas petition and remanded the case to address Batson claims. The defendant in Gilchrist v. O'Keefe received a 48 to 144-month sentence at sentencing. He filed a habeas corpus petition alleging a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Judge Sotomayor's opinion stated that the state court's actions were consistent with Supreme Court precedent, addressing issues of waiver versus forfeiture of constitutional rights. In Gilchrist v. O'Keefe, Judge Sotomayor's opinion addressed the distinction between waiver and forfeiture of constitutional rights. The court found that the state court's ruling on the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was a reasonable application of the law. The court's ruling in Campusano v. United States addressed the defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a notice of appeal. Despite the defendant's plea agreement not allowing an appeal within a certain sentence range, the court emphasized the importance of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and suggested alternative measures instead of denying this right. The defendant, sentenced to 108 months, filed a habeas claim for ineffective assistance of counsel due to failure to file a notice of appeal. Judge Sotomayor ruled that even with a waiver, an attorney must file an appeal if requested, citing the Roe v. Flores-Ortega case. She emphasized the importance of constitutional rights and exceptions to plea waivers. The court remanded the case to determine if Campusano instructed his attorney to file an appeal. Judge Sotomayor's circuit court opinions with international implications include a dissent on the Hague Convention and opinions on civil RICO suits involving foreign governments and tobacco companies. Judge Sotomayor's circuit court opinions with international implications include a dissent on the Hague Convention and opinions on civil RICO suits involving foreign governments and tobacco companies. Her decision on the revenue rule in the Second Circuit was later approved by the Supreme Court. The dissenting opinions show her inclination to bring an international perspective to her analysis. Judge Sotomayor's opinions on international matters, such as the Hague Convention and the revenue rule in the Second Circuit, considered foreign policy and separation of powers concerns. She emphasized the importance of protecting parental rights in cross-border disputes and analyzed foreign case law for guidance. In Croll v. Croll, the Second Circuit interpreted the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction, addressing whether a ne exeat clause confers a right of custody for the non-custodial parent to exercise a right of return. The court ruled that a ne exeat clause does not transform access rights into custody rights under the Convention. The Second Circuit ruled that a ne exeat clause does not grant custody rights under the Hague Convention, leading to the district court lacking jurisdiction to order the child's return to Hong Kong. Judge Sotomayor dissented, stating that the ne exeat clause granted joint custody rights to the father and the Hong Kong court. The Supreme Court denied certiorari. The Hague Convention aims to ensure the prompt return of wrongfully removed children and respect custody and access rights across Contracting States. The Hague Convention aims to ensure the prompt return of wrongfully removed children and respect custody and access rights across Contracting States. The Convention contains a remedy of return only for \"wrongful\" removal or retention of a child, which will be found where the removal or retention is in breach of custody rights. Parents with a right of access and a ne exeat clause have argued that the clause gives them a right to determine a child's place of residence and thus a right of custody for purposes of the Convention. The Croll case involved a custody order from a Hong Kong court in a divorce proceeding. The mother had sole custody with a ne exeat clause preventing the child's removal from Hong Kong without court permission. The mother took the child to New York without the father's knowledge and filed for custody there. The father sought the child's return to Hong Kong under the Hague Convention, which defines \"rights of custody\" based on American dictionary definitions. The court analyzed the term \"rights of custody\" under the Hague Convention, concluding that a ne exeat clause did not confer a joint right to determine the child's residence. Enforcement of such rights would go against the Convention's purposes as it could result in a parent with no duty of care gaining custody. The court cited various sources supporting its decision. The court analyzed the term \"rights of custody\" under the Hague Convention, concluding that a ne exeat clause did not confer a joint right to determine the child's residence. Judge Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the majority mischaracterized the issue and that the ne exeat clause confers \"rights of custody\" under the Convention. She criticized the majority's reliance on local definitions of custody and instead looked to international rules of treaty interpretation. Judge Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's interpretation of custody rights under the Hague Convention, arguing that a ne exeat clause confers \"rights of custody\" and protects the international relocation decisions of parents. She criticized the majority for not recognizing the international nature of the Convention and emphasized the importance of respecting custody rights under different legal systems. Judge Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's interpretation of custody rights under the Hague Convention, emphasizing the international nature of the agreement and the importance of respecting custody rights under different legal systems. She found that the Convention protects custody rights regardless of the number of parents involved and set a precedent for the Second Circuit on an important question regarding the Hague Child Abduction Convention. Her analysis was consistent with decisions from foreign courts, highlighting the need to fully explore the Convention's meaning and its international character. Judge Sotomayor disagreed with the majority's interpretation of custody rights under the Hague Convention, emphasizing the international nature of the agreement and the importance of respecting custody rights under different legal systems. She found that the ne exeat clause could be the basis for finding a custody right, noting a split in the circuits on this issue. The issue also remains unsettled internationally, with most case law supporting the view that a custody right is conferred. The Supreme Court has agreed to review the Fifth Circuit decision in Abbott v. Abbott regarding custody rights under the Hague Convention, with the Justice Department supporting a review. The Department argued that the decision deepens disagreement among circuit courts and deviates from the majority of courts in States parties. Koehler v. Bank of Bermuda involved alienage jurisdiction under federal law. In Koehler v. Bank of Bermuda, the Second Circuit's ruling on alienage jurisdiction was challenged by Judge Sotomayor and later rejected by the Supreme Court. The case involved a U.S. plaintiff and defendants from Bermuda, with the court initially finding alienage jurisdiction lacking. Judge Sotomayor argued for a rehearing to reexamine the flawed position that Bermuda defendants were not considered \"citizens or subjects of a foreign state.\" The Supreme Court's reversal of another Second Circuit ruling highlighted the disagreement in the court's approach. The Second Circuit's ruling in Koehler was based on a previous decision in Matimak Trading Co. v. Khalily, which determined that Bermuda, like Hong Kong, was not considered a \"foreign state\" for diversity jurisdiction purposes. Judge Sotomayor argued for a rehearing, pointing out concerns such as the negative reaction from the United Kingdom and the State Department's advocacy for a different rule to avoid international controversy. Judge Sotomayor criticized the Second Circuit's ruling in Koehler for failing to provide a neutral federal judicial forum for foreign persons. She argued that the historical and contemporary understanding of the terms \"citizen\" and \"subject\" called for a broader interpretation, especially when a country is not recognized as a sovereign state by the State Department. Judge Sotomayor emphasized that Bermuda corporations are subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, aligning with the State Department, Department of Justice, and UK government. She highlighted the importance of alienage jurisdiction in strengthening US relations with foreign countries, especially in the context of complex international relations and global trade. The potential damage to US-UK relations due to the circuit split was also noted. Judge Sotomayor expressed concern about potential damage to US-UK relations and other nations due to a Supreme Court case involving individuals and firms from the British Virgin Islands. She argued against the majority's interpretation, fearing it would deny foreign entities the opportunity to adjudicate their claims in a federal forum and lead to increased international controversy. Judge Sotomayor's concern with international controversy stemmed from the majority approach in the case involving the application of the common law \"revenue rule\" to a civil RICO suit brought by the European Communities. She aimed to avoid obstacles to political and commercial relations between the United States and foreign countries. In General of Canada v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc., the court applied the revenue rule to a civil RICO suit involving smuggling of contraband cigarettes, resulting in loss of revenue for the governments. Judge Sotomayor ruled that the revenue rule applied, barring the plaintiffs' claims. The Supreme Court later vacated the judgment for further consideration in light of a related ruling. Judge Sotomayor upheld the revenue rule in a wire fraud case connected to smuggling liquor into Canada to avoid taxes. The rule protects sovereignty and separation of powers by avoiding interference in foreign tax matters. Judge Sotomayor upheld the revenue rule in a wire fraud case involving tax evasion in Canada, citing the need to protect sovereignty and separation of powers. The rule may conflict with foreign policy choices in tax enforcement, but exceptions can be made if superior law abrogates the rule or if the executive branch consents to the suit. Judge Sotomayor upheld the revenue rule in a wire fraud case involving tax evasion in Canada, citing the need to protect sovereignty and separation of powers. She rejected claims that a subsequent amendment to the RICO statute in the USA PATRIOT Act abrogated the rule, finding that Congress had not shown a clear intent to do so. Additionally, she dismissed plaintiffs' attempts to show the absence of foreign policy concerns, stating that the Executive Branch's awareness of the suit did not constitute consent to the action. In Pasquantino, the Supreme Court had determined that the case was a criminal prosecution by the United States to punish domestic criminal conduct, not to recover a foreign tax liability. Judge Sotomayor upheld the revenue rule in a wire fraud case involving tax evasion in Canada, emphasizing sovereignty and separation of powers. She noted that government prosecutions overcame the issues the rule sought to avoid. In a post-Pasquantino reconsideration, she found that the lack of U.S. government intervention made the revenue rule inapplicable to the civil RICO suit. Judge Sotomayor upheld the revenue rule in a wire fraud case involving tax evasion in Canada, emphasizing sovereignty and separation of powers. She noted that government prosecutions overcame the issues the rule sought to avoid. In a post-Pasquantino reconsideration, she found that the lack of U.S. government intervention made the revenue rule inapplicable to the civil RICO suit. The court dismissed plaintiff arguments, stating that the violation of foreign tax laws and lack of political branch participation justified barring the RICO suit. Judge Sotomayor was reluctant to involve the judiciary in the dispute without clear evidence of political branch involvement. Judge Sotomayor barred the RICO suit based on Second Circuit precedent and showed deference to the executive branch in cases with foreign policy implications. She emphasized the need for clear executive branch intervention and participated in significant immigration law cases during her tenure as a Second Circuit judge. Judge Sotomayor's judicial approach in immigration cases shows deference to agency action unless it exceeds statutory authorization. Asylum can be granted to foreign nationals with a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific criteria. Such cases can make up a significant portion of the Second Circuit's docket. Judge Sotomayor has participated in many panels reviewing denials of asylum in the United States, constituting up to 17% of the Federal Courts of Appeals docket. She has written important Second Circuit opinions on asylum cases, including Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales and Zhang v. Gonzales. Her opinions may seem pro-claimant, but she often remands cases back to the agency instead of directly resolving them. Judge Sotomayor demonstrates deference to agency adjudications by remanding cases for further proceedings instead of directly resolving them. This stance was evident in her concurrence in Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, where she disagreed with the Second Circuit's broader holding on refugee status for spouses of forced sterilization victims. Unmarried partners qualified for automatic refugee status, Justice Sotomayor will hear three cases involving labor issues, including a dispute over termination for refusing to recant allegations of illegal workers. The Court will also review decisions on due process violations by the National Railroad Adjustment Board and an arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement. In a Ninth Circuit decision, parties were compelled to arbitrate a dispute over contract formation. Judge Sotomayor wrote an opinion in a high-profile labor case, Clarett v. NFL, where the Second Circuit upheld the NFL's three-year eligibility rule, protected by the non-statutory labor exemption to antitrust laws. Judge Sotomayor considered the petitioner's claim in light of Second Circuit decisions involving the non-statutory exemption and the concerted activities of a professional sports league. The Second Circuit maintained that relationships between sports leagues and players are governed by collective bargaining agreements, protected by federal labor laws, not antitrust laws. The Second Circuit upheld the NFL's three-year eligibility rule, citing the importance of collective bargaining and freedom of contract in labor laws. The Second Circuit upheld the NFL's three-year eligibility rule as a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, rejecting the argument that antitrust law should override federal labor law. Judge Sotomayor has few environmental decisions, including Riverkeeper, Inc. v. US EPA, addressing water withdrawal by power plants. The Clean Water Act requires cooling water intake structures at power plants to use the best available technology to minimize environmental impact. The EPA's Phase II Rule, issued in 2004, was challenged for allowing cost-benefit analysis in determining the best technology. The Second Circuit agreed that cost should be a lesser consideration in determining required technology under the Act. Judge Sotomayor emphasized that the Clean Water Act mandates the use of the best available technology at power plants' cooling water intake structures. She argued against cost-benefit analysis, stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost as a primary factor. However, she did allow for limited consideration of costs to determine what technology can be reasonably borne by the industry and to evaluate cost-effectiveness in setting Best Technology Available (BTA) standards. The court remanded the Phase II Rule to EPA for clarification and possible reassessment of Best Technology Available (BTA) standards, specifically regarding the use of cost-benefit analysis. Justice Scalia found that EPA had permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting BTA standards and providing for cost-benefit variances in the Phase II regulations. The decision on \u00a7 1326(b)'s silence allows federal agencies to use cost-benefit analysis. Industry supports this analysis, while environmentalists oppose it. The Entergy majority's approach may lead to more agency use of cost-benefit analysis. A climate change case before the Second Circuit, presided over by Judge Sotomayor, is pending for three years. The Second Circuit is slow in rendering opinions and has a high number of immigration filings. A case involves using common law to reduce CO2 emissions for climate change. In 2004, states, New York City, and environmental groups sued electric utility companies for being top CO2 emitters. The district court dismissed the cases in 2005 on political question grounds. The district court dismissed cases in 2005 on political question grounds, involving common law theory to address modern climate change issues. The Southern District of New York and other courts avoided common law claims on greenhouse gas emissions, citing political question. Justice Sotomayor will review cases on securities law issues in the upcoming term. The Supreme Court will review cases on securities law issues in the upcoming term, including whether a mutual fund's investment adviser charged excessive fees, the constitutionality of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statute of limitations for federal securities law fraud claims. Judge Sotomayor has written opinions in several securities law cases, with a focus on violations of the general antifraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act. Judge Sotomayor's opinions in securities law cases focus on the analysis of statutes and cases, displaying a methodical approach to statutory interpretation. The opinions do not show a bias towards corporations or investors. The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act (SLUSA) was enacted to address perceived failures of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) in curbing securities fraud litigation abuses. SLUSA aimed to prevent plaintiffs from bypassing PSLRA by filing securities fraud cases in state courts, requiring such cases to be brought in federal court under specific criteria. Dabit v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. involved appeals by Merrill Lynch brokers and a customer regarding misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. In Dabit v. Merrill Lynch, plaintiffs alleged biased research and investment recommendations to secure investment banking business. The Second Circuit examined the \"in connection with\" requirement of SLUSA and found it should be interpreted similarly to the Securities Exchange Act's antifraud provision. Judge Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit. The court analyzed past cases to determine that fraud must be \"integral to the purchase and sale of securities\" under the SEC's Rule. Judge Sotomayor's opinion considered the standing of private litigants in antifraud actions and whether SLUSA preempts state law claims. Congress enacted SLUSA to ensure that class actions meeting the purchaser-seller requirement fall under federal jurisdiction. The court held that class actions meeting the purchaser-seller requirement are subject to federal securities laws. The Dabit plaintiff, being a holder and not a buyer or seller of securities, was not preempted by SLUSA. In contrast, the Seventh Circuit in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust stated that SLUSA is broad and does not allow for litigation under state law for securities transactions. The Supreme Court unanimously vacated the Second Circuit's judgment, rejecting its narrow interpretation of \"in connection with\" in securities class actions. Congress was aware of the broad construction of this phrase when enacting federal securities laws. The Supreme Court overturned the Second Circuit's narrow interpretation of \"in connection with\" in securities class actions, emphasizing Congress's intent for a broad construction of the phrase in federal securities laws. This interpretation aligns with the goal of preventing State private securities class action lawsuits from undermining the objectives of the 1995 Reform Act. The Supreme Court overturned the Second Circuit's narrow interpretation of \"in connection with\" in securities class actions, emphasizing Congress's intent for a broad construction of the phrase in federal securities laws to prevent State private securities class action lawsuits from undermining the objectives of the 1995 Reform Act. The Court stated that the identity of the plaintiffs does not determine whether the compliant alleges fraud \"in connection with the purchase or sale\" of securities, and fraudulent manipulation of stock prices qualifies as such. In Press v. Quick & Reilly, Inc., plaintiffs alleged violations of section 10(b) Rule 10b-5 due to broker-dealers making automatic sweeps of clients' uninvested funds into poor performing money market funds. In a securities fraud case, the Second Circuit found that any omissions in fund prospectuses were not material. In another case, Joseph Falcone appealed a conviction for trading on insider information obtained from a stockbroker acquaintance. The defendant was convicted of insider trading based on the misappropriation theory, which does not require defrauding buyers or sellers. He argued that a Supreme Court decision undermined the lower court's ruling. The Second Circuit, led by Judge Sotomayor, upheld the lower court's decision. The Second Circuit, led by Judge Sotomayor, affirmed Falcone's conviction for insider trading based on the misappropriation theory. The court held that Falcone had misappropriated material nonpublic information, as outlined in O'Hagan, and that the government had provided sufficient evidence to prove its case. In In re NYSE Specialists, lead plaintiff investors appealed the lower court's judgment granting NYSE's motion to dismiss claims of unfair regulation and misrepresentations under Rule 10b-5. Second Circuit affirmed NYSE's immunity for regulatory failures but vacated ruling on plaintiffs' standing for misrepresentations. The court affirmed NYSE's immunity for regulatory failures under Rule 10b-5 but vacated the ruling on plaintiffs' standing for misrepresentations. The court stated that the SEC has oversight power to supervise and discipline the NYSE. The lower court's decision on plaintiffs' lack of standing under Rule 10b-5 was overturned, allowing a cause of action against the issuer of the security for false statements. The Second Circuit affirmed the lower court decision regarding the fair funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, stating that the SEC's distribution plan fairly and reasonably distributed the limited Fair Fund proceeds among potential claimants. Judge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy in taxation cases remains unclear. In a Second Circuit case, Judge Sotomayor's reasoning was disagreed with by the Supreme Court regarding the deductibility of investment-advice fees for a trust. The issue was whether the fees were fully deductible or only partially deductible as miscellaneous itemized deductions. There was a split among circuits on this issue. Judge Sotomayor disagreed with the Fourth and Federal Circuits on the deductibility of investment-advice fees, stating that the provision only applied to expenses that could be incurred by an individual. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, supported this interpretation. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Second Circuit's decision on investment advice fees but rejected its reasoning. The Court emphasized that the focus should be on whether fees would customarily be incurred by an individual, not just if they could be. This interpretation aligns with other circuits and avoids rendering parts of the statute superfluous. The Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit's decision on investment advice fees but rejected its reasoning. The Court focused on whether fees would customarily be incurred by an individual, not just if they could be. Both courts performed a statutory interpretation analysis, yet reached different conclusions on the term \"would\" in the statute. Judge Sotomayor's interpretation, not pursued by either party or other appellate courts, aimed to simplify the tax statute. Judge Sotomayor's analysis aimed to simplify the tax statute, which the government later adopted as the preferred interpretation for easier administration. However, her interpretation was criticized by the Supreme Court for being inconsistent with common meanings of terms in the statute. Additionally, she wrote the opinion in Malesko v. Correctional Services Corporation, a Second Circuit decision that was later reversed by the Supreme Court. The Second Circuit allowed claims against federal officials for violating the Fifth and Eighth Amendments. In Malesko, a contractor of the Federal Bureau of Prisons caused harm to a plaintiff with a known heart condition. The court distinguished between federal agencies and government contractors in Bivens actions. Judge Sotomayor's opinion in the Malesko case suggests a different approach to Bivens actions compared to the Supreme Court's emphasis on deterrence goals. She views providing a remedy for constitutional violations as a more important goal of Bivens liability. This contrasts with the Court's focus on deterring wrongdoing by individuals. Additionally, her opinion would have expanded Bivens by allowing plaintiffs to sue government contractors for damages based on their employees' actions. The Supreme Court has not extended Bivens liability to new contexts or defendants since 1980. Some commentators suggest a desire to abolish Bivens actions, but this may overstate the significance of the Malesko case. Four other Circuits allowed Bivens actions against contractors before Malesko, and the opinion mainly focuses on issues other than the importance of Bivens liability goals."
