    "content": "On November 7, 2007, the container ship Cosco Busan collided with the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, causing a significant fuel spill. The accident was likely due to pilot error, with heavy fog playing a role in the delayed departure from the Oakland pier. The San Francisco Vessel Traffic Service contacted the pilot moments before the collision, but it was too late to prevent the incident. Investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident. The Cosco Busan accident in 2007 was likely caused by pilot error, with heavy fog contributing to the delayed departure from the Oakland pier. Despite accidents being rare due to the skill of pilots and navigation support services, the spill had a significant public impact. Tanker safety improvements since the Exxon Valdez spill have reduced oil spills, with the Cosco Busan having a fuel capacity larger than most non-tank vessels calling at U.S. ports. U.S. ports have vessels with fuel capacities over 50,000 barrels, and some over 70,000 barrels. Non-tank vessels carry a small amount of fuel oil, but a spill could still cause environmental and economic damage. The Cosco Busan spill raised concerns about pilot proficiency and VTS oversight. Congress has held hearings and introduced legislation in response to the accident, with questions about pilot oversight and VTS operations. The report discusses the role of pilots and VTSs in safe navigation in U.S. harbors, focusing on preventing ship collisions and groundings. It reviews controversies over pilot association governance, VTS-pilot interaction, and proposals for improving harbor navigation safety. The report does not cover oil spill response or legal liabilities. The report focuses on ship collisions and groundings in harbors, highlighting the differences in navigation skills required in harbors versus at sea. It discusses the challenges posed by land, shallow water, other vessels, and man-made structures in harbors, as well as the impact of tide and river currents. The report emphasizes the hydrodynamics peculiar to harbors, such as water displacement, under-keel clearance, and the difficulty of stopping a fully loaded ship in a channel with a following tide. Harbor pilots face increasing challenges due to larger ships and higher port traffic. In 2005, ocean-going vessels over 10,000 dwt made over 61,000 U.S. port calls. Container ship calls at U.S. ports increased by 14% from 2001 to 2006, with larger ships like the Cosco Busan seeing a 241% increase in port calls. The Cosco Busan, a fifth-generation container ship, has a capacity of 5,500 TEUs and is over 130 feet wide and 901 feet long. Unlike oil tankers, these large container ships require harbor pilots for navigation. Ships carrying dangerous cargo have increased in number, with LNG and LPG carrier calls rising by 31% and tanker calls by nearly 10% from 2001 to 2005. Concerns arise over older ships still in operation due to the shipping boom, especially in the dry bulk sector. Many ships transiting U.S. harbors may be too large for their designated routes. Ships in U.S. harbors may be too big for their designated routes, leading to the need for deepening shipping channels. Economic factors drive dredging more than safety concerns, with ships often passing closely in maneuvers like \"Texas Chicken\" to navigate narrow channels. The \"can opener\" structure in the Port of Long Beach poses a risk to ships due to its grounding on the channel edges. Cargo ships prioritize deep-sea speed over maneuverability in restricted waters, leading to challenges for pilots. As ships grow larger, their rudders are getting smaller, impacting controllability in narrow channels. Cruise ships, on the other hand, prioritize slow-speed maneuverability over deep-sea speed. Maritime pilots are hired by ocean carriers to navigate ships through harbors, especially in narrow channels and shallow waters where controllability is affected by crosswinds. They provide instructions to helmsmen and may direct tugboats during slow-speed maneuvering. Maritime pilots are responsible for navigating ships through harbors, providing instructions to helmsmen, and may direct tugboats during slow-speed maneuvering. The pilot is in charge of navigating the ship through the harbor, while the captain retains ultimate responsibility for its safe passage. The pilot boards the ship with a laptop containing charts and ship tracking technology, and the captain provides navigation particulars such as draft and maneuvering characteristics. Maritime pilots use a \"pilot card\" for communication with captains. Hiring a pilot is compulsory in most U.S. ports, but voluntary in some. Shipping lines often take on a pilot for liability reasons. On the West and Gulf Coasts, the pilot navigates the ship to the dock, while on the East Coast, a \"docking pilot\" may take over for docking. Docking pilots are usually former tugboat captains. In Louisiana, shipping lines may need to hire harbor pilots and one or two \"river pilots\" depending on how far up the Mississippi River the ship is going. Large ships may require two pilots. Pilots may be maritime academy graduates with sea experience or apprentices under senior pilots. New pilots start with smaller vessels and must pass exams before advancing. Maritime pilots must have experience piloting ships of various sizes before advancing. There are state and federal licenses for pilots, with state licenses typically requiring more experience. Pilots work as independent contractors in associations, assigned to ships on a rotating basis. Pilot associations are regulated by state boards or city governments. Pilot boards, regulated by state or city government, consist of members from the maritime industry and the public. They oversee pilot qualifications, set fees based on vessel size and distance, and monitor pilot performance. Pilot associations operate as local monopolies, selecting pilots based on traffic needs. Associations have jurisdiction over foreign trade ship pilotage. The federal government has jurisdiction over pilotage of ships in the domestic trade, such as tank vessels carrying oil from Alaska to California. Sea captains in domestic trade carry a Coast Guard pilot's endorsement on their license, allowing them to pilot the vessel in harbors. Federal pilot authorization is common, with some independent federal pilots offering services at specific ports. Ship captains must obtain a pilot license for each port they frequent. To pilot ships in domestic trade, captains must obtain a federal license for each port they visit. State and local pilots licensed for foreign trade vessels also hold a federal license. Federal pilot's license is granted to anyone who qualifies, unlike state licenses which have limitations. The Coast Guard cannot revoke a pilot's license for misconduct while piloting a foreign trade vessel, as the pilot acts under state authority. Conversely, states cannot revoke a pilot's license for misconduct while piloting a vessel in domestic trade. The Coast Guard can levy penalties for negligent vessel operation, with fines up to $25,000 for negligence and a class A misdemeanor for gross negligence. The dual regulatory structure of piloting dates back to the mid-1800s when Congress began to play a role in pilotage after the introduction of steam vessels. In 1871, Congress mandated federally licensed pilots for steam powered ships in coastal trade, preventing states from requiring state pilots. A 1912 Supreme Court decision established federal jurisdiction over domestic trade ships' pilotage, while foreign trade ships fell under state jurisdiction. This regulatory structure remains today, raising questions about oversight based on safety. The NTSB questions the Coast Guard's ability to ensure safety without direct oversight of pilotage for most U.S. vessel transits. The NTSB questions the Coast Guard's ability to ensure safety without direct oversight of pilotage for most U.S. vessel transits, especially with the trend of substituting Alaskan oil with imported oil. Captains of coastwise trade vessels gain expertise in navigating U.S. ports more frequently compared to captains on international voyages. State pilot associations argue that the geography and nature of maritime traffic vary significantly among ports. Pilot associations argue that their monopoly status is necessary to prevent commercial interests from compromising safety and maintain expertise in safe harbor navigation. They believe that competition among pilots would lead to economic pressures undermining safety standards. State licensed pilots argue for the importance of maintaining their independent contractor status to avoid cost pressures that could affect their judgment. The state pilot system has faced criticism for being a closed profession with allegations of nepotism. A study by the Marine Board of the National Academies highlighted pilots' reluctance to address colleague performance due to social and business relationships. The integrity of pilot oversight was questioned after a ship collision on the Mississippi River. Louisiana amended its piloting regulations to include non-pilots on pilot boards. Criticism of the monopoly structure of the pilot system in Louisiana persists. The Cosco Busan accident raised criticism against the San Francisco Bar Pilots due to a pilot's previous ship grounding incident. Pilotage fees are a point of debate regarding the monopoly structure of pilotage, with concerns about driving business away from ports. The Coast Guard established vessel traffic services (VTS) to assist with safe navigation in many ports. Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) use electronic communication, radar, and surveillance cameras to operate 24/7 in U.S. ports. VTSs are staffed by Coast Guard watchstanders and civilian personnel, with some ports having VTS-like services called Vessel Traffic Information Services (VTIS) provided by maritime exchanges or pilot associations. Maritime exchanges, funded by user fees and port authorities, were originally created to alert ship service providers of pending arrivals. In the 1960s and 1970s, they also provided VHF radio communication and radar systems to prevent collisions. Participation was initially voluntary and unregulated until a ship collision in San Francisco Bay in 1971 prompted Congress to pass regulations. The Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 directed the Coast Guard to establish Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) systems at ports deemed necessary. VTSs were established in various ports in the 1970s and participation became mandatory after the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires ships over 300 gross registered tons to be equipped with Automatic Identification System (AIS) for enhanced harbor traffic monitoring and ship tracking. The Coast Guard is planning to extend shore-side AIS receivers and transmitters nationwide for ships over 300 gross registered tons. AIS transponders electronically transmit ship information, location, speed, and direction for safety and efficiency in communication. The Coast Guard emphasizes non-intrusive VTS communications to pilots or masters, aiming to avoid distractions during critical maneuvers. While AIS technology allows ships to track their location and other vessels, shore-side VTS facilities remain crucial for security. Joint Harbor Operational Centers (JHOCs) have been established to enhance port safety and security. Joint Harbor Operational Centers (JHOCs) were created to improve port security and safety by serving as fusion centers for federal and local law enforcement to share intelligence and coordinate responses. Currently operational at Norfolk, San Diego, Charleston, and Seattle, JHOCs are planned for each major port area to address safety concerns related to increased port traffic and larger ships. In response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Congress implemented dual accountability for ship pilots in Prince William Sound, requiring them to hold both Alaska and federal licenses. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends that state pilots operate under Coast Guard authority to ensure consistent accountability. This would prevent a state-licensed pilot from piloting vessels if their federal license is revoked, emphasizing the need for federal oversight in preventing major marine accidents. The NTSB recommends federal oversight of state pilots to ensure accountability and safety on all Federal waterways. The Coast Guard has sought legislative authority over state-licensed pilots in the past but has not been successful in Congress. This issue was addressed in the Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978. The Port and Tanker Safety Act of 1978 sought federal oversight of state pilots for accountability and safety on Federal waterways. The American Pilots Association opposed the provision, arguing that local pilots were more knowledgeable about harbor conditions than the Coast Guard. Shipping lines supported federal evaluation to ensure uniform excellence nationwide. The Marine Board of the National Academies called for an independent assessment of pilot performance and the creation of a national commission on pilotage to set standards for training and qualifications. The Coast Guard emphasizes that VTS is an advisory service, not a traffic control center. The Coast Guard emphasizes that VTS is an advisory service, providing monitoring of harbor traffic, information to mariners for safe navigation, occasional course recommendations, and rare vessel direction without specific maneuvering orders. VTS involvement in harbor navigation varies depending on harbor circumstances. In harbors with a drawbridge, VTS may enforce a traffic management plan for one-way traffic or procession. VTS is seen as traffic management, not control. Debate exists on whether VTS can operate like ATC, known as \"shore-based pilotage\" or \"remote pilotage.\" Pilots emphasize the irreplaceable role of experienced mariners on board for ship maneuvering. Ship response to commands is influenced by ship characteristics, weather, and water conditions. Pilots must consider cues like wind, tide, and currents for safe navigation. Pilots stress the importance of visual cues and references in ship maneuvering, emphasizing the need for continual evaluation by an on-board mariner. Congress may assess whether VTS should have more control over harbor traffic in bad weather conditions, as the Coast Guard currently lacks standards to judge vessel maneuvering capabilities in constricted waters. Lawmakers may need more scientific information on ship maneuverability in harbor waters as there are no performance standards for ships in shallow, constricted water at slow speed. This lack of standards hinders the Coast Guard from establishing harbor restrictions for ships that may be less controllable in hazardous weather conditions. Establishing these standards could improve pilot training and aid in predicting vessel maneuvering capabilities. Policymakers should consider a systematic method for pilots to share experiences with vessels requiring special attention. The U.S. Coast Guard recommended a systematic method for pilots to share experiences with vessels needing special attention in harbors. Congress may assess the need for Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) in ports with increased traffic, like the Port of Savannah. The Coast Guard is exploring the use of AIS technology to track ships for security reasons. Congress may also consider the safety benefits of this technology. The NTSB recommends establishing a detailed passage plan for vessels navigating harbors to prevent collisions. The plan should include intended course, relevant checkpoints, and contingency plans. This allows the crew to effectively monitor the ship's position and movement. Some accident investigations reveal a lack of communication between pilots and bridge crews, leading to reluctance to challenge the pilot. Bridge Team Management (BTM) emphasizes good communication and teamwork on the bridge, adopted from the airline industry. The Coast Guard has not supported the NTSB's recommendation for detailed passage plans, citing concerns about impinging on the traditional master/pilot relationship. The Coast Guard believes Federal regulations and customary practices apply in master/pilot relationships. A Canadian survey found discrepancies in communication between pilots and masters, with foreign masters relying heavily on pilots for passage plans. The International Maritime Organization recommended that information exchanged between pilots and masters include agreement on passage plans and procedures. Language barriers can be an issue in international shipping operations, with English being the standard language but communication in other languages being possible. The largest source of ship crews is the Philippines due to their English language skills. China, India, Ukraine, and Russia also supply seamen. Congress may need to address language barriers in ship navigation and enforce English proficiency among crews. Consider establishing a database of near misses like in aviation. Congress may need to address concerns about technical expertise in the Coast Guard, particularly in relation to vessel movement control and pilot performance. Some suggest transferring safety functions to a civilian agency for better professional continuity. The Coast Guard has responded with a plan to address these criticisms. The Coast Guard is responding to criticism by increasing civilian positions in the marine safety program, strengthening career paths, and hiring from maritime academies. They argue for synergies between maritime safety and security missions and advocate for these missions to be carried out by the same agency. Legislation has been introduced to give authority to VTS in emergencies and require pilots to use laptop navigational equipment. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007 would require a vessel safety risk assessment for Cook Inlet and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. The Senate version (S. 1892) requires the Coast Guard to study human errors causing oil spills, secure marine transport of hazardous cargo, and report on data deficiencies. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 (H.R. 3352/S. 1582) authorizes funding for NOAA's coastal surveying and nautical chart functions. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act (H.R. 2400) and the Ocean and Coastal Exploration and NOAA Act (S. 39) provide funds for updating survey information for U.S. coastal regions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) requires the DHS Inspector General to investigate the San Francisco VTS. The DHS Inspector General is required to investigate the role of the San Francisco VTS in the Cosco Busan accident and the Coast Guard's response to the spill, with a report due by April 1, 2008."
