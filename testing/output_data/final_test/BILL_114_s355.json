    "content": "The \"Teach Safe Relationships Act of 2015\" establishes a fund for the improvement of education to provide safe relationship behavior education and training. It amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a new subpart for this purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to ensure students receive education on safe relationship behavior, promote healthy relationships, develop respectful attitudes, and provide financial assistance to meet title IX requirements. \"Congress acknowledges the importance of educating students on safe relationship behavior to prevent dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Schools can provide students with the knowledge to make informed decisions and lead a healthy lifestyle.\" According to the Department of Justice, there are an average of 293,066 victims of rape and sexual assault each year, with young women aged 16 to 24 experiencing the highest rate of intimate partner violence. Females aged 18 to 24 consistently have higher rates of rape and sexual assault, and partners of all genders in same-sex relationships also experience dating violence. Bisexual, transgender, and LGBTQ youth are more likely to experience physical dating violence compared to heterosexual youth. This violence is linked to increased sexual risk-taking behaviors and health risks, including adolescent and unintended pregnancy. Safe relationship behavior education is lacking in US teaching practices, with a need for sex education curriculum to address emotional relationship health and address sexual harassment in schools. Educational materials also need to promote safe relationships. Efforts to improve public education should include programs for safe relationship behavior training and curriculum addressing sexual assault and teen dating violence. Federal support should focus on developing innovative curricula and strategies to promote healthy behavior in schools and communities. \"SEC. 5624. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'consent' in this subpart refers to affirmative, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement for a specific sexual activity during a sexual encounter. Consent cannot be given by an individual who is asleep, incapacitated, under duress, coercion, force, or in circumstances where consent is not clear. Safe relationship behavior education promotes recognizing and preventing physical and emotional relationship abuse, coercion, violence, and abuse, including teen dating violence, domestic abuse, and sexual harassment. It is medically accurate and tailored to an individual's age, developmental stage, and culture. Safe relationship behavior education includes education on communication skills, emotional health, accountability, well-being, consent, healthy relationships, healthy attitudes, self-esteem, self-efficacy, stress management, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including advances and requests for favors. Sexual violence involves non-consensual physical sexual acts. Teen and adolescent dating violence is violence in romantic relationships based on factors like relationship length. The curr_chunk discusses the key factors in a relationship: length, type, and frequency of interaction. \"SEC. 5625. GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for professional development in safe relationship behavior education and age-appropriate curricula. Grants are awarded competitively and distributed equitably among agencies in different areas, lasting for 4 years. The Secretary awards grants to local educational agencies for safe relationship behavior training and curriculum development. Grants last for 4 years and include policies on promoting safe and healthy relationships. Grant funds must be used for curricula that incorporate safe relationship behavior training and education on healthy relationships. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary with details on their need for funds, plan for implementing activities, and measurable objectives for the use of grant funds. The Secretary will select grantees based on certain criteria. The Secretary determines which local educational agencies receive funding and the grant amounts based on a peer review process. Grant amounts are determined by available funds and proposed activities to ensure effectiveness. A peer review committee reviews grant applications. The peer review committee reviews grant applications and makes recommendations to the Secretary for selecting grantees. Section 9526(a)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include \"safe relationship behavior education\" after \"abstinence\"."
