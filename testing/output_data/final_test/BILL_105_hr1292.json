    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Voluntary Alcohol Advertising Standards for Children Act\". The Congress finds that television advertising influences children's perception of societal values, especially regarding alcohol. American children are exposed to significant amounts of television each week, with alcohol producers spending millions on advertising in 1995, particularly during sports programming. Many beer ads target young people by using themes like humor, parties, and athletic pursuits, often featuring animated characters or music that appeal to children and teens. The current advertising codes of brewers and distillers are inadequate in restraining messages that encourage underage drinking, as they are unenforceable and do not apply to all alcohol companies. Alcohol producers use advertising practices that target young people with persuasive inducements to drink. Current standards lack uniformity and do not shield underage audiences from alcohol promotions. Developing voluntary industry standards could prevent government restrictions on alcohol advertising and allow producers to promote to adult consumers. Alcohol producers use advertising practices targeting young people with persuasive inducements to drink. Enforceable voluntary broadcast standards provide a minimally restrictive condition on alcohol producer marketing activities, consistent with their business missions and social responsibility. SEC. 337. ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TELEVISION ADVERTISING CODES. This section amends the Communications Act of 1934 to establish and implement television advertising codes. The Commission shall prescribe a code of conduct for alcoholic beverage advertisements in video programming to limit exposure to minors, based on recommendations from an advisory committee. The committee must include parents, broadcasters, cable operators, public interest groups, and individuals from the private sector. The advisory committee for developing a voluntary code to limit exposure of alcoholic beverage ads to minors must be balanced in political affiliation and viewpoints. The committee will be provided with necessary staff and resources and must submit recommendations within one year. An antitrust exemption is granted for joint actions in the television industry related to the code. The exemption for joint actions in the television industry related to limiting exposure of alcoholic beverage ads to minors has limitations, including no boycotts and a one-year timeframe. Advertising codes established must be enforced with forfeiture penalties. The Act requires the Commission to prescribe a code if the television industry fails to establish a voluntary code limiting exposure of alcohol ads to minors. The code must consider ad content, frequency, timing, and placement, as well as public information messages about alcohol risks for minors. Annual reports are mandated by the Commission. The Commission must assess the implementation and compliance of video programming distributors with the code established under the Act in each annual report. Definitions for \"antitrust laws\" and \"person in the television industry\" are provided in the section. The National Cable Television Association, Association of Independent Television Stations, National Association of Broadcasters, Motion Picture Association of America, Community Antenna Television Association, and networks' affiliate organizations are included in the regulations for telecasting video programming. The term 'video programming' is defined in section 602 of the Act."
