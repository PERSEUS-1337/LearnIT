ADVANCE PAYMENT OF EARNED INCOME CREDIT. This section introduces a new provision for advance payment of earned income credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 3 introduces a provision for advance payment of earned income credit in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An employer must make an additional lump sum payment to an employee with an eligibility certificate equal to the earned income advance amount. Employees can elect to receive this amount after 6 months of employment during the calendar year. Employees must submit an eligibility certificate to their employer to certify their eligibility for the earned income credit. The certificate must confirm that the employee does not have another certificate with a different employer for the same year and that their spouse also does not have a certificate. Employees must submit an eligibility certificate to their employer to certify their eligibility for the earned income credit. The employer is not responsible for verifying the certification or liable for false claims made by the employee. The earned income advance amount is determined based on the employee's eligibility. The earned income advance amount is determined based on the employee's wages and is limited to $500 per calendar year, with adjustments for inflation after 2019. For taxable years beginning after 2019, the $500 amount in subparagraph (B) will be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. If the increase is not a multiple of $10, it will be rounded. For taxable years after 2019, the $500 amount in subparagraph (B) will be adjusted for cost-of-living. If the increase is not a multiple of $10, it will be rounded. The earned income advance amount for Armed Forces members is based on total wages. Tables for advance amounts will be similar to those issued under section 3402. Payments made by an employer to an employee under this section are not considered compensation. The text explains that advance payments made by an employer to an employee are not considered compensation but are treated as made out of specific amounts required to be deducted and withheld for the payroll period. If the aggregate amount of earned income advance payments exceeds the taxes due for any employer in a payroll period, adjustments will be made. The employer must limit earned income advance payments if they exceed certain amounts, and failure to make these payments will be treated as a failure to deduct and withhold the required amount. An eligibility certificate submitted to an employer remains valid until revoked by the employee during the calendar year. The employee must revoke an eligibility certificate if they become ineligible for the tax credit within 10 days. The certificate must be in a specified form and contain required information as per regulations. No earned income advance amount will be paid for any taxable year if prior fraudulent or reckless claims have been made. The disallowance period for earned income advance amounts is 10 taxable years after a final determination of fraud, and 2 taxable years after a final determination of reckless or intentional disregard of rules. The IRS ensures taxpayers receiving a credit refund are aware of earned income advance amounts. Coordination with advance payments of earned income credit includes recapture if payments are made by an employer during the individual's last taxable year. The IRS coordinates with employers to recapture advance payments of earned income credit made during an individual's last taxable year. Taxpayers receiving credit refunds are required to report payments received under section 3507. The Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include the total amount paid to employees under section 3507 for advance payment of earned income credit. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 25 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include advance payment of earned income credit under section 3507. The effective date for these amendments is 1 year after the enactment of this Act."
