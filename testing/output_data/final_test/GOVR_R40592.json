    "content": "Medicare is the health insurance program for individuals aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons. It consists of Parts A, B, C, and D, with Part A covering hospital services and Part B covering medical services like physician visits. Beneficiaries can also opt for private Part C or Medicare Advantage plans and Part D for prescription drug coverage. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers Medicare, contracting with private entities for day-to-day operations like paying claims and detecting fraud. These entities handle multiple administrative tasks, including enrolling providers, educating physicians on billing, adjudicating appeals, and recovering improper payments. Improper payments in Medicare, including duplicate, ineligible, or unreceived services, have been a longstanding issue. The Government Accountability Office has identified Medicare as high risk for fraud due to billing errors. The Improper Payments Information Act requires federal agencies to report on improper payments annually. In 1996, Medicare estimated $23.2 billion in improper payments. Since 1996, efforts to reduce improper payments in federal health programs have been successful. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) were established to combat fraud. The improper payment rate decreased from $23.2 billion in 1996 to $10.8 billion in 2007. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 authorized recovery audit contractors (RACs) to further address improper payments in Medicare. The Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) were authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to identify and recover overpayments in Medicare Parts A and B. RACs were reimbursed through contingency fees, returning $693.6 million in overpayments and correcting $1 billion in improper payments between 2005 and 2008. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) permanent and mandated their nationwide expansion by January 1, 2010. The legislation required the Secretary to reimburse RACs using contingency fees and granted permission to pay for identifying underpayments. Additional requirements included deposit stipulations, audit periods, contractor qualifications, and an annual performance report. RACs are not authorized to review improper payments in MA or PDP programs. The CMS announced the national rollout of the permanent RAC program in October 2008, with four contractors tasked to review claims for select states. Providers under Medicare Parts A and B are subject to RAC audits, including hospitals, physicians, and other facilities. The RACs were set to begin outreach in November 2008, but CMS imposed a stay shortly after naming the contractors. After announcing the new RACs, CMS imposed a stay on the nationwide program due to protests from unsuccessful bidders. The two protesting companies, Viant Payment Systems and PRG Schultz, settled with the agency and now act as subcontractors. RACs use automated and complex reviews to identify improper payments, with automated reviews only used under specific conditions. RACs conduct reviews to determine Medicare coverage based on written policies or guidelines. Complex reviews involve human review of medical records for potential overpayments, with consultation of medical literature and clinical judgment when necessary. CMS mandates that RACs use nurses and certified coders for medical record reviews, with one full-time medical director overseeing the process. RACs select claims for review using data analysis techniques to identify suspicious claims and aberrancies. Contractors also review reports from OIG and GAO to pinpoint improper payments. RACs use nurses and certified coders for medical record reviews, overseen by a full-time medical director. They select claims for review using data analysis techniques and also review reports from OIG and GAO to identify improper payments. Other contractors like MACs, FIs, and Carriers, CERT contractor, PSCs and ZPICs, and QIOs also have the authority to review claims suspected of being improper. Determinations of improper payments can be made for various reasons such as incorrect coding, unnecessary services, incorrect payment amounts, and duplicate claims. RACs, CERT contractor, and QIOs can review claims post-payment, with restrictions on the \"look-back\" period set by statute and CMS. Contractors are limited to reviewing claims up to four years past the initial payment date, unless fraud is suspected. In response to provider concerns, CMS reduced the claim look-back period from four to three years. In response to provider concerns, CMS reduced the claim look-back period from four to three years in the permanent program. RACs are prohibited from reviewing any claim paid prior to October 1, 2007. CMS manual instructions direct certain administrative contractors to use physician consultants for complex medical documentation reviews. Medicare has the authority to pay RACs differently than other administrative contractors. The Medicare program reimburses organizations for costs incurred during the year, but the MMA legislation required RACs to be paid on a contingency basis. RACs are paid a percentage of overpayments they identify and collect, ranging from 9.0% to 12.5%. CMS did not disclose fees paid to each RAC but made public the contingency percentages. RAC contracts were competitively awarded based on technical standards. Opponents of the Medicare program's RACs argue that the contingency payment structure incentivizes aggressive auditing and claims denial. Provider groups like the AHA and AMA have requested CMS to remove this payment method and instead pay RACs a fixed annual amount. Concerns were raised during the demonstration program when RACs could keep contingency fees even if their determinations were overturned on appeal. CMS has since required RACs to return all contingency fees for overpayments. Opponents argue that the contingency fee structure of the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) incentivizes aggressive claims denial. In response to high denial rates for joint replacement procedures in California, CMS hired an independent contractor to review RAC determinations. After disagreements in 40% of cases, CMS halted RAC reviews in California, leading to legislation for a moratorium on the RAC program in 2007. Capps introduced legislation (H.R. 4105) for a one-year moratorium on the Medicare Recovery Audit Contractor Program in 2007. CMS now requires RACs to seek permission before audits and hired a validation contractor for accuracy reviews. RACs returned $693.6 million to Medicare Trust Funds during a three-year demonstration. Provider groups argue that the reported $693.6 million returned to the Medicare Trust Funds by Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) overstates actual net savings, as appeals can result in funds being paid back to providers. They claim that providers often successfully appeal overpayment determinations, with 14% of claims appealed and 33% of those overturned in the provider's favor. As of August 31, 2008, providers appealed 22.5% of overpayment determinations made by RACs, with 34% of appealed claims decided in the provider's favor. The percentage of appeals overturned in the provider's favor increased from 4.6% to 7.6%. Medicare regulations allow the Secretary to recoup overpayments, with limitations set by Congress in the MMA. The agency plans to release a final report on the total dollar value returned to the Trust Funds. Section 935 of the MMA limits Medicare's ability to recoup overpayments during the appeals process. Providers must file a valid appeal within 30 days to delay recoupment, or CMS can initiate recoupment on day 41 after the demand letter is sent. Medicare providers still have 120 days to file a first level appeal, but the Secretary can start recouping overpayments before a decision is made. The Secretary can recoup funds before 120 days if no appeal is filed, but must stop if an appeal is filed. Providers in South Carolina filed a complaint against CMS for recouping $30 million before the appeals process. They claim they didn't receive a timely overpayment demand letter to appeal. The hospitals argue that Section 935 of the MMA prevents recoupment until after appeals at both levels. CMS implemented rules for recoupment limitations in 2006 and provided instructions in 2008. RAC audits require providers to submit medical records and complete paperwork for appeals, which providers find burdensome. Providers find RAC audits time-consuming and burdensome, especially for small practices. CMS has set limits on medical record requests to alleviate concerns, with different limits for various provider types. Providers are concerned about the administrative burden of RAC audits due to limits on medical record requests based on each provider's NPI. CMS plans to clarify policies for facilities with multiple NPIs. Congressional leaders have requested a study on the RAC program. The GAO and OIG are conducting studies on the RAC program to prevent improper payments in Medicare, which is expected to exceed $500 billion in spending for elderly and disabled beneficiaries. CMS historically relied on claims administration contractors to reduce improper payments. HHS began reporting the first Medicare improper payment rate in 1996, highlighting concerns about contractors' effectiveness in safeguarding the program due to budget constraints and lack of incentives for reducing payment errors. Prior to the MMA, contractors were paid under cost-based contracts without profit incentives, leading to evaluations based on speed rather than accuracy. The RAC program now offers payment incentives for contractors to improve performance and enhance program integrity efforts. The RAC program offers payment incentives for contractors to identify and recover improper payments, but concerns remain about accuracy and oversight. Changes have been made to address these concerns, such as requiring RACs to return contingency fees for overturned overpayments and setting limits on the number of medical records they can request. Anxiety among providers persists as the permanent program unfolds, with upcoming evaluations likely to be critical. The upcoming GAO and OIG evaluations will be crucial in helping policymakers evaluate the use of recovery audit contractors in Medicare as the permanent program unfolds."
