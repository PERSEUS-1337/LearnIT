    "content": "Financial market participants face various risks that can be addressed through diversification, insurance, or financial instruments like derivatives. Systemic risk is defined as instability for large parts of the financial system, often caused by risks individual firms cannot protect against. It can come from within or outside the financial system, such as the fears following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the nation's financial center. Systemic risk in the financial system can lead to widespread disruption due to infrastructure damage and loss of industry professionals. The 2008 financial crisis exemplified systemic risk with runs on institutions and illiquidity of assets. Debate exists on whether the crisis could have been predicted or prevented. Regulators failed to prevent the financial crisis due to a focus on microprudential risk rather than macroprudential risk. Microprudential regulation addresses risks to individual firms, while macroprudential regulation focuses on systemic risks. Proponents argue for a new mandate to regulate systemic risk, but some argue that regulators already had the authority to respond effectively. The failure to prevent the financial crisis was attributed to a focus on microprudential rather than macroprudential risk regulation. Some argue that regulators already had the authority to address systemic risk episodes effectively, suggesting that the crisis could not have been avoided even with a systemic risk regulator in place. This raises concerns that creating a systemic risk regulator may be ineffective or even detrimental to necessary risk-taking behavior. The need for systemic risk regulation is explained, highlighting the importance of identifying and regulating sources of systemic risk. The authority of a systemic risk regulator can be broad or narrow, impacting the balance of power between legislative and executive branches. The section reviews sources of systemic risk during the recent crisis, emphasizing the need for specific activities to be potentially regulated. Firms are considered liquid when they can meet short-term obligations, while markets are liquid when there is a ready supply of buyers and sellers. Solvent but illiquid firms have assets exceeding liabilities but struggle to meet obligations quickly. Financial intermediation involves borrowing short-term and lending long-term, creating a liquidity mismatch. Liquid markets are seen as normal, but can be disrupted during times of financial stress. During a liquidity crunch, an institution may fail even if its assets exceed liabilities, as investors may no longer buy assets or lend funds. This scenario, known as a run, historically caused bank runs until the creation of FDIC deposit insurance. During the recent crisis, runs occurred on non-banks when lenders refused to roll over loans as they matured. Money market mutual funds were revealed to be susceptible to runs, such as when the Reserve Fund holding Lehman Brothers commercial paper \"broke the buck,\" prompting widespread withdrawal requests that could not be met. This set off a run throughout the money market industry, including funds that did not hold Lehman debt. Money market mutual funds are vulnerable to runs due to the liquidity mismatch and the inability to immediately liquidate assets to meet redemption requests. Runs can spread from troubled to healthy institutions, causing losses for remaining creditors and potentially leading to financial instability. The financial system relies on interdependent relationships between institutions for credit, liquidity, and risk-sharing. During a crisis, a breakdown in counterparty trust can lead to a reduction in transactions, causing strains on the system. This lack of trust can result in creditors and depositors withdrawing funds due to uncertainty about counterparty exposure, leading to a potential liquidity crisis for institutions. Regulators reduce liquidity problems by requiring financial firms to hold sufficient reserves and limit reliance on short-term debt. This intervention is justified by the argument that liquidity creates positive externalities for the financial system. Individual firms tend to hold less liquidity than optimal from a societal perspective. The moral hazard problem arises when institutions hold too little liquidity, leading to greater risk-taking. Systemic risk can spread through contagion if a firm's failure affects other firms. Concentration of assets in a few large firms in the US poses a risk according to the IMF. Some policymakers are concerned about systemic risk in the bankruptcy process of large financial firms. The failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 unexpectedly caused disruptions in the financial system, leading to a widespread run on money market accounts. Regulatory actions were taken to address the risks posed by certain firms. In 2008, regulators intervened to prevent the bankruptcy of firms like AIG and Bear Stearns, considering them \"too big to fail\" or \"too interconnected to fail.\" The Fed facilitated the sale of Bear Stearns and provided funds to AIG, ensuring all counterparties and creditors were paid in full. However, the perception of being \"too big to fail\" can lead to moral hazard, encouraging firms and creditors to take more risks due to the expectation of government protection. During the credit boom, leverage increased in the financial sector as institutions expanded loans and asset purchases by increasing liabilities. This was fueled by low interest rates, leading to potential profits but also increasing the risk of insolvency. During the financial crisis of 2007, firms faced losses on loans and assets, depleting their capital. To reduce leverage, they needed to sell assets, but the market uncertainty led to \"fire sale\" prices, further depleting capital and causing feedback effects on institutions holding similar assets. During the financial crisis of 2007, firms faced write downs that depleted capital. Economists argue that leveraging in good times and deleveraging in bad times poses systemic risk. They suggest making capital requirements less pro-cyclical to prevent fire sales during losses. Systemic risk could also arise from events disrupting payment systems, like major counterparty failures or technological disruptions. During the financial crisis of 2007, concerns arose about systemic risk in payment systems, particularly in the derivatives market. Regulators were worried about delays in processing over-the-counter derivative contracts, lack of record-keeping, and counterparty risks. Lack of transparency made it difficult to identify these risks. One solution proposed was clearing derivatives through a central clearinghouse or trading on public exchanges. During the financial crisis, derivatives and repurchase agreement markets experienced failures. Repurchase agreements provide liquidity for financial firms but faced scarcity and low yields during the crisis. Settlement fails in these markets hinder efficient clearing and impose credit risk, damaging overall market liquidity. Regulators' narrow mandates and lack of responsibility for systemic risks contributed to gaps in oversight of institutions, financial systems, and products, leading to the financial crisis. For example, the Office of Thrift Supervision failed to adequately supervise AIG's financial products subsidiary, focusing only on its impact on thrifts. These gaps in regulation damaged overall market liquidity. The financial crisis was exacerbated by gaps in regulation, particularly in oversight of institutions and financial products. Critics argued that the regulatory system was ineffective due to overlapping regulators and a lack of coordination. Reducing the number of regulators could prevent firms from \"forum shopping\" for lenient oversight, which could lead to a decrease in regulatory standards. Competition among regulators can prevent \"blind spots\" or \"groupthink\" in regulatory standards. Addressing underlying economic fundamentals is crucial for preventing future crises, such as the housing bubble leading to the financial crisis. Policymakers could have taken steps to prevent the bubble from growing too large, like raising interest rates. The Federal Reserve could have raised interest rates to indirectly increase financing costs for purchasing a house and tightened mortgage underwriting standards to prevent the housing bubble. Regulators should have required higher underwriting standards to withstand market downturns. Focusing on overall capital and liquidity levels alone would not have prevented the boom and bust cycle. Systemic risk regulation is not a new concept, as maintaining financial system stability is crucial. The Federal Reserve's primary duties include maintaining financial system stability and containing systemic risk. During the crisis, it could have used its regulatory powers to limit systemic risk and provide assistance to firms. The Fed also has a mandate to keep inflation stable and unemployment low. The Federal Reserve's mandate includes maintaining financial system stability, containing systemic risk, and keeping inflation stable and unemployment low. Regulators may have lacked the legal authority to address systemic issues during the crisis due to regulatory gaps caused by financial innovation. Despite the inherent risk of runs in financial intermediation, regulators could require firms to take precautionary steps to minimize the likelihood of runs. During the financial crisis, banks struggled to access sufficient liquidity from private markets despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to provide liquidity. This was due to fear of counterparty risk causing the interbank lending market to freeze up. Regulatory measures aimed at minimizing the likelihood of runs included requiring firms to hold assets in a liquid form and maintain access to long-term credit. During the financial crisis, banks faced liquidity issues as the interbank lending market froze up. They turned to the Fed's discount window and the Term Auction Facility for funding, with borrowing reaching over $500 billion. The FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program also guaranteed bank debt. However, accessing these facilities created a moral hazard problem by reducing incentives to seek liquidity from private markets. A skeptic might argue that simply requiring higher liquidity levels in institutions may not prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Structural changes, such as limiting exposure to individual counterparties or requiring adequate collateralization, could address the root cause of liquidity problems. However, regulatory complexities between banks and non-banks in the U.S. hinder effective structural changes. Non-bank financial institutions face liquidity risks due to their heavy reliance on short-term borrowing, with broker-dealers particularly vulnerable. The Federal Reserve intervened during the 2008 crisis by providing liquidity through emergency lending facilities. Regulatory challenges hinder structural changes to address liquidity issues effectively. The Federal Reserve intervened in the 2008 crisis by adding liquidity to commercial paper and asset-backed securities markets. The SEC regulates money market mutual funds, but it was the Treasury that provided a temporary guarantee in September 2008. However, the Treasury no longer has the authority to use the Exchange Stabilization Fund for future guaranty programs. The Federal Reserve had regulatory responsibility for the money market mutual fund industry in the United States. It already had authority to address the too big to fail problem for bank holding companies. The crisis highlighted the need for similar regulation across all subsidiaries of these holding companies. Commercial banks and investment banks were subject to different regulatory systems before the crisis. Before the financial crisis, there were five large investment banks not regulated by the Fed. Post-crisis, they either failed, were acquired by bank holding companies, or converted to bank holding companies, bringing them under the Fed's supervision. Non-bank financial firms like hedge funds and broker-dealers were not closely regulated for safety and soundness before the crisis, despite growing rapidly. This lack of regulation was a concern as these firms were not considered sources of systemic risk like banks. Non-bank financial firms, like hedge funds and broker-dealers, were not explicitly identified as too big to fail before the financial crisis. Despite growing rapidly, they received no special regulatory treatment to address any systemic risks they might pose. Policymakers were willing to live with the ambiguity surrounding the too big to fail status, believing it would prevent moral hazard. Intervening to prevent the failure of firms like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, and AIG during the crisis made it unlikely that market participants would perceive a stated intent to allow a large institution to fail as credible. During the financial crisis, the Fed had the option to let non-bank financial firms like Lehman Brothers go bankrupt or inject funds to keep them solvent, as was done with AIG. The Fed used its emergency lending authority to provide loans to troubled firms, ensuring they were secured to its satisfaction. Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated that Lehman Brothers was not provided a loan because it could not secure it to the Fed's satisfaction. The Fed did not disclose specific evidence on how it ensured loan security. The Fed's lender-of-last-resort role aimed to assist solvent firms with liquidity problems during the financial crisis. Government receivership or conservatorship were options for banks, thrifts, credit unions, and GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FDIC has the authority to impose losses on specific creditors and use government or deposit insurance funds to reduce losses on others, such as in bank insolvencies. Capital requirements set by regulators, like the Fed, were based on the Basel Accords but were criticized for not addressing systemic risk. Capital requirements were seen as pro-cyclical, requiring firms to hold less capital when asset prices were high and raise capital when prices fell. Federal capital requirements applied to depository subsidiaries, not holding companies. The Federal Reserve's supervision of nonbank subsidiaries under the Bank Holding Company Act focuses on preventing risks to affiliated depository institutions. Capital requirements are applied to depository subsidiaries, not non-depository subsidiaries, to account for the federal subsidy of insured deposits. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve played a key role in regulating the payment system for banks to ensure smooth functioning. Private sector settlement systems supervised by the Fed operated in areas such as payments, securities, and foreign exchange. Other payment systems not directly regulated by the Fed were not subject to the same oversight. The Federal Reserve oversaw private sector settlement systems in payments, securities, and foreign exchange during the financial crisis. While the Fed did not directly regulate all payment systems, it could influence their operations through monitoring banks' involvement in credit default swaps and derivatives. Coordination among regulators was facilitated by groups like the FFIEC. During the financial crisis, inter-agency groups like the FFIEC and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets aimed to regulate banks and monitor systemic risks. Critics argued that FFIEC's scope was too narrow, while the President's Working Group's responsibilities were too ad hoc. Despite the lack of explicit statutory delegation for systemic regulation, the Fed had a broad directive to monitor the financial system and inform Congress of potential dangers. The Dodd-Frank Act gave the Fed authority to monitor the financial system and intervene in potential systemic risks. Before this, regulatory authority over holding companies was dispersed among various regulators, limiting the Fed's powers over non-banking subsidiaries. The law provided the Fed with safety and soundness regulatory authority over the holding company and certain depository subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act granted the Fed authority to oversee systemic risks in the financial system. Prior to this, regulatory power over holding companies was divided among different regulators, hindering the Fed's control over non-banking subsidiaries. The law empowered the Fed with safety and soundness regulatory jurisdiction over the holding company and specific depository subsidiaries. However, there was no clear authority for any one regulator to oversee the entire operations of a holding company, leading to challenges in making systemic risk determinations. The Fed's broad policy mandate to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates raised questions about the lack of a comprehensive regulator to identify broader financial market issues. The Fed's mandate includes promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Despite not having authority to act on systemic issues, the Fed regularly makes recommendations to Congress. The argument that everyone missed warning signs like the Fed did raises questions about the effectiveness of a systemic risk regulator. The bursting of an asset bubble can have significant macroeconomic consequences. The bursting of an asset bubble can lead to macroeconomic results inconsistent with the Fed's mandate. The Fed has chosen not to use monetary policy to respond to bubbles in the past, arguing it would stray from its mandate. Identifying bubbles accurately is difficult as future asset prices cannot be predicted with certainty. The Fed would need to \"outsmart\" market participants to successfully identify bubbles. The Fed's ability to accurately identify asset bubbles is questioned, as market participants may have more information. Despite evidence of a housing bubble driven by speculation, Fed officials dismissed the threat before the 2008 crisis. Chairman Bernanke believed in solid income growth and low mortgage rates supporting the housing market, downplaying risks. The Fed believes that using higher interest rates to deflate asset bubbles may not be effective and could have negative consequences. They argue for using expansionary monetary policy to manage the aftermath of a burst bubble. The 2001 recession after the dot-com bubble was mild, supporting this approach. However, the 2008 financial crisis following the housing bubble suggests that monetary policy was not sufficient for a smooth landing. The effectiveness of a systemic risk regulator in ensuring a smooth landing during rare systemic events is difficult to evaluate. Good outcomes may be attributed to the regulator's vigilance or normal times. There is a risk of stifling financial innovation if the regulator only focuses on avoiding instability. The Fed's mandate lacks a clear mechanism to discipline the regulator for failure to prevent systemic events. The Federal Reserve Act does not provide a clear mechanism to discipline the Fed for failing to prevent systemic events, other than congressional intervention. The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the Fed's authority but may hinder effective oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced new systemic risk responsibilities divided between the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Reserve, with resolution authority shared between the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Title I, Subtitle A of the act establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, consists of heads of federal regulatory agencies and is responsible for identifying and responding to financial risks, proposing regulatory changes, and promoting stability in the financial system. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, coordinates among financial regulators, makes regulatory recommendations, identifies gaps in regulation, reviews accounting standards, and provides a forum for resolving disputes. It cannot impose resolutions on disagreeing members but must provide an annual report to Congress. The Council can only make regulatory recommendations and lacks the authority to eliminate emerging threats or close regulatory gaps. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, has the authority to identify non-bank financial firms that are systemically significant. Foreign financial firms operating in the United States could also be identified as systemically significant. The Council can exempt firms with consolidated assets under $50 billion, with the possibility of raising that threshold. The Fed has examination powers to assist in determining a firm's systemic significance. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can designate non-bank financial firms as systemically significant, with the ability to recommend stricter safety standards. Firms with over $50 billion in assets and TARP assistance would automatically be considered systemically significant. The Council can suggest different standards based on risk levels. The Federal Reserve would regulate firms designated as systemically significant by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, setting standards such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management requirements, and exposure limits. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports to the Fed. The Federal Reserve would regulate systemically significant firms, setting standards like risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, and exposure limits. The Fed may override the primary regulator if needed. Annual stress tests and early remediation measures would be conducted to prevent insolvency. If a firm poses a grave threat, restrictions may be imposed on mergers or acquisitions. Title VI of the Federal Reserve regulations imposes restrictions on systemically significant firms to maintain financial stability. This includes limitations on mergers, acquisitions, offering financial products, and activities that could pose a threat to the US financial system. Additionally, it prohibits companies from exceeding 10% of total consolidated liabilities when merging or acquiring assets. Title VI of the Federal Reserve regulations imposes restrictions on systemically significant firms to maintain financial stability, including limitations on mergers and acquisitions that could exceed 10% of total consolidated liabilities. Title II addresses concerns about failures of systemically important financial firms by establishing a resolution system modeled after the FDIC's receivership regime. Exceptions may be made for certain circumstances such as acquisitions involving assistance from the FDIC or during severe financial conditions. The special resolution regime for financial companies is based on the FDIC's receivership regime. Eligible companies can be recommended for resolution by regulators, with the Treasury Secretary making a determination of default or danger of default. Private sector alternatives must be unavailable for the company to qualify for this regime. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a special resolution regime for financial companies, with the Treasury Secretary making determinations of default. Creditors and shareholders will bear losses, and management responsible for the company's condition will not be retained. The regime allows for actions against parties responsible for the company's condition. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes a resolution regime for financial companies where creditors and shareholders bear losses, and management is not retained. The Orderly Liquidation Fund will be used for liquidation without taxpayer funds, and the FDIC can borrow funds from the Treasury with caps based on the failed firm's assets. Claimants may be assessed if necessary to pay off obligations to the Treasury. Title VI of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits proprietary trading by certain financial institutions and their affiliates, as well as owning interests in hedge funds or private equity funds. There are exceptions to these prohibitions. The Act also establishes a resolution regime for financial companies, where creditors and shareholders bear losses, and management is not retained. The Orderly Liquidation Fund will be used for liquidation without taxpayer funds, and the FDIC can borrow funds from the Treasury with caps based on the failed firm's assets. Claimants may be assessed if necessary to pay off obligations to the Treasury. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits proprietary trading and owning interests in hedge funds or private equity funds for certain financial institutions and their affiliates. Exceptions to these prohibitions exist, with additional capital and quantitative limits imposed on non-bank financial companies by regulators unless specific exceptions apply. The Dodd-Frank Act allows the Council to identify systemically significant systems for payment, clearing, and settlement activities for regulation by the SEC, CFTC, or the Fed. Title VIII lists activities that could be regulated, including settling financial transactions, risk management, payment instructions, and movement of funds. It covers various financial instruments like funds transfers, securities contracts, futures contracts, and derivatives. The PCS regulator can regulate financial instruments for payment, clearing, or settlement activities, excluding certain entities. The regulator can request information, issue rules, and take enforcement actions. The Fed can intervene in regulated PCS systems in case of imminent risk. Regulated PCS systems may borrow from the Fed in exceptional circumstances. Title VII of the act aims to transform the OTC market to mirror regulated futures exchanges. It mandates swap contracts to be cleared through a central counterparty regulated by federal agencies. Clearing houses require initial margin to cover potential losses and maintenance margin for actual losses, preventing firms from accumulating excessive uncapitalized exposure. The firm's ability to post capital limits the size of cleared positions. The new law mandates swap contracts to be cleared through a central counterparty, shifting counterparty risk from firms to the clearing house. Exceptions are provided for commercial end-users and smaller financial institutions. Swap dealers and major swap participants will face additional margin and capital requirements. All trades will be subject to trading on an exchange or swap execution facility regulated by the CFTC or SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates clearing swap contracts through a central counterparty to reduce counterparty risk. Data on swap prices and trading volumes will be publicly available, providing regulators with more information on potential losses during market volatility. The act also imposes margin and capital requirements on swap dealers and major participants. Holding companies are no longer allowed to include trust-preferred securities in Tier I capital. Title VI of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates countercyclical capital requirements for banks, with a study on implementing contingent capital for systemically significant firms. The Federal Reserve is required to establish regulations on the use of trust-preferred securities in Tier I capital. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates countercyclical capital requirements for banks and requires the Federal Reserve to establish regulations governing the use of emergency lending authority to prevent aid to failing firms or insolvent borrowers. Programs must be approved by the Treasury Secretary and aimed at providing liquidity to the financial system, not aiding specific companies. Assistance must be secured to protect taxpayers from losses. The Federal Reserve and FDIC implemented emergency programs during the crisis to provide liquidity to the financial system. Assistance must be secured to protect taxpayers from losses, in contrast to previous standards. The FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, not specifically authorized by Congress, aimed to encourage liquidity in the banking system. The FDIC has the authority to create a program to guarantee debt of solvent depository institutions during severe economic distress. The program requires approval from two-thirds of the FDIC's Board and Fed governors, and must be widely available to solvent insured depository institutions. The FDIC has the authority to create a program to guarantee debt of solvent depository institutions during severe economic distress. The program must be widely available to solvent insured depository institutions or holding companies, excluding the provision of equity. The FDIC, in consultation with the Treasury Secretary, will establish policies and procedures for the program, which will be financed by assessments on participants with temporary funding available from the Treasury. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President, will set a maximum amount of debt that can be guaranteed, requiring congressional approval. Title VI of the legislation modifies the Fed's authority to regulate bank holding companies by expanding its authority to examine subsidiaries for risks to U.S. financial stability and compliance with federal laws. Congressional approval is required for guarantees on debt, which must be issued under expedited procedures. Title VI of the Dodd-Frank Act expands the Fed's authority to examine non-depository, non-functionally regulated subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies. The regulator of the lead depository institution can request a Fed examination, and if the Fed does not act, the regulator can conduct the examination. Recommendations for supervisory actions are to be submitted to the Fed. Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection within the Federal Reserve System to oversee various consumer financial products and services. The Bureau will enforce federal consumer protection laws for institutions offering these services. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, has the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for consumer protection laws. It operates independently within the Federal Reserve System and consults with prudential regulators when issuing guidance. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can overturn Bureau regulations if they pose a risk to the banking or financial system's stability. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, operates independently within the Federal Reserve System. The Fed does not have formal authority to interfere with Bureau regulations, appointments, or mergers, but can delegate examination authority. The Bureau is headed by a director appointed by the President for a five-year term. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, operates independently within the Federal Reserve System. The director, appointed by the President for a five-year term, has authority to hire necessary employees and determine funding from the Federal Reserve System's earnings. The Bureau's funding is capped at 10% for FY2011, 11% for FY2012, and 12% thereafter. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection's total operating expenses for FY2009 were $4.98 billion, with 10% amounting to just under $500 million. These funds are not subject to review by the House or Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was previously restricted from auditing monetary policy actions, but Title XI now allows GAO to audit certain actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including open market operations and emergency lending. The GAO is authorized to audit actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including emergency lending and security policies, to ensure operational integrity and fairness among participants. The GAO cannot evaluate monetary policy actions but can review third-party contractors' selection and payment policies. The GAO is authorized to audit the Federal Reserve's response to recent crisis within a year of enactment. Legislation also calls for a separate audit of Federal Reserve bank governance to assess conflicts of interest. Dodd-Frank Act requires disclosure of Federal Reserve lending details to congressional committees. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to disclose lending details to congressional committees, including information on the rationale for assistance, recipient identity, terms of assistance, and expected cost to taxpayers. Public disclosure of borrower identities, amount borrowed, rates charged, and collateral pledged is mandated within specific timeframes. Additionally, the Act specifies public disclosure deadlines for Fed programs created during the crisis. Title XI of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the selection process for Federal Reserve regional bank presidents, allowing only directors representing non-banking interests to make the selection. It also mandates a GAO audit of the selection process. The Dodd-Frank Act changes the selection process for Federal Reserve regional bank directors, transferring authority from the Office of Thrift Supervision to other regulators. The Fed gains authority to supervise savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries. Title VI allows the Fed to require unitary thrift holding companies to conduct financial activities in a regulated savings and loan holding company. It also eliminates the investment bank holding company framework. The Dodd-Frank Act allows the Federal Reserve to supervise savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries. Securities holding companies can choose to be regulated by the Fed, subjecting them to record-keeping, reporting, and examination requirements, as well as capital and risk management standards."
