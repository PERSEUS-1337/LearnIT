    "content": "In 2000, 189 U.N. member states, including the United States, adopted the U.N. Millennium Declaration, committing to achieve measurable development targets known as the \"Millennium Development Goals\" (MDGs) by 2015. The MDGs consist of eight goals with 21 targets and 60 indicators. World leaders met in 2010 to review progress and adopted a resolution for a \"global action plan\" to achieve the MDGs in the next five years, without financial commitments. The Meeting participants discussed governments' lack of success in meeting the MDGs in the past 10 years. There is a general consensus that while some progress has been made, the majority of Goals will not be met by 2015. Progress is unevenly distributed across countries and regions, with some Goals showing no progress or regression. President Obama emphasized sustainability, accountability, and economic growth in development assistance programs. President Obama emphasized sustainability, accountability, and economic growth in development assistance programs, aligning with the U.S. Strategy for Meeting the MDGs. The Obama Administration uses the MDGs as a framework for U.S. development policy more than Congress. Members of the 112th Congress may be interested in the Goals and the September High-level Meeting due to the challenges of development assistance in a tight fiscal environment. Members of Congress may wish to reassess foreign assistance priorities and strategies in light of concerns over the federal budget deficit. They may also consider commitments made on behalf of the United States in the Meeting's outcome document regarding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Oversight on the effectiveness of the MDGs and the role of the United States in fulfilling the Goals should be conducted. Congress may also consider how the MDGs should shape future U.S. and international development activities. Key questions for policymakers include assessing the success of the MDGs and their impact on development activities. Some experts question the practicality of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), citing unrealistic expectations and lack of prioritization. The role of foreign aid in achieving the MDGs is debated, with some calling for increased aid commitments while others doubt the impact of higher aid levels. Governments are held primarily accountable for MDG progress, but it remains unclear who they are accountable to if they fail to meet the goals by 2015. The report discusses trends in MDG progress, U.S. policy towards the Goals, different perspectives on their effectiveness in international development, and the adoption of a global action plan to achieve the MDGs by 2015. Development Goals progress is uneven among regions and within countries. Governments call for expedited aid delivery and commit to specific measures for the next five years. Annual reviews of progress are requested by the General Assembly. Member states agreed to hold a General Assembly special event on the MDGs in 2013 and requested the Secretary-General to report annually on progress towards the Goals. Various organizations and governments made development commitments, such as South Korea pledging $100 million for food security and agriculture in developing countries. Various organizations and governments made development commitments to support food security, education technology, health programs, clean cookstoves, and progress on the MDGs. These commitments aim to accelerate progress on the Goals and are part of broader development efforts already being undertaken. Experts monitoring MDG indicators have identified two overarching trends: some goals are on track to be achieved, while others have shown no progress or even deterioration. Progress towards the goals is unevenly distributed among regions and countries. Despite significant progress on a few MDGs, it is widely agreed that many goals will likely be missed globally and by most countries. Many experts predict that MDG 1, target 3, to halve the number of people suffering from hunger, will not be achieved due to global food crises and economic downturns. In the period from 2005 to 2007, 830 million people were undernourished, an increase from 817 million in 1990. MDG 2, ensuring all children complete primary schooling, is also likely to remain unfulfilled globally, despite progress in enrollment rates. In over half of Sub-Saharan Africa, at least 25% of school-aged children were not enrolled in 2008. MDG 4 aims to reduce child mortality by two-thirds by 2015, but progress is slow. Only 10 out of 67 countries with high child mortality rates are on track to meet the target. MDG 5, which aims to reduce maternal mortality by 75% by 2015, is also unlikely to be achieved. In developing countries, access to safe reproductive health services remains poor, with preventable conditions like hemorrhage and hypertension causing half of all deaths in expectant or new mothers. Global progress towards the MDGs is uneven, with significant poverty reduction driven by economic growth in countries like China and India, while progress in Sub-Saharan Africa has stalled or regressed. The world is on track to halve the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day, but challenges remain in achieving other MDG targets. Progress in reducing extreme poverty is mainly driven by economic success in certain countries, particularly China. However, poverty and hunger persist in other parts of Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Excluding China, the number of people living in extreme poverty increased by 36 million between 1990 and 2005. Gender equality in education is improving globally, with developing regions nearing gender parity in primary and secondary school enrollment. For example, in 2008, there were 96 girls for every 100 boys in primary school and 95 girls for every 100 boys in secondary school. Gender parity in education has improved globally, with 96 girls for every 100 boys in primary school and 95 girls for every 100 boys in secondary school. However, some developing countries and regions still struggle to achieve gender equality in education. In Sub-Saharan Africa, girls' enrollment in primary school decreased from 82% in 1999 to 79% in 2007. Progress towards girls' enrollment in primary school in Oceania has also stalled. Additionally, while the world is making progress in providing safe drinking water and sanitation, there are disparities across regions and countries. In an effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the next five years, experts discussed common factors contributing to progress and obstacles hindering it. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, certain factors have been identified to fulfill the MDGs. Safe water supply remains a challenge in many developing countries, particularly in rural areas and across Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa. When examining U.S. development policy and efforts to address the MDGs, members of Congress may consider effective government leadership, policies to support implementation, quality investments, institutional capacity, civil society involvement, and global effectiveness. The U.S. development policy and efforts to address the MDGs involve effective government leadership, policies, quality investments, institutional capacity, civil society involvement, and global partnerships. However, external events like the global financial crisis and armed conflict can hinder progress towards the Goals. The United States supports the U.N. Millennium Declaration and considers the MDGs in its development policy. The U.S. development policy aligns with the MDGs, with Presidents Bush and Obama emphasizing commitment to the Goals. Despite different rhetoric, the role of MDGs in U.S. foreign assistance policy remains unclear. The MDGs were published during President Bush's term, highlighting challenges in drawing conclusions about their impact. The U.S. commitment to the MDGs during the Bush Administration was nuanced, as it did not fully accept the Secretariat's formulation of the goals and indicators. The State Department described the MDGs as a \"Secretariat product\" that was not formally adopted by member states. The United States opposed the MDGs taken out of the context of the Millennium Declaration and argued against numeric aid targets, leading to a focus on ODA discussions. The United States opposed the MDGs and argued against numeric aid targets, leading to a focus on ODA discussions. International documents replaced blanket endorsements of MDGs with phrases like \"internationally agreed to development goals, including those in the Millennium Declaration,\" emphasizing economic growth and good governance as key priorities. The Monterrey Consensus provided the strategy for meeting global development priorities, focusing on sustainable development through country ownership of strategies, trade, and private investment. The Bush Administration pledged significant increases in U.S. ODA in the context of the Monterrey Consensus, not the MDGs. The Bush Administration pledged significant increases in U.S. ODA at the Monterrey Conference, introducing the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to fund countries with good governance and economic freedom. The U.S. strategy focused on country ownership, economic policy, investing in people, and addressing failing states, without specifically mentioning the MDGs. During the Bush Administration, U.S. ODA almost tripled between 2000 and 2008, with a significant portion going towards the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. However, a considerable amount of foreign assistance during this period was directed towards the Middle East and South and Central Asia, possibly due to strategic interests related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Obama aimed to align America's goals with the MDGs during his leadership. President Obama's leadership elevated the significance of the MDGs, with his administration embracing them in foreign assistance initiatives like Feed the Future and the Global Health Initiative. The Obama Administration aligned America's goals with the MDGs, focusing on ending hunger, combating diseases, reducing child mortality, and improving maternal health. The Obama Administration's strategy for meeting the MDGs focuses on innovation, sustainability, measuring outcomes, and mutual accountability among donor and recipient countries. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the MDGs and supports initiatives targeting environmental sustainability, economic opportunities in Muslim communities, and women's involvement in community development. The Obama Administration's strategy for meeting the MDGs emphasizes innovation, sustainability, measuring outcomes, and mutual accountability among donor and recipient countries. President Obama announced a new U.S. global development strategy called the Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development (PPD), focusing on aid impact rather than volume. The President emphasized the need for development assistance to focus on impact and sustainable improvement, not dependency. He highlighted the role of diplomacy, trade, and investment in development, stating that aid alone is not effective. The PPD, similar to the U.S. Strategy for Meeting the Millennium Development Goals, emphasizes mutual accountability and the importance of developing countries taking the lead in their own development. The announcement of the new policy during the MDG High-level Meeting shows a desire to improve the relationship between the United States and developing countries.

The announcement of the new policy during the MDG High-level Meeting shows a desire to improve the relationship between the United States and developing countries. Meeting indicates a desire to improve the working relationship with the U.N. on development issues. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a $50.82 million U.S. commitment for the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and a partnership to improve access to family planning services in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The Administration also renewed the U.S. commitment to supporting \"best practices\" related to each MDG. The legislative record shows little congressional action on the MDGs since 2000, with limited mention in appropriations legislation. Two bills introduced in the 109th Congress addressed the MDGs, emphasizing U.S. leadership and accountability in meeting these goals. The legislative record shows limited congressional action on the MDGs since 2000. A bill was introduced in the Senate requiring a report on global progress towards the MDGs and U.S. contributions. Another resolution expressed support for the MDGs and urged the President to ensure U.S. meaningful contribution by 2015. Congressional interest in the MDGs was indicated in a hearing held by the House Subcommittee on International Organizations. In July 2010, congressional interest in the MDGs was shown before the High-level Meeting. Bills introduced referenced specific Goals, like the Global Poverty Act calling for a strategy to meet MDG 1. Efforts to reform U.S. foreign assistance in the 111th Congress did not specifically mention the MDGs, but aligned with their goals. Major reform bills in the 111th Congress did not mention the MDGs. Ten years after the Millennium Declaration, government officials and development advocates are reviewing a decade of implementation efforts to shape policies for more effective development in the future. President Obama emphasized the need for new approaches to avoid missing development goals. Key policy issues for Congress include the practicality of the Goals, the role of foreign assistance, selectivity in aid provision, and accountability. Some question the practicality of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), arguing they set unrealistic expectations for poorer countries, like Sub-Saharan Africa, to achieve in a short timeframe. Critics believe such idealistic goals may lead to failure and detract from actual progress. Some critics argue that the idealistic aspects of the MDGs may overshadow actual development successes, leading to countries being labeled as failures for not achieving all goals. Debate over aid levels was central at the High-level Meeting, with aid advocates pushing for higher aid commitments while others question the impact of increased aid on development outcomes. The debate over aid levels at the High-level Meeting focused on the effectiveness of aid in development, with concerns raised about the potential negative impacts of increased aid. The lack of consistent monitoring and evaluation of aid programs leaves the issue unresolved. The U.S. delegation emphasized aid effectiveness and non-aid tools of development, such as trade and investment, rather than increasing aid levels. The MDG global action plan called on governments to fulfill their aid commitments without making new commitments. Stakeholders may pressure Congress to increase foreign aid appropriations to reflect needs highlighted in the action plan from the summit. The MDGs are criticized for trying to accomplish too much at once. Efforts have been made to help policymakers prioritize development challenges. The Obama Administration emphasizes selectivity and division of labor among donors in its new development strategy. Prioritizing programs can be challenging. Prioritizing programs in development can be challenging due to strong supporters and interrelated activities. The focus on HIV/AIDS by the Bush Administration has led to progress but may have come at the expense of basic healthcare, education, and nutrition. Limited advancement towards the MDGs is attributed to the lack of accountability. Limited advancement towards the MDGs is attributed to the lack of accountability in government and aid programs. International efforts like the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness aim to monitor progress, but the MDGs do not address donor and recipient country responsibilities. Congress emphasizes accountability in foreign aid reform, with the Bush and Obama Administrations highlighting mutual accountability and evidence of impact in U.S. development policy. The global action plan on the MDGs lacks new ground on accountability despite the uneven evidence of MDG effectiveness. The United States continues to use the Goals as a development assistance paradigm, with a focus on accountability, good governance, and sustainability. The September High-level Meeting was an opportunity for the U.S. to demonstrate commitment to the Goals and lead the global development discussion towards these priorities."
