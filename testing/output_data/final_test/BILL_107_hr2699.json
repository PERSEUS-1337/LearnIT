Since World War II, the US has been a leader in international justice, pursuing justice for genocide and crimes in various countries. Bringing perpetrators to justice aligns with US national interests and values, as these crimes cause humanitarian tragedies affecting national interests. The International Criminal Court aims to investigate and prosecute individuals for such crimes. The International Criminal Court, established under the Rome Statute, aims to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The United States signed the Rome Statute in 2000, with 139 countries signing and 36 ratifying it. US officials and servicemembers should be protected and not targeted for politically motivated actions. The Rome Statute contains safeguards to protect US citizens from politically motivated prosecutions by the International Criminal Court. It ensures due process rights for Americans and requires the ICC to defer to US jurisdiction in cases involving US citizens or service personnel. The International Criminal Court can proceed in cases where the US decides not to prosecute due to unwillingness or inability. President Clinton and the Bush Administration have both indicated they will not seek ratification of the Rome Statute. Continued US engagement with the ICC can protect US interests during ongoing negotiations. The curr_chunk is a section defining terms, while the prev_chunk discusses the US stance on the International Criminal Court and the importance of engagement with the ICC to protect US interests. In this Act, key terms are defined including \"appropriate congressional committees,\" \"classified national security information,\" \"International Criminal Court,\" and \"party to the International Criminal Court.\" The Rome Statute, adopted in 1998, refers to the International Criminal Court. A United States servicemember is defined as someone subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The sense of Congress is to fully support the due process rights of US citizens before foreign tribunals, including the International Criminal Court. The US should participate in ICC negotiations to ensure adherence to US standards of due process and seek a definition of the crime of aggression. The curr_chunk focuses on seeking a definition of the crime of aggression under the Rome Statute that respects the right of self-defense of the United States and its allies, ensuring US interests are protected in ICC negotiations, providing legal assistance to US citizens facing prosecution without due process, and undertaking diplomatic negotiations to safeguard US interests in international legal matters. The curr_chunk emphasizes protecting US citizens, especially servicemembers, from frivolous prosecutions or prosecutions without due process in international legal matters. SEC. 5. Policy of judicial assistance and protection for United States citizens and servicemembers; study and report. The United States prohibits extradition of its citizens or servicemembers to the International Criminal Court if being investigated or prosecuted under U.S. law. If no basis for prosecution is found or if acquitted, extradition is not allowed. The U.S. has the right to investigate and prosecute its citizens under its own laws if accused under the Rome Statute. The United States retains the right to investigate and prosecute its citizens under U.S. law for crimes under the Rome Statute, unless the President deems it not in the national interest. The Attorney General, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of State are required to conduct a study to ensure the U.S. can fully exercise its rights under the Rome Statute. The Attorney General, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 180 days regarding a study on U.S. rights under the Rome Statute. If a case involving a U.S. citizen or servicemember is admissible by the International Criminal Court, the President must ensure due process for that individual. The President must ensure due process for a person entitled to assistance under title 10, including representation and exculpatory evidence. SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. The President must submit a report comparing due process protections under the Rome Statute to those for US servicemembers and citizens under various agreements and treaties. The report required by subsection (a) shall describe the due process protections provided to US citizens and servicemembers accused of crimes overseas, including rights such as jury trial, presumption of innocence, and protection against self-incrimination. SEC. 7. POLICY OF ASSISTANCE FOR THE PROSECUTION OF WAR CRIMINALS. The United States may provide support and assistance to the International Criminal Court for the prosecution of accused war criminals, including financial support, extradition compliance, intelligence sharing, legal aid, and other assistance when deemed in the interest of the United States. SEC. 8 prohibits the transfer of certain classified national security information to the International Criminal Court. SEC. 9. ALLIANCE COMMAND ARRANGEMENTS. The President must report on military alliances regarding the command arrangements and potential exposure of US Armed Forces to foreign military officers under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. The President is required to report on modifications to command and operational control arrangements within military alliances to reduce risks to US Armed Forces. The report must be submitted in classified form. The description of measures under subsection (b) may be submitted in classified form. Prior to submitting the Rome Statute to the Senate for ratification, the President must certify that the International Criminal Court has a fair and impartial record in prosecuting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity."
