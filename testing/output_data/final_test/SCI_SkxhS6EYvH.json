The IB curve is drawn by maximizing the IB Lagrangian for different Lagrange multipliers, allowing selection of the desired predictability and compression. When Y is a deterministic function of X, alternative Lagrangians like the squared IB Lagrangian are used. This paper introduces a family of Lagrangians to explore the IB curve in all scenarios. The information bottleneck (IB) problem involves finding compressed representations T of variable X to predict Y, maximizing I(T;Y) while ensuring I(X;T) <= r. A family of Lagrangians is introduced to explore the IB curve in all scenarios, proving a one-to-one mapping between Lagrange multiplier and compression rate r for known IB curve shapes. The IB functional involves selecting the representation that best fits the requirements by maximizing I(T;Y) subject to I(X;T) \u2264 r. The IB curve is defined by the solutions of the IB functional for varying values of r. The Information plane is defined by the axes I(T;Y) and I(X;T). To simplify the constrained optimization problem, the IB Lagrangian is introduced. The IB Lagrangian is defined as L \u03b2 IB (T) = I(T;Y) - \u03b2I(X;T), where \u03b2 controls the trade-off between retaining information of Y and compressing X. Solutions of the IB Lagrangian optimization are also solutions of the IB functional, as the IB functional is concave. The problem of maximizing the IB Lagrangian is typically solved using various algorithms such as the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, deterministic annealing approaches, or greedy agglomerative clustering. However, for high-dimensional random variables like images, deep learning techniques using the IB Lagrangian as the objective function are more effective. The IB Lagrangian optimization results in a representation T with a specific performance for a given \u03b2, but there is no direct mapping between \u03b2 and the compression level r. Multiple iterations are needed to achieve the desired compression level. The Lagrange multiplier selection is crucial for optimizing the IB Lagrangian, as different values of \u03b2 can lead to varying performance levels. Kolchinsky et al. (2019) introduced the squared IB Lagrangian to address issues in deterministic scenarios, where multiple \u03b2 values can result in the same performance level. The article introduces a general family of Lagrangians, the convex IB Lagrangians, which can explore the IB curve in any scenario. This family includes the squared IB Lagrangian as a particular case. The analysis for deriving these Lagrangians can inspire new families to solve other objective functions with trade-offs like the IB Lagrangian. In deterministic scenarios, the convex IB Lagrangian can achieve desired performance levels with a single optimization, eliminating the need for multiple optimizations. Discontinuities in performance levels are connected to intrinsic clusterization of representations in the IB bottleneck objective. The article motivates IB usage in supervised learning and outlines important results about the IB curve. In Section 3, important results on the IB curve in deterministic scenarios are outlined. Section 4 introduces the convex IB Lagrangian and its properties. Section 5 provides empirical evidence on the MNIST dataset to support claims. The PyTorch implementation can be downloaded at https://gofile.io/?c=G9Dl1L. Supervised learning aims to learn a conditional distribution of task outputs given input features. Regression is for continuous-valued Y, while classification is for discrete Y. Methods use intermediate representations like hidden layers in neural networks or transformations in feature space. A stochastic function T of input features X follows the Markov condition Y \u2194 X \u2194 T. In representation-based machine learning methods, the Markov Chain is Y \u2194 X \u2194 T \u2194 \u0176. The conditional probability p(Y|X) is estimated by marginalizing the representations. An instantaneous cost function j\u03b8(x, y) measures the loss in predicting task outputs. Minimizing the expectation of the cost function is the goal. The cost function is defined based on input features and task outputs, with the goal of minimizing the empirical cost function using a finite dataset. The discrepancy between the normal and empirical cost functions is known as the generalization gap, which indicates how well the model generalizes to new samples. Regularization is a modification to learning algorithms aimed at reducing the generalization gap without compromising performance on the empirical cost function. The representation cross-entropy cost function involves statistically dependent variables and encoding/decoding distributions in the model. The cross-entropy cost function, parametrized by \u03b8, is used in classification tasks and aims to maximize mutual information I(T ; Y ). Nuisance variables, like \u039e, impact observed data X but are not relevant to the task at hand. The cross-entropy cost function aims to maximize mutual information I(T; Y) in classification tasks. Minimizing I(X; T) helps in generalization by removing irrelevant information of nuisances like \u039e from input representations. Jointly maximizing I(T; Y) and minimizing I(X; T) is beneficial for performance on both existing and new data, motivating research on the Information Bottleneck. Kolchinsky et al. (2019) demonstrated that the IB curve is piecewise linear when Y is a deterministic function of X. The IB curve is piecewise linear in deterministic scenarios, defined by a specific equation. It cannot be explored using the IB Lagrangian for multiple \u03b2 due to lack of strict concavity. The IB curve can be explored using convex IB Lagrangians, which are defined by a monotonically increasing and strictly convex function. This family of Lagrangians allows for different levels of compression and performance exploration along the IB curve. The IB curve can be explored using convex IB Lagrangians defined by a monotonically increasing and strictly convex function. The solutions of arg max T \u2208\u2206 {L can recover the IB curve, achieving the solution for each point (I(X; T ), IB,h (T )). By exploiting IB curve duality, other families of Lagrangians can be derived to explore the IB curve further. If h is the identity function, the normal IB Lagrangian is obtained, but it does not ensure exploration of the IB curve. Convex IB Lagrangians allow exploration of the IB curve with different levels of compression and performance. The convex IB Lagrangians allow for exploration of the IB curve with different \u03b2 h values, identifying specific points on the curve. A bijective mapping exists between Lagrange multipliers \u03b2 h and points on the IB curve, allowing for a deeper understanding of the relationship between compression and performance. The convex IB Lagrangians enable exploration of the IB curve with different Lagrange multipliers, allowing for a deeper understanding of the relationship between compression and performance. The domain of Lagrange multipliers that allow for this exploration can be determined if the shape of the IB curve is known, otherwise, it can be bounded. The convex IB Lagrangians facilitate exploration of the IB curve with various Lagrange multipliers, providing insight into the compression-performance relationship. Corollaries 1 and 2 help narrow down the search range for \u03b2 when investigating the IB curve. An algorithm is suggested for approximating inf \u2126x\u2282X {\u03b2 0 (\u2126 x )}, with a recommendation for simplicity. The proofs for these corollaries can be found in Appendices C and D. The MNIST dataset is used to demonstrate the claims, modifying the nonlinear-IB method to minimize cross-entropy and a differentiable kernel-based estimate of I(X; T). The technique involves maximizing a lower bound on convex IB Lagrangians by applying functions to the I(X; T) estimate. The network architecture includes a three fully-connected layer encoder and a deterministic decoder. Results for different values of \u03b1 and \u03b7 are provided in Appendix F. In Figure 1, specific convex IB Lagrangians are shown. Note that in a related study, the dual problem is considered, and adjustments are made for the encoder. The encoder must be stochastic for well-defined mutual information and effective optimization methods. Clusters were obtained using the DBSCAN algorithm. Lagrangians explore the IB curve, with some mismatches between theoretical and experimental performance due to factors like inaccurate estimation of I(X; T) and restrictions on T's structure. The main difference in performance for increasing \u03b2 is due to discontinuities, with the bottleneck variable showing clusterization in classification tasks. The quantized performance levels match the number of clusters, with maximum performance when clusters equal Y's cardinality. The exact relationship between these phenomena is not mathematically proven, but it aligns with previous research. In order to achieve desired performance with the convex IB Lagrangian objective, one should adjust the value of \u03b2 h accordingly. In a deterministic setting, use the appropriate \u03b2 h for performance and gradually decrease it if needed. In a stochastic setting, select representations that best fit interests from the IB curve. Different criteria can be used to choose the function h, such as the exponential IB Lagrangian. The exponential IB Lagrangian may be preferable over the power IB Lagrangian for drawing the IB curve due to its finite range of \u03b2 h. There is a trade-off between how closely the selected h function resembles the identity and how fast it grows, impacting performance levels. The IB Lagrangian is widely used but cannot achieve varying performance levels in deterministic scenarios. Refer to Appendix G for a more detailed explanation. In this article, a general family of Lagrangians is introduced to achieve varying performance levels in any scenario and optimize for specific performance levels in known IB curve scenarios. The \u03b2 h domain is explored when the IB curve is known, reducing the need for multiple optimizations and computational effort. Insight is provided on discontinuities in performance levels with Lagrange multipliers, connected to the intrinsic clusterization of the bottleneck. The Lagrange multipliers are connected to the intrinsic clusterization of the bottleneck variable. The optimization problem is modified by assuming a monotonically non-decreasing function. If there exists a T* that maximizes the Lagrangian over all T and I(X; T*) \u2264 r, then certain inequalities hold. The optimization is done over L, exploiting that certain terms do not depend on T. The Lagrange multipliers are connected to the intrinsic clusterization of the bottleneck variable. The optimization problem is modified by assuming a monotonically non-decreasing function. If there exists a T* that maximizes the Lagrangian over all T and I(X; T*) \u2264 r, then certain inequalities hold. The optimization is done over L, exploiting that certain terms do not depend on T. In equation (16), we maximize over L to find a solution for FIB,max(r) under specific conditions on concave and convex functions. The conditions for maximizing the Lagrangian over the IB curve involve finding a unique beta value for each point, ensuring a non-zero derivative of h with respect to I(X; T), and requiring h to be monotonically increasing. This ensures continuity of beta with respect to I(X; T). The function of I(X; T) is a strictly decreasing function of I(X; T), requiring h to be a strictly convex and monotonically increasing function. Each point on the IB curve has a unique beta value that maximizes the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is strictly concave with respect to T, allowing for the determination of beta values that maximize the Lagrangian for fixed I(X; T). The function h is invertible and strictly decreasing, allowing for the solution of I(X; T) when \u03b2 h > 0 is known. Maximizing the Lagrangian directly maximizes I(T; Y), which is concave for T \u2208 \u2206. The maximum I(T; Y) is less than or equal to I(X; Y), achievable when Y is a deterministic function of T. For \u03b2 h = 0, maximizing L IB,h (T) obtains the point (r max, I max) on the IB curve. The function h is invertible and strictly decreasing, allowing for the solution of I(X; T) when \u03b2 h > 0 is known. Maximizing the Lagrangian directly maximizes I(T; Y), which is concave for T \u2208 \u2206. The maximum I(T; Y) is less than or equal to I(X; Y), achievable when Y is a deterministic function of T. For \u03b2 h = 0, maximizing L IB,h (T) obtains the point (r max, I max) on the IB curve. Moreover, there exists a minimum \u03b2 h such that the exploration of the IB curve is ensured. The region for all possible IB curves, regardless of the relationship between X and Y, is determined by hard limits imposed by the DPI and the non-negativity of mutual information. The minimum and maximum values of the slope of the Pareto frontier define the minimum and maximum values of f IB. The IB curve in the information plane is graphically represented, showing tight bounds and informative values. The slope of the Pareto frontier can be bounded using results from previous studies. The IB curve in the information plane is graphically represented, showing tight bounds and informative values. The dual IB functional allows for the exploration of the IB curve by formulating new Lagrangians. The IB curve duality theorem states that minimizing the dual IB Lagrangian is equivalent to maximizing the IB Lagrangian. The original Lagrangian for maximizing the IB curve was defined by Tishby et al. (2000). Using the maximization version is preferred due to the bounded domain of useful \u03b2. The IB curve exploration can be ensured by defining relationships between Lagrange multipliers of different Lagrangians.\u03b2 g , \u03b2 g,dual , \u03b2 h,dual are the Lagrange multipliers involved. The IB curve is maximized without transformations due to its meaningful interpretation. Lagrangians with unbounded domains like \u03b2 g and \u03b2 h,dual are less preferable. Empirical support was generated using the nonlinear IB on the MNIST dataset, consisting of hand-written digits labeled from 0 to 9. Training was done with the Adam optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 10^-4 and a 0.6 decay rate every 10 iterations. After training the nonlinear IB on the MNIST dataset with Adam optimization, a decay rate was introduced every 10 iterations. Gradients of I\u03b8(X; T) and cross entropy were estimated using the same mini-batch. The covariance of the mixture of Gaussians for kernel density estimation was set to (exp(\u22121))^2. We used Glorot & Bengio's weight initialization method and trained for 100 epochs. The PyTorch implementation can be found at https://gofile.io/?c=G9Dl1L. Clustering was performed using the DBSCAN algorithm with specific parameters. Figure 5 illustrates exploring the IB curve with different \u03b1 values for the power IB. In Figures 5, 6, and 7, the IB curve is explored with varying values of \u03b1 and \u03b7 for different Lagrangians. The connection between performance discontinuities and clusterization is highlighted. The exponential IB Lagrangian outperforms the power IB Lagrangian. Finding the right balance in the h function is crucial for avoiding value convergence and achieving strong convexity. This balance is determined by the growth rate of h compared to the identity function. The example of classification on MNIST is used to explain this concept. The power and exponential IB Lagrangians are compared on MNIST dataset. A bijective mapping between their Lagrange multipliers and compression level in classification is obtained. Plotting I(X; T) vs. \u03b2 h for different hyperparameters shows convergence of values with increased growth, impacting performance levels. The estimation of IB Lagrangian may result in slight variations in \u03b2 h values for a specific I(X; T). Theoretical and practical value of \u03b2 h for specific I(X; T) may vary slightly. Selecting a function with high growth can lead to significant performance changes. A function is \u00b5-strong convex if f(r) is twice continuously differentiable and f(r) \u2265 \u00b5 \u2265 0 \u2200r. Observations show that small growth in function h(r) leads to poor performance in convex IB Lagrangian. Strict convexity of function h is required to ensure a unique \u03b2 h for each I(X; T) value. Strong convexity is necessary for exploring the IB curve when estimating the Lagrangian. The power and exponential functions h(r) = (1+\u03b1)\u03b1r \u03b1\u22121 and h(r) = \u03b7 2 exp(\u03b7r) are inherently 0-strong convex for r > 0 and \u03b1, \u03b7 > 0. However, values of \u03b1 < 1 and \u03b7 < 1 could lead to low \u00b5-strong convexity in certain domains of r. Using low \u03b1 values can result in poor performance for the power IB Lagrangian as it approaches 0-strong convexity as r increases."
