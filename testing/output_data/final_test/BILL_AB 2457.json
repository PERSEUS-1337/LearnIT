    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 27521 of the Government Code is amended to include procedures for postmortem examinations or autopsies on unidentified bodies. This includes fingerprinting, dental examinations, DNA testing, facial photographs, and documentation of scars, marks, and personal effects. The procedures for postmortem examinations or autopsies on unidentified bodies include precise documentation of observations, location, and full body X-rays. Electronic image systems may be used at the discretion of the coroner or medical examiner, but it is not mandatory. (3) Autopsies cannot be conducted using electronic imaging in cases where criminal activity is suspected, and a dissection autopsy must be performed instead to collect evidence for court presentation. (4) X-ray computed tomography scanning systems can be used for autopsies even if a religious belief certificate is present. The coroner, medical examiner, or other agency must prepare a final report of investigation in a specified format, listing the information collected during the postmortem examination or autopsy. The body of an unidentified deceased person must retain jaws and tissue samples for possible future use, unless significant deterioration is present. The coroner or medical examiner must keep these samples for one year after identification or indefinitely. If the identity of an unidentified deceased person cannot be established through dental examination, the coroner must submit dental charts and X-rays to the Department of Justice within 45 days. If the identity of a body or human remains cannot be established through dental examination, the coroner must submit the final report of investigation to the Department of Justice within 180 days, including information from the postmortem examination, anthropology report, fingerprints, photographs, and autopsy report."
