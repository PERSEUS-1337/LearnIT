    "content": "The \"Protecting America's Families from Toxic Chemicals Act of 2014\" aims to limit the uses of chemical substances with evidence of persistence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and exposure to critical or essential uses. The Act defines key terms and identifies restrictions on persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemical substances. The Administrator will establish criteria to identify chemical substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic, or transform into such substances, with evidence of exposure to humans or the environment. The Administrator will consider a chemical substance to be bioaccumulative if it significantly accumulates in biota, persistent if it significantly persists in environmental media, and toxic if it poses a risk to human health or the environment. The Administrator may revise criteria to reflect best available science for chemical substances demonstrating toxicological properties in humans or animals. Within 180 days of finalizing the rule, a list of substances meeting criteria will be published. The Administrator updates and republishes a list of chemical substances meeting criteria every 3 years. Chemical substances like Anthracene, Asbestos, Cadmium, Chloroalkanes, p-Dichlorobenzene, and Hexabromocyclododecane are considered to meet the criteria based on existing evidence. The list of restricted chemical substances includes Hexabromocyclododecane, Hexachlorobutadiene, Lead compounds, Mercury compounds, Musk xylene, Pentachlorobenzene, Phenanthrene, Polybrominated biphenyls, Polybrominated diphenylethers, Polychlorinated terphenyls, Tetrabromobisphenol A, Trichlorobenzenes, and Tetrachlorobenzenes. These restrictions must be implemented within a year. The Administrator must identify allowed uses for listed chemical substances within a year of enactment. They must also specify a deadline, not exceeding 5 years, for ceasing manufacturing, processing, and distribution for any uses not identified. Conditions may be imposed on the allowed uses. The Administrator determines allowed uses for chemical substances to protect public health and the environment. They must make this determination public, including the basis, list of allowed uses, and any conditions. The Administrator may allow manufacturing based on orders issued. The Administrator may allow manufacturing, processing, and distribution of a chemical substance for a specified use if it is deemed critical, essential, or has no discernible exposure to humans or the environment. Allowable uses of identified chemical substances shall include specific uses of lead or cadmium unless determined otherwise by the Administrator. The Administrator may allow specific uses of lead, cadmium, mercury compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid in various products exempted from the Restriction on Hazardous Substances Directive, Directive 2011/65/EU. Lead-acid batteries are also permitted for use. The Administrator may allow specific exemptions for the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of chemical substances if clear evidence is provided that the use qualifies as allowable under certain requirements. The Administrator, for petitions involving restricted chemical substances, consults with State agencies, publishes notice in Federal Register, makes petition available, allows review and comment, and considers feedback before allowing specific chemical substance use. The Administrator considers comments received to determine conditions for allowed use, which is granted for up to 5 years and can be renewed if it continues to meet requirements after public notice and comment. The Administrator may revise any allowed use under consideration for renewal to ensure it continues to meet requirements, taking into account regulatory programs and international agreements. The Administrator must establish criteria to identify critical uses of chemical substances within 180 days of this Act's enactment. These criteria will determine uses essential for national security, economic stability, or public health and safety when no feasible alternatives are available. The Administrator will establish criteria within 180 days to identify uses of chemical substances with no discernible exposure to humans or the environment. This applies to new chemical substances under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The Administrator will determine if a chemical substance meets criteria during the notice review period. For identified substances, the Administrator will allow manufacturing, processing, and distribution for approved uses with specified conditions. The Administrator determines allowed uses and conditions for new chemical substances, which must be followed by manufacturers or processors. This information is made public, including the basis for the determination and any restrictions on manufacturing, processing, and distribution. The Administrator determines allowed uses and conditions for new chemical substances, which must be followed by manufacturers or processors, including restrictions on manufacturing, processing, distribution, and disposal."
