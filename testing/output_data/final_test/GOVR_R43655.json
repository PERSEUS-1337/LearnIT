    "content": "President Obama announced a summit with African heads of state in the United States to launch a new chapter in U.S.-African relations. The summit, themed \"Investing in the Next Generation,\" will focus on expanding trade and investment ties with Africa and addressing development challenges. It will include discourse between President Obama, African leaders, and the chairperson of the African Union Commission. The summit with African heads of state in the United States will focus on challenges related to Africa's development, particularly its youthful population. President Obama is expected to discuss issues from his 2012 U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa during the summit, which will include sessions on Investing in Africa's Future, Peace and Regional Stability, and Governing for the Next Generation. The U.S.-Africa summit will focus on mutual exchange of ideas to build cooperative relations. No bilateral meetings between President Obama and African heads of state are planned to give all leaders an equal voice. Cabinet members will hold bilateral meetings with some countries' leaders. Side meetings will address issues like Ebola in West Africa and Boko Haram in the Sahel. The summit aims to define shared U.S.-African views on achieving common goals such as governance, economic growth, peace, and security. The U.S.-Africa summit, based on President Obama's 2012 Africa Strategy, aims for economic growth, peace, security, and development. It signifies ongoing U.S.-African cooperation and increased engagement with Africa, especially in trade and investment. The summit is a response to Africa's growing economic and political ties with major global powers. The Administration invited AU Commission chairperson and African heads of state, except suspended governments, to the event. The U.S.-Africa summit invited African heads of state, excluding those from suspended governments or under U.S. or U.N. sanctions. 45 heads of state were expected to attend the summit, with bipartisan support shown through a Senate resolution. Several official and unofficial events are scheduled during the U.S.-Africa summit. This includes a White House-coordinated Congressional Reception for African Leaders, discussions on bills before Congress, and civil society thematic working groups presenting recommendations on various issues. Additionally, a public meeting led by the National Endowment for Democracy will focus on topics like human rights and elections. A National Endowment for Democracy (NED)-led public meeting in the Cannon House Office Building will include multi-stakeholder discussions and debates. Feedback will be used to create an \"Action Program for Democracy in Africa\" to be shared with African governments, the international community, and civil society. Representatives Karen Bass, Chris Smith, Gregory W. Meeks, and Steny Hoyer are expected to deliver remarks at various events during the U.S.-Africa summit. Over 50 forums on various topics are scheduled during or after the summit, including business opportunities in Africa, public policy issues, and civil society advocacy. Two U.S. Trade and Development Agency-sponsored trade missions by African delegations to Houston and Chicago are also planned. The Obama Administration has launched several large development initiatives in Africa, such as Feed the Future, Global Climate Change, and Global Health initiatives including PEPFAR. President Obama also announced Power Africa, Trade Africa, and expanded the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). Vice President Joe Biden and three African heads of state are expected to speak at an event on The Future of Business and Development in Africa at Georgetown University. President Obama may announce new U.S. commitments to Africa at the summit, but the Administration does not plan to announce any new large-scale initiatives. This decision may be due to budget constraints and a desire to redefine U.S.-African cooperation with mutual contributions toward shared goals. This approach is reflected in various Administration initiatives in Africa and the MCC's country-centered design paradigm. During the Bush Administration, various countries including China, Japan, the European Union, France, and India have engaged in high-level summits with African leaders, focusing on trade, investment, and development cooperation. China, in particular, has made significant policy pledges and financial commitments to Africa, with top Chinese leaders visiting the continent annually. China has made significant policy pledges and financial commitments to Africa, with top Chinese leaders visiting the continent annually. The Administration's reported plan to refrain from offering concrete \"deliverables\" at the summit has drawn questions from observers. Some doubt if the summit will adequately facilitate business-focused deal-making with African leaders. The U.S.-Africa Business Forum summit event is expected to announce $900 million or more in business deals. Critics question the effectiveness of the summit's planning and decision not to pursue one-on-one meetings with African heads of state. Some view the summit as lacking in positive engagement opportunities. Some African leaders invited to the U.S.-Africa Business Forum summit have been criticized for human rights abuses and lack of democratic governance. Activists are advocating for a focus on the rights of African women and LGBT individuals. The U.S. Administration defends its decision to engage with all African governments, stating that human rights concerns will be addressed. Critics argue that the U.S. emphasis on democracy and human rights may hinder business prospects compared to China's approach. In contrast to China's approach, the U.S.-Africa Business Forum summit invites African leaders with human rights concerns. Sub-Saharan African countries have seen economic growth, but challenges remain in achieving inclusive growth and poverty alleviation. Despite economic growth in sub-Saharan African countries, challenges persist in achieving inclusive growth and poverty alleviation. Most African countries are classified as \"lower-middle-income\" or \"low-income\" by the World Bank, with only a few exceptions. The region also faces significant youth population, presenting both promise and challenges related to education, job creation, and socio-political enfranchisement. Africa remains among the poorest global regions, with limited progress towards U.N. development goals. Many African countries struggle to achieve the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, facing challenges like poverty, lack of institutional capacity, corruption, and weak democratic institutions. The U.S. trade and investment policy towards Africa focuses on economic development goals and promoting trade with the United States to encourage economic growth and investment opportunities. Members of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees have held hearings on these topics, with bills introduced to support these efforts. Africa is a key supplier of U.S. natural resource imports. Despite improvements in some African countries' economic and political climates, many U.S. businesses remain skeptical of investing in the region due to economic governance challenges and security crises. In 2013, the United States had a trade deficit with sub-Saharan Africa, importing $39 billion worth of goods and exporting $24 billion. Major U.S. exports to Africa include machinery, vehicles, refined fuel products, aircraft, and wheat, while U.S. imports are mainly concentrated in oil. The United States has a trade deficit with sub-Saharan Africa, importing $39 billion worth of goods and exporting $24 billion. Major U.S. imports from Africa are mainly concentrated in oil, metals, vehicles, and cocoa. Nigeria and South Africa are the largest U.S. trade partners in the region, with Nigeria also being a major oil exporter to the United States. The stock of U.S. foreign direct investment in Africa is concentrated in countries like Nigeria, Mauritius, South Africa, and Ghana. Despite economic growth, challenges persist in making the region attractive for investment. In recent years, multiple factors make many countries in sub-Saharan Africa difficult places to do business, limiting investment despite new economic opportunities. Key challenges include poor infrastructure such as land transport, maritime transport, and electricity, leading to high production costs and shipment delays. Additionally, low per capita incomes result in a smaller and fragmented market size in the region. Efforts to improve regional integration are ongoing. Fragmented efforts to improve regional integration in sub-Saharan Africa. Foreign business interest mainly focuses on major economies like South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. Lack of skilled labor due to high illiteracy rates and under-investment in education. Dependence on unrefined commodity production limits growth of skilled workforce. Many economies reliant on low-profit agriculture. Limited access to capital markets and inputs. Limited access to capital markets and inputs hinders agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa. Governments' inadequate support for private sector activity, corruption, and inefficient trade procedures further impede economic growth in the region. Political instability and conflict also undermine business confidence. The President's 2012 Africa Strategy aims to enhance legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for trade and investment in Africa. The strategy also focuses on improving economic governance, regional economic integration, and African participation in global markets. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) is a key component of U.S.-Africa trade policy, with efforts to reauthorize it before its expiration in 2015. The Administration has launched initiatives like the Doing Business in Africa campaign and Trade Africa Initiative to promote African trade and investment. Efforts include African Trade Hubs, USAID and MCC programs for trade capacity building, and trade agreements like TIFAs and bilateral investment treaties. The U.S. has an FTA with Morocco. The United States has a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Morocco but no existing FTAs with sub-Saharan African countries. AGOA is a non-reciprocal trade preference program for eligible sub-Saharan African countries, aimed at promoting African development and strengthening trade ties. AGOA has been amended multiple times since its inception in 2000 and is authorized until September 30, 2015. Crude oil is the top U.S. import under AGOA, followed by vehicles. AGOA imports make up over 75% of total imports in 2013, including vehicles, metals, refined petroleum products, and apparel. Apparel comes mainly from Kenya, Lesotho, and Mauritius. AGOA provides technical and trade capacity building assistance to African countries to liberalize trade policies, harmonize laws with WTO commitments, and promote agribusiness linkages. The President is required to hold an annual U.S.-Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum in consultation with Congress and AGOA beneficiary governments. The AGOA legislation establishes a biennial Forum to discuss trade and investment relations between the U.S. and Africa. The 13th AGOA Forum will be held in Washington, DC, focusing on AGOA renewal and expansion. Some African countries' reluctance to implement the WTO trade facilitation agreement may impact AGOA's renewal. Despite general support for AGOA renewal, ongoing debate surrounds potential changes to the program, including country eligibility and reauthorization duration. Some argue for changes to eligibility requirements and a longer reauthorization period to encourage more businesses to utilize AGOA. However, critics warn that such changes could diminish the program's use for non-economic foreign policy goals like democracy and human rights promotion. Some critics argue that AGOA benefits have been hesitantly suspended over human rights concerns. There is debate over the effectiveness of Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance in increasing program utilization. Strategies to increase use include creating country export plans and targeting TCB towards competitive sectors. AGOA covers most products, but some, mostly agricultural products, remain excluded. Including more products could increase program utilization, but might face opposition from U.S. producers. Some argue for extending duty-free quota-free benefits beyond Africa, but concerns exist about competitiveness. Reciprocal access and two-way trade are being considered to enhance AGOA's focus on African economic growth. The U.S. is considering reciprocal trade requirements with some AGOA-eligible countries, like South Africa, to avoid potential disadvantages for U.S. exports to Africa. Aid for African development is mainly administered by USAID, the State Department, and the MCC, targeting specific development needs through country strategies and presidential initiatives. The MCC supports limited compacts for crucial development goals carried out by recipient countries under oversight. Sub-Saharan Africa receives a significant portion of U.S. bilateral aid, primarily for health programs. The Department of Defense implements some State Department-funded assistance programs and provides its own aid to foreign militaries, including in Africa. North African countries also receive substantial U.S. aid, with a focus on security. In FY2013, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco received $1.59 billion in U.S. bilateral foreign aid, with Egypt being a top recipient. Aid for Tunisia has exceeded $450 million since 2011, while Morocco received support for a $700 million MCC compact. African countries also benefit from U.S. aid through initiatives like the Global Health Initiative. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) was established in 2009 to coordinate global health programs like PEPFAR, the President's Malaria Initiative, and the Neglected Tropical Diseases Program. GHI focuses on strengthening health systems in developing countries and promoting country ownership of health assistance programs. Key program areas include maternal and child health, family planning, HIV/AIDS prevention, and pandemic outbreak efforts. Feed the Future (FtF) is a USAID-led initiative launched in 2009 to reduce poverty as part of the Group of Eight (G-8) commitments. The Feed the Future initiative, led by USAID, aims to reduce poverty and malnutrition by boosting agricultural production in 19 focus countries, including 12 in Africa. It also supports the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in Africa. The Global Climate Change Initiative focuses on building resilience to climate shocks in regions like Africa. President Obama initiated several Africa-specific initiatives in 2013, including Power Africa, a multi-agency initiative to double access to electricity in energy-poor Africa by providing up to $7.8 billion in U.S. technical and financial support. The goal is to spur the expansion of power generation infrastructure and reform investment constraints. Power Africa aims to use public resources to attract private investments in the power sector in six focus countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, and Tanzania. Two bills, Energize Africa Act of 2014 and Electrify Africa Act of 2014, align with Power Africa's goals and seek to continue U.S. support for electrification in Africa. Trade Africa focuses on expanding U.S. trade and investment activities in Africa, with an initial focus on the East African Community. The USAID-led East Africa Trade and Investment Hub aims to deepen the U.S.-EAC Trade and Investment Partnership by expanding intra-EAC trade and increasing U.S. imports of AGOA-eligible EAC products. It also focuses on reducing trade barriers, enhancing the regional business climate, and fostering U.S. investment in the region. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) supports the development of young African leaders through exchange-based fellowships. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) offers academic study, leadership training, and networking opportunities in the United States and Africa. Administered by the State Department and USAID, the program provides access to resources, funding, internships, and professional opportunities for Fellows. The program is expanding to accommodate 1,000 fellows in 2015 and will be renamed the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders. Additionally, new online courses, mentoring, networking resources, and regional Leadership Centers will be launched to support program fellows. Since the early 1990s, African countries have transitioned to multiparty political systems with regular elections. Some countries like Senegal, Cabo Verde, and Ghana have seen peaceful transfers of power. Southern African states have strong institutions but are dominated by single parties. Democratic accountability varies among Africa's 54 countries, with a focus on democracy, rule of law, and human rights in U.S. policy towards Africa. Despite progress in some African countries towards democracy, challenges remain in developing accountable institutions. Many elections are marred by fraud, violence, or irregularities, leading to concerns about the credibility of the electoral process in countries like Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria. Some countries lack viable democratic competition or independent civil society, hindering the establishment of functional democratic systems. In Eritrea, The Gambia, and Sudan, democratic competition and civil society activism are limited. Governance challenges in Africa include inadequate state institutions due to corruption, mismanagement, and lack of resources. Transnational drug trafficking has also weakened institutional capacity in some countries. Corruption remains a significant issue in countries like Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, and Burundi. Conflict and state collapse are prevalent in Somalia. The 2012 Africa Strategy aims to strengthen democratic institutions in countries like Liberia, Malawi, and Mali, where state weakness and conflict hinder social services. U.S. policy makers use tools like diplomacy and reports to promote democracy and human rights in Africa. Diplomats publicly criticize undemocratic actions and raise human rights concerns in private meetings with African leaders. The State Department publishes annual reports on human rights conditions globally. The State Department and USAID finance international election observer missions in Africa, support African electoral institutions, train political parties and civil society organizations, and provide expert advice on governance. U.S. security aid programs aim to improve human rights records of African security forces. Congress has imposed human rights-related aid restrictions on countries like Chad, Egypt, and Zimbabwe. The United States imposes aid restrictions on African countries like Guinea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe due to human rights violations. Sanctions target individuals involved in human rights abuses in countries such as the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zimbabwe. The US has funded special tribunals for human rights violations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Rwanda. The United States has provided support for ICC prosecutions in Africa, tried individuals accused of human rights abuses in Rwanda and Liberia, and imposed aid restrictions on countries like Guinea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe for human rights violations. Conflict and instability in Africa threaten regional security and contribute to widespread human suffering, with many African countries ranking among the most fragile states globally. Multiple UN peacekeeping operations are located in Africa, with nine missions currently authorized in the region. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) conducts peacekeeping, stabilization, and counter-terrorist operations against Al Shabaab. The continent faces transnational threats due to weak governance, porous borders, and corruption, enabling terrorist groups, illicit trafficking, and maritime piracy. Extremist groups in Northwest and East Africa, such as AQIM, Al Shabaab, Boko Haram, and Ansar al Sharia in Libya and Tunisia, pose threats to state stability, regional security, and U.S. national security interests. Armed Islamist groups in North Africa and the Sahel region have grown in influence since 2011, sharing training, tactics, and weapons. Weak governance allows transnational crime networks to operate in some parts of the continent, posing a threat to state stability. U.S. concern has grown over potential links between terrorist groups like AQIM and rising transnational threats in Africa, including drug trafficking networks and wildlife trafficking. Africa's coastal waters are highly susceptible to illegal activities like fishing, trafficking, and piracy due to inadequate policing by African governments. Criminal elements exploit this lack of state controls to smuggle people. Criminal elements exploit the absence of state controls in the region's waters for smuggling people, drugs, and weapons, as well as dumping hazardous waste. Maritime piracy and sabotage are prevalent in some regions with high rates of incidents. Nigerian waters and the Gulf of Guinea are identified as the most dangerous areas for piracy and armed robbery at sea. Despite progress in reducing pirate attacks off the Somali coast, other areas like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, and Sudan continue to face instability and conflict. Recent conflicts in Africa, fueled by communal tensions and political grievances, have erupted in countries like the Central African Republic, Libya, Mali, and South Sudan. Other nations such as Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria are facing challenges in achieving economic and development goals due to armed insurgencies and extremist threats. These conflicts, along with existing social, economic, and political pressures, could threaten the stability of these countries. Extremist groups and restive communities also pose risks to political stability in the fragile Sahel states. The conflict in South Sudan, which began in late 2013, has resulted in thousands of deaths and millions displaced. In South Sudan, over 1.5 million people are displaced and 4 million face food insecurity. Famine conditions are possible in 2014. Neighboring Sudan, particularly Southern Kordofan, may also experience famine due to ongoing fighting. In Darfur, violence has led to significant population displacement. Al Shabaab remains a serious threat in Somalia. The threat posed by terrorist group Al Shabaab in war-torn Somalia remains serious, with ongoing progress in retaking territory and rebuilding the Somali state. Drought conditions and security restrictions worsen food security, with over 1 million displaced in Somalia and 1 million refugees in neighboring countries. Al Shabaab continues to conduct terrorist attacks in East Africa, notably in Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone. The overthrow of CAR's central government in March 2013 triggered a crisis in Central Africa. The March 2013 overthrow of CAR's central government in Africa led to widespread violence along ethno-religious lines, causing massive displacement and human suffering. In West Africa, Boko Haram, a violent extremist group in Nigeria, has become increasingly active and deadly in its attacks. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Central Africa, although somewhat contained, continues to terrorize civilian populations. Boko Haram, a group based in the northeast, has become more active and deadly in attacks since 2010, causing thousands of deaths and displacing over 300,000 people. In Mali, efforts are being made to recover from a previous crisis with assistance from French and U.N. forces, but peace negotiations with northern rebels are uncertain. Libya's post-conflict transition is hindered by armed groups, leading to concerns about it being a terrorist safe haven. The United States is concerned about Libya being a terrorist safe haven and the flow of weaponry from Libya into surrounding countries. Egypt is facing attacks from Islamist groups in the Sinai Peninsula, while Tunisia and Algeria are countering armed Islamist militants. The U.S. is investing resources in promoting peace and security in Africa and countering threats like drug traffickers and violent extremist groups. The United States plays a significant role in U.N. Security Council deliberations on African conflicts, providing funding for peacekeeping missions and offering training and support to African militaries through programs like ACOTA. U.S. efforts also aim to strengthen the role of the AU and sub-regional entities in conflict mediation and peacekeeping in Africa. The United States provides funding and training for African militaries through programs like ACOTA and aims to strengthen the role of the AU and sub-regional entities in conflict mediation and peacekeeping in Africa. Additionally, the State Department supports security sector reform efforts in countries like Liberia, the DRC, Somalia, and South Sudan, providing Foreign Military Financing and training for police and security forces. The Obama Administration's National Security Strategy focuses on advancing \"effective partnerships\" in Africa. The Security Strategy, issued in 2010, emphasizes building African security forces' capacity to deter and respond to crises. Recent years have seen increased DOD funding for capacity-building programs in Africa, mainly focused on counterterrorism. The DOD's view of Africa, as outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, highlights the threats posed by terrorists, criminal organizations, militias, corrupt officials, and pirates in ungoverned territories. Rapidly developing threats, such as violent protests and terrorist attacks in fragile states, could challenge U.S. interests. The Security Strategy emphasizes building African security forces' capacity to deter and respond to crises. U.S. Africa Command leads military efforts in Africa, focusing on strengthening peacekeeping, maritime security, counterterrorism, and counter-narcotics capacities to further U.S. security goals in the region. Multilateral peace operations play a key role in maintaining international security and preventing mass atrocities. AFRICOM focuses on rapid deployment of crisis response forces and conducts joint exercises with African militaries. The Obama Administration's strategy in Africa aims to dismantle Al Qaeda elements and empower local partners to counter terrorism. State Department and USAID programs seek to build regional intelligence and military capacities. The State Department leads regional counterterrorism programs in Africa, focusing on building intelligence and military capacities to combat terrorism and extremist ideologies. AFRICOM works indirectly by training and equipping African militaries to counter terrorism. The Department of Defense aims to rebalance its efforts globally towards building partnership capacity in fragile states while retaining robust capability for direct action. AFRICOM primarily works indirectly by training partner forces like AMISOM to combat extremism in Africa. U.S. ISR assets support counterterrorism operations in the region, with limited direct military action against terrorist targets.
