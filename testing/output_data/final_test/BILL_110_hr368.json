    "content": "The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for individuals eligible during a transitional period. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2007\" introduces amendments to Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act, including adjustments to the primary insurance amount calculation for certain individuals. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 2007\" amends the Social Security Act by adjusting the primary insurance amount calculation for specific individuals based on a product derived from the excess under former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year of eligibility for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for individuals eligible for benefits varies from 55% in 1979 to 5% in 1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference for each individual. The former law refers to the excess of an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount over the amount that would be their primary insurance amount if computed under current regulations. The applicable former law primary insurance amount is determined based on calculations from December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d), and modified accordingly. \"In determining an individual's primary insurance amount, certain provisions from December 1978 apply, with limitations on the computation base years and adjustments to the calculation table.\" \"In determining an individual's primary insurance amount, certain provisions from December 1978 apply, with limitations on the computation base years and adjustments to the calculation table. This paragraph applies to individuals if it results in a higher primary insurance amount than computed under a different paragraph. It also applies to individuals who elect to receive lump sum payments instead of the standard computation method.\" Upon receipt of a timely election filed by an individual described in paragraph (4)(B), the Commissioner certifies it to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary then pays the individual $5,000 in 4 annual lump sum installments of $1,250 from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. Any election filed after December 31, 2007, is null and void. The Commissioner certifies timely elections to the Secretary of the Treasury, who then pays beneficiaries $5,000 in 4 annual installments of $1,250 from the Trust Fund. If no timely election is filed by a deceased individual's beneficiaries, the Commissioner certifies all received elections to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment. The Commissioner certifies timely elections and pays beneficiaries $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Trust Fund. Amendments made by this Act shall be effective. The amendments made by this Act shall be effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before July 2008. Individuals entitled to benefits in June 2008 may have their benefits recomputed based on the Social Security Act. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to benefits in June 2008 to take into account the amendments made by the Act."
