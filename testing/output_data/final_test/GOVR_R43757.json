It establishes new requirements for state child welfare agencies, child support enforcement agencies, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) mandates state child welfare agencies to address sex trafficking concerns of children in foster care and those served by the agency. It also requires protocols to locate and serve runaway foster care children, report trafficking victims, and establish a national advisory committee on child sex trafficking. Additionally, the law promotes normalcy for children in foster care by changing state licensing laws for foster caregivers. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act mandates state child welfare agencies to address sex trafficking concerns of children in foster care. It also promotes normalcy for children in foster care by changing state licensing laws for foster caregivers and ensuring foster caregivers use a \"reasonable and prudent parenting standard\" for foster children's activities. Successful transitions to adulthood for older children in foster care are emphasized, with laws prohibiting certain permanency plans and requiring efforts to find permanent connections for youth age 16 or older. The law mandates state child welfare agencies to involve children in foster care at age 14 or older in their own case and permanency planning, informing them of their rights and providing key documents when they age out of foster care. It extends funding for programs supporting strong and permanent families for children, including the Adoption Incentives Payment program and the Family Connection grant program. States are required to spend a portion of adoption assistance savings on services to strengthen families and ensure children receiving federal guardianship assistance can continue with a legal relative guardian. The law mandates state child welfare agencies to involve children in foster care at age 14 or older in their own case and permanency planning, informing them of their rights and providing key documents when they age out of foster care. It extends funding for programs supporting strong and permanent families for children, including the Adoption Incentives Payment program and the Family Connection grant program. Federal guardianship assistance can continue with a legal relative guardian if the guardian becomes ill or incapacitated, and the child is placed with a successor guardian. HHS is directed to report on children placed in foster care due to disrupted legal guardianship or adoption. Improved child support collections include implementing the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other measures to increase effectiveness, especially for noncustodial parents in foreign countries and tribal governments. State child support enforcement agencies are required to adopt data standardization measures. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) includes provisions to address sex trafficking of children in foster care or involved in the child welfare system. State child welfare agencies are urged to respond to this concern, as children in foster care are at higher risk of becoming victims. Little information is available on specific responses to this issue. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) addresses sex trafficking of children in foster care or involved in the child welfare system. It defines a \"sex trafficking victim\" and amends federal foster care laws. P.L. 113-183 amends federal foster care laws to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures for identifying and providing services to children at risk of sex trafficking. Agencies must collaborate with various organizations and report cases to law enforcement within 24 hours. State child welfare agencies must report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours. They are also required to annually report the total number of sex trafficking victims among children and youth. Procedures for identifying and providing services to victims must apply to all children in the care of the state agency, including those in foster care. State child welfare agencies must report child or youth victims of sex trafficking to law enforcement within 24 hours. They are also required to annually report the total number of sex trafficking victims among children and youth, including those in foster care. Additionally, procedures for identifying and providing services to victims extend to individuals up to age 26 who are at risk of sex trafficking, regardless of their foster care history. State child welfare agencies must develop protocols for locating missing children from foster care, addressing factors contributing to their disappearance, and reporting any information on possible sex trafficking victims. They are also required to report missing and abducted children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authorities within 24 hours. The National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United States must be established within two years of the law's enactment. Its duties include advising on policies to improve the response to sex trafficking and developing recommendations for combating it. The National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United States will develop best practices and recommendations for states to combat sex trafficking, provide notice to state governors and child welfare agencies, and report on each state's implementation efforts. The committee will terminate within five years, but HHS will continue to update a website displaying state best practices and evaluations. Members of the advisory committee will be appointed by HHS in consultation with the Attorney General and the National Governors Association. The National Advisory Committee on Sex Trafficking of Children and Youth in the United States must be composed of 21 members, including a former victim of sex trafficking and two state governors. The committee will receive support from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and must meet at least twice a year. Reports of its work must be submitted to Congress, HHS, and the Attorney General. Members serve without compensation, and HHS must report annually on the number of child victims of sex trafficking. The law requires state child welfare agencies to report children in foster care who are victims of sex trafficking. It also mandates collecting national data on these children and their risk factors. HHS is directed to provide a report to Congress on efforts to provide specialized services for these children and ensure they have lasting connections with caring adults. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act utilizes information from AFCARS and state protocols to ensure appropriate activities for children in foster care. These children are placed in foster care due to abuse or neglect, with the state child welfare agency responsible for their safety. Concerns have been raised about limited opportunities for foster children to engage in age-appropriate activities. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act addresses concerns about limited opportunities for children in foster care to participate in age-appropriate activities. P.L. 113-183 introduces provisions for the \"reasonable and prudent parent standard\" to allow foster caregivers to make decisions on extracurricular and social activities for foster children. The law stipulates that \"age or developmentally-appropriate\" activities should be encouraged for children in foster care, without federal government control over educational content. State child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages and the reasonable and prudent parenting standard for prospective foster parents. The law requires states to provide training on children's developmental stages and the reasonable and prudent parenting standard for foster parents. States must revise licensing standards to allow foster parents to apply the standard and ensure children can participate in age-appropriate activities. The law mandates that child care institutions providing foster care designate an onsite caregiver trained in the reasonable and prudent parenting standard. It also allows states to use Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funds for age-appropriate activities for children in foster care until age 18, with an increased annual funding authorization to $143 million starting FY2020. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act increases annual funding for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to $143 million. It introduces new requirements for child sex trafficking and successful transition to adulthood for youth in foster care. Child welfare advocates support these changes to provide more support to young people in and leaving foster care. The law requires state child welfare agencies to ensure every child in foster care has a court-approved permanency plan, which aims to reunite the child with parents, place them for adoption, with a legal guardian, or a relative. If none of these options are possible, a court may establish \"another planned permanent living arrangement\" (APPLA) as the child's permanency plan. The APPLA designation was added to the law by the Adoption and Safe Families Act to strengthen permanency planning requirements in child welfare policy. Congress sought to strengthen permanency planning requirements in child welfare policy by adding \"APPLA\" to the law, ensuring thoughtful consideration before placing a child in long-term foster care. P.L. 113-183 prohibits states from using APPLA as a permanency plan for children under 16, requiring them to actively seek permanent family placements for children in care at age 16 or younger. P.L. 113-183 prohibits states from using APPLA as a permanency plan for children under 16, requiring active search for permanent family placements for children in care at age 16 or younger. Children under tribal responsibility have a delayed effective date. The law mandates additional requirements for children with an APPLA plan during annual permanency hearings and periodic reviews in foster care to ensure ongoing efforts to find a permanent family and involve the child in decision-making. P.L. 113-183 mandates that children in foster care aged 14 and older must be consulted in the development of their case and permanency plans, allowing them to choose members of the planning teams. It also requires the inclusion of a description of the child's desired permanency outcome in the case plan. The case plan for children in foster care aged 14 and older must include services for successful adulthood, rights regarding education, health, and safety, as well as desired permanency outcomes. The case plan for children in foster care aged 14 and older must include services for successful adulthood, rights regarding education, health, and safety, as well as desired permanency outcomes. Additionally, for children in care at age 14, the state child welfare agency must provide annual credit reports and help resolve inaccuracies. Upon discharge from foster care at age 18 or older, the state must provide official documents such as birth certificate, social security card, and health insurance information. The law requires states to provide official documents like birth certificates, social security cards, and health insurance information to children in foster care upon discharge at age 18 or older. Additionally, HHS is mandated to report on state implementation of allowing children aged 14 or older to select members of their case and permanency planning teams. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) extends child welfare programs, encourages children's placement in permanent families, and provides incentives to states for increased adoptions from foster care. Adoption Incentives Payment was revised and extended for three years, renamed as \"Adoption and Legal Guardianship Incentive Payments.\" The law revises categories for states to earn incentive payments, including exits from foster care to legal guardianship and focusing on moving children age 9 or older to permanent homes via adoption or guardianship. Incentive payment amounts are based on improvements in the rate of children moving to adoption or guardianship, rather than just an increase in the number of adoptions. Award categories include improving foster child adoptions and providing $5,000 for each improved adoption, as well as adding a new category for foster child guardianships with a $4,000 incentive payment for each guardianship. The law introduces new award categories for adoptions and foster child guardianships, with incentive payments of $7,500 for pre-adolescent adoptions/guardianships and $10,000 for older child adoptions/guardianships. These categories replace the previous \"older child\" category and aim to improve rates of children moving to permanent homes. The law introduces new award categories for adoptions and foster child guardianships, with incentive payments based on the age of the child. The award category for children under age nine with special needs would be eliminated. Any excess funds for incentive payments would be awarded to states with timely adoptions, defined as children moving from foster care to adoption in less than 24 months. In late FY2015, incentive payments for adoptions or guardianships completed in FY2014 are based on a combination of old and new structures. Payments in late FY2016 for adoptions or guardianships completed in FY2015 are entirely based on the new structure. States have up to 36 months to use incentive funds and must use them to supplement child welfare spending. Federal support for ongoing adoption assistance to children with special needs has been provided since 1980. In 2008, Congress adopted provisions to remove the income test requirement for children with special needs in low-income families. States must reinvest any savings from this change in federal eligibility rules into child welfare purposes. P.L. 113-183 revises prior law requirements on calculating state savings and their use. The new provisions under P.L. 113-183 require states to use a specified methodology approved by HHS to calculate and report any savings from adoption assistance. States must spend at least 30% of identified savings on post-adoption and post-guardianship services, with two-thirds of that amount allocated specifically for these services. HHS is required to post state information on savings calculation, effective as of October 1, 2014. The law also amends guardianship assistance provisions of the Title IV-E program. The law amends the guardianship assistance provisions of the Title IV-E program, ensuring that children under legal guardianship with a relative continue to receive assistance if the guardian dies or is incapacitated. The successor guardian must have been named in the kinship guardianship agreement. The law now requires states to provide notice to grandparents and other adult relatives of children removed from parental custody, including options for participating in the child's care. $15 million is appropriated for Family Connection Grants to continue for one year. Child welfare agencies and non-profit organizations can receive federal funding to help children in foster care or at risk of entering foster care connect with birth parents or extended kin. The funds are used for kinship navigator programs, family finding efforts, family decision-making policies, and family treatment programs. HHS is required to issue new regulations for data collection on children entering foster care after adoption or legal guardianship. Noncustodial parents must contribute to child support orders. The Child Support Enforcement program under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act helps custodial parents obtain child support by locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity, and enforcing support obligations. It can be challenging to enforce support when parents live in different countries. The provisions in P.L. 113-183 aim to ensure compliance with international child support treaties and improve the program's ability to collect support payments. The new law aims to enhance the Child Support Enforcement program's ability to collect child support from noncustodial parents living in foreign countries. While the program has procedures for international enforcement, the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement has bilateral agreements with only 15 countries. Many countries do not reciprocate the recognition of child support orders, highlighting the challenges in international child support enforcement. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of assistance is a cost-free option for U.S. citizens seeking child support in other countries. The Convention streamlines the process by providing a multilateral treaty, avoiding the need for individual bilateral agreements. The U.S. Senate approved the Resolution of Advice and Consent regarding the Convention on September 29, 2010. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance requires implementing legislation from Congress, adoption of the 2008 version of UIFSA by all states, and the President's signing of the instrument of ratification for the Convention to enter into force in the United States. P.L. 113-183 includes provisions to implement the Convention and other U.S. treaty obligations related to multilateral child support conventions. The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance requires states to adopt the 2008 amendments to the UIFSA for the Convention to enter into force in the United States. The Obama Administration will wait for states to comply with this requirement before ratifying the Convention. Once in force, it applies to cases involving parents from countries party to the Convention. Additionally, P.L. 113-183 allows the federal income tax refund offset program to be used by states for handling child support requests from foreign reciprocating and treaty countries. P.L. 113-183 grants Indian tribes access to the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) to locate noncustodial parents for child support. The FPLS assists in establishing paternity and enforcing child support orders, transmitting information only to authorized persons like child support agencies and courts. P.L. 113-183 allows Indian tribes to access the Federal Parent Locator Service for child support enforcement. It also requires the Secretary of HHS to designate standard data exchange elements for CSE information and federal reporting. The workgroup established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) aims to create data exchange standards that are cost-effective, improve program efficiency, and can be continually upgraded. These standards would incorporate widely accepted, nonproprietary formats and be interoperable with federal entities overseeing contracting and financial assistance. Congress has also introduced provisions for standardizing data exchange formats across programs like income security programs. The HHS Secretary, under P.L. 113-183, is required to review and provide recommendations for cost-effective improvements to the CSE program, including engaging noncustodial parents in their children's lives. A report to Congress must include a review of state CSE programs, collection practices, and policy options for program improvements. The HHS Secretary is required to review and provide recommendations for cost-effective improvements to the CSE program, including engaging noncustodial parents in their children's lives. This includes methods to involve noncustodial parents in parental time and visitation with children, reviewing state practices under the Passport Denial program, and identifying best practices for connecting parents to non-duplicative, evidence-based support programs. Automated systems for child support payments are recommended for efficiency. The P.L. 113-183 requires states to use automated systems for the collection and disbursement of child support payments through the State Disbursement Unit. Employers are mandated to transmit child support orders using uniform formats prescribed by the HHS Secretary. The legislation emphasizes the importance of establishing parenting time arrangements when obtaining child support orders, with strong family violence safeguards in place. States are encouraged to use existing funding sources to support the establishment of parenting time arrangements. The bill authorizes expansions in federal support for child welfare programs and activities, with costs projected to be offset by other provisions, resulting in a reduction in direct federal spending. Certain provisions of the bill require data collection and reporting under Title IV-E, including reporting on victims of sex trafficking in foster care. The bill proposes additional funding for various child welfare programs, including support for children in foster care and those leaving care due to age. The projected costs are expected to be offset by savings from other provisions in the bill. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (H.R. 4980) introduced by Representative Dave Camp on June 26, 2014, includes provisions for child welfare programs and savings measures such as compliance with child support conventions and electronic income withholding under the CSE program. The bill was approved by the House on July 23, 2014. The House and Senate negotiators approved H.R. 4980 on July 23, 2014, and the Senate passed it on September 18, 2014. The bill's three main titles draw on earlier legislation related to protecting children at risk of sex trafficking. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4980 on July 23, 2014, focusing on child protection and sex trafficking prevention. The bill included provisions from previous acts related to Adoption Incentive Payments and international child support recovery. The Child Support Enforcement program was established through the International Child Support Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 1896) and the Child Support Improvement and Work Promotion Act (S. 1877). These acts addressed concerns that have been discussed in congressional hearings and events over the past five years. The Youth white paper, co-chaired by Senators Grassley and Landrieu, discussed policy changes for children in foster care, including limiting APPLA use, informing youth of their rights, enhancing access to activities, and improving data collection. House Ways and Means Subcommittee and Senate Finance Committee held hearings on these issues and child support improvements. In March 2012, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee focused on legislation for U.S. compliance. In 2012 and 2013, various congressional committees and subcommittees held hearings and discussions on improving the Child Support Enforcement program, increasing adoptions out of foster care, and achieving permanency for older children in care. Witnesses emphasized the importance of pre-adoption training and post-adoption services. In February 2013, the Senate Finance Committee discussed ways to enhance child support enforcement. In April 2013, the Committee considered reauthorization of the Adoption Incentives program and funding for Family Connection Grants. In May 2013, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee focused on ensuring foster children have similar experiences as their peers. In June 2013, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on child welfare's role in preventing and intervening in the sex trafficking of children, with representatives from state and local jurisdictions testifying about the child welfare system's response to child sex trafficking. In October 2013, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources reviewed the needs of sex trafficking victims. The Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing to review the needs of sex trafficking victims and improve federal laws for children in foster care. Efforts in Washington state to end child sex trafficking were discussed. Public comments were sought for bills on child welfare policy and addressing sex trafficking of children in the system. Over 50 advocacy groups and citizens contributed to shaping the final bill. Over 50 advocacy groups and citizens contributed to shaping the final bill, with close to 50 advocacy, research, professional, tribal, and other groups offering their support of H.R. 4980."
