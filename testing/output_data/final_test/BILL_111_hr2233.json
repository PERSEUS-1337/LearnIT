    "content": "The \"Health Empowerment Zone Act of 2009\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings, designation of health empowerment zones, assistance for designation, benefits of designation, definition, and authorization of appropriations. The Congress finds that health disparities exist across the country, with racial and ethnic minorities disproportionately affected by chronic and acute conditions. These disparities are not only due to access to healthcare but also social determinants of health. The text discusses various factors such as environment, nutrition, education, employment, race, ethnicity, and language preference that impact health disparities. It emphasizes the importance of involving communities affected by health inequities in efforts to address and reduce disparities, as well as supporting community stakeholders from various sectors. Collaboration among different sectors and organizations is essential to address health disparities and improve community wellness. SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF HEALTH EMPOWERMENT ZONES. The Secretary may designate an eligible area as a health empowerment zone at the request of an eligible community partnership that demonstrates public support and includes stakeholders from communities experiencing disparities. An eligible area can be designated as a health empowerment zone if communities within it face disparities in health status and care, focusing on access to quality services, arthritis, cancer, and other chronic conditions. The curr_chunk lists various health conditions and topics including cancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, injury prevention, maternal and child health, mental health, nutrition, environmental health, family planning, HIV/AIDS, and more. The curr_chunk outlines the procedure for requesting designation as a health empowerment zone, including describing the area bounds, demonstrating eligibility of the partnership, and showing eligibility of the area. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for designation as a health empowerment zone, including conducting a comprehensive assessment of disparities, setting a vision and goals, and creating a strategic plan for approval within 60 days by the Secretary. The Secretary may designate up to 110 health empowerment zones, with at least one zone in each state, the District of Columbia, and each U.S. territory or possession. The Secretary provides technical assistance and grants to organizations seeking designation under section 4. This assistance includes forming community partnerships, conducting health assessments, and preparing requests for designation. Priority is given to applicants meeting eligibility criteria for a grant, proposing activities in a health empowerment zone, and aligning with the zone's strategic plan. Grants are provided for the initial implementation of strategic plans in designated health empowerment zones. The grant period for a health empowerment zone is 2 years, renewable for up to 10 years. The Secretary cannot prioritize or reduce grants based on previous assistance. Recipients must report progress every 6 months on implementing the zone's strategic plan. SEC. 7.
