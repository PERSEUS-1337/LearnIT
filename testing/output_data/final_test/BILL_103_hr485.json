    "content": "Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding a new part called \"Parents as Teachers.\" This part is known as the \"Parents as Teachers: the Family Involvement in Education Act of 1993.\" The Congress finds that increased parental involvement in education is crucial for children's long-term success. Providing federal seed money for education is appropriate. Children in the Parents as Teachers program in Missouri show improved cognitive, language, and social skills. Early childhood programs often start too late for effective remediation, and many children miss early developmental screenings before school entry. The purpose of this part is to encourage states to develop parent and early childhood education programs to increase parents' knowledge and confidence in child-rearing activities, strengthen partnerships between parents and schools, and enhance the developmental progress of children. The term 'developmental screening' refers to measuring children's progress in various areas. An 'eligible family' includes parents with children aged 0-3 or expecting a child. The 'lead agency' is designated by the Governor to administer the parents as teachers program. 'Parent education' encompasses support activities and providing resource materials on child development. The term 'parent educator' refers to a person hired or designated to administer group meetings, home visits, and developmental screening for eligible families. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Education. \"SEC. 4705. PROGRAM ESTABLISHED.\" The Secretary can provide grants to States for parents as teachers programs, with special consideration for hard-to-serve populations like teenaged, illiterate, economically disadvantaged, and non-English speaking parents. The Secretary considers population size, area size, and financial resources when providing grants for parents as teachers programs. States associated with the Parents As Teachers National Center in St. Louis, Missouri, are eligible for grants. \"Program requirements under SEC. 4706 include considerations for population size, area size, and financial resources when providing grants for Parents as Teachers programs.\" Each State receiving a grant under section 4705(a) must conduct a parents as teachers program, including parent education programs and developmental screening of children. A lead State agency must hire parent educators with experience in child care, establish group meetings and home visits for participating families, and administer periodic screenings of children's development. Grants awarded under section 4705(a) must be used for parents as teachers programs serving families from the last 3 months of pregnancy until the child turns 3. The programs include developmental screening using approved instruments and recruitment efforts for hard-to-reach populations. The Secretary will establish a Parents As Teachers National Center to support states with parents as teachers programs. Evaluations of state programs must be completed within 4 years. States seeking grants must submit applications describing the services they need assistance with. Payments and federal share details are outlined in section 4710. The Secretary will pay the Federal share of costs to States with approved applications under section 4709. The Federal share varies from 100% in the first year to 25% in the fifth year. The non-Federal share can be in cash or in kind. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1993 to 1997 for this Act."
