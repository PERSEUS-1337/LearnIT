    "content": "Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract oil and gas from underground rock formations by pumping fluids under high pressure. It has raised concerns due to its potential environmental and health impacts. This report focuses on legal issues related to hydraulic fracturing, including federal environmental laws and state preemption of local zoning authority and tort law. The Safe Drinking Water Act directs the EPA to regulate fluid injection. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) directs the EPA to regulate underground injection of fluids to protect drinking water sources. Part C of the SDWA establishes national regulations for underground injection control to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources. EPA is mandated to promulgate regulations for state underground injection control programs to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources. EPA cannot interfere with the underground injection of fluids brought to the surface in connection with certain activities. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires EPA to regulate underground injection of fluids to protect drinking water sources. Section 1421 of the SDWA mandates minimum requirements for preventing underground injection that endangers drinking water sources. The focus is on safeguarding groundwater used for public water systems. EPA regulations aim to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources from underground injection activities related to oil or natural gas production. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires EPA to regulate underground injection activities to protect drinking water sources, specifically focusing on safeguarding groundwater used for public water systems. The regulations define an \"underground source of drinking water\" (USDW) as an aquifer that supplies a public water system or contains enough groundwater for human consumption. EPA has established six classes of underground injection wells based on the materials injected. Class II wells inject brines and fluids related to oil and gas production below the lowermost underground source of drinking water. If hydraulic fracturing falls under SDWA regulation, it would likely be classified as Class II. States can have primary enforcement authority for UIC programs under SDWA Section 1422. EPA can delegate this authority to states. The EPA can delegate primary enforcement authority for UIC programs to states if they meet EPA requirements and prohibit unauthorized underground injections. If a state's program is not approved, EPA must implement the UIC program. States can demonstrate effectiveness in preventing endangerment of drinking water sources for oil and gas injection wells. Hydraulic fracturing was not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) until the late 1990s. Recent developments have raised questions about whether hydraulic fracturing should be considered an \"underground injection\" under the SDWA. This debate was triggered by a challenge to the Alabama UIC program in 1994. The State of Alabama's UIC program was challenged in 1994 due to the lack of regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations for methane gas production from coalbed formations. EPA denied the petition to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA in 1995, leading to a legal challenge in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The court rejected EPA's interpretation that only wells with the \"principal function\" of fluid injection could be regulated under the SDWA. The court rejected EPA's claim that only wells with the \"principal function\" of fluid injection could be regulated under the SDWA, stating that hydraulic fracturing falls within the definition of \"underground injection\" as it involves the subsurface emplacement of fluids. EPA was not authorized to exclude hydraulic fracturing from regulation based on perceived ambiguity in the SDWA. The court remanded the decision to EPA for reconsideration of LEAF's petition for withdrawal of Alabama's UIC program approval. Alabama submitted a revised UIC program to EPA in 1999, seeking approval under Section 1425 of the SDWA. This section requires the state to show that the program meets specific requirements to prevent underground injection that endangers drinking water sources. EPA approved Alabama's revised UIC program in 2000, and LEAF appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. LEAF argued that EPA should not have approved state regulation of hydraulic fracturing under Section 1425 of the SDWA. The court rejected this argument, stating that regulation of hydraulic fracturing is related to secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas. The court agreed with LEAF that regulation of hydraulic fracturing is related to secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas. It found that wells used for hydraulic fracturing must fall under one of the five classes set forth in EPA regulations. The court remanded the matter to EPA for a determination of whether Alabama's updated UIC program complied with the requirements for Class II wells. The UIC program in Alabama was found to comply with Class II well requirements. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected LEAF's argument that EPA's approval was arbitrary and capricious. The court's decision raised the question of whether EPA should regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the definition of \"underground injection\" in the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to exclude hydraulic fracturing operations from UIC requirements, except for the use of diesel fuel. This clarified that EPA does not regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. The 2005 amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act excluded hydraulic fracturing operations from UIC requirements, except for injections involving diesel fuel. EPA issued final diesel permitting guidance in February 2014, stating that a UIC Class II permit is required for underground injection involving diesel fuel. The SDWA requires a UIC Class II permit for underground injection of diesel fuels for hydraulic fracturing. The guidance outlines regulatory requirements for permitting, testing, and monitoring. EPA's definition of \"diesel fuels\" in the final guidance was a topic of debate, recommending the use of six CASRNs for identification. The final guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations does not establish a de minimis concentration of \"diesel\" in fracturing fluid that would be exempt from permitting requirements. Flowback from hydraulic fracturing typically contains proppant, chemical residues, salts, metals, and naturally occurring radioactive materials. The water produced from geologic formations during oil and gas production may contain salts, metals, and naturally occurring radioactive materials. Proper disposal of flowback water and production brine is necessary, either through underground injection or treatment and surface discharge. If underground injection is not feasible, wastewater may be transferred to publicly owned treatment works for compliance with the Clean Water Act. EPA sets national standards for discharges of pollutants into navigable waters. EPA sets national standards for industrial wastewater discharges under the Clean Water Act, including a \"zero discharge\" pretreatment standard for oil and gas production wastewater to prohibit discharges to publicly owned treatment works. The EPA issued new regulations under the Clean Air Act in 2012 to regulate emissions from onshore natural gas hydraulic fracturing operations, in response to a legal challenge by environmental organizations. In 2009, WildEarth Guardians and the San Juan Citizens Alliance filed a petition alleging that EPA had failed to review and revise its New Source Performance Standards for oil and gas operations as required by the Clean Air Act. This led to a new rulemaking by EPA updating standards for natural gas processing plants and establishing new standards for emissions from certain types of natural gas operations, including hydraulic fracturing. The 2012 NSPS regulations require new onshore natural gas hydraulic fracturing operations to implement \"green completions\" to reduce emissions. This process captures and cleans natural gas for reuse instead of venting or flaring. Compliance was phased in from October 15, 2012, to January 1, 2015, allowing time for industry adjustments. The regulations require all hydraulically fractured wells to use green completions to reduce emissions. Certain types of wells are exempt, such as exploratory or delineation wells and low-pressure wells. Operators must use completion combustion devices unless prohibited by state or local laws. EPA implemented CAA rules affecting oil and gas production on June 3, 2016. On June 3, 2016, EPA implemented CAA rules for the oil and natural gas production industry, including new emissions standards for methane and VOCs. The rules require controls for methane and VOC emissions from various sources in the industry, with an emphasis on reducing methane emissions. EPA also issued an Information Collection Request for public comment to gather data for developing comprehensive regulations. The EPA implemented new rules on June 3, 2016, for the oil and natural gas production industry to reduce methane emissions. The rules include new emissions standards for methane and VOCs, expanding coverage to other sources and revising permitting requirements. Additionally, the EPA strengthened the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and extended VOC reduction requirements to existing oil and gas sources in certain areas. Federal and state authorities regulate wastes under the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. The Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, established regulations for hazardous waste under RCRA. EPA has the primary authority to implement the federal hazardous waste program, with states having the option to become authorized. State and local governments are responsible for managing non-hazardous solid waste under RCRA Subtitle D. EPA's role is primarily focused on hazardous waste regulation. The Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of 1980 included amendments to Subtitle C requirements regarding the identification of hazardous waste. The \"Bentsen\" amendment temporarily excluded certain drilling fluids and other wastes associated with oil and gas production from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. This exemption was motivated by concerns about the economic impact on the industry. EPA was required to conduct a study on these exempted wastes. The EPA conducted a study on E&P waste and reported to Congress that existing regulations were generally sufficient, with some gaps in certain states. They found that regulating E&P waste under RCRA Subtitle C would have a significant economic impact and be unnecessary. In 1988, the EPA determined that managing E&P waste under Subtitle C was not warranted, opting instead to improve existing federal regulatory programs under RCRA Subtitle D and the Safe Drinking Water Act. In the 25 years since EPA made its regulatory determination, the agency has chosen not to develop regulations under RCRA Subtitle D or pursue additional RCRA legislation. EPA issued guidance in 2002 clarifying the Subtitle C exemption for E&P wastes, listing produced water and drilling fluids as exempt, and unused fracturing fluids as non-exempt if they exhibit hazardous characteristics. The Natural Resources Defense Council petitioned the EPA in 2010 to regulate E&P wastes as hazardous under Subtitle C of RCRA, despite the exemption of such fluids from federal regulation. The NRDC petitioned the EPA in 2010 to regulate E&P wastes as hazardous under Subtitle C of RCRA, citing toxicity threats and inadequate state regulations. They sought safe management from cradle to grave. EPA has not formally responded yet. The EPA was reviewing incidents alleged by the petitioner, regulations in states with natural gas activities, and best management practices for E&P wastes. If EPA determines that Subtitle C regulation is necessary, regulations could be promulgated but would require authorization from Congress to take effect. CERCLA, also known as Superfund, gives the federal government broad authority to respond to releases of hazardous substances. CERCLA, also known as Superfund, grants the federal government authority to address hazardous substance releases to protect public health and the environment. It holds responsible parties liable for response costs, natural resource damages, and public health studies related to potential hazards. Potentially responsible parties include past and current facility owners, operators, and waste generators. The President's response and enforcement authorities under CERCLA are delegated by Executive Order to the EPA and other federal agencies to address hazardous substance releases. Hydraulic fracturing operations could potentially release hazardous substances, leading to liability under CERCLA for facility owners and operators. Certain exclusions or exemptions from the statute may limit liability in such cases. The petroleum and natural gas exclusion in CERCLA limits liability for releases of these substances, but not for hazardous substances released from petroleum or natural gas facilities. CERCLA may apply to releases from oil or natural gas production, excluding petroleum and natural gas themselves. The exclusion in CERCLA for petroleum and natural gas does not apply to hazardous substances released from fracking sites. Liability under the statute could arise if fracking fluids contain hazardous substances and are released in a way that endangers public health or the environment, leading to cleanup actions for which responsible parties would be liable. Liability for releases of hazardous substances from hydraulic fracturing operations depends on compliance with federal or state permits. CERCLA exempts federally permitted releases from liability but does not prevent liability under other laws. The Clean Water Act and other federal statutes authorize discharges or emissions, including underground injection for oil or gas production. EPA has used CERCLA to investigate groundwater contamination in areas where hydraulic fracturing has been conducted, such as Dimock, PA, and Pavillion, WY. EPA initiated the Pavillion investigation in response to a public petition citing residents' concerns about groundwater. The EPA initiated an investigation in Pavillion, WY in response to a public petition about groundwater quality. EPA issued a draft report in 2011 but announced in 2013 that it would not finalize the investigation. The state of Wyoming took over the investigation, with EPA providing technical support. As of March 2016, EPA continues to assist the state in examining groundwater issues in Pavillion. The EPA issued an Action Memorandum for the Dimock site in 2012 to address hazardous substances in groundwater. A groundwater investigation was completed in July 2012, determining that contaminant levels did not require further action. The Dimock and Pavillion sites are examples of CERCLA authorities used to investigate potential contamination from hydraulic fracturing. EPA has not confirmed a definitive link between hazardous substances and fracking at either site. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental consequences of actions but does not mandate a specific course of action. If significant environmental impact is expected, agencies must document their considerations in an environmental impact statement. The agency must document consideration of effects in an environmental impact statement (EIS) or prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be made. NEPA is a procedural statute that requires agencies to assess environmental consequences of actions, allowing them to move forward if benefits outweigh costs. Oil and gas companies are interested in drilling in the Monterey Shale in Central California, which may require a NEPA document due to potential federal involvement. In 2011, the Bureau of Land Management sold leases for public land to private parties, leading to a lawsuit from environmental groups claiming violations. Environmental groups sued the Bureau of Land Management for violating the Administrative Procedure Act and NEPA by issuing a FONSI instead of an EIS for a proposed lease sale. Concerns about hydraulic fracturing's environmental effects were raised during the public comment period, but BLM did not analyze them. The Council on Environmental Quality's regulations under NEPA require agencies to determine significant environmental effects and prepare an EIS. The district court found that BLM did not properly investigate the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on health, the environment, and public safety, leading to the conclusion that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) should have been prepared. The court found that BLM's NEPA review was \"erroneous as a matter of law\" due to inadequate investigation of potential impacts of drilling. The Delaware River Basin Compact establishes the DRBC to manage water resources and published draft regulations in 2010 to protect water resources during natural gas operations. In 2011, the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against federal agencies and the DRBC for not preparing an EIS before allowing natural gas development in the Delaware River Basin, alleging it was a violation of NEPA. The New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against federal agencies and the DRBC for not preparing an EIS before allowing natural gas development in the Delaware River Basin, alleging it was a violation of NEPA. The federal defendants argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the claims and that the DRBC was not a federal agency, therefore NEPA did not apply. In September 2012, the U.S. District Court dismissed New York's complaint against the DRBC for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing lack of standing and ripeness. The court did not reach the merits of the claims but allowed the plaintiffs to refile if final regulations are adopted. The composition of hydraulic fracturing fluid varies. The fluid used in hydraulic fracturing contains water, proppant like sand, and chemicals to aid in the process. Some chemicals may be harmful, leading to calls for public disclosure of their use. Oil and gas companies used 780 million gallons of chemicals between 2005 and 2009. Concerns about unknown chemicals in well water near operations have increased. Public disclosure of chemicals used in well water near oil and gas operations is advocated for health professionals to respond to emergencies, aid researchers in health studies, and allow regulators to track potential groundwater contamination. However, some in the industry resist disclosure due to concerns about revealing proprietary formulas. In 2011, President Obama directed a panel to study the effects of shale gas production on health and the environment. The Shale Gas Production Subcommittee recommended public disclosure of chemicals used in fracturing fluids on a \"well-by-well basis\" with trade secret protection. Currently, no federal law requires detailed chemical composition disclosure. Under EPCRA, facilities with hazardous hydraulic fracturing chemicals may need to comply with emergency planning, release notification, and chemical storage reporting. Environmental groups have petitioned the EPA for health and environmental data collection. Advocacy groups petitioned EPA for health and environmental data on hydraulic fracturing chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act. States have adopted chemical disclosure requirements, while the IOGCC argues that state regulation is sufficient. The TSCA aims to protect human health and the environment from toxic chemicals in commerce. EPA may require manufacturers to report data on chemicals. EPA may require manufacturers and processors to report data on chemicals' effects on health and the environment, and place restrictions on chemicals deemed to pose unreasonable risks. Advocacy groups petitioned EPA for rules under TSCA for chemicals used in oil and gas exploration. EPA can mandate testing of chemicals for health and environmental effects under TSCA. Advocacy groups petitioned EPA to require data reporting on health and environmental effects of E&P Chemicals used in oil and gas development, citing potential risks from leaks, spills, and human exposure during hydraulic fracturing. Advocacy groups petitioned EPA for data reporting on health and environmental effects of E&P Chemicals used in oil and gas development due to potential risks from leaks, spills, and human exposure during hydraulic fracturing. EPA partially granted the petitioners' requests for Section 8(a) and Section 8(d) data gathering on hydraulic fracturing chemicals but declined to issue rules for other chemicals in the oil and gas sector. EPA intends to discuss potential Section 8 reporting requirements. EPA plans to discuss Section 8 reporting requirements with states, industry, and interest groups to minimize burdens and costs. In 2013, EPA explained its response to a petition regarding hydraulic fracturing chemicals. In 2014, EPA issued a notice to gather information on these substances, considering mandatory disclosure, voluntary reporting incentives, or a combination of both. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has regulations under the Hazard Communication Standard. The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHAct) ensures employees are aware of potential dangers from hazardous chemicals in the workplace. Manufacturers must provide Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for hydraulic fracturing chemicals, listing chemical identity, hazards, and safety precautions. Operators must maintain MSDS at job sites, with limited information on chemical identities required by OSHA regulations. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) requires coordination between government levels and industry to prepare response plans for hazardous chemical emergencies. States are encouraged to establish State Emergency Response Commissions (SERC) to oversee local activities. The Emergency Response Commission (SERC) appoints and coordinates Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) for each planning district. LEPCs develop emergency response plans for chemical releases and submit them to the SERC. Facilities with EPA-listed hazardous substances must comply with EPCRA's planning requirements. Well sites with hydraulic fracturing activities may also be subject to these requirements based on the chemicals present. Owners must notify the SERC and LEPC in case of an emergency. Facility owners must notify the SERC and LEPC in case of an accidental release of a chemical exceeding its reportable quantity. Information on hazardous chemicals must be provided to the public, including submitting MSDS or chemical inventory information as required by EPCRA. Well sites with hydraulic fracturing activities may also need to comply with these requirements based on the chemicals present. Facility owners must submit annual chemical inventory information for hazardous chemicals exceeding EPA thresholds to the LEPC, SERC, and fire department. Two types of information may be required: Tier I includes aggregate amounts and general locations of chemicals, while Tier II includes chemical names, storage locations, and methods. Section 313 of EPCRA requires facilities to report toxic chemical releases to federal and state officials, who then disclose non-proprietary details to the public via the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) website. Reporting applies to facilities with 10 or more full-time employees. Facilities with 10 or more full-time employees must report toxic chemical releases under Section 313 of EPCRA. Oil and gas extraction industry facilities are generally not required to report under the TRI program, but EPA can add or delete industry codes as needed. Environmental advocacy groups have requested the inclusion of the oil and gas industry in reporting toxic chemicals. EPA considers factors like the presence of listed toxic chemicals when adding new industry groups to the reporting requirements. The Earthworks petitioners argued for the inclusion of the oil and gas extraction industry in reporting toxic chemicals under EPCRA section 313, citing the use of listed chemicals in drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. They claimed that the industry's processes met the criteria for reporting based on chemical usage, activities involving TRI chemicals, and the potential to increase information disclosure. The petitioners argued for including the oil and gas industry in reporting toxic chemicals under EPCRA section 313, citing inadequate disclosure laws. Concerns about environmental effects and property values near oil and gas operations have led to increased local government regulation. The increase in local regulation of hydraulic fracturing has raised questions about the relationship between state and local authority. States retain authority over local governments in matters of mixed state and local concern, even with some degree of independence granted to municipalities. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state could not preempt municipal zoning restrictions violating local regulations. The court ruled that states cannot preempt municipal zoning restrictions that violate the state constitution. State preemption of municipal land use and zoning powers arises in oil and gas regulation, with three types of preemption recognized: express, occupation of the field, and conflict preemption. Express preemption occurs when state law explicitly overrides local regulations on oil and gas operations. In 2014, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that zoning restrictions imposed by municipalities did not conflict with the state's mineral resource laws, as they were valid exercises of the state's Home Rule law. The court found that the state's oil and gas law only preempted local laws that aimed to regulate drilling practices. The court ruled that local zoning restrictions did not conflict with state oil and gas laws, as they were aimed at regulating land use generally and not drilling operations. In a separate case, a Pennsylvania appeals court found that a state law preempting local zoning laws violated towns' substantive due process rights by requiring them to allow certain oil and gas facilities in all zoning districts. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that a state law preempting local zoning laws for oil and gas facilities was invalid under the state constitution. This decision was based on the argument that the law allowed incompatible land uses in zoning districts, denying towns their substantive due process rights. The doctrine of field preemption in the oil and gas context has been a topic of discussion in various state court cases. Courts have considered whether local regulations interfere with state laws governing oil and gas development, leading to operational conflicts. The Colorado Supreme Court, for example, ruled that a home rule city's total ban on oil and gas was preempted by state law. The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that state law preempted a home rule city's ban on oil and gas drilling, citing operational conflicts. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper created a task force to address regulatory coordination between local governments and the state to avoid litigation. The task force recommended local governments to enter agreements with operators and the COGCC to address concerns. Property owners near oil and gas operations have filed tort claims for damages from hydraulic fracturing and drilling waste contamination. Plaintiffs have filed tort claims for damages related to oil and gas operations, including contamination of land, noise and air pollution, water supply contamination, property damage, and personal injury. Common law causes of action include nuisance, trespass, negligence, and strict liability. Plaintiffs seek monetary and injunctive relief, such as property remediation and medical monitoring. Difficulty in proving harm is sometimes faced due to damages alleged to have occurred underground or in the air above the property. Defendants may request modified case management orders for plaintiffs to establish a prima facie case. In some cases, courts have required plaintiffs to make a prima facie showing of exposure, injury, and causation before full discovery by submitting expert opinions and supporting data. Defendants in Colorado initially had a case dismissed for failing to provide sufficient information, but an appeals court later reversed the decision. Courts may decline to enter modified case management orders in simple cases with few parties. The question of whether defendants are subject to strict liability for their operations arises in these situations. The court considers whether defendants are subject to strict liability for their operations based on whether hydraulic fracturing and related oil and gas production activities are abnormally dangerous. The Restatement of Torts outlines factors to determine if an activity is abnormally dangerous, including the degree of risk, likelihood of harm, inability to eliminate risk, uncommon usage, inappropriateness to the location, and value to the community. In a legal context, courts have considered whether hydraulic fracturing qualifies as an ultra-hazardous activity, with factors like risk, harm likelihood, and community value being assessed. Some courts have questioned the applicability of strict tort liability to hydraulic fracturing operations, particularly in relation to trespass claims involving gas extraction from adjacent properties. The court ruled that damages from oil and gas extraction could not be recovered due to the rule of capture. Plaintiffs have argued trespass in cases where unnecessary acts were done during mineral extraction. Regulation of oil and gas practices is mainly under state and municipal jurisdiction, with federal oversight limited to environmental impacts, except on federal lands. The Bureau of Land Management oversees oil and gas operations on federal lands. A hydraulic fracturing rule was set aside by the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming and is currently under appeal. The rule aimed to update regulations related to hydraulic fracturing, estimating it would impact up to 3,800 operations annually with compliance costs reaching $45 million. The proposed rule by the Bureau of Land Management would impact up to 3,800 operations annually with compliance costs reaching $45 million. Operators planning to use fracking on federal or Indian land must submit a detailed plan, follow best practices for casing and cementing, conduct a Mechanical Integrity Test, and monitor well pressure during the fracking operation. The Final Rule for fracking operations includes integrity testing, monitoring well pressure, managing flowback fluids, and disclosing chemicals used. States and tribes can seek variances from specific regulatory provisions if their requirements are as protective as BLM's. Legal action was taken to enjoin enforcement of the Final Rule. The petitioners sought to enjoin the enforcement of the BLM Final Rule on hydraulic fracturing, arguing that BLM lacked statutory authority. The court agreed with the petitioners, setting aside the rule. The federal government appealed the decision, likely arguing its authority under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The BLM Final Rule on hydraulic fracturing was challenged in court due to concerns over statutory authority. The government may cite Section 226(g) of the Mineral Leasing Act to regulate surface-disturbing activities on federal lands. The Tenth Circuit's decision will impact federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other environmental issues in oil and gas exploration. The BLM proposed a rule to reduce venting and flaring from oil and gas production on federal and Indian leases. The proposed rule by BLM aims to limit natural gas venting and routine flaring associated with oil well development. Legislation such as the FRAC Act seeks to require disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and repeal the exemption established in EPAct 2005. The Safe Hydration is An American Right in Energy Development Act of 2015 (H.R. 1515) would amend the SDWA to regulate hydraulic fracturing operations and impose new testing and data reporting requirements. Legislation also includes requirements for baseline and follow-up testing of potable groundwater near fracking sites. H.R. 1515 and other bills propose testing requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations, including pre, during, and post-testing for substances indicating damage. EPA would publish test results by zip code. H.R. 1647 and S. 15 aim to limit federal regulation on hydraulic fracturing in states with their own regulations. The bill proposes deferring to state regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands managed by the Department of the Interior. It also directs a study on the economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing. Legislation in the 114th Congress aims to limit the Department of the Interior's authority over hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. Environmental statutes enforced by the EPA have exemptions for hydraulic fracturing activities, such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 excluding underground injection control requirements for hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, drilling fluids and other wastes from oil and gas production are exempt from hazardous waste regulation under RCRA. Environmental groups have petitioned the EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing and related activities under various environmental laws. This includes petitions to classify drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes from oil and gas extraction as hazardous waste under RCRA, and to establish rules for chemical substances used in oil and gas exploration under TSCA. Environmental advocacy organizations have urged the EPA to mandate reporting of toxic chemicals released by the oil and gas extraction industry. Local government regulation of hydraulic fracturing has sparked debates on state preemption of municipal land use powers. Courts have ruled that local governments can regulate drilling locations but not methods. Property owners near oil and gas operations have filed tort claims for negligence, strict liability, nuisance, and trespass. Litigation involving hydraulic fracturing raises questions on causation, the activity's danger level, and potential subsurface trespass. A recent court decision overturned BLM's safety and disclosure regulations. A recent federal court decision overturned BLM's safety and disclosure regulations for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, pending appeal."
