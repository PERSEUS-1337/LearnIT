Congress aimed to improve tracking of temporary legal residents, such as nonimmigrants, by implementing an entry-exit control system and monitoring foreign students. The Department of Homeland Security uses the Immigration and Nationality Act to track foreign nationals, requiring registration for aliens in the U.S. for 30 days or more. Alien registration has been addressed in the 107th and 108th Congresses. Alien registration requirements, originating from the Alien Registration Act of 1940, were included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. These requirements mandate registration and fingerprinting for aliens aged 14 and older staying in the U.S. for 30 days or more, with exceptions for certain nonimmigrants. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 mandates registration and fingerprinting for aliens aged 14 and older staying in the U.S. for 30 days or more, with exceptions for certain nonimmigrants. The Attorney General is authorized to prescribe special regulations and forms for registration, including questions about entry into the U.S., activities, length of stay, criminal record, and address changes notification. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 requires aliens aged 14 and older staying in the U.S. for 30 days or more to register and be fingerprinted. The Attorney General can demand notification of current addresses and additional information from foreign state natives. Failure to comply can result in fines, imprisonment, or deportation unless the alien proves a reasonable excuse for non-compliance. The Attorney General has used the INA to prescribe special regulations for alien registration and fingerprinting. INS administered alien registration until 2003. In 1991, INS required nonimmigrants with Iraqi or Kuwaiti travel documents to be registered, photographed, and fingerprinted at the port of entry. This was to protect the interests and security of the United States. In 1993, INS removed these special registration requirements for Iraqis. In 1993, INS removed special registration requirements for Iraqis and Kuwaitis, adding a provision for registration and fingerprinting of certain nonimmigrants from specific countries upon arrival in the US. This change provided the Attorney General more flexibility in responding to political situations. The U.S. immigration system implemented registration, photographing, and fingerprinting measures for nonimmigrants from specific countries due to terrorist activities and plots. The September 11, 2001 attacks exposed weaknesses in the system, making it difficult to track nonimmigrants' activities in the country. In response to concerns about tracking nonimmigrants in the country, INS proposed two rules in 2002, including the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) outlined by Attorney General John Ashcroft. NSEERS aimed to enhance scrutiny of foreign visitors for national security purposes and establish a data system to track all foreign visitors. INS proposed a rule to implement NSEERS on June 13, 2002, and issued the final rule on August 12, 2002, which took effect on September 11, 2002. The rule expanded special registration requirements for nonimmigrant aliens from designated countries and individuals meeting undisclosed criteria for monitoring in the interests of national security or law enforcement. These requirements do not apply to diplomats or officials of international organizations. DOJ estimated NSEERS would track about 100,000 visitors initially. Upon arrival in the United States, aliens subject to special registration under NSEERS are fingerprinted, photographed, and checked against databases of criminals and terrorists. They provide personal information and details about their plans in the country. The original rule required subsequent 30-day and annual registration for aliens registered at a port of entry. They had to report to an immigration office between day 30 and day 40 to complete their registration by providing additional documentation of compliance with their visas. On September 11, 2002, NSEERS was implemented at selected ports of entry, expanding to all remaining land, air, and sea ports on October 1, 2002. The system applies to nonimmigrants from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria, as well as others posing a national security risk. Special registrants must provide notification of address, employment, and educational changes within 10 days of occurrence. Upon leaving the US, they must report their exit at the port of departure. The Attorney General determined that nonimmigrant males from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, or Yemen aged 16-45 needed special registration starting October 1, 2002. Seven criteria were outlined for immigration inspectors to decide on special registration, including unexplained trips to certain countries and behavior indicating a need for monitoring. DOJ and INS did not comment on the memorandum. Aliens in the United States were required to register if they met specific criteria, including being citizens or nationals of certain countries and being at least 16 years old. The registration involved reporting to an immigration office by a certain deadline for fingerprinting and photographing. A notice published in the Federal Register reopened the registration period for those who had not complied with the initial requirement. Between January 27, 2003, and February 7, 2003, individuals who were not registered as required could do so and would be considered in compliance. A December 2, 2003 DHS rule suspended the annual re-registration requirement. Nonimmigrant males from additional countries were subject to special registration if they were at least 16 years old and last admitted to the United States on or before September 30, 2002. They were required to report to an immigration office by January 10, 2003, for registration, fingerprinting, and photographing. The December 18 notice required citizens or nationals of Pakistan or Saudi Arabia to report by February 21, 2003, for registration, fingerprinting, and photographing. The January 16 notice required citizens or nationals of Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, or Kuwait to report by March 28, 2003. Registration deadlines were extended to March 21, 2003, and April 25, 2003. Annual re-registration requirement was suspended in December 2003. The annual re-registration requirement for NSEERS was suspended in December 2003 by Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. A new entry-exit system called the US-VISIT System was announced to replace NSEERS registrations for aliens within the country. By September 30, 2003, 177,260 individuals had been registered under NSEERS. As of December 1, 2003, individuals from over 150 countries had been registered in the NSEERS program, totaling 83,519 registrations at immigration offices. Aliens in the United States must report address changes within 10 days, including LPRs, with millions of individuals affected. Previous reporting requirements for nonimmigrants and LPRs were repealed in 1981 to improve INS efficiency. The INS is proposing a rule to improve the efficiency of address reporting by aliens, as current compliance and enforcement are lacking. Aliens must provide a valid current address and report any changes within 10 days. Failure to do so may result in fines, imprisonment, or removal from the country. The rule requires aliens to report any address changes promptly to ensure efficient communication and tracking for immigration purposes. Failure to update addresses may lead to missed notifications and potential consequences. The registration and address reporting rules aim to enhance national security and streamline removal proceedings. Critics and some supporters debate the effectiveness and implications of a proposed address reporting rule for foreign nationals in the United States. Critics argue that the system may create resentment and undermine international support for the U.S. war on terrorism, while supporters emphasize the importance of government tracking for national security purposes. The government is considering a proposal to collect current addresses of foreign nationals in the United States. Some supporters have doubts about timely processing of the information, citing past issues with INS not filing documents. Critics question the feasibility and resource allocation of the address reporting rule. Opponents of the large-scale address reporting proposal have raised concerns about potential severe consequences for law-abiding aliens and fear selective enforcement based on race or ethnicity. The DHS published an interim rule in December 2003 to amend NSEERS regulations, suspending certain reporting requirements and implementing a more tailored notification system for future registration. Under a new rule, DHS will determine which registrants must appear for additional interviews to ensure compliance with nonimmigrant visa conditions. Changes reflect the transfer of immigration functions to DHS under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The suspension of automatic re-registration requirements is justified by the presence of other tracking systems. The new rule by DHS suspends automatic re-registration requirements for NSEERS registrants to reduce burden and allocate resources for national security needs. Existing registration procedures at ports of entry remain unchanged. The registration of aliens at ports of entry has provided law enforcement benefits by identifying alien terrorists and criminals. The rule maintains the requirement for NSEERS registrants to report their departure from the United States. Legislation in the 107th Congress included alien registration and reporting provisions. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 directs a study on requiring nonimmigrants to submit their current address annually. The \"Securing America's Future through Enforcement Reform Act of 2002\" (H.R. 5013) aimed to expand alien registration requirements under the INA. It proposed annual registrations for LPRs and quarterly registrations for other aliens, along with address reporting within 10 days. The bill also called for the establishment of an information technology system for data collection and maintenance. H.R. 5013 aimed to expand alien registration requirements by establishing an information technology system for data collection. In the 108th Congress, the Senate passed an amendment for funding an entry-exit system and restricted funds for NSEERS expenses. The final version of H.J.Res. 2, signed into law on February 20, 2003 as P.L. 108-7, did not eliminate funding for NSEERS but required the Attorney General to provide NSEERS-related documents to the Appropriations Committees by March 1, 2003."
