    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides benefits and services to veterans through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) offers compensation, pensions, and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national veterans' cemeteries and provides headstones. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers health care services and research programs. In FY2014, the VA employed approximately 323,016 full-time equivalent personnel, with the majority working for the VHA. The VA employs approximately 287,179 FTEs in the VHA, with the rest distributed among VBA, NCA, BVA, and other staff offices. The VA Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1994) was introduced by Representative Jeff Miller to give the VA Secretary more tools to hold executives accountable for mismanagement. Chairman Miller offered amendments to the bill during committee markup, including one authorizing travel expenses for VA employees testifying before Congress. Representative Tim Huelskamp offered expenses for VA employees testifying before Congress. The House Committee on Rules reported a closed rule for H.R. 1994, allowing floor debate with two proposed amendments. One amendment requires the VA Inspector General to submit reports on employee misconduct to Congress. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs proposed amendments to H.R. 1994, including measures to hold managers accountable for fixing problems, suspend employees threatening health or safety, protect whistleblowers, and limit administrative leave. The Office of Management and Budget expressed opposition to the bill, citing concerns about due process for VA employees. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs proposed amendments to H.R. 1994, including measures to hold managers accountable for fixing problems, suspend employees threatening health or safety, protect whistleblowers, and limit administrative leave. The Office of Management and Budget expressed opposition to the bill, citing concerns about due process protections for VA employees. The SAP stated that H.R. 1994 may contravene the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The House passed H.R. 1994 after rejecting amendments and a motion to recommit the bill. The VA Accountability Act of 2015 passed by the House on July 29, 2015 emphasizes the importance of due process in civil service employment. Federal employees have a property interest in continued employment, protected by the Fifth Amendment. Due process rights are provided to federal employees under Title 5 of the U.S. Code, requiring notice, opportunity to respond to charges, and a hearing before or after removal. The VA Accountability Act of 2015 emphasizes due process in civil service employment, granting federal employees rights to notice, opportunity to respond to charges, and a hearing before or after removal. It allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove or demote individuals based on performance or misconduct, with provisions for pay adjustments post-demotion. The VA Accountability Act of 2015 allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove or demote individuals based on performance or misconduct. Demoted individuals cannot receive pay or benefits if they do not report for duty. The Secretary must notify Congress within 30 days of any removal or demotion, and different procedures apply compared to standard civil service removal processes. The VA Accountability Act of 2015 allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove or demote individuals based on performance or misconduct. A removal or demotion under H.R. 1994 could be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) within 7 days. An administrative judge must issue a decision within 45 days, which is final and not subject to further appeal. If a decision is not issued within 45 days, the removal or demotion becomes final. The Board must submit a report to Congress explaining the delay. The VA Accountability Act of 2015 allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to remove or demote individuals based on performance or misconduct. Those who are removed are not eligible for any pay, awards, bonuses, or benefits. The Secretary must provide necessary information and assistance for expediting an appeal. Approval from the Special Counsel is required to remove or demote whistleblowers seeking corrective action. Individuals with whistleblower complaints cannot be removed until a final decision is made by the central whistleblower office. The Special Counsel can terminate an investigation of a prohibited personnel practice alleged by an employee after providing a written statement of reasons. This authority is in addition to existing laws regarding adverse actions and performance appraisal. Definitions are provided for key terms. The Secretary's authority in H.R. 1994 allows for the removal or demotion of certain individuals in the Department of Veterans Affairs, similar to authority granted in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. This authority extends to many employees in the VA, excluding career appointees in the Senior Executive Service or political appointees. The appeal under 38 U.S.C. Section 713 to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit alleges due process and Appointments Clause violations. H.R. 1994 proposes an 18-month probationary period for certain VA employees before their appointment becomes final, extendable at the Secretary's discretion. The provision in H.R. 1994 proposes an 18-month probationary period for certain VA employees to determine fitness before their appointment becomes final, excluding specific healthcare professionals with probationary periods already defined by law. Regulations by the Office of Personnel Management require a one-year probationary period for career or career-conditional employees in the competitive civil service to assess fitness and terminate if necessary. The probationary period for federal employees can be extended up to 3 years for certain positions, as authorized by Congress. In the 112th Congress, a bill was proposed to extend the probationary period from one year to at least two years for civil service appointments. The probationary period for federal employees can be extended up to 3 years for certain positions, as authorized by Congress. An August 2005 report by the Merit Systems Protection Board found that a fair assessment of probationers is crucial for determining successful employees. H.R. 1994 proposes adding a new subchapter to establish guidelines for probationary periods in federal employment. A new subchapter in Title 38 of the U.S.C. would establish a process for handling whistleblower complaints by VA employees regarding potential violations of laws, rules, or regulations, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. This process would provide relief for employees facing personnel actions in response to such disclosures, supplementing the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) provides relief for employees facing personnel actions due to disclosures of violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. Three forums for relief include appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, actions by the Office of Special Counsel, and individual right of action. Proposed new provisions in H.R. 1994 would require whistleblower complaints to be filed on a form developed by the Secretary, with specific procedures for filing based on the nature of the complaint. The proposed new provisions in H.R. 1994 would require supervisors to notify employees within four business days if a complaint discloses a violation of laws or poses a danger to public health and safety. If the complaint is deemed valid, the supervisor must outline specific actions to address it and submit a report to higher authorities. A central whistleblower office would investigate all complaints and maintain a toll-free hotline for anonymous reporting. Supervisors found guilty of prohibited personnel actions related to whistleblower complaints face suspension or removal. Past actions are considered in evaluations. Annual training on whistleblower complaints is required for all agency employees. The Secretary must submit a yearly report to Congress on whistleblower complaints and their outcomes. The proposed amendment to H.R. 1994 would impact the performance appraisal system for Senior Executive Service (SES) members at the VA. It would establish five summary levels for performance ratings and cap the number of executives eligible for top ratings. Under current requirements, agencies have flexibility to establish their own performance appraisal systems for senior executives, with at least three summary performance levels. Agencies can opt for a more comprehensive system meeting OPM standards, potentially leading to higher pay. H.R. 1994 would require the Secretary to consider specific factors in the certification process. The Secretary would need to consider specific factors when evaluating senior executives at the VA, including complaints filed against them, efforts to maintain satisfaction among supervisees, treatment of whistleblower complaints, and prohibited personnel actions. Agencies currently have flexibility in setting performance appraisal criteria, but H.R. 1994 would introduce additional requirements. The appraisal system for senior executives at the VA must adhere to OPM's requirements. Factors like complaints, employee perspectives, and performance quality are considered. H.R. 1994 introduces new requirements, including reassigning executives every five years. The Secretary can waive this rule with approval from the Veterans' Affairs Committees. The Secretary can waive the requirement for reassigning executives every five years at the VA, with notice to the Veterans' Affairs Committees. The SES was created to promote mobility among members, but it is not a strict requirement. The goal was to expose individuals to different agencies for fresh perspectives, but this vision has not been fully realized. Almost half of the U.S. government's senior executives have remained in the same position throughout their SES career. A proposed section would mandate the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report to Congress on senior executives' performance appraisals, including individual performance reviews and summaries. The Inspector General would review the ratings, with their findings included in the report. Section 5(b) of H.R. 1994 requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract a nongovernmental entity to review the management training program for senior executives within 180 days. The entity will compare VA's training to other federal agencies and the private sector, with a report due in 180 days. The Secretary must then submit a plan to Congress within 60 days based on the report's recommendations. Section 6 of H.R. 1994 allows for changes in the crediting of federal service for certain SES employees at the VA who were removed due to performance or misconduct and convicted of a felony. This would reduce the years of service used in calculating their pension, decreasing their federal retirement benefit. Most civilian federal employees are covered by CSRS or FERS for retirement benefits, based on their hire date. To be eligible, individuals must have creditable federal service, make required contributions, and meet age and service requirements. Retirement benefits are calculated using salary base, accrual rate, and years of service. H.R. 1994 allows changes in service crediting for SES employees at the VA who were removed for performance or misconduct, reducing their pension. H.R. 1994 impacts the CSRS or FERS benefit calculation for SES employees at the VA who were removed for performance or misconduct and convicted of a felony that influenced their performance. It excludes the period between the activity leading to removal and the actual removal from the calculation. The removal action under H.R. 1994 impacts the CSRS or FERS benefit calculation for SES employees at the VA who were removed for performance or misconduct and convicted of a felony. Affected employees and retirees would be notified and given a hearing by another federal agency. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) would recalculate the retirement benefit within 30 days. Removed employees and retirees would receive a lump-sum credit for any period of federal service no longer creditable under CSRS or FERS. The forfeiture of federal retirement annuity benefits is limited to acts of treason or espionage. Members of Congress can lose service credit for any service performed if convicted of corruption under certain federal laws. The proposed amendment in H.R. 1994 limits the placement of Department employees on administrative leave to 14 days during a 365-day period if they are under investigation or facing disciplinary action. The Secretary can extend administrative leave beyond 14 days in a 365-day period with detailed explanation to Congress. Department of Justice limits administrative leave to 10 days without prior approval. According to the memorandum, an employee's status during an investigation or notice period depends on misconduct and position. Managers must assess if the employee poses a risk in the workplace. If no risk exists, the employee stays. If risk can be avoided by reassignment, it should be done. If risk persists and reassignment is not possible, indefinite suspension or enforced leave is recommended. The [policy] allows managers to consider placing an employee on administrative leave for up to 10 work days during disciplinary actions. Section 8(a) of H.R. 1994 proposes treating congressional testimony as official duty for department employees. The Secretary would provide travel expenses, including per diem, to a department employee performing official duty for the House of Representatives, Senate, or a congressional committee. This provision is similar to 5 U.S.C. \u00a76322(b) regarding testimony or record production. H.R. 1994 would also amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to limit awards and bonuses for Department of Veterans Affairs employees. The provisions in the Veterans Affairs bill would cap the total amount of awards and bonuses paid to employees at $300 million annually from FY2015 to FY2018, and $360 million annually from FY2019 to FY2024. This includes various types of awards and bonuses for federal employees, such as incentive awards and step increases for high performance. Title 38 authorizes performance pay for physicians and dentists, and cash bonuses for nurses and health-care professionals. H.R. 1994 requires a study on department employees' time spent on labor organizing activities. The study includes a cost-benefit analysis and must be completed within 180 days of enactment. The Comptroller General must submit a report on the study results to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs within 90 days after completion. Official time allows employees to represent a union during work hours. Employees on official time for union activities cannot exceed the number representing the agency. The Federal Labor Relations Authority determines if employees can use official time for labor organization activities during non-duty status. Employees representing an exclusive representative are granted official time as agreed upon by the agency and the representative. OPM policy emphasizes accountability and shared responsibility between labor and management. The Government Accountability Office evaluated official time at the Department of Veterans Affairs in FY2013, finding an official time rate of 4.05 hours per bargaining unit employee. The VA is implementing a new time and attendance system to track official time usage. The current time and attendance system at the agency lacks a code for capturing official time separately. Section 11 directs the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit covered reports to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans Affairs, which include recommendations to address public health or safety issues related to employee misconduct. The Secretary must promptly notify responsible managers mentioned in the report. The Secretary must ensure that responsible managers resolve identified issues in covered reports submitted by the Inspector General. Failure to resolve issues may result in the withholding of bonuses or awards. This authority is in addition to the IG's responsibilities under the Inspector General Act of 1970."
