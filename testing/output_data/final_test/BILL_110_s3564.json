It focuses on the valuation of statistical life in Environmental Protection Agency decision-making. The Act, titled the \"Restoring the Value of Every American in Environmental Decisions Act,\" addresses the controversy surrounding using a dollar value to determine the worth of a human life in environmental decision-making. This practice is criticized for disregarding religious, moral, and ethical beliefs, and for not adequately considering alternative decision-making tools based on health protections for vulnerable individuals. The Act promotes technology-forcing standards to encourage research in cutting-edge technologies that reduce costs, use of dangerous materials, and environmental impact. It also includes right-to-know safeguards to inform families and communities. The Act aims to inform individuals and communities about potential threats, empower them to make safety decisions, and encourage the reduction of toxic chemical emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency's decision-making involves policy and legal standards. The Act emphasizes policy decisions and legal standards, focusing on health-based protections, technology-forcing standards, and right-to-know safeguards. Federal agencies should consider nonquantifiable benefits of their actions, especially for involuntarily imposed risks. The use of a value of statistical life based on voluntarily accepted risks may not be suitable for involuntarily imposed risks. Current methodologies for the value of statistical life do not fully represent the situation. The value of statistical life methodologies may not fully represent the worth of a human life due to various factors such as individuals valuing the lives of others differently, the inability of certain groups to determine the value of avoiding death, limited study populations influencing results, and economic disparities affecting estimates. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must not lower the value of statistical life below the highest value previously used and must increase it annually to reflect average compensation of individuals. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must not decrease the value of statistical life based on personal attributes or relativistic analysis. The Administrator must also consider factors such as income, benefits, capital liquidation upon death, and value of nonpaid activities. Transparency in the decision-making process is required. The Administrator must ensure transparency in establishing a value of statistical life by providing public notice, explaining the process in simple terms, and describing the strengths and weaknesses of significant studies relied upon. The Administrator must provide public notice and describe the injury or event used for a study to the Senate and House Committees. Congress does not endorse the use of statistical life analysis for decision-making or cost-benefit analysis. The text chunk discusses the criteria for regulatory decision-making thresholds and the duty to make or revise standards under applicable laws."
