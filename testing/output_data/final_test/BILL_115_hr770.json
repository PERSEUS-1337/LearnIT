    "content": "The \"American Innovation $1 Coin Act\" establishes a program to mint $1 coins honoring innovation and innovators from each state, the District of Columbia, and each territory. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue these coins with designs selected in accordance with the Act. The Secretary will mint $1 coins honoring Native Americans and their contributions in accordance with subsection (r), and may mint a $1 coin in 2018 to introduce the series of coins described in this subsection. The $1 coin honoring American Innovators features the obverse described in paragraph (2)(A), a reverse with inscriptions of 'United States of America' and 'American Innovators', the signature of President George Washington, edge-incusing as in paragraph (2)(C), and a design reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. The term 'territory' in this subsection refers to specific regions including Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The $1 coins issued must meet design requirements such as featuring a likeness of the Statue of Liberty, the inscription '$1', and 'In God We Trust' on the obverse, and specific designs on the reverse. The design on the reverse of each coin issued under this subsection shall bear an image emblematic of one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or the territories of the United States. The curr_chunk discusses significant innovations, innovators, and groups of innovators. The curr_chunk discusses the edge-incused inscriptions on coins, including the year of minting, mint mark, and 'E Pluribus Unum', to preserve the distinctive edge for easy identification by individuals who are blind or visually impaired. It also mentions the issuance of coins commemorating innovation or innovators. The curr_chunk discusses the issuance of coins commemorating innovation or innovators from each State, the District of Columbia, or a territory in a specific order. Coins will be issued in the order of State ratification of the Constitution or admission into the Union. After all State coins are issued, coins will be issued for the District of Columbia and territories in a specific order. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue a $1 coin for any additional State admitted into the Union before the end of the 14-year period. This also applies in the event of independence or adding of a territory. If a territory becomes independent or ceases to be part of the United States before $1 coins are minted, this subsection will no longer apply to that territory. If a new territory is added to the United States, $1 coins will be issued for each new territory in the order they are added, starting after the coin is issued for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The subsection outlines the issuance of four $1 coin designs each year for 14 years, featuring innovations or innovators from each state, the District of Columbia, and territories. The Secretary will determine the number of coins for each design. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with state officials, selects the innovation or innovator to be featured on the reverse of each coin. Designs for the coins are chosen by the Secretary after consultation. The Governor or chief executive of the State, District of Columbia, or territory, along with the Commission of Fine Arts, are involved in the issuance of coins under this subsection. The Secretary has the authority to review and approve designs for $1 coins, ensuring they are dignified and not frivolous or inappropriate. Designs cannot include head and shoulders portraits, busts of any person, or portraits of living individuals. Under this subsection, $1 coins minted shall be considered numismatic items for sections 5134 and 5136. The Secretary can mint and issue $1 coins in uncirculated and proof qualities as deemed appropriate. The program will terminate after honoring an innovation, individual innovator, or group of innovators from each State, the District of Columbia, and each territory, and can only be resumed by an Act of Congress. The curr_chunk summarizes the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
