    "content": "Tax rates on dividends increased in 2013 for certain high-income taxpayers due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) and a 3.8% tax on net investment income. ATRA reversed the effect of qualified dividends being taxed at reduced rates since 2003. Past tax reforms have often changed the treatment of dividends. Tax rates on dividends increased in 2013 for high-income taxpayers due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act. Congress is considering changes to the tax treatment of dividends as part of tax reform options. One option is to tax dividends as ordinary income to raise revenue and reduce individual income tax rates. Another option is to increase the tax on dividends to finance a corporate rate cut. Tax rates on dividends may be reduced by 4.6%, with proposed changes to tax treatment by Chairman Dave Camp. Dividends could be taxed as ordinary income, with some exclusions. This report discusses current law tax treatment, economic issues, and policy options for dividend taxation. Integration options are also considered for taxing dividend income once. The tax treatment of dividends depends on the recipient, with individuals generally taxed at reduced capital gains rates. For 2013, the maximum tax rate for qualified dividends was 20%, with higher rates for taxpayers in higher income brackets. Additionally, a 3.8% net investment income tax may apply to dividend income. Tax-exempt entities receiving dividends are not taxed on most types of dividends, exempt from UBIT. Dividends are taxed at reduced rates for individuals, with maximum rate of 20% in 2013. Deductions for dividends received by corporations help prevent multiple-level taxation. Corporate shareholders can deduct varying percentages of dividends based on ownership levels. The tax expenditure estimate for the preferred tax treatment of qualified dividends was $29.8 billion in 2012. Post-ATRA, the cost of this tax expenditure is expected to decrease. Dividend income is concentrated at the top of the income distribution. Equity analysis examines the burden of taxes on dividends and concerns \"double taxation\" issues. Income from corporate equity investments, like dividends, is taxed at both the corporate and individual level, resulting in double taxation. For example, $1 of net corporate income would be taxed at 35% at the corporate level, leaving $0.65 after tax. If this $0.65 is paid out as a dividend, the individual receiving it may face a maximum tax rate of 39.6%, resulting in a total tax rate of 61% on the original $1 of corporate income. The \"double taxation\" of dividend income is a key issue at both corporate and individual levels. Not all dividends are subject to this double taxation, with exemptions for certain entities. In 2009, around 56% of dividends paid were not taxed at the individual level. Vertical and horizontal equity concerns arise when evaluating the tax treatment of dividends. The distribution of the tax burden on dividends raises issues of vertical equity, particularly regarding higher income individuals. A discussion of corporate tax incidence is also relevant in this context. The discussion of corporate tax incidence is relevant to equity issues related to dividend taxation. The concentration of dividend income at the top of the income distribution raises concerns about horizontal equity. In 2011, 17% of tax returns reported income from qualified dividends, with higher income returns more likely to have such income. The top 2% of returns accounted for 53% of qualified dividends reported. Middle-income taxpayers may indirectly hold stocks through pensions and retirement savings accounts. Concerns exist that taxing dividends as ordinary income would disproportionately impact elderly taxpayers, as nearly half of qualified dividends were reported by taxpayers age 65 and over in 2011. Interest income, taxed at ordinary rates, is also more prevalent among the elderly, with 50% reported by those age 65 and over. Elderly taxpayers, especially those in the highest income quintile, earn a significant portion of their income from interest, dividends, and rents. While dividends are more common among the elderly, it only makes up a small part of total income for low-income elderly individuals. This analysis of income sources contributes to understanding the progressivity of the tax system. Higher income taxpayers are more likely to have income from qualified dividends, along with other forms of capital income. The top income quintile earns 80.9% of all capital income, with 49.8% earned by the top 1%. The tax burden on dividends depends on how it can be shifted, with traditional analysis suggesting that it falls on corporate owners and capital owners in the long run. This analysis contributes to understanding the progressivity of the tax system. Recent studies have shown that in an open economy, labor bears some of the burden of corporate taxes, with 75% allocated to capital owners and the rest to labor. Increasing dividend tax rates would make the system more progressive, benefiting higher-income taxpayers, while decreasing rates would make it less progressive. Decreases in the tax rate on dividends would make the tax system less progressive and raise equity concerns. Corporate income tax analyses show that the tax burden on corporate equity owners shifts to other incomes in the long run. This leads to capital moving out of the corporate sector, resulting in equalized after-tax returns in both sectors. Tax rates on dividends were reduced in 2003 to reduce economic distortions and promote growth. This adjustment process ensures fairness for equity holders, compensating them with higher pre-tax returns. Market forces address perceived unfairness, balancing investments in dividend-paying assets with other options. Equity-financed investments are taxed more heavily than debt-financed ones due to deductible interest payments. The Department of the Treasury's 1992 study on tax integration found that full integration could result in substantial efficiency gains by reducing economic distortions favoring non-corporate and debt-financed investments. However, with dividends currently taxed at a reduced rate, the potential efficiency gains are limited. The issue of how to replace revenue if the tax is repealed further complicates the potential gains. The efficiency effects of eliminating double taxation of dividends depend on how capital distortions compare to other distortions under different tax systems. While some economists believe dividend taxes discourage investment, others argue changes in dividend tax policy may not affect investment incentives. The impact of dividend tax rate changes on savings is uncertain, as higher rates may lead to lower savings due to reduced opportunity cost of present consumption. Higher tax rates on dividends can impact savings and consumption. The effects on savings are uncertain, as they can increase due to reduced future income, but also decrease due to lower opportunity cost of present consumption. Changes in dividend tax rates could potentially lead to increased personal savings, which in turn could boost output and growth. However, if reduced tax rates on dividends are debt-financed, it could result in increases in national debt and interest payments that may offset any potential growth effects. The differential treatment of debt versus equity, dividends, and capital gains favors retentions in corporations. Stockholders with varying tax rates and tax-exempt investors impact the taxation of corporate equity investment. Estimates show that corporate equity-financed income was taxed at 37% before 2003 and 34% since, reflecting corporate preferences. The tax relief in 2003 reduced the tax rate on corporate equity-financed income from 37% to 34%. This was largely due to tax reductions on dividends. The distortion between debt and equity reduced the overall tax rate on corporate capital to 26%. Another distortion arises from the tax differential between dividends and capital gains. The tax system favors capital gains over dividends due to lower rates. Taxation can lead to misallocation of capital across countries, but this is largely irrelevant to dividend taxes based on residence. Evidence shows small differentials in effective marginal corporate taxes between the United States and other countries. Profit shifting can occur due to corporate tax rate differentials. Profit shifting can occur when firms shift profits to low tax countries, reducing revenues without affecting real output. Increasing taxes on dividends in the U.S. could lead to greater efficiency and potentially lower the corporate rate, attracting capital inflows and increasing labor income. Changes in dividend taxation can influence firms' payout policies, with evidence showing an increase in dividend payments after a reduction in dividend tax rates in 2003. These open economy issues should be considered when evaluating integration proposals. The reduction in dividend tax rates in 2003 led to an increase in dividend payouts, particularly from firms with taxable shareholders. Some argue that factors other than tax policy may have driven this increase, such as higher corporate earnings during that period. Despite predictions that lower dividend tax rates would boost stock prices and stimulate the economy, empirical evidence has not found a clear link between dividend tax rates and stock prices. The reduction in dividend tax rates in 2003 led to an increase in dividend payouts, particularly from firms with taxable shareholders. High-dividend yield stocks outperformed others, indicating investors may have adjusted their portfolios. Changes in dividend tax policy have small and transitory effects on the stock market, as market adjustments reflect asset values. Dividend tax relief as an economic stimulus tool has limited scope due to already reduced tax rates. Targeting high-income individuals with tax relief, like dividend tax relief, is relatively ineffective as they tend to save more. Under the current system, dividend tax policy may not be an effective stimulus measure as individuals tend to save more than spend. Policies that increase businesses' cash flow without impacting hiring and investment incentives are not successful as stimulus measures. Various options for dividend relief, integration, and increasing taxes on dividends are discussed. Capital used in the corporate sector is taxed twice under the current system. Integrating the corporate and individual income tax systems would increase economic efficiency by removing distortions between debt and equity financing. Full integration is practically infeasible, but current policies like reduced tax rates on dividends aim to achieve some efficiency benefits. Reforms that adjust taxes on dividends impact the relative taxes on distributions versus earnings retentions. Integration policies could reverse the current treatment to favor distributions over retentions, potentially influencing corporate payout decisions. However, reducing taxes on dividends or integrating the corporate and individual income tax systems could lead to a decrease in federal revenues, potentially increasing the deficit and national debt. These policies may also address concerns related to taxing multinational corporations, as profit shifting has increased with international capital mobility. The current U.S. tax system encourages corporations to report income in low-tax jurisdictions, reducing domestic tax collection. The United States moved from a classical system to a \"modified classical\" system in 2003, taxing shareholder-level dividend income at preferred rates to reduce the difference in tax burden on different types of investments. This change lessened efficiency-reducing distortions in the tax system. Reducing shareholder-level taxes on dividends aligns tax rates on investments, lessening distortions. However, biases for debt financing and double taxation of corporate income remain. Integration of corporate and individual income tax can address these issues, with full integration covering dividends and retained earnings. Full integration of corporate and individual income tax systems can be achieved through various methods, such as a partnership basis, shareholder credit system, or elimination of taxes at the individual level. Partial integration options include dividend relief through deductions for dividends paid at the firm level or exclusions for dividends received at the individual level. The 1992 Treasury Report recommended a dividend exclusion system due to minimal changes required from current law. The 1992 Treasury report recommended key policy considerations for integration proposals, including the treatment of foreign shareholders, domestic tax-exempt shareholders, corporate tax preferences, and foreign corporate tax payments. The report suggested that benefits of integration should not extend to foreign shareholders, tax-exempt investors' capital income should be taxed, corporate-level tax preferences should not be passed through to shareholders, and foreign tax payments by U.S. corporations should not be treated the same as domestic tax payments. Full integration of taxation on a partnership basis would eliminate corporate tax, taxing individuals on their share of income. Challenges include profit allocation among shareholders, treatment of losses, and foreign/tax-exempt shareholders. Integration of the corporate and individual tax systems can be achieved by granting a credit at the individual level for taxes paid at the corporate level. This approach involves the corporation acting as a withholding agent, paying taxes on dividend income on behalf of the shareholder, with distributed income ultimately taxed at the shareholder's tax rate. However, full integration via shareholder allocation option has not been widely pursued due to complications and potential federal revenue losses. Several European countries have abandoned their dividend credit imputation systems due to challenges related to the European Community Treaty conditions. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico still use imputation systems as of 2013. Implementing an imputation credit system poses challenges, such as whether the credit should be refundable to non-taxable investors. Implementing an imputation credit system poses challenges, such as whether the credit should be refundable to non-taxable investors. Making credits non-refundable would reduce revenue loss but may deter foreign investment. The 1992 Treasury report did not recommend an imputation credit due to administrative complexity. Australia's experience suggests imputation credits may encourage corporations to pay tax. Imputation credits in Australia may have encouraged corporations to pay tax domestically, generating credits for shareholders. Taxing dividends as ordinary income, with a deduction for dividends paid, could prevent double taxation. However, challenges arise with non-taxable entities and tax preferences under a dividends paid deduction. The curr_chunk discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing a dividend deduction or an \"allowance for corporate equity\" (ACE) as alternatives to reduce corporate tax rates. The ACE option, based on corporate equity rather than dividends paid, could address concerns for firms that pay less in dividends, such as technology companies. It aims to promote efficient capital allocation internationally but may also distort corporate payout decisions. The drawbacks of a dividend exclusion include the corporate tax no longer acting as a backstop to individual income tax. It can be limited to exclude only dividends paid out of taxed corporate income. The 1992 Treasury Report recommended a dividend exclusion, but in 2003, a reduced rate on dividends was enacted instead to avoid administrative complexity for firms. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a dividend exclusion in the Tax Reform Act of 2014, where 40% of net long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income would be excluded from taxable income. This proposal aims to tax capital income, including dividends, at the individual level rather than the corporate level, keeping effective tax rates on capital income close. The Camp draft proposes a 40% exclusion for capital income, maintaining effective tax rates. A comprehensive business income tax (CBIT) is also discussed, aiming to eliminate bias for debt-financing by taxing interest and profits at the entity level. This could be revenue-neutral but may deter foreign capital investment due to increased tax burden on debt-financed ventures. The proposed Comprehensive Business Income Tax (CBIT) could deter foreign capital investment by increasing the tax burden on debt-financed ventures. A long phase-in period would be needed to avoid penalizing firms with high debt levels, reducing potential efficiency gains and revenue. Taxing dividends at ordinary rates could generate additional revenue to potentially reduce individual income tax rates and increase overall tax system progressivity. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed taxing dividends as ordinary income, with a 40% exclusion for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. This change is estimated to generate $18.7 billion in additional revenue between 2014 and 2023. The Camp proposal aims to reduce corporate and individual tax rates by using revenue from repealing and modifying tax provisions. The history of dividend taxation dates back to 1909 when dividends were not deductible for corporations. Individual income tax was introduced in 1913 with a 1% levy on net income and additional surtax rates. The history of dividend taxation dates back to 1909 when dividends were not deductible for corporations. Individual income tax was introduced in 1913 with a 1% levy on net income and additional surtax rates. From 1913 through 1935, dividends received by individuals were not subject to the normal tax on individual income, but were included in net income for surtax purposes. The corporate income tax rate was initially the same as the normal tax rate on individual income, but was increased in 1917. Dividends were exempt from individual normal income tax from 1917 through 1935, but the exemption did not fully offset corporate taxes paid on income distributed as dividends. The Revenue Act of 1936 introduced changes in the tax treatment of dividend income. It imposed a new surtax on the undistributed net income of corporations, with five graduated rates ranging from 7% to 27%. The act aimed to prevent tax avoidance by high-income taxpayers who retained earnings in corporations to avoid individual surtax rates on dividends. The Revenue Act of 1936 imposed a surtax on undistributed corporate profits to prevent tax avoidance by high-income taxpayers. The Revenue Act of 1938 repealed this tax, reduced surtax rates, and applied it to corporations with net incomes over $25,000 for 1938 and 1939 only. The 1954 Act introduced a new dividend exclusion for individuals, allowing each spouse to exclude the first $50 of dividend income. The Revenue Act of 1964 increased the dividend exclusion for married couples to $100 for each spouse (maximum of $200 per joint return) and to $100 for single individuals. The act also reduced the dividend tax credit to 2% of dividends received in excess of the exclusion for tax year 1964. In 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act further increased the maximum dividend exclusion for joint returns to $400. The 1980 Act increased the dividend exclusion for joint returns from $200 to $400 and for single individuals from $100 to $200. It also expanded the exclusion to cover interest income, effective only for tax years 1981 and 1982. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 repealed the interest and dividend exclusion for tax years after December 31, 1981, but reinstated a $100 dividend exclusion for individuals in 1982. The dividend exclusion for individuals was repealed in 1986 to broaden the tax base and reduce tax rates. Dividends were fully taxed as ordinary income until 2002. The top tax rate on qualified dividends was reduced to 15% in 2003 to promote economic growth. Taxing dividends as ordinary income was believed to distort corporate financial decisions and encourage firms to retain earnings. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 extended dividend tax rate reductions through 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended reduced tax rates on dividends through 2012. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 imposed a 3.8% tax on net investment income for certain individuals starting in 2013. Under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the top tax rate on dividends was allowed to rise to 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket. The 15% or 0% tax rate on dividends was made permanent for all other taxpayers. There are two different views on the effects of dividend taxation, the \"Traditional (Old) View\" suggests dividends provide non-tax or non-financial benefits to shareholders. The \"old view\" suggests dividends signal firm performance to investors and taxing dividends at the individual level increases the cost of capital, discouraging investment. The \"trapped equity view\" states dividends are the only way to distribute earnings to shareholders, leading to an inefficient allocation of capital with double taxation. The \"new view\" of dividends argues that taxes on dividends do not affect investment incentives but are capitalized into stock prices. However, this theory is challenged if firms can freely repurchase their own shares. The influence of the new view has diminished due to the common practice of U.S. firms repurchasing shares. The new view theory on dividends, originally proposed by British economist Mervyn King, was influenced by the prohibition of share repurchases in the United Kingdom. In the United States, restrictions on share repurchases led economists to embrace this theory, but as U.S. firms increasingly repurchased shares, the new view became less viable. Additionally, the U.S. shifted to a \"modified classical\" system for taxing dividends in 2003. The U.S. shifted to a \"modified classical\" system for taxing dividends in 2003, reducing statutory tax rates on dividend income. Most OECD countries decreased taxes on dividends through reduced taxes on corporate profits, unlike the U.S. Shareholder-level taxes on dividends in the U.S. increased after 2012, but individual-level statutory tax rates on dividends remain below 2002 levels. Since 2000, OECD countries have been moving away from full imputation systems for taxing dividends, with some countries like Finland, France, Italy, and Norway increasing shareholder-level taxes on dividends. The U.S. has maintained constant statutory corporate tax rates, while individual-level statutory tax rates on dividends remain below 2002 levels. Various systems for taxing dividends are used in major industrialized countries as of 2013, with countries like Japan, Denmark, and Switzerland using a modified classical system. Countries in the OECD have different systems for taxing dividends. Some, like Ireland, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands, have a classical system that taxes dividends at the individual level. Others, like Canada, Mexico, and Australia, provide full imputation credits. The U.K. and France have partial imputation credits or a partial inclusion system, respectively. France excludes a portion of dividends received from income."
