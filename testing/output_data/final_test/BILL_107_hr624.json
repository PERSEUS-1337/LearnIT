    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Organ Donation Improvement Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of organ donation. Sense of Congress regarding organ donation includes educating the public, encouraging family discussions, and recognizing the contribution of living donors and medical advancements in organ transplantation. SEC. 3. Payment of travel and subsistence expenses for living organ donation under Section 377 of the Public Health Service Act. \"Sec. 377 allows the Secretary to award grants for travel and subsistence expenses for living organ donors, as well as incidental nonmedical expenses. Eligibility for payments is based on the donating individual's residence in a different state.\" The Secretary can award grants for travel and subsistence expenses for living organ donors residing in a different state. The annual income of the recipient must not exceed $35,000. The Secretary may also include individuals incurring qualifying expenses for organ donation. The Secretary may cover qualifying expenses for family members accompanying organ donors for travel. Payments are limited based on the geographic area of the donor and recipient. Expenses for payments under this subsection are limited to the amount that would have been paid if the recipient's area was the covered vicinity, considering travel costs and regional cost differences. The term 'covered vicinity' refers to the transplant center nearest to the recipient's residence. An award under this section cannot be used to pay for expenses covered by other programs. The award will not cover expenses already paid by state compensation, insurance, or health benefits programs, or by prepaid health service providers. Definitions include 'covered vicinity,' 'donating individuals,' and 'qualifying expenses.'
