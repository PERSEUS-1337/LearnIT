    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Letter of Estimated Annual Debt for Students Act of 2017\" or the \"LEADS Act of 2017.\" It requires an annual estimate of student loan borrowing costs. Section 485 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require eligible institutions to provide enrolled students with an annual cost estimate of student loan borrowing costs. This estimate must be given to students receiving education loans at least 30 days before the start of each academic year. The estimate should include information on cumulative balances and monthly payments. The amended Section 485 of the Higher Education Act now requires institutions to provide students with annual cost estimates of education loans, including cumulative balances and projected monthly payments based on standard repayment schedules. Interest rates for each loan must be disclosed, with a disclaimer included in the notice. The amended Section 485 of the Higher Education Act mandates institutions to provide students with annual cost estimates of education loans, including interest rates based on loan types and loan awareness. The estimate must be provided to the student in hard copy format. The Secretary may prescribe the method of providing cost estimates to students, separate from other disclosures. Institutions acting in good faith are not liable for inaccuracies in the estimate. The Secretary will provide examples of required estimates and technical assistance to comply with regulations. The Secretary provides technical assistance for compliance with cost estimate requirements, preliminary approvals for estimate formats, a formula for projections, and encryption technology software for secure estimates. In this subsection, definitions for education loan and private education loan are provided, including loans under part D, State-sponsored loan programs, and private education loans known to the institution. The term 'private education loan' is defined in section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act. The term 'student' excludes those who transferred to the institution more than 60 days before the academic year begins. SEC. 3. ANNUAL PROVISION OF INFORMATION BY THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION. The Secretary of Education must annually provide institutions of higher education with information on the amount of loans expected to be disbursed to borrowers for the next academic year and the projected cumulative balance of those loans after completion of the borrower's course of study. The Secretary of Education provides institutions of higher education with projected monthly payment amounts of loans for borrowers, based on a standard repayment schedule."
