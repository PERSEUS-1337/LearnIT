    "content": "Congress has faced challenges in closing military installations due to restrictions written into National Defense Authorization Acts during the 1960s and 1970s. Despite vetoed bills, Congress has implemented provisions to delay closures of installations with a certain number of civilian employees. The President has authority to close military installations under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. The most recent BRAC round, a comprehensive reduction of DOD real property, was authorized until April 16, 2006. The President, as commander in chief, has the authority to deploy federal armed forces and create military installations. Title 10 of the United States Code establishes laws for the armed forces, including the Secretary of Defense's role in overseeing the Department of Defense. The secretaries of the military departments (Army, Navy, Air Force) operate under the Secretary of Defense's authority. The Department of Defense (DOD) is funded and regulated by Congress through annual defense and military construction appropriations acts and the National Defense Authorization Act. Congress authorizes the acquisition and transfer of military real property, funds construction and operation of military installations, and empowers DOD to waive statutory requirements. The Department of Defense is funded and regulated by Congress through annual defense and military construction appropriations acts. Congress authorizes the acquisition and transfer of military real property, funds construction and operation of military installations, and empowers DOD to shape and maintain its infrastructure inventory. Congress has passed restrictions on presidential powers to close military installations, including 10 U.S.C. \u00a72687 and 10 U.S.C. 993. The Secretary of Defense and secretaries of military departments must follow a detailed process before closing or realigning military installations with at least 300 civilian personnel. This process includes submitting notification, evaluation of consequences, criteria used for closure recommendation, and a waiting period of 30 legislative days or 60 calendar days. The statute defines realignment as reducing and relocating functions and civilian personnel positions, with exemptions for certain situations. Restrictions are imposed on secretaries for realignments involving significant reductions in civilian personnel. Preparation of facilities at other military installations for relocated employees is prohibited until specific conditions are met. Section 2687 is based on the anticipated reduction of civilian employees. Section 2687 and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7993 outline processes for reducing civilian employees and military personnel at installations. Section 993 requires notification to Committees on Armed Services, justification, evaluation of impacts, and a waiting period before implementing reductions. Both statutes have exceptions for national security or military emergencies. The U.S. Joint Forces Command, headquartered in Virginia, was disbanded in 2011. The disbandment did not reach a realignment threshold at any installation, so no statutory requirement for congressional notification was needed. BRAC has been a time-limited process established under specific authorization from Congress. The last four rounds were carried out under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, which expired in 2006. Future BRAC rounds would require new legislation from Congress and the President. Military installation closures involve various issues beyond real property.
