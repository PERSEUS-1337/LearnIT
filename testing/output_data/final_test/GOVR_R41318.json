    "content": "Jamaica, with a population of 2.8 million, has a stable parliamentary system influenced by British colonial rule. The People's National Party (PNP) and Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) have dominated politics since independence in 1962. In the 1970s and 1980s, the parties had ideological differences, but by 1989, both adopted pro-business policies with few distinctions. The People's National Party (PNP) and Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) have dominated Jamaican politics since independence in 1962. P.J. Patterson of the PNP served as Prime Minister until 2006, followed by Portia Simpson Miller, Jamaica's first female Prime Minister. The PNP's policy orientation focused on market liberalization and close ties with the United States. In 2007, the JLP, led by Bruce Golding, returned to power, ending the PNP's 18-year rule. In September 2007, the JLP, led by Bruce Golding, came to power in Jamaica due to public dissatisfaction with crime and violence under Prime Minister Simpson's government. The JLP currently holds a narrow margin in the House of Representatives. Challenges in anti-crime and anti-corruption efforts persist under the Golding government. In May 2010, Jamaica's stability was tested when the government agreed to extradite alleged drug kingpin Christopher \"Dudas\" Coke to the United States. In August 2009, a federal grand jury indicted Prime Minister Golding for narcotics and arms trafficking, but he denied the request for extradition. The U.S. pressured Jamaica in 2010 to extradite Coke, highlighting potential government corruption. Reports also surfaced that Golding hired a U.S. lobbying firm to convince the U.S. not to seek extradition. In response to pressure from the U.S. to extradite Christopher Coke, Prime Minister Golding hired lobbyists to convince the U.S. not to seek extradition. However, after facing political fallout, Golding issued an arrest warrant for Coke. This led to violent clashes in West Kingston, resulting in 76 deaths, including police officers and soldiers. Security forces eventually secured the area. Security forces secured West Kingston by late May after violent clashes resulting in 76 deaths. Christopher Coke was arrested on June 22, 2010, and extradited to the U.S. on June 24 for running a drug ring. Prime Minister Golding faced criticism for hiring lobbyists and handling police operations. The Prime Minister faced criticism for his handling of police operations and the extradition of Christopher Coke, narrowly surviving a no-confidence vote. The fallout from these events will continue to challenge the government as it implements fiscal austerity measures. Jamaica has a history of political violence, high crime rates, and internal divisions within political parties. In the aftermath of Jamaica's independence, political parties utilized armed criminal gangs to secure votes in garrison communities, creating strongholds for the JLP and PNP. Gang leaders, known as \"dons,\" controlled these communities through violence and intimidation, receiving government support in exchange for loyalty to a political party. Garrison communities functioned as a separate entity within the state, providing both protection and services to residents. The political violence in Jamaican \"garrison communities\" peaked in the 1980 election with 800 deaths. While election violence has decreased, the 2007 general election still saw some violence, with nine deaths. Jamaican gangs are involved in drug and weapons trafficking, with connections to New York City and Toronto. In the 1970s, gangs trafficked marijuana, but in the 1980s, they shifted to cocaine and weapons. Their power now stems from the drug trade rather than political affiliations. The rise in violent crime in Jamaica since the 1990s is largely attributed to drug trafficking, with a high murder rate and a significant number of murders related to gang feuds. The availability of guns has also increased due to connections to the international drug trade, with over 70% of murders involving firearms. The importation of guns is a major concern in Jamaica, with over 70% of murders involving firearms, mostly originating from the United States. The government established a task force to address violence and planned to introduce legislation to criminalize gang membership. After the outbreak of violence related to the Coke extradition, anti-gang legislation was being prepared. One of the challenges is breaking the link between political parties and armed gangs, highlighted by the extradition of Christopher Coke, a leader of the Shower Posse. The Jamaican government faces challenges in breaking the entrenched linkages between armed gangs and political parties, highlighted by the extradition of Christopher Coke. Concerns remain about the government's ability to provide security and services if criminal gangs are dismantled. The State Department's human rights report noted ongoing issues such as unlawful killings by security forces and poor prison conditions. Jamaica faces challenges with armed gangs linked to political parties, highlighted by the extradition of Christopher Coke. Concerns persist about the government's capacity to provide security and services if gangs are disbanded. Human rights issues include unlawful killings by security forces and inadequate prison conditions. Police in Jamaica have been criticized for extrajudicial killings and excessive use of force, with high rates of violence and crime in the country. Amnesty International has raised concerns about police justifying killings as shoot-outs with gunmen, which may amount to unlawful killings. In late May 2010, Jamaican security forces began operations to extradite Christopher Coke, prompting concerns from human rights organizations. The Jamaican government pledged to respect human rights during the search for Coke. Amnesty International praised efforts to reform the police and justice system but also highlighted ongoing human rights violations. The Jamaican government is working on reforming the police and justice system to tackle corruption and reduce homicides. There are concerns about human rights violations, including abuses against the gay and lesbian community. Prime Minister Golding's controversial statements have sparked criticism from gay rights groups. J-FLAG reports human rights abuses against the LGBTQ+ community in Jamaica, including arbitrary detention, mob attacks, stabbings, harassment in hospitals and prisons, and targeted shootings. Members have faced property attacks, death threats, and arson. Fear of physical harm prevents reporting of incidents, with lesbian women also experiencing sexual assault and violence. Critics highlight Jamaica's pervasive homophobia and targeted violence. Jamaica's pervasive homophobia has led to discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals and those living with HIV/AIDS. Key activists like Brian Williamson and Steve Harvey were murdered in apparent hate crimes. The economy relies heavily on services, with tourism being the main source of employment and foreign exchange. Economic growth has been modest, averaging about 1.5% from 1990-2007. Jamaica's economic growth averaged about 1.5%, slightly above population growth. Major constraints include vulnerability to external shocks and a large public debt burden. The country is classified as an upper middle-income developing country with pockets of poverty. Poverty declined from 30.5% in 1989 to 9.9% in 2007, with progress in financial sector reform and social sectors. Challenges include high crime, violence, and unemployment, especially among youth. The Jamaican economy has been impacted by violence, high unemployment, and a significant HIV/AIDS epidemic. The global financial crisis and recession led to a decline in demand for Jamaican exports, resulting in a contraction of the economy. Unemployment has increased to over 13%, with closures of bauxite/alumina plants and declines in tourism. The Jamaican economy faced challenges due to violence, high unemployment, and HIV/AIDS. The global financial crisis caused a decline in exports and economic contraction. Remittances fell in 2009 but rebounded in 2010. The government struggles with a large debt burden, limiting its ability to respond to the crisis. IMF approved a stand-by arrangement to support economic reforms in 2010. The IMF approved a stand-by arrangement in 2010 to support Jamaica's economic reforms, including fiscal reform, public debt restructuring, and financial sector reform. The program aims to increase social spending for targeted safety net programs and is expected to generate $1.1 billion in funding from other international financial institutions. Jamaica relies heavily on oil imports for energy consumption and was the first Caribbean nation to join the PetroCaribe program in 2005 to combat rising oil prices. Jamaica joined the PetroCaribe program in 2005, importing oil on preferential terms with financing for energy and economic development projects. The program was altered in 2008 to allow more financing when oil prices were high. U.S. relations with Jamaica are close. U.S. relations with Jamaica are close, characterized by economic and cultural linkages, cooperation on anti-drug trafficking efforts, and assistance from USAID and the Peace Corps since Jamaica's independence in 1962. There are 10,000 Americans living in Jamaica, and over a million U.S. tourists visit each year. Tension arose due to Jamaica's reluctance to extradite Jamaican gang leader Christopher Coke on drug trafficking charges, but after efforts to capture and extradite him in 2010, U.S. officials commended the Jamaican government. The State Department commended the Golding government for its efforts during violence in Kingston in May 2010. A travel alert was issued for U.S. citizens, noting a state of emergency in certain areas. Jamaica has received significant U.S. foreign assistance, with over $500 million in the 1990s and an average of almost $23 million annually from FY2000-FY2006. U.S. foreign aid to Jamaica has decreased in recent years, with assistance averaging about $12.7 million annually from FY2007 through FY2010. In FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $13.1 million in assistance, with funding allocated for various projects including community policing, youth and education programs, HIV/AIDS combat activities, and military education and training. USAID work in Jamaica has focused on economic growth, rural development, health (specifically HIV/AIDS projects), democracy, and education. Security assistance includes support for port and border security, counternarcotics, and counterterrorism capabilities. The USAID has focused on economic growth, rural development, health, democracy, and education in Jamaica. Security assistance includes support for port and border security, counternarcotics, and counterterrorism capabilities. Funding has also been provided to increase the counternarcotics and counterterrorism capabilities of Jamaican security forces, enhance their capability to protect Jamaican waters, and support training for the Jamaica Defense Force. Jamaica received high-speed interceptor boats in 2008 under the Enduring Friendship initiative. Additionally, Jamaica is likely to receive assistance under the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative to reduce illicit trafficking, increase public safety, and promote social justice. The Obama Administration has requested $79 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) program in FY2011. The program aims to combat illicit trafficking, strengthen regional defense institutions, provide educational opportunities for at-risk youth, and promote community and law enforcement cooperation. Jamaica, a major producer and exporter of marijuana, is also a drug transit country for cocaine. The United States has a Peace Corps program in Jamaica since 1962, with volunteers working on youth projects, HIV/AIDS education, water sanitation, and environmental education. Jamaica is a drug transit country for South American cocaine destined for the U.S. The government cooperates closely with the United States on counternarcotics efforts, with training and support provided to the Jamaica Constabulary Force and Jamaica Defense Force. The U.S. Marshals Service and Jamaica Fugitive Apprehension Team work together for training and operational support. Jamaica has extradited wanted drug traffickers to the U.S. for prosecution. The JDF Coast Guard participated in joint deployments with the U.S. in 2009 under \"Operation Riptide.\" The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) highlighted delays in extradition requests, questioning Jamaica's commitment to law enforcement cooperation. The State Department commended the Golding government for extraditing Christopher Coke in 2010 and encouraged Jamaica to enhance collaboration with the U.S. and regional partners, develop a gang reduction strategy, and address corruption within the government. The INCSR report emphasized the prevalence of public corruption in Jamaica, hindering efforts against drug-related crimes. The government's anti-corruption legislation was stalled in parliament, but measures were being fast-tracked. Minister of National Security Dwight Nelson attributed gang activities in Jamaica to the return of criminals from other countries. The return of criminals from Britain, Canada, and the United States has contributed to gang activities in Jamaica. U.S. criminal deportations to Jamaica numbered 1,178 in FY2007, 1,261 in FY2008, and 1,252 in FY2009. A 2007 joint UN/World Bank study concluded that while most deportees are not committing violent crimes, a minority may be causing serious problems by their involvement in crime. Jamaican politicians argue that deportees learned criminal behavior in the U.S., while criminologist Bernard Headley believes most deportees are not hardened criminals. In June 2007, then-Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller called for international assistance in rehabilitating and reintegrating criminal deportees in Jamaica. A UN/World Bank study suggested that supporting reintegration efforts for deported offenders could help weaken international criminal networks. The study recommended better coordination among sending countries, research on the link between deportees and crime, and financing reintegration programs. The UK started funding a project for returning deportees in 2008. The United Kingdom funded a project in 2008 to help deported individuals from the UK integrate into Jamaican society. Jamaica has benefited from trade programs like the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, which provide tariff treatment for textile and apparel producers. Congress extended the CBTPA benefits through September 2020. Jamaica's manufacturing exports to the United States have not significantly increased despite participating in preferential trade programs. Competition from low-cost producers like the Dominican Republic and Honduras, as well as Asia, has hindered growth. The United States remains Jamaica's main trading partner, with 45% of imports and 30% of exports. Jamaican exports to the US in 2009 declined by 36% due to the global economic downturn, while imports from the US decreased by almost 46%. Top exports to the US in 2009 were ethanol and aluminum. Jamaica's exports to the United States in 2009 were ethanol and aluminum, accounting for about 63% of the total. Major imports from the US included oil, machinery, food, and industrial supplies. Jamaica is a member of CARICOM and participates in trade negotiations through CRNM. Concerns have been raised about the impact of free trade agreements on the region. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Jamaica has a history of attracting foreign direct investment from the United States, with over 80 major U.S. investors in the country. U.S. direct investment in Jamaica was estimated at $901 million in 2008.
