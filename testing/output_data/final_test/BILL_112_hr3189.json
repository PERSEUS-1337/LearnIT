Congress finds that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, with sudden cardiac arrest being the leading cause of death in young athletes. Sudden cardiac arrest kills an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 children and young people per year.

Only 36 states have laws encouraging CPR or automated external defibrillator use. Encouraging CPR and AED training in schools can significantly increase survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest. Teaching students these life-saving skills, along with healthy behaviors, can save lives and improve emergency response in schools.
