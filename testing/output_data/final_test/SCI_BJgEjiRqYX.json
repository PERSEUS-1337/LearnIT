This approach enhances the accuracy of generative models and aids in learning object representations. The generator successfully identifies and separates information related to different objects, as confirmed by a human study. Generative modelling approaches aim to learn the generative process of observed data, with deep generative models using neural networks to capture important factors of variation. The structure of the generative model is crucial in learning corresponding representations, allowing for the generation of images faithful to the reference distribution. Deep generative models use neural networks to capture salient features and recover independent factors of variation, such as pose and lighting of human faces. An under-explored inductive bias in these models is compositionality at the representational level of objects, allowing for the disentanglement of visual information in a scene. This enables a more accurate generative model of real-world images by describing a scene as a composition of objects. In this work, object compositionality for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is investigated, with a focus on incorporating dependencies among objects and background. Two extensions are proposed to address the binding problem when representing multiple objects with neural networks. The approach involves different representational slots for each object and a relational mechanism to maintain separation. The approach involves different representational slots for each object and a relational mechanism to maintain separation. The generative model efficiently composes individual objects and background to generate novel scenes without prior access to specific information. The proposed generative model, utilizing state-of-the-art techniques, outperforms baseline models in generating high-quality images faithful to the reference distribution. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a generator and discriminator, aiming to transform samples from a prior distribution to match samples from the target distribution through adversarial training. The text discusses the challenges in optimizing the minimax game between the generator and discriminator in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two practical reformulations, Non-Saturating GAN (NS-GAN) and Wassertein GAN (WGAN), are explored to improve stability and optimization. The Wasserstein distance is used to optimize the generator in GANs by incorporating techniques like gradient penalty and spectral normalization. The generator is structured to create images as compositions of objects and background, with separate latent vectors for each object and background. The system is trained end-to-end for optimal performance. The system is trained end-to-end in the standard GAN framework, with the final image composed using alpha compositing. Object compositionality in neural networks focuses on independently varying visual primitives, identifying and describing them in a common format. The structure assumes strict object independence initially, then incorporates relational structure to address the binding problem that may arise. The text discusses the process of incorporating relational structure and allowing for unstructured background and occlusion in images. It describes a generative model where each object is represented by independent vector-valued random variables, and a deterministic generator transforms these variables into images. The model efficiently describes images in a compositional manner by sharing weights among generators. The text discusses a generative model where objects are represented by independent random variables, and knowledge is shared among generators. This allows for learning variations of individual objects instead of all combinations. However, the model lacks communication among generators, preventing modeling of object relations. The approach addresses concerns by using superposition of generators for object compositionality. The text introduces a relational stage to incorporate object relationships in a generative model. It utilizes attention blocks with Multi-Head Dot-Product Attention to compute interactions among object representations efficiently. This allows for learning about relations between objects and updating their representations accordingly. The text introduces attention blocks for updating object representations by computing interactions among objects efficiently. Multiple heads with different parameters are used to model various interactions, and complex relationships can be modeled by iteratively updating object representations. The text introduces attention blocks for updating object representations efficiently. It discusses the challenge of modeling complex visual scenes where certain objects in the background may not occur frequently enough. This leads to conflicting assumptions about discovering visual primitives and capturing background information. The text introduces an additional generator for background generation in complex visual scenes. It addresses the challenge of combining objects with background and occlusion, proposing the use of alpha compositing for combining outputs. In the context of generative models and multi-object representation learning, previous work has explored inductive biases for object compositionality. Different approaches have been used, such as modeling images as spatial mixtures of patches or using recurrent neural networks to model interactions between objects. However, these approaches struggle to model complex visual scenes with unstructured backgrounds and object interactions. A different approach in generative models involves using recurrent neural networks to model multiple objects in an image iteratively. Attention is used in BID14, while Eslami et al. FORMULA0 considers objects explicitly. Im et al. FORMULA0 generates images iteratively with a recurrent generator, and BID27 combines outputs using alpha compositing. BID44 extends this by using a separate generator for the background and spatial transformations for foreground integration. They explore multi-object image generation on a dataset of two non-overlapping MNIST digits, but their method requires prior knowledge of object size and number, unlike our approach. Recent work in GANs is focusing on incorporating architectural structure in the generator to generate realistic images. BID29 uses a Spatial Transformer Network as a generator and proposes an iterative scheme to manipulate objects in a scene. BID22 suggests image generation by conditioning on explicit scene graphs to address limitations in generating scenes with multiple objects that require relational structure. Our approach utilizes an implicit graph structure to model relations among objects in generating scenes composed of multiple objects. We do not rely on prior information about individual objects and test the proposed structure on various multi-object datasets to verify the quality and content of generated images. The study focuses on generating images using an implicit graph structure to model relations among objects in multi-object datasets like Multi-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CLEVR. The datasets consist of variations like Independent MM, Triplet MM, RGB Occluded MM, and CIFAR10 + MM. The evaluation includes comparing the quality of generated images using popular metrics. The study evaluates the quality of generated images using the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) metric. However, FID is limited in assessing image datasets with multiple objects, as it cannot verify properties like the number of objects present. This limitation is due to the Inception embedding being trained only for single objects. The study compensates for the limitations of FID in assessing images with multiple objects by conducting human studies to compare generated images to a baseline and verify their content. Human evaluation is not feasible for large-scale hyperparameter search, so FID is still used to select the best models. Each model is optimized with ADAM using a learning rate of 10^-4 and batch size 64 for 1M iterations. The study optimized GAN models with ADAM using a learning rate of 10^-4 and batch size 64 for 1M steps. FID is computed every 20K steps, and the best parameters are selected. Extensive grid searches were conducted with 40-50 hyperparameter configurations for each dataset, with each configuration run with 5 different seeds. Different techniques were used for combining outputs on different datasets. In this study, GAN models were optimized using ADAM with a learning rate of 10^-4 and batch size 64 for 1M steps. The results were reported by breaking down the outcomes when incorporating structure in GAN across different parts. The notation k-GAN was used to describe generators with K components, with k-GAN rel. for relational structure and k-GAN ind. for no relational structure. The analysis of each generator consistently showed the final image output. The final images generated by k-GAN models consist of compositions of individual objects, even when the number of objects exceeds the components used during training. This is observed in CLEVR and Multi-MNIST datasets, where the generator learns to decode parts of its latent space to represent different objects. From the generated samples in Appendix C, relations among objects are correctly captured. The background generator mostly produces a single object with the background and rarely more than one object. Latent Traversal explores how the relational structure affects the independence assumption about objects, with no strict architectural constraint. The experiment in k-GAN rel demonstrates traversing the latent space of a single vector, showing how disentangling objects at a representational level makes the underlying representation more robust. This confirms the intuition of how the relational mechanism should be utilized. The experiment in k-GAN rel demonstrates traversing the latent space of a single vector, showing how disentangling objects at a representational level makes the underlying representation more robust. Comparing FID scores of k-GAN and GAN models on different datasets shows k-GAN performing favorably in most cases. The experiment with different variations of k-GAN shows that FID scores vary across datasets. 4-GAN without relational structure achieves the lowest FID on Independent MM, but struggles to consistently generate 3 digits. FID may not fully capture image generation properties, leading to inconclusive results. However, significant FID differences are observed on Triplet MM and RGB Occluded MM, indicating the importance of relational mechanisms in these cases. The study compared the visual quality of images generated by k-GAN to GAN across different datasets. Results show that k-GAN performs better, especially on RGB Occluded MM and CIFAR10 + MM, even when k > 3, attributed to the relational mechanism allowing components to agree on the correct number of digits. In a study comparing images generated by k-GAN to GAN, k-GAN outperformed especially on RGB Occluded MM and CIFAR10 + MM datasets. Results showed that k-GAN generated images with correct number of objects, digits, and properties more frequently, indicating better fidelity to the reference distribution. The difference in correct digits and objects suggested that some generated objects were not recognizable as digits. The study compared images generated by k-GAN and GAN on various datasets. k-GAN outperformed GAN in generating crowded scenes with distorted shapes and mixed colors. Human scoring confirmed these observations, although some differences were small. The proposed structure benefits in generating images of multiple objects, but accurately estimating the number of objects is challenging. The structure considers \"primitives\" corresponding to multiple objects, even when the number of components is insufficient. Challenges arise in determining foreground and background when combining object generators' outputs. The structure for generating images of multiple objects faces challenges in accurately estimating the number of objects and determining foreground/background when combining object generators' outputs. The use of a patch discriminator and alpha channel for segmentation may help address these issues. The importance of compositionality in deep generative models of images is highlighted, with a focus on incorporating structure in the generator of a GAN. The proposed generative model shows learning about individual objects and background in multi-object datasets. A human study confirms the effectiveness of this approach in generating better images without supervision. The generator and discriminator neural network architectures in all experiments are based on DCGAN. Object Generators in k-GAN introduce k copies of an object generator that each generate an image from a 64-dimensional UNIFORM(-1, 1) prior. When a relational stage is incorporated in k-GAN, updates are computed using attention blocks. A single-layer neural network followed by LayerNorm is used in the experiments. In k-GAN, outputs from object generators are concatenated and transformed by a neural network to obtain new z i. A background generator uses DCGAN architecture with its own set of weights. Different variations of z b participation in the relational stage are explored. Final generated image is obtained by combining images from each generator. The outputs of different generators are combined using various methods such as summing outputs, alpha compositing, and adding an additional alpha channel. Each model is optimized using ADAM with specific parameters, and checkpoints are saved periodically. The lowest FID checkpoint is saved every 20,000 steps, computed using 10,000 samples from a hold-out set. An extensive grid search over 48 GAN configurations is conducted to establish a strong baseline on each dataset."
