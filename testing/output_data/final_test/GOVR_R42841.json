    "content": "Under its civil works program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resource facilities. Congress has provided significant supplemental appropriations for emergency activities, totaling $33.2 billion from 1987 to 2016. These funds, mainly for Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies, have been crucial alongside the agency's regular discretionary appropriations. Congress has provided significant supplemental appropriations for emergency activities for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, including funding for Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M). Supplemental funds have also been allocated for other Corps accounts, such as the Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) account and the Construction account. In some instances, a large portion of supplemental funding has been designated for construction activities, with examples being Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Additionally, the Corps received $4.6 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Congress often considers providing supplemental appropriations to the Corps and other agencies following major natural disasters. Some argue for supplemental funding for the Corps to improve flood resilience in affected areas, with special considerations like emergency funding and waiving cost-share requirements. Others believe annual appropriations are more suitable for flood-damage reduction investments, subjecting postdisaster investments to project-development and cost-sharing requirements. Some stakeholders prefer more attention and funding for other programs to reduce flood risks. The report analyzes Corps supplemental funding from 1987 to 2016 and proposed funding in H.R. 4667 for disaster relief. It does not cover annual Corps discretionary appropriations or funding for other agencies. FEMA has authority for disaster response under the National Response Framework and receives regular and supplemental appropriations for this purpose. The Corps works on some FEMA mission assignments funded by FEMA. The Corps primarily uses the FCCE account to fund disaster-related activities such as flood fighting, emergency response, and repairing damaged projects. Congress authorized the Corps to assist in flood fighting and response under the Flood Control Act of 1941. The Corps is authorized by Congress to operate the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) to repair nonfederal flood-control works damaged by natural events. Funding for repairs comes from the agency's FCCE account, with supplemental funds used for federally owned projects. The Secretary of the Army can transfer funds for emergency work until additional appropriations are available. The Corps has the authority to transfer regular annual appropriations to pay for emergency actions during floods. The O&M account funds upkeep of Corps projects, including dredging of ports and waterways. The MR&T account covers flood-control and navigation projects for the lower Mississippi River Valley, with supplemental funds used for repairs to damaged levees. Supplemental expenditures under this account primarily fund repair to damaged MR&T levees, floodways, and project features. Construction account funds new project construction and major upgrades. Congress has provided approximately $33.2 billion in supplemental funding between 1987 and 2016. Legislation like H.R. 4667 may provide an additional $12.09 billion for response to natural disasters. The discussion focuses on enacted Corps supplemental appropriations, including funding provided in H.R. 4667 in the 115th Congress. A total of $33.2 billion was allocated in supplemental appropriations between 1987 and 2016, with $31.4 billion provided in 12 laws enacted from 2005 to 2016. Adjusted for inflation, approximately $38 billion was allocated to the Corps. 92% of this funding was provided between 2006 and 2016. The breakdown of enacted Corps supplemental appropriations and H.R. 4667 by year is illustrated in Figure 1. The Corps received five primary types of supplemental funding, including funding for 2005 hurricanes, Hurricane Sandy response, other natural disasters, nondisaster purposes, and funding for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in H.R. 4667. The $16 billion received for the 2005 hurricanes, primarily Hurricane Katrina, is more than three times the agency's annual civil works budget. The Corps received significant supplemental funding between 2005 and 2009, with most funds designated for rebuilding and strengthening facilities in Southeast Louisiana. Approximately 94% of the funds went to activities in Louisiana, including $14.5 billion for protective measures. This included repairs and strengthening of levees and floodwalls in New Orleans, as well as the construction of surge-protection barriers like the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Surge Barrier. The federal government covered 100% of the costs for FCCE and O&M infrastructure in Southeast Louisiana. The state of Louisiana is contributing $1.7 billion for construction projects with federal-nonfederal cost-sharing requirements. Louisiana's cash contribution is being repaid over 30 years. Congress directed the Corps to develop a plan to protect coastal Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina. In response to Hurricane Katrina, Congress directed the Corps to design comprehensive improvements and modifications to coastal Mississippi through the Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program (MsCIP). Funding was authorized for these projects in various bills, with a total of $1.07 billion allocated in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. The projects follow a standard 65% federal and 35% nonfederal cost share. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $5.35 billion in supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts, with funding allocated to address damages and reduce future flood risks. The majority of the funding was designated for the Construction account to support long-term sustainability of coastal ecosystems and communities. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act of 2013 allocated $5.35 billion for Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts, focusing on repairing damaged projects and restoring them to their original designs within the North Atlantic Division of the Corps. Funding was also provided for new construction projects, with certain conditions for release, and waived cost-sharing requirements for ongoing projects. Between 1987 and 2016, Congress provided the Corps with approximately $7.1 billion for responding to natural disasters, with the majority of funding allocated between 2005 and 2016. The funding was mainly for flood events, with a significant portion going towards Corps actions under the O&M and FCCE accounts. The most recent supplemental appropriation for the Corps was included in this category. The Corps received supplemental funds for repair and maintenance of facilities in response to flooding in Louisiana and Florida. Additional funding was allocated for facility security upgrades after the terrorist attacks of 2001, as well as for facility and project construction under ARRA. Total appropriations for non-natural disaster-related funding are provided in Figure 2. H.R. 4667 would provide the largest supplemental appropriation in history for the Corps, totaling $12.09 billion for response and repair activities for natural disasters. This funding would also support reducing flood risks in areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The bill includes $537 million for natural disasters and would fund emergency response activities and repair of flood-control works and other civil projects. H.R. 4667 allocates $12.09 billion for response and repair activities for natural disasters, with funding distributed across various Corps accounts. The majority of the funding, $10.425 billion, is designated for construction projects in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The bill allows for funds to be used for repairing damaged projects and restoring them to their original construction designs. Congress allocated 31% and 65% of the Corps supplemental funding for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy to flood-risk reduction projects. The $10.425 billion and $75 million for Corps studies are limited to areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Projects would proceed at full federal expense with no nonfederal cost-share requirement. The standard process for Corps projects includes completing feasibility studies, environmental documentation, and a Chief's Report before Congress authorizes construction in a Water Resources Development act. H.R. 4667 would provide funding for these projects. The Water Resources Development Act, H.R. 4667, grants the Secretary of the Army authority to use funds for project construction without specific congressional authorization. This authority, similar to that provided for Hurricane Sandy funds, allows projects to be initiated without project-specific approval. With federal fiscal constraints and recent natural disasters, emergency supplemental funding is gaining attention, particularly for Corps natural disaster projects. Topics of focus include transparency and the use of emergency funding. After the initial appropriation, public reporting on Corps expenditure of supplemental funding has generally been limited. Some early post-Katrina and Sandy supplemental bills set reporting requirements for Corps appropriations, including regular reports to the Committee on Appropriations. Congress has limited public reporting on Corps expenditure of supplemental funding, with project-level data available through congressional reports and agency work plans. Detailed data on Corps expenditures of supplemental appropriations have not been widely available. Congress must decide whether to use supplemental funding for improving flood protection in impacted areas to reduce future flood risk. Congress funded Corps infrastructure investments to improve hurricane storm protection. Congress funded Corps infrastructure investments to improve hurricane storm protection in Southeast Louisiana post-Katrina. 65% of the $5.3 billion in supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy recovery was allocated for new construction to reduce flood risks. However, supplemental funds were not used for flood protection in areas impacted by Hurricane Ike, Midwest floods, or Hurricane Andrew. Proponents argue for supplemental funds for flood-impacted areas, while others believe annual appropriations are sufficient for federal flood-infrastructure investments. The Corps has a backlog of authorized flood and storm damage-reduction projects across the country, competing for less than $1 billion in annual discretionary budget. Discretionary appropriations for flood-related construction activities averaged $907 million annually over the FY2008-FY2017 decade, totaling $9.1 billion. Some of the spending is for major rehabilitation activities, so the actual new construction spending would be lower. Congress has provided supplemental appropriations for construction activities to improve infrastructure in areas affected by hurricanes, such as Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. Cost-sharing requirements vary for different projects, with waivers for ongoing construction projects related to Hurricane Sandy but not for new construction. The appropriate cost share for Corps construction activities has been a subject of debate. The debate over the appropriate cost share for Corps construction activities includes proposals for standard cost shares, federal government handling most project costs, and relaxing cost-sharing requirements for specific project types. Justifications for altering the standard arrangement include limited ability of disaster-impacted communities to pay the nonfederal share. The responsibility for the nonfederal share and repayment period are also key issues, as seen in the case of Louisiana creating a single state entity for its nonfederal construction partner. Louisiana created a state entity to partner with the federal government for post-Katrina Corps repairs, with 30 years to repay construction costs. Cost-sharing requirements for navigation projects differ from natural disaster funding, as trust funds have not covered disaster response costs in the last decade. H.R. 4667 would require the use of HMTF funds for federal costs related to HMTF-eligible activities. The Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) serves as an insurance program for nonfederal flood-control projects, with 14,000 miles of levees participating. 80% of repair costs for locally constructed projects are covered by federal funds. The Corps determines repair funding for locally constructed projects, with federal funds covering 80% and the levee owner paying 20%. Federally constructed projects are fully funded by the federal government. The Corps must assess a favorable benefit-cost ratio for repairs. The 115th Congress is considering responses to natural disasters in 2017, providing funding for emergency response, repair, and flood risk reduction projects. H.R. 4667 proposes $12.09 billion for response, repair, and recovery from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, with $10.425 billion allocated for new construction of flood-risk reduction projects in affected areas. Congress considers various issues when providing supplemental funds for Corps projects, including authorization, nonfederal cost sharing, and special considerations. The debate over supplemental Corps funding raises questions about the effectiveness of post-disaster appropriations and annual budget development, particularly in prioritizing investments to reduce flood risk."
