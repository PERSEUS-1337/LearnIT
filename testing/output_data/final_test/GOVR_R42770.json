They offer various financial products and services, including mortgage financing, flexible underwriting, technical assistance, and commercial loans to businesses in economically distressed areas. CDFIs operate in both rural and urban communities and include regulated institutions like banks and credit unions, as well as nonregulated entities like loan funds. Some stakeholders are concerned about a capital shortage for CDFIs. Some stakeholders worry about a capital shortage for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), which could limit opportunities for new entrepreneurs, business expansion, and consumer access to credit. This report discusses the history and programs of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (Fund) and analyzes policy considerations for promoting economic development effectively. The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 established the Fund to assist CDFIs in providing coordinated development strategies in underdeveloped communities. The legislation aimed to improve access to capital, credit, and private investment in economically distressed areas. The Fund, established by the Riegle Act in 1994, aims to provide access to capital and credit in underdeveloped communities. It was initially a government corporation but later moved to the Department of the Treasury in 1995. The Fund operates under the Office of Domestic Finance and is led by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Fund, established by the Riegle Act in 1994, aims to provide access to capital and credit in underdeveloped communities. The director, appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, serves a career term since 2010. Annie Donovan has been the Director since December 2014. The Fund also has a 15-member Community Development Advisory Board to advise on policies. The Fund, established in 1994, aims to provide access to capital in underdeveloped communities. The advisory board advises on policies, but not on specific grant applications. Congress provides the Fund with its own budget authority for administration and programs. The Fund's total enacted budget authority for FY2017 was $233.1 million, with majority allocated to core CDFI financial and technical assistance programs. President Trump requested $14 million in his FY2018 budget blueprint for administration costs of the Fund's programs, including the NMTC and BEA program. This funding would manage past awards, monitor compliance, and support new award rounds. The budget blueprint also proposes eliminating funding for discretionary grant and loan programs, reallocating into the Capital Magnet Fund. Organizations must be certified as CDFIs or CDEs to be eligible for certain Fund-related programs. To access financial assistance from the Fund, organizations must be certified as CDFIs, CDEs, or QOFs. CDFIs qualify for CDFI Program FA and TA, CDEs for NMTC, and QOFs for OZ tax incentives. CDFI certification is necessary for funding through various programs. Organizations can still apply for technical assistance even if they do not meet all certification requirements initially. To be eligible for CDFI certification, the applicant must be a legal entity with a primary mission of promoting community development, provide financial products or development services primarily in designated areas, serve targeted populations, offer development services in conjunction with financial products, maintain accountability to target markets, and be a nongovernment entity. As of November 31, 2017, there were 1,011 certified CDFIs located in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. California and New York have the highest number of certified CDFIs. These CDFIs include loan funds, credit unions, banks, depository institution holding companies, and venture capital funds. Additionally, 7% of certified CDFIs are Native American CDFIs. CDE certification is necessary to receive an NMTC allocation, with CDEs serving as intermediary vehicles for providing loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-income communities. CDEs use the NMTC to encourage investors to make equity investments in low-income communities. To be eligible for CDE certification, the applicant must have a primary mission of serving low-income communities, target at least 60% of activities to these groups, and maintain accountability through representation on a governing board. There were 5,780 certified CDEs in the US, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands as of July 31, 2012, with California and New York having the highest number. The 2017 tax revision created new tax incentives for certified entities. The tax revision (P.L. 115-97) introduced tax incentives for Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) investing in Qualified Opportunity Zone (OZ) property. QOFs must hold at least 90% of their assets in qualified OZ property, which can be stock or tangible business property in a qualified OZ acquired after December 31, 2017. Failure to meet the 90% requirement incurs a penalty. The Fund, authorized by P.L. 115-97, aims to increase economic opportunity and promote community development investments in low-income and distressed communities in the United States. It offers incentives such as equity investment, tax credits, grants, loans, and technical assistance to support local businesses, homebuyers, community developers, and investors in these communities. The Fund's programs include equity investment, tax credits, grants, loans, and deposits in insured CDFIs and credit unions to promote community development in underserved areas. Geographically targeted incentives were a key feature in federal policy debates in the 1980s and 1990s, but were not widely implemented until the Clinton Administration. The Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 authorized the Fund's core CDFI program, providing financial and technical assistance. The Fund provides financial assistance (FA) and technical assistance (TA) awards to certified CDFIs to enhance their capacity to serve low-income communities. FA awards require certification, while TA awards are open to both certified and noncertified CDFIs. Noncertified organizations must become certified within two years of receiving a TA award. The Fund evaluates applicants based on their business plan, history of serving distressed communities, and operational capacity. The Fund evaluates applicants based on their prior history of servicing distressed communities, operational capacity, and financial track record. Eligible activities must target a distressed community meeting specific population and income criteria. The Fund evaluates applicants based on their history of servicing distressed communities and financial track record. The Fund's online resource, Fund Mapping System (CIMS), designates qualifying distressed communities based on specific criteria. Awards up to $2 million are available to certified CDFIs for promoting community revitalization and job creation. The Fund awards grants of up to $125,000 to certified CDFIs and entities seeking certification under the TA component of the CDFI program. The grants are intended to build capacity for providing affordable financial products and services to low-income communities. TA funds can be used for purchasing equipment, consulting services, staff salaries, training, and other approved activities. The Fund typically requires applicants to demonstrate a dollar-for-dollar match from a nonfederal source for FA and TA awards. There is a limit of $5 million in awards for any entity or its affiliates within a three-year period, with temporary legislative changes possible. The Fund waived the nonfederal matching requirement for three years starting in 2009. In FY2017, 265 organizations received a total of $171.1 million in awards. The Native American CDFI Assistance program originated from the Riegle Act of 1994, which aimed to address financing barriers for Native American populations. The Fund certifies Native CDFIs and provides assistance to reduce barriers for access to credit and financial services in Native American communities. The NACA component of the CDFI program issues awards to organizations increasing access to capital in Native Communities. TA grants are provided to certified Native CDFIs, emerging CDFIs, and sponsoring entities to support certification or establishment of new CDFIs. The Fund certifies Native CDFIs to qualify for NACA's FA and TA awards. Certified Native CDFIs, emerging Native CDFIs, and sponsoring entities are eligible. Hawaii, Oklahoma, and South Dakota have the most certified Native CDFIs. SECA assists small or emerging CDFIs with FA and TA awards. The Fund's SECA program provides FA and TA awards to small or emerging CDFIs, with eligibility criteria based on financial holdings or start date. Awards are capped at $700,000 for FA funds and $125,000 for TA funds. The Fund also supports the Healthy Food Financing Initiative through its CDFI program. The Fund's Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) is part of a multi-agency effort involving Treasury, USDA, and HHS to expand access to nutritious foods in low-income neighborhoods. Through grants, the Fund supports organizations in providing affordable and nutritious food. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, established by Congress, encourages private investment in impoverished communities lacking access to capital. The NMTC is a nonrefundable tax credit aimed at increasing private investment in low-income communities with limited access to capital. The credit, totaling 39% of the investment made in a Community Development Entity (CDE), is claimed over a seven-year period. Investors receive a 5% credit for the first three years and a 6% credit for the remaining four years. The Fund awards tax credit allocations to eligible CDEs through a competitive process. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) provides a 6% annual credit for the final four years of a seven-year period. Investors must maintain their interest in a qualified equity investment to receive the credit. Eligible investments are in qualifying Low-Income Communities (LICs) meeting specific criteria, covering 39% of census tracts and nearly 36% of the U.S. population. Targeted populations can also qualify as LICs. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) allows for a 6% annual credit for the final four years of a seven-year period. Investors can apply for an allocation of the NMTC through qualified investment groups. CDEs seek individuals for tax preferences to make equity investments in LICs and low-income community businesses. The NMTC was extended through various acts, such as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the American Taxpayer Relief Act, and the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The NMTC was extended through the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, with a total authorization of $3.5 billion per year. The Government Accountability Office has issued reports on the NMTC's performance, including concerns about the low success rate of minority-owned CDEs in obtaining NMTC allocations. The Government Accountability Office found that minority-owned Community Development Entities (CDEs) have a lower probability of receiving NMTC allocations, but could not determine the reasons behind this disparity. Reports have highlighted weaknesses in CDE applications and the challenges in assessing the impact of NMTC due to data gaps. Recommendations have been made to simplify the program for those in Low-Income Communities (LICs). The complexity of NMTC transaction structures makes it difficult for CDEs to execute smaller transactions, resulting in less equity reaching low-income community businesses. Recommendations include converting part of NMTC to a grant program and simplifying transaction structures to increase federal subsidy to businesses in impoverished LICs. NMTC investments have become more complex and less transparent over time, with higher fees or interest rates charged by CDEs due to combining financing from multiple sources. The Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) was established in 1991 and later moved under the Fund's operations in 1994. It provides grants to FDIC-insured banks and thrifts to increase investments in CDFIs and support activities in economically distressed communities. BEA rewards are retrospective, measuring increases in lending, investment, and service activities. The Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) provides formula-based grants to qualified banks and thrifts for CDFI-related activities, distressed community financing activities, and service activities. CDFI-related activities include equity investments and support activities to certified CDFIs. Distressed community financing activities include loans or investments for various purposes in distressed communities. Service activities include the provision of financial services. The Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) provides grants to FDIC-insured financial institutions supporting economic development in qualified communities. Eligibility criteria include not having pending applications or recent awards under the CDFI program. In FY2016, 102 depository institutions received $18.8 million in BEA. The BEA program awards $18.8 million to 102 depository institutions in FY2016. Recipients must use the award for BEA-qualified activities in distressed communities. GAO reports on the program's impact on investment in distressed communities. In a 2006 report, GAO found that the BEA program may not significantly increase investments in CDFIs and distressed communities. Award recipients mentioned lower costs for investing in CDFIs and distressed communities, but other incentives also play a role. Treasury disputed GAO's findings on the BEA program. The 2017 tax revision authorized Opportunity Zone (OZ) tax incentives for investments in qualified OZs. The Fund designates eligible census tracts and certifies qualified opportunity funds (QOFs) for tax incentives. To qualify as an OZ, the state's CEO must nominate census tracts to the Treasury Secretary. Tracts must be qualified LICs or contiguous with an LIC. Designations last 10 years, with limits on the number of tracts per state. The number of census tracts in a state designated as qualified Opportunity Zones (OZs) depends on the number of Low-Income Communities (LICs). If a state has less than 100 LICs, 25 census tracts can be designated as OZs. If a state has 100 or more LICs, the maximum number of OZs is 25% of the total LICs. Additionally, no more than 5% of census tracts in a state can be designated as OZs. The tax incentives provided under P.L. 115-97 include deferral of capital gains reinvested in a QOF, with increased basis after holding for five or seven years. If a qualified Opportunity Zone (OZ) investment is held for at least seven years, the basis on the original gain increases by 5%. The deferred gain is recognized upon disposal of the investment or by December 31, 2026. Taxpayers can take advantage of special treatment for capital gains by rolling over non-OZ assets before the deadline. The basis of a QOF investment is zero initially, but increases by 10% after five years and an additional 5% after seven years. Holding the investment until December 31, 2026, increases the basis by the remaining 85%. The basis in the investment increases by the remaining 85% of the deferred gain until December 31, 2026. Post-acquisition capital gains on investments in QOFs held for at least 10 years are excluded from gross income. Taxpayers can elect to use the fair market value of the investment at the date of sale or exchange after holding a QOF investment for more than 10 years. OZ tax incentives are in effect from December 22, 2017, through December 31, 2026, with no gain deferral or exclusion available after that date. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the Bond Guarantee program to provide low-cost capital to CDFIs. Treasury can guarantee up to 10 bonds per year, each at a minimum of $100 million, totaling $1 billion per year. Bonds are fully guaranteed by the US, offered at Treasury rates, with a maximum maturity of 30 years. They support CDFIs for eligible community or economic development purposes. The Bond Guarantee program supports CDFIs by providing low-cost capital for community or economic development activities in underserved areas. The program is a zero-subsidy credit program that guarantees bonds issued by qualified issuers, which are then lent to eligible CDFIs. The Federal Financing Bank purchases the bonds, which are fully guaranteed by the United States. The CDFI Bond Guarantee program was initially slow to implement despite being authorized in 2010. Congress reduced the program's lending authority to $1 billion between 2010 and 2014 due to delays in budget appropriations. Subsequent acts limited the total loan amounts supported by the bonds in FY2015 to $750 million, in FY2016 to $750 million, and in FY2017 to $500 million. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) to provide grants to CDFIs and nonprofits for affordable housing and economic development projects in distressed communities. Awardees could use the funds for affordable housing activities, economic development, and community service facilities. Eligible organizations included certified CDFIs and qualified nonprofit housing organizations. The CMF award required organizations to be certified as a CDFI, have a pending CDFI certification application, or be a nonprofit focused on affordable housing. Funding from GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was suspended, leading to an initial $80 million appropriation from the Consolidation Appropriations Act, 2010 for the CMF in FY2010. 23 CDFIs and nonprofit housing organizations received grants from the Fund. In FY2010, the Fund awarded grants to 23 CDFIs and nonprofit housing organizations out of 230 applications requesting $1 billion. Funding for the CMF was discontinued in FY2011, but in 2014, contributions from GSEs were reinstated after pressure from Senators and Representatives. In FY2016, 32 organizations received $91.47 million in awards from the CMF. The Fund's use of federal resources for economic development is analyzed in four policy considerations: targeting assistance towards people or places, labor or capital, unique role compared to other programs, and assessments of management. Economic theory questions the need for government intervention in promoting development in distressed communities. Government policies like tax exemptions can lead to inefficiencies by directing resources from high to low productivity areas. However, investing in distressed communities may be justified if it generates positive externalities, benefiting society as a whole. Government policies can generate positive externalities within a community by aligning individual business interests with societal interests through taxes, subsidies, and incentives. This can attract investors to underdeveloped areas, leading to economic growth and success that encourages further investment. Government incentives can benefit businesses and employees in a community, leading to positive participation in activities outside of work. Evaluations of geographically targeted economic development policies have shown mixed results due to various factors. Enterprise zones and federal empowerment zones offer tax incentives and regulatory relief for distressed communities. Studies show that these policies can boost economic activity, promote entrepreneurship, and increase employment in targeted areas. For example, John Ham et al. found that empowerment zones reduce local unemployment and poverty rates by 8.7% and 8.8%, while enterprise zones reduce them by 2.6% and 20%, respectively. Additionally, surveys from U.S. enterprise zones indicate that around 25% of new businesses are start-ups within these zones. Barry Rubin and Margaret Wilder's analysis of Indiana's enterprise zone found that 76% of the jobs created could not be attributed to regional or sectoral growth. These policies may not contribute to overall economic activity and could rearrange the mix of economic activity within the targeted area. Andrew Hanson and Shawn Rohlin suggest that location-based tax incentives positively impact firm location. Location-based tax incentives have a positive effect on firm location in industries benefiting the most, but growth in new establishments is offset by declines in other industries. Geographically targeted policies may shift activity towards targeted zones rather than create new economic activity. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) may increase corporate investment in targeted areas but does not lead to a net increase overall. This could result in investment shifting between similar areas rather than creating new economic activity. The debate on the effectiveness of geographically targeted economic development policies revolves around the impact on local property prices and the displacement of lower-income residents. Researchers disagree on whether these policies truly benefit the community. Policy makers may need to redefine the primary objective of development to focus on either helping people or places. If the goal is to improve business and employment opportunities, these policies may be effective. Geographically targeted economic development policies may have limited effectiveness in creating new jobs. The focus should be on whether government assistance should only be extended to distressed communities. Different evaluation standards imply various metrics and trade-offs. The effectiveness of policies in benefiting labor costs, capital costs, or both should be considered. Development policies need to target either workers, business owners, or both to have a positive impact on economic development within the intended community. The economic theory suggests two behavioral responses to factors of production: the output effect increases total output and the substitution effect leads to firms using one factor at the expense of the other. The total effect of a policy determines whether it benefits labor or capital more. For example, a labor subsidy can encourage labor-intensive firms to locate in a specific area. A labor subsidy promotes employment by encouraging firms to use more labor, while a capital subsidy encourages firms to use more capital. The net increase in employment is expected with a labor subsidy, as firms will expand operations and substitute labor for capital. Conversely, a capital subsidy leads to firms substituting capital for labor, offsetting the benefits of increased labor use. The net effect of a capital subsidy may decrease employment in the area if the substitution effect outweighs the output effect. Policies balancing the trade-off between promoting capital or labor can impact employment. Producers' use of factor price differentials influences the mix of capital and labor they employ, affecting the outcome of policies related to total costs. Geographically targeted tax incentives like the NMTC have a positive but limited effect on economic well-being in the target area. Studies show that preferential tax incentives for employers can generate development, with an average responsiveness ranging from -0.25 to -0.51. A 10% reduction in taxes in a specific geographic zone could lead to changes in economic activity. A study found that a 10% tax reduction in a specific geographic zone could increase economic activity by 2.5% to 5.1%. Legislative interest in identifying duplicative federal programs has grown, with concerns about efficient budget management. The Fund's programs may overlap with other efforts to boost economic development in distressed communities. Various federal programs managed by agencies like USDA, SBA, and HUD offer financing sources for CDFIs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under President George W. Bush stated that the core CDFI program funded by various agencies was not unique as states administer similar programs. The NMTC is not the only tax incentive for economic development in distressed communities, with other incentives providing short-term assistance and encouraging investment. The OMB also mentioned that the NMTC was not unique as other federal and state programs exist for similar purposes. The Fund plays a unique role in filling financing gaps for community lenders in distressed communities, supporting alternatives to predatory lending institutions, especially in tribal communities. The Fund complements federal initiatives by encouraging more entities to invest in Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), providing incentives for activities that private-sector investors would not engage in, such as offering affordable financing for businesses. Some concerns over the Fund's management include transparency and consistency in award evaluation processes, as well as monitoring and evaluating award recipients' performance. These issues have been addressed through feedback and recommendations from outside parties. The Fund has developed the Community Investment Impact System (CIIS) for CDFIs and CDEs to submit reports. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the lack of CDFIs in U.S. territories and rural communities. A 2012 GAO report found that CDFI and NMTC programs ensure awards are proportionate. Congress is also interested in comparing CDFIs' performance with non-CDFI peers and has raised concerns about fund usage. President Obama authorized a program allowing certified CDFIs to receive discounted capital investments from TARP, bypassing the typical appropriations process. The Bank on USA program was proposed to provide financial services to unbanked individuals. The Financial Education and Counseling (FEC) pilot program provided grants in FY2010 to organizations that offered financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers, aiming to increase their financial knowledge and decision-making capabilities. The Financial Education and Counseling (FEC) pilot program, authorized by HERA of 2008, allocated funds to organizations for financial education and counseling services. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $4.15 million, with $3.15 million designated for an organization in Hawaii. Treasury selected five organizations in FY2009 to receive $400,000 each. A 2011 GAO report found consistent selection criteria for FEC grantees, with the four grantees in 2010 serving a total of 311 clients. The GAO could not assess the impact of the Financial Education and Counseling program or the effectiveness of grantees due to the short duration of services provided."
