    "content": "The \"Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001\" is cited as the short title. Chapter 223 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to focus on capital grants for railroad track. The \"Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001\" amends Chapter 223 of title 49, United States Code, to establish a program of capital grants for the rehabilitation, preservation, or improvement of railroad track for class II and class III railroads. Grants are provided for track used primarily for freight transportation to ensure safe and efficient operation, including handling 286,000 pound rail cars. Grants may be given directly to the railroads. The Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 establishes a program of capital grants for class II and class III railroads to improve track safety and efficiency. Railroads can receive grants directly or with the approval of state or local governments. State transportation agencies are encouraged to assist in grant applications. Temporary regulations will be issued by the Secretary by December 31, 2001 to implement the program. The Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 establishes a program for capital grants to improve track safety and efficiency for class II and class III railroads. The Secretary will issue final regulations by October 1, 2002, with a maximum Federal share of 80% of project costs. Projects must have been operated or owned by a class II or class III railroad as of the enactment date. Grants can be used for cash, equipment, supplies, or other approved in-kind contributions. Grants under the Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 must be used for track capital projects promptly. Funds not obligated within three years must be returned for reallocation. The Secretary may also provide grants to supplement loans for projects, including credit risk premiums and interest rate reductions. The Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 requires recipients of grants to protect employee interests and adhere to prevailing wage standards for construction work financed by the grant. The Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 mandates that grants recipients must maintain labor standards on construction work, with wage rates from collective bargaining agreements deemed compliant with the Davis-Bacon Act. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study on the public benefits of light density railroad networks and report recommendations to Congress by March 31, 2003. The Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 requires the Secretary of Transportation to report recommendations to Congress on the eligibility of light density rail networks for Federal infrastructure financing. $350,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004 for this purpose. A conforming amendment is made to the table of chapters in title 49 of the United States Code. The Railroad Track Modernization Act of 2001 authorizes $350,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2004 for capital grants for railroad track improvements."
