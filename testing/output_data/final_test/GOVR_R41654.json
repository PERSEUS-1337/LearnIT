    "content": "Housing in the United States is primarily a private market enterprise, with most regulation done at the state and local level. The federal government has assisted in providing safe, decent, and affordable housing for families of modest means through the low-rent public housing program. Administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the program is governed by federal rules and regulations as well as local policies. The public housing program in the United States faced controversy due to concerns about subverting local control, housing conditions, and impact on communities. Criticism led to the replacement of the publicly owned and subsidized apartment buildings model with other forms of assistance. Despite no new funding, existing public housing units still house some of the nation's poorest families. The federal public housing program in the United States supports millions of families, including the elderly, disabled, and families with children. There is debate over the $6-7 billion annual funding and whether it is a worthwhile federal investment. This report provides an overview of the program's history, administration, funding, and the characteristics of public housing properties and the households they serve. The federal public housing program in the United States supports millions of families, including the elderly, disabled, and families with children. The program's history dates back to the 1930s during the Great Depression, aiming to provide affordable housing and stimulate economic growth. The report does not delve into current policy issues or legislation but offers a brief history of the program's evolution. The Housing Act of 1937 aimed to address housing issues without government intervention, allowing state-chartered public housing authorities to own and manage properties. Federal government provided financing through long-term contracts. The Housing Act of 1937 allowed public housing authorities to manage properties under long-term Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs), with decisions on design and location left to the PHAs. Families had to have sufficient income to pay rent, limited to five times the rent to prevent competition with the private market. The law also required the elimination of unsafe units for each new unit built, known as \"slum clearance.\" World War II later shifted federal housing focus. During World War II, federal housing focus shifted with the Lanham Act of 1940 halting new development under the low-rent public housing program in favor of housing for war workers. Around 200,000 public housing units were built by the end of the 1940s. The Housing Act of 1949 restarted the low-rent public housing program with a goal of providing decent homes for all. The Housing Act of 1949 established a federal policy goal of providing a decent home for every American family. It authorized the Urban Renewal program, expanded public housing units, and set construction cost limits. Income eligibility limits were tied to rents, ensuring affordable housing for low-income families. The Housing Act of 1949 aimed to provide affordable housing for low-income families by establishing income eligibility limits tied to rents. However, the goal of 810,000 units in six years was not met due to construction rate reductions, materials shortages from the Korean War, and opposition from local communities. Only about 210,000 units were under management by the end of 1957. The Housing Act of 1949 aimed to provide affordable housing for low-income families, but only 210,000 of the 810,000 authorized units were under management by 1957. Policy changes led to public housing serving families with lower incomes, with a rise in families receiving assistance. Urban Renewal tied to public housing development increased housing for black families displaced by the program, with the percentage of nonwhite families in public housing rising from 36% to 46% from the 1950s to 1960s. In the 1960s, new federal housing assistance programs were introduced to subsidize privately owned rental properties for low-income families and seniors, as well as the elderly and families with moderate incomes. The Section 23 leased housing program allowed Public Housing Authorities to lease private market units. In the 1960s, new federal housing assistance programs were introduced to subsidize privately owned rental properties for low-income families and seniors. The Section 23 leased housing program allowed Public Housing Authorities to lease private market units on behalf of public housing-eligible families. The Turnkey model of public housing also gained popularity, where a private developer builds housing and sells it to a PHA for public housing use. Despite the increase in public housing units to over 800,000, new programs utilizing private market participants were seen as more efficient and timely. Social changes in public housing included legal measures to prevent discrimination based on race. In the 1960s, efforts were made to end racial discrimination in public housing and prevent the segregation of residents by race. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 prohibited the construction of new high-rise public housing projects for families due to concerns about concentrated poverty. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 introduced the Brooke Amendment, capping tenant rent contributions at 25% of family income to address affordability issues. The 1969 act authorized HUD to provide operating assistance to public housing authorities, in addition to capital funding. Policy and market changes led public housing to serve the poorest tenants, many of whom were receiving public assistance. Until the Brooke Amendment, rents for these families were often unaffordable. The 1969 act authorized HUD to provide operating assistance to public housing authorities, in addition to capital funding. Rents for poorer tenants were often unaffordable before the Brooke Amendment. Congress provided additional subsidies, but some public housing developments still faced disrepair due to insufficient income. Construction programs in the early 1970s were criticized for being slow and expensive. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 required 30% of new public housing units to be created through the Section 23 leased housing program. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 created the Section 8 program, shifting to subsidizing privately owned housing with rental subsidies. President Nixon imposed a moratorium on new housing construction, leading to the end of the Nixon Moratorium as Congress authorized funding for new public housing units and housing assistance programs. The Section 8 program shifted to subsidizing private housing units, reducing the focus on new public housing construction. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 increased tenant rent contributions to 30% of family income. The Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 limited new construction of public housing and targeted assistance to the poorest families with incomes below 50% of the local area median income. It also restricted the ability of Public Housing Authorities to demolish or dispose of public housing units. The 1983 act limited new public housing construction and restricted the demolition or disposal of units. It also introduced a portable voucher program as a new form of Section 8 assistance, which replaced the original program in 1988. New public housing starts decreased in the 1980s in favor of the Section 8 program, leading to concerns about the condition of existing public housing. In 1989, a National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing was established by Congress. In 1989, Congress established a National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing to identify and address issues such as crime, unemployment, and deteriorating housing conditions. The commission recommended increased social services, funding for capital needs, better performance assessment, and public-private partnerships. The National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 addressed concerns about public housing by authorizing the Family Self Sufficiency program and establishing a management assessment system for troubled housing authorities. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 created the HOPE VI program for redevelopment of distressed public housing. The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1998 (QHWRA; P.L. 105-276) aimed to reform public housing by promoting local control, eliminating federal preferences, and allowing PHAs to convert properties to vouchers. It required PHAs to develop annual and five-year plans detailing their use of local discretion. The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1998 (QHWRA) gave PHAs the authority to convert public housing properties to vouchers, required non-elderly, non-disabled residents to work or participate in community service, allowed PHAs to leverage funding for redevelopment, and prohibited the use of federal funding for new public housing units. Since FY1994, funding for new public housing units has been restricted by the QHWRA, leading to a decline in national public housing units. The HOPE VI program, responsible for some of the declines, has seen reduced funding. Despite efforts by PHAs to leverage private capital, there remains a backlog of unmet capital needs. The potential for raising enough funds to address this backlog is limited, given the decreasing number of public housing units. The limited funds to address the backlog of needs in public housing raise questions about the future of the program. Public housing has a unique administrative structure with local PHAs managing properties under federal regulations. Public housing authorities (PHAs) have contracts with the federal government to administer properties according to federal rules in exchange for funding. PHAs have discretion in developing some policies but less in others, with requirements for public input. PHAs were created by states in response to the federal low-rent public housing program. Public housing authorities (PHAs) are governed by state laws and typically have an executive director and a board. The board approves policies, sets goals, and delegates authority to the executive director. Federal law mandates that PHA boards must include at least one resident. PHAs administer various housing programs and may also act as affordable housing developers in their communities. Public housing authorities (PHAs) vary in size from small to large, with over 3,000 PHAs nationwide. Small PHAs, which make up 75% of all PHAs, administer fewer than 250 units but only account for 18% of all public housing units. Large PHAs, with 1,250+ units, administer over half of all units. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) is notably the largest PHA, managing over 17% of all public housing units. Small PHAs were typically tied to specific localities, like counties or local governments, but recent years have seen changes in their creation. In recent years, there has been an increase in smaller PHAs merging or forming consortia to administer programs across metropolitan regions. This consolidation aims to reduce administrative costs and achieve efficiencies of scale, encouraged by academic researchers and past administrations. However, it can lead to a loss of local control and be unpopular with local leaders. PHAs have the discretion to develop their own local policies and procedures within federal regulations. PHA plans outline how they administer public housing and voucher programs, as well as their future intentions. These plans serve as a valuable resource for understanding a PHA's goals and policies, providing a framework for accountability and easy access to basic PHA information. PHAs are required to establish two plans: the five-year plan and the annual plan, developed with resident input and public participation, subject to HUD approval. The five-year plan outlines the PHA's mission, goals, and progress towards meeting them, while the annual plan details day-to-day operations and policies consistent with the five-year plan. The PHA's annual plan must include details on housing needs, eligibility policies, financial resources, rent determination, operation and management, capital improvement needs, housing for elderly or disabled, demolition plans, community programs, safety measures, and Resident Advisory Boards. Resident Advisory Boards, consisting of public housing residents and voucher holders, provide input in PHA planning. PHAs must consider their recommendations in annual and five-year plans. Community input is also sought through public hearings before plan adoption, subject to HUD approval. Some PHAs are exempt from annual and five-year planning processes, with high performing, small, and Section 8 voucher-only PHAs eligible for streamlined annual plans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 exempts PHAs with 550 or fewer combined units from filing an annual plan, excluding troubled PHAs. PHAs in the Moving to Work Demonstration may also be exempt from standard planning requirements. According to HUD regulations, public housing residents must be involved in policy development and operations. Resident participation is promoted through resident representation on governing boards, Resident Advisory Boards, and resident councils. PHAs are required to allocate funding for resident participation activities, including resident councils. Public housing residents can form resident councils to provide input on various aspects of PHA operations. They may also establish resident management corporations to manage properties in partnership with PHAs. HUD encourages PHAs, resident councils, and resident management corporations to explore opportunities for collaboration. Resident-managed entities can lead to an improved quality of life for residents. HUD assesses the performance of local PHAs administering public housing and Section 8 programs through the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS), which includes reviews of indicators like physical and financial conditions, management performance, and capital funding spending. High performers score 90% or better overall and at least 60% on all individual indicators, making them eligible for reduced federal oversight. PHAs are assessed through the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) to determine their performance. High performers, scoring 90% or better overall and at least 60% on all indicators, receive reduced federal oversight and may qualify for bonus funding. Standard performers score at least 60% overall and on all sub-indicators. PHAs scoring less than 60% overall or on two or more indicators are considered \"troubled\" and must develop improvement plans with HUD. HUD offers assistance such as appointing recovery teams, providing technical support, imposing financial sanctions, and developing flexible solutions for troubled agencies. If a troubled PHA fails to make progress, it may be in substantial default of its contract with HUD. Factors leading to default include violations of the Fair Housing Act, physical deterioration of housing, and management difficulties. HUD can place a troubled PHA in receivership, where authority is granted to a receiver. HUD can serve as the receiver under an administrative receivership. HUD can serve as a receiver in an administrative receivership for troubled Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), or select another PHA or private housing management corporation to manage the PHA. 48% of PHAs were high performers, 26% standard, 23% substandard, and 2% troubled in May 2012. PHAs must obtain HUD's permission to make changes to their public housing stock, including demolishing or selling units. PHAs must obtain HUD's permission to demolish or dispose of public housing units under contract. Demolition and disposition are governed by Section 18 of the U.S. Housing Act. Approval for demolition requires the property to be deemed unsuitable for housing purposes, while disposition approval is based on criteria such as adverse conditions in the surrounding area. PHAs face restrictions on the use of proceeds from a disposition. The PHA must obtain HUD's permission to demolish or dispose of public housing units. Disposition is allowed for various reasons, including the acquisition of properties for low-income housing developments. Proceeds from a disposition must be used for retiring obligations and providing low-income housing or benefiting residents. Displaced tenants must receive relocation assistance if a unit is demolished or disposed of. In addition to demolition and disposition, properties can leave public housing stock through conversion to vouchers. Congress enacted a requirement in 1996 for properties with over 300 units and a vacancy rate of over 10% to be assessed for viability. If it would cost more to rehabilitate the property than provide vouchers to residents, the property must be removed from public housing inventory in five years. The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Act of 1998 reinforced the mandatory conversion requirement for public housing developments with 250 or more units and low occupancy. PHAs must convert to vouchers if modernization and operation costs exceed voucher provision. Voluntary conversions are allowed if beneficial to residents and the area, without affecting affordable housing availability. PHAs review their inventory annually since 2006 to determine necessary removals. PHAs review their inventory annually to determine if public housing units need to be removed per conversion policy. Over 180,000 units have been removed through demolition or disposition, and over 16,000 through conversion. The program is governed by federal rules, regulations, and local discretion. The public housing program aims to assist low-income families by providing housing. To be eligible, families must have a gross income at or below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) and be comprised of citizens or eligible non-citizens. \"Income\" includes all sources of income from household members. Families with mixed status can live in public housing, but ineligible members cannot receive benefits. Families in public housing with ineligible members receive prorated benefits, leading to higher rent. They apply through their local PHA, which may have specific properties for elderly or disabled individuals. Due to high demand, families are placed on waiting lists that can be lengthy or closed. PHAs establish policies for managing these lists. PHAs must establish policies for managing waiting lists, including local preferences such as for working families, elderly, disabled, or veterans. They can choose between first-come, first-served or random selection processes. PHAs must balance serving the neediest families and deconcentrating poverty, ensuring at least 40% of families admitted are extremely low-income. Federal law prohibits PHAs from concentrating very low-income families in certain public housing units. PHAs must submit plans to HUD promoting income mixing by bringing higher-income tenants into lower-income properties. They must also screen families for suitability and cannot admit those convicted of producing methamphetamines on housing property or on a state sex offender registry. The federal law prohibits PHAs from concentrating very low-income families in certain public housing units. PHAs must also screen families for suitability and may adopt additional discretionary screening criteria, such as prohibiting admission for households with criminal convictions, poor credit histories, poor rental histories, or failing to meet other criteria set by the PHA. Federal housing law defines affordable housing as costing no more than 30% of family income. Tenant rent in public housing is based on family income, calculated as 30% of monthly adjusted income. Adjusted income is total family income minus deductions, such as $480 for each dependent and certain medical expenses. The Public Housing Authority (PHA) offers various deductions for tenant rent, including earned income disregard and additional deductions. Families can choose to pay a flat rent instead of income-based rent, which encourages increasing earnings without rent increases. Utilities are considered part of housing costs and are typically included in rent calculations. The Public Housing Authority (PHA) includes utilities in housing costs for families, either by reimbursing the family or paying the utility provider directly. PHAs develop utility allowance schedules to determine payments towards utility bills and assess excess consumption charges. Household composition and income are reviewed annually for rent determination. Families must provide necessary information for this process. Families must provide information for rent determination, including income, assets, and expenses. PHAs conduct interim reexaminations for changes in income or family size. Compliance with community service/self-sufficiency requirements is assessed at reexamination. Residents must participate in monthly activities to retain public housing. Federal law does not impose time limits on how long families can live in public housing as long as they pay rent and follow program rules. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) can evict families with incomes above the low-income limit but are not required to do so. PHAs have federally mandated and discretionary grounds for eviction. PHAs have discretion to evict household members convicted of drug-related criminal activity, illegal drug use, or other criminal behavior that threatens residents' safety. They may also terminate tenancy for alcohol abuse or providing false information related to substance abuse. Additional grounds for eviction, such as other criminal conduct, can be established by PHAs. PHAs have the authority to terminate tenancy based on various reasons, including drug-related criminal activity, illegal drug use, criminal behavior, alcohol abuse, and providing false information. They can also decide to evict a household member or even the entire household. Tenants have the right to challenge PHA decisions through a grievance procedure that includes an informal process and hearing. Families in public housing are low-income. The public housing program serves low-income families who may benefit from supportive services. PHAs can receive funding through programs like ROSS to hire service coordinators for residents. PHAs apply for ROSS funding through HUD's NOFA each year. The FSS program is similar to ROSS in funding service coordinators. The FSS program, similar to ROSS, funds service coordinators to link families to supportive services for self-sufficiency. Participants set goals over five years and may have increased rent deposited in an escrow account. PHAs must provide job training and opportunities for low-income individuals under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act. Under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act, PHAs and their contractors must make efforts to provide employment and training opportunities to low- and very low-income individuals using federal housing funds. Priority is given to residents of assisted developments and other properties managed by the PHA. PHAs can promote public housing resident homeownership by selling portions of properties, providing assistance to residents, or purchasing homes to resell. A plan must be approved by HUD. The Moving to Work Demonstration (MTW) allows for this option, with about 6,000 units sold to residents as of May 2009. The Moving to Work Demonstration (MTW) was authorized in 1996 to provide HUD and PHAs flexibility in designing policies to reduce costs, incentivize work participation, and increase housing choices for low-income families. Up to 30 agencies could apply for waivers under MTW to merge funds, alter policies, and modify agreements with HUD approval. The Moving to Work Demonstration (MTW) allows PHAs to make changes to their funding agreements, eligibility, and rent policies with HUD approval. Rules outside of the 1937 act cannot be waived under MTW, and agencies must continue to serve low-income families. Participating agencies have used the flexibility differently, with some making minor changes and others significantly altering their programs. The exact number of public housing units is difficult to determine. The number of public housing units is complex, with variations in occupancy status. Estimates range from over 1.1 million to just under 1.2 million units. Units may be vacant temporarily for various reasons or occupied but slated for demolition or rehabilitation. Figure 1 shows the trend in the number of public housing units over time. The public housing program peaked at over 1.4 million units in the mid-1990s but has steadily declined since then. The stock has decreased due to demolitions and lack of authorization for new units. Nearly 250,000 units were approved for removal between 1973 and May 2009, with over 200,000 actually removed. Removal rates have increased since the mid-1990s, with demolition being the most common method of unit removal. The public housing program has declined since the mid-1990s, with over 200,000 units removed through demolition or disposition. The increase in removal rates coincided with the creation of the HOPE VI program and the removal of the one-for-one replacement requirement. HUD and its partners have actively pursued demolition/disposition as a management strategy due to difficulties in developments and surrounding communities. Many units proposed for removal were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The public housing properties now being proposed for demolition/disposition were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s to a standard no longer acceptable. Today's public housing projects are mostly smaller in scale, with three-quarters being row houses, townhomes, or other types of homes. Less than half are in central city locations, and nearly half are in low-poverty areas. The distribution of public housing units is higher in central-city and high-poverty areas, with New York having the greatest number of units. The properties proposed for demolition were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s, no longer meeting current standards. New York has the largest number of public housing units in the nation, with several projects having over 2,000 units. Texas and Pennsylvania have more public housing projects than New York. Public housing is mainly located in the eastern half of the United States and is available to all types of low-income families and individuals. The most common household type in public housing is families headed by persons who are not elderly, not living with a disability, and have children, accounting for over one-third of all households. Single parent, female-headed households make up the majority of these families. Elderly households without children are the second largest category, followed by households where the head of household is living with a disability. Overall, there are more families without children than with children in public housing. In 2010, there were over 2.7 million people living in public housing, with an average household size of 2.2 people. Families with children had an average of 3.5 people per family, while families without children had an average of 1.3 people per family. About 40% of residents were children under 18, 15% were adults over 62. Nearly half of households were headed by white individuals, and another half by black individuals, with 21% headed by Hispanic individuals. In 2010, households living in public housing had a median family income of $9,644 per year, which was significantly below the national poverty guidelines. Families with children had a median income that was less than half of the poverty guideline for a three-person household. Different types of families in public housing received income from various sources. In 2010, households in public housing had a median income of $9,644 per year, below the national poverty guidelines. Elderly households mainly received income from Social Security or pensions, while households with disabilities received Supplemental Security Income. Non-elderly, non-disabled families with children received income from work, welfare, and child support. Some households reported no income. Social assistance programs have focused on promoting work among benefit recipients. The policy interest in increasing work effort among non-elderly, non-disabled families is evident in public housing requirements. In 2010, over half of these families received income from work, with a majority not receiving welfare income. Families without children had a higher rate of income from work compared to those with children. About 26% of not-elderly, not-disabled households received welfare income but not from work. Among not-elderly, not-disabled households, those with children were more likely to receive welfare income but not from work. Most of these families are likely to be subject to work requirements in the TANF program. A quarter of families with children and a fifth of families without children reported receiving no income or income only from non-work and non-welfare sources. These families are most likely to be subject to community service requirements in public housing. Families in public housing pay low rents due to their low incomes. In 2010, the median rent paid by tenants in public housing was $224 per month, with non-elderly, non-disabled families with children paying the lowest rent. The difference between what tenants pay in rent and the fair market rent (FMR) was $563 per month for all households, with families with children benefiting the most at nearly $700 per month. Public housing does not impose limits on how long a family can reside in the units. The length of time a family can live in public housing is not limited. Families can renew their lease until they are no longer eligible due to income increases or rule violations. Data from December 2010 shows that over half of families in public housing had lived there for five years or less, with the majority residing for one to two years. Public housing residents can live there indefinitely, with some living for less than a year and others for over 20 years. Elderly-headed families are more common in long-term residents. PHAs sustain public housing through federal funding, tenant rents, and other income sources. Congress provides funding to cover the gap between rent and operating costs. Operating funds for public housing cover day-to-day operations like administration, utilities, and maintenance. Capital funds are for modernization projects. PHAs receive funds based on a formula and can apply for HOPE VI grants to revitalize distressed housing. Operating funds also subsidize costs not covered by tenant rent. The calculation for determining a PHA's operating subsidy eligibility involves expenses and income. HUD subtracts income from expenses to determine the subsidy. Appropriations from Congress were not always sufficient, leading to proration levels ranging from 83% to over 100%. Subsequent years saw reductions in funding, with proration levels at 95% in 2011 and 2012, and 82% in FY2013. Operating funds supplement PHAs' income from tenant rents and investments. The federal funds supplement PHAs' income from tenant rents and investments, making up a varying percentage of their operating budget. In 2009, 61% of PHAs' revenues came from federal funds, 34% from tenant rents, and 5% from other sources. HUD data shows how PHAs allocate their funds, with percentages going towards utilities, administrative expenses, maintenance costs, general expenses, tenant services, and protective services. The Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant program provided funding to PHAs from FY1991-FY2001. The Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant program provided competitive grant funding to PHAs for safety and security activities, including funding for security guards, after-school programs, and physical changes to promote security. Capital funds are provided to PHAs via formula to meet modernization needs, with a portion set aside for Replacement Housing Factor funding. PHAs receive capital funds for modernization, development, and management improvements, with a portion set aside for Replacement Housing Factor funding. A 1998 study highlighted a backlog of $18-$20 billion in unmet needs for public housing modernization. Funding levels have not met the annual accrual needs since then. In FY2008, Congress directed HUD to conduct a new Capital Needs Assessment for public housing, revealing a $20.7 billion backlog and annual needs accruing at over $3.4 billion. PHAs are leveraging capital funds to address needs, with $3.8 billion approved for 240 PHAs by June 2012. The Capital Fund Financing program (CFFP) allows PHAs to pledge future capital funds for debt service payments on loans or bonds, subject to HUD approval. PHAs can pledge up to one-third of their capital funding, but not operating funds or public housing properties. HOPE VI is a grant program for public housing redevelopment, aiming to replace public housing with mixed-income housing. The HOPE VI program was created in response to the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing's findings, which identified 6% of public housing as severely distressed. This equated to 86,000 units with high crime, low employment, poor conditions, and limited opportunities for residents. The program aims to revitalize these properties by transforming them into safe, attractive, marketable units in mixed-income communities through partnerships with agencies and local governments. The HOPE VI program aims to revitalize severely distressed public housing by partnering with agencies and local governments, enforcing strict eviction rules, and promoting self-sufficiency for residents. Despite criticism for displacing existing residents, the program has been credited with demolishing troubled housing and replacing it with higher quality, mixed-income units. The Obama Administration has proposed replacing the HOPE VI program with a new initiative. The Obama Administration has proposed replacing the HOPE VI program with the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI), expanding beyond public housing to distressed neighborhoods. Congress funded CNI in FY2010, FY2012, and FY2013, excluding HOPE VI. Total public housing funding fluctuated over the last decade, increasing until FY2002, declining from FY2002 to FY2006 due to reductions in HOPE VI funding. Funding began rising again in FY2007. In FY2007, public housing funding started to increase again, with a peak in FY2010 due to stimulus funding. However, funding decreased in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. Per unit funding remained relatively stable from FY1999 to FY2008, with fluctuations corresponding to changes in appropriations. The significant increase in funding per unit in FY2009 was mainly due to stimulus capital funding. The report provides an overview of the public housing program and highlights the $4 billion in capital funding from the economic stimulus legislation. Policy issues regarding the program, such as the backlog of unmet capital needs and aging infrastructure, have been raised and may be considered by Congress. Issues like poor quality materials and design have contributed to the decline of public housing viability. The declining physical state of public housing stock is attributed to poor quality materials, low funding levels, and inadequate budgets. There is a backlog of unmet capital needs that current federal funding levels are unlikely to address. Properties in disrepair are at risk of removal through demolition or conversion, with the HOPE VI program aimed at addressing the worst-condition properties. Many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) have become skilled at leveraging private resources to address capital needs, even without HOPE VI grants. However, there are limits to accessing private financing, as HUD restricts the amount of future capital funding that PHAs can pledge towards debt repayment. PHAs are also unable to pledge future operating funds or the property itself as security for private funding. Lenders' willingness to provide funding in the private market is crucial for PHAs seeking additional resources. Seeking funding in the private market for public housing is dependent on lenders' willingness to provide capital. Additional funding may be necessary to preserve existing public housing stock, possibly through increased federal appropriations. The economic stimulus legislation in the 111th Congress allocated nearly $4 billion for public housing, addressing around 20% of the estimated capital needs backlog. Future funding infusions are uncertain due to budget constraints and political considerations. Future large infusions of federal funding for public housing are uncertain due to tight budget constraints and political questions. Options to address capital needs include changing federal rent policies to allow higher payments from tenants, accessing private capital markets, leveraging operating fund dollars, mortgaging public housing properties, and creating mortgage insurance programs through the FHA to incentivize lenders. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) is an Obama Administration initiative to allow public housing authorities (PHAs) to access private capital by removing limitations on mortgaging public housing properties. Congress authorized RAD in the FY2012 and FY2013 HUD appropriations laws, making up to 60,000 units eligible to convert to project-based Section 8 contracts without additional funding. The future role of the public housing program in federal housing policy is uncertain due to declining units and lack of authority to construct new ones. The public housing program's future role in federal housing policy is uncertain as it has evolved from a construction program to providing affordable housing for poor families. Other models of direct housing assistance have overshadowed its prominence, such as programs promoting private market construction and subsidizing housing costs for families. The Section 8 voucher program is the primary rental assistance program for poor families, growing in recent decades due to declines in public housing units. Other housing assistance models were developed to address issues with public housing, such as lack of mobility and cost effectiveness. Critics point to poor locations and conditions in public housing, raising questions about its future role in federal housing policy. Critics argue that public housing traps vulnerable families in poor conditions, with high crime rates and limited social capital. They believe it denies choice and opportunity, while rent structures may discourage self-sufficiency. Advocates claim private market options are inadequate for the most vulnerable, as landlords can refuse Section 8 vouchers. Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) serve the poorest families with a social mission, providing high-quality housing and services. Advocates argue that high-quality public housing, enriched with services, can offer opportunities for families, citing successful mixed-income communities like HOPE VI. Research shows place-based interventions can support family success, especially for the elderly and families with children. The cost of providing vouchers to families has been higher than funding public housing units, potentially making public housing a more cost-effective option for rental assistance. However, the low cost of public housing is due to underfunding, highlighting the need for full funding to address the backlog of capital needs. If public housing were fully funded, the cost to the government could be higher than vouchers. Evaluating the costs and benefits should consider the value of public housing properties built and maintained with federal funds. Questions about ownership of this value may impact program evaluation."
