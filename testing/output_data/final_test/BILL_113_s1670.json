    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\" and includes legislative findings. Congress finds that unborn children have pain receptors throughout their bodies, reacting to touch by 8 weeks and painful stimuli by 20 weeks. This can lead to increased stress hormones and long-term neurodevelopmental effects. Fetal anesthesia is routinely used for surgery on unborn children to reduce stress hormones. Some physicians argue that unborn children cannot feel pain until later in pregnancy, based on the development of the cerebral cortex and nerve connections. Recent research challenges this belief. Recent medical research since 2007 suggests that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain. Evidence shows that children born without most of the cerebral cortex still feel pain. Stimulation or removal of the cerebral cortex in adults and animals does not affect pain perception, while the thalamus does. Early development structures for pain processing differ from adults, using different neural elements like the subcortical plate. (10) Unborn children can experience pain despite being in a coma-like state, as shown by their reactions to painful stimuli and the need for anesthesia during fetal surgery. (11) Medical evidence suggests that unborn children can feel pain by 20 weeks after fertilization. (12) Congress aims to protect unborn children from the stage where they can feel pain. The government has a strong interest in protecting unborn children from the stage where medical evidence shows they can feel pain, separate from the interest in protecting them at the stage of viability. SEC. 3. PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION. Section 1532 of Title 18, US Code prohibits performing an abortion unless in compliance with specified requirements. The physician must determine the unborn child's post-fertilization age and conduct necessary medical examinations. The physician must determine the post-fertilization age of the unborn child to make an accurate determination. Abortions after 20 weeks are prohibited unless necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. The text chunk discusses exceptions for terminating a pregnancy, including cases of rape or incest against a minor if reported to law enforcement. Physicians must follow specific guidelines when terminating pregnancies under these exceptions. In cases where termination of a pregnancy is necessary, physicians must choose the method that offers the best chance for the unborn child to survive, unless it poses a greater risk to the pregnant woman's life or physical health. Violation of these guidelines can result in a criminal penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to 5 years. Additionally, a woman who undergoes an abortion in violation of these guidelines cannot be prosecuted. The definition of abortion in this section includes intentionally killing an unborn child or terminating a pregnancy with certain intentions. The term 'abortion' includes removing a dead unborn child, attempting an abortion, fertilization, performing an abortion, and defining a physician as someone licensed to perform abortions. The term 'post-fertilization age' refers to the age of the unborn child calculated from the fusion of human sperm and ovum. 'Probable post-fertilization age' is the estimated age at the time of planned abortion based on reasonable medical judgment by a knowledgeable physician. The term 'unborn child' is defined as a human organism from fertilization until birth, while 'woman' refers to a female human being regardless of age. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the United States Code. The chapter heading and table of chapters in title 18 of the United States Code are amended to replace \"Partial-Birth Abortions\" with \"Abortions\" under the Pain-capable unborn child protection act."
