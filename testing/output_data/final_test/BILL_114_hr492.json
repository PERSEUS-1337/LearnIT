    "content": "The \"Ultrasound Informed Consent Act\" is added to the Public Health Service Act, including definitions under Title XXXIV. The curr_chunk defines \"abortion\" as the intentional termination of an unborn child's life or a woman's pregnancy, with exceptions for live birth, preserving child's life, removing ectopic pregnancy, or addressing specific circumstances. It also defines \"abortion provider\" as a person legally qualified to perform abortions under Federal and State laws. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to abortion laws, including the definitions of \"unborn child,\" \"unemancipated minor,\" and \"woman.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the legal framework surrounding abortion. The curr_chunk focuses on the requirement of informed consent in relation to abortion laws. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for abortion providers regarding informed consent, including the performance and review of ultrasounds before the procedure. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for ultrasounds before an abortion, including checking the embryo/fetus dimensions, cardiac activity, and presence of organs. It also states that pregnant women can choose not to view the ultrasound images without penalty. The curr_chunk discusses exceptions for medical emergencies in abortions, allowing for abortions to save the life of a mother in certain physical conditions. It also outlines the certification required by abortion providers in such cases and penalties for non-compliance. The Attorney General can impose civil penalties on abortion providers for violations of the law, with fines up to $100,000 for the first violation and $250,000 for subsequent violations. The Attorney General must also notify the State medical licensing authority. Additionally, women have a private right of action in cases of abortion. \"A woman can sue an abortion provider for damages if the abortion was performed in violation of the law, with actual and punitive damages available.\" SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act does not override any State laws that have stricter disclosure requirements or penalties for non-compliance with abortion regulations than those outlined in the Act.\n\nSEC. 4. SEVERABILITY.\n\nIf any part of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
