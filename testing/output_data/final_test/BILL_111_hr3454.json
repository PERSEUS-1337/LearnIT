    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Hospice Reform and Savings Act of 2009\" introduces reforms to hospice care payment and coverage. The Medicare Hospice Reform and Savings Act of 2009 amends Section 1814(i)(2) of the Social Security Act to provide relief from demand payments for hospice programs, limiting demands to 10% of payments and capping aggregate reductions at $400,000,000 for accounting years ending before November 1, 2009. The Secretary shall reduce reductions under subclause (I) to not exceed $400,000,000. Subclause (I) considers principal amounts made before the enactment date. Hospice programs can request a 60-month repayment period for demands under the limit. The interest rate on demands cannot exceed the rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury. The amendment to section 1814(i)(1) of the Act allows for realignment of payment amounts for hospice care, specifically addressing care furnished after November 1, 2009, during a hospice election period. The amendment allows for adjustments in payment amounts for hospice care, with a 12.5% reduction for certain care and a 20% increase for specific periods. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to issue national coverage determinations for terminal illnesses by January 31, 2010. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will determine annual savings from national coverage determinations for hospice care during fiscal years 2010-2013. There will be a delay in phasing out the Medicare hospice budget neutrality adjustment factor based on these savings. The Secretary will restore the budget neutrality adjustment factor in the Medicare hospice wage index for fiscal years 2010-2013 to increase expenditures under title XVIII of the Social Security Act."
