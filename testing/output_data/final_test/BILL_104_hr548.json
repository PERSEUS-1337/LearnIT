The Director of the Institute, in cooperation with other national research institutes, conducts research on aging processes in women, focusing on menopause effects and changes. They also support research on disorders related to aging and loss of ovarian hormones. Additionally, the Director will develop at least 5 research centers for menopause and related conditions after consulting with the advisory council. Research centers will conduct basic and clinical research on menopause to improve medical knowledge and develop models of healthcare for menopausal health conditions. The Institute will conduct educational programs on menopause and menopausal health conditions for healthcare professionals and the general public. Research centers will focus on hormonal and nonhormonal treatments for menopausal health conditions. The Institute will conduct research on the relationship between menopausal health conditions and various diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Additionally, they will develop protocols for prevention and treatment of menopausal health conditions.
