    "content": "The North Korean Taepo Dong program, originating from the No Dong missile program in the late 1980s, developed two ballistic missile systems - Taepo Dong 1 and Taepo Dong 2. Taepo Dong 1 aimed to deliver a 1,000 to 1,500 kg warhead up to 2,500 km, while Taepo Dong 2 targeted a range of 4,000 to 8,000 km. Initial prototypes were likely made in 1995 or 1996, with a small production run for Taepo Dong 1 in 1997 or 1998. Estimates suggest North Korea may have produced up to ten Taepo Dong 1 and one or two Taepo Dong 2 prototypes by 1999, with no deployment. Foreign assistance from China, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran was believed to be extensive. The Taepo Dong 1 missile program received foreign assistance from China, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran. On August 31, 1998, a Taepo Dong 1 was launched from North Korea, aiming to place a satellite into orbit. Initial U.S. intelligence reports indicated it was a two-stage rocket, but further analysis revealed a small third solid propellant stage. Debris from this stage was found up to 4,000 km away. The Taepo Dong 1 missile program received foreign assistance from China, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran. On August 31, 1998, a Taepo Dong 1 missile was launched from North Korea with a satellite aiming to enter earth orbit. Debris from the third stage was found up to 4,000 km away. The missile could potentially reach a range of 3,800 to 5,900 km, putting U.S. military facilities in Guam, Okinawa, and Japan within its possible range. The missile is believed to be a two-stage missile using a No Dong missile derivative as its first stage and a SCUD C derivative as its second stage, capable of delivering a 700 - 1,000 kg warhead to a range of 2,500 km. The Taepo Dong 2 missile, also known as Moksong 2 or Pekdosan 2, is believed to be a two-stage missile around 35 meters long. The first stage resembles the Chinese CSS-2 and CSS-3, while the second stage is based on the No Dong missile. Analysts speculate that with a 700 to 1,000 kg payload, it could potentially reach a range of 3,750 km, and up to 4,300 km with a third stage added. Some analysts believe the Taepo Dong 2 missile could deliver a 700 to 1,000 kg payload up to 6,700 km. The missile's guidance system has not been tested, making its accuracy uncertain. Deployment method (silo or transportable) is undetermined, with suggestions of it being a road mobile system. To reach Hawaii and U.S. mainland targets, payload may need to be reduced to 200 - 300 kg. There are speculations of potential export to other countries. In June 2006, the missile was seen being assembled and fueled at the Musudan-ri test site in North Korea. On July 4, 2006, North Korea launched the Taepo Dong 2. On July 4, 2006, North Korea launched the Taepo Dong 2 missile, which failed during the first stage and fell into the Sea of Japan. The causes of the failure were not publicly disclosed, with speculations including structural failure or issues with the propulsion and guidance systems. Reports suggested Russian engineering support and initial production of the missile in 2005, with around 20 missiles possibly built in 2006. In early February 2009, reports indicated North Korea was preparing for a Taepodong-2 launch, which was deemed unhelpful by Secretary of State Clinton and a violation of a UN Security Council Resolution. South Korea also warned of the threat. North Korea later announced plans to launch a communications satellite, raising concerns about its military spending. North Korea may allocate up to 40% of its GDP to military spending, focusing on nuclear, biological, chemical, and missile programs to gain an advantage over the US and South Korea. General LaPorte expressed concerns about North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons development, potentially weaponizing their materials. North Korea's collaboration with countries like Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Yemen, and Libya on ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads raises additional concerns. North Korea's collaboration with countries like Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Yemen, and Libya on ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads raises concerns about the proliferation of Chinese warhead designs and potential acceleration of North Korea's long-range nuclear ballistic missile program. Reports suggest North Korea may be developing new missile systems, including medium to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. North Korea may be developing new medium to intermediate-range missiles based on the decommissioned Soviet R-27 submarine-launched ballistic missile, potentially enhanced with Russian assistance. This proven design could allow North Korea to deploy these missiles without extensive testing. North Korea has deployed a new medium-range ballistic missile with a range of 1,800 miles, believed to be based on the decommissioned Soviet R-27 missile. The missile, known as Musadan or No Dong B, is 12m long and has a range of 2,500-3,200 km, putting most of East Asia within its reach. Experts suggest that this missile could potentially target U.S. military bases in Guam and Okinawa. The Musadan missile, based on the decommissioned Soviet R-27, has a range of 2,500-3,200 km, potentially reaching U.S. military bases in Guam and Okinawa. North Korea has reportedly deployed 15-20 Musadan missiles without testing, with new missile bases constructed to accommodate them. The sea-based version of the R-27 is either submarine or ship-mounted. North Korea may be pursuing a sea-based ballistic missile capability, potentially acquiring decommissioned Russian submarines capable of carrying SS-N-5 SLBMs. It is unclear if North Korea has reentry vehicles for their versions of the R-27 missiles. This development could pose security implications for the United States. North Korea acquired decommissioned Russian submarines with missile launch sub-systems, potentially enabling them to develop submarine or ship-mounted ballistic missiles. Experts believe North Korea lacks the capability to independently develop SLBMs and may have integrated this technology into new ballistic missile submarines or possibly merchant ships. This development poses security concerns for the United States. North Korea's acquisition of decommissioned Russian submarines with missile launch sub-systems could lead to the development of ship-mounted ballistic missiles. There are concerns that North Korea might sell this technology to other countries like Iran, potentially increasing the missile threat to the United States. Analysts believe that a sea-launched version of these missiles could pose the greatest threat by targeting the continental United States and complicating intelligence collection efforts. North Korea's potential development of ship-mounted ballistic missiles from decommissioned Russian submarines raises concerns about increased missile threats. US officials doubt North Korea's current capability to reach the continental US with a sea-based missile or intentions to hide missiles in freighters for attacks."
