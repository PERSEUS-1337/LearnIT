    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Geothermal Energy Initiative Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that there is a lack of awareness about geothermal energy resources among Federal land management agencies, leading to delays in development. The Bureau of Land Management has a backlog of 230 lease applications for prospecting for geothermal energy, with an average age of 9 years. The oldest non-competitive geothermal lease application was received in 1974, indicating a lack of focus and priority in the Bureau of Land Management. Geothermal energy development is considered environmentally safe and clean. The Bureau of Land Management lacks focus on geothermal energy development. The Secretary of Energy is required to assess geothermal energy resources in the US annually, considering market conditions and technologies. A report must be published within a year detailing available resources, including terrain, population centers, energy infrastructure, and cost estimates. The Secretary of Energy is required to assess geothermal energy resources annually in the US, including cost estimates and barriers to transmission. Recommendations for addressing barriers and providing grid access without disadvantaging renewable energy producers are also required. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2006-2008 for this purpose. SEC. 4. ENHANCED ACCESS TO FEDERAL LANDS FOR GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture are required to expedite geothermal energy development in land use and resource management plans while protecting other resources. This does not affect the issuance of rights-of-way for geothermal projects before plan revisions. The Secretary of the Interior will develop recommendations for Congress on changes to assist geothermal energy development on Federal land, including a 5-year plan for environmentally sound development and an analysis of rights-of-ways versus leasing. The Secretary of the Interior will provide recommendations to Congress for promoting geothermal energy development on Federal land, including exploring leasing systems, grants, loans, and tax credits. They will also address any environmental concerns and identify suitable lands for geothermal energy development in consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and Defense. The Secretary of the Interior will recommend statutory and regulatory mechanisms for geothermal energy development on suitable lands. The Secretary of the Interior will recommend mechanisms for geothermal energy development on suitable lands, including consultation regarding geothermal leasing and permitting on public lands. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture will create a memorandum of understanding within 6 months for geothermal development on public lands. The memorandum will include provisions for identifying geothermal areas, reviewing management plans, and establishing an administrative procedure for processing lease applications. The Secretary concerned will review geothermal lease applications within 14 days to determine if they contain sufficient information for processing. If deficiencies are found, the application will be returned with an explanation of the issues. The Secretary concerned will review geothermal lease applications within 14 days for processing deficiencies. They must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days, including an estimated processing time. An administrative procedure for geothermal development permits must be established. A 5-year leasing plan for public land in the National Forest System under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 must be developed and updated regularly. A data retrieval system is also required. The memorandum of understanding establishes a joint data retrieval system to track lease and permit applications, providing applicants with status updates and estimated processing times. SEC. 6. REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF NEPA ANALYSES, DOCUMENTATION, AND STUDIES. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to include reimbursement for costs related to NEPA analyses, documentation, and studies. The Secretary of the Interior may reimburse individuals for costs related to NEPA analyses, documentation, and studies if adequate funding is not available, payments were voluntary, and records of costs are maintained. The Secretary will issue regulations for the lease amendment within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, applicable to leases before or after that date. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of the Interior for the implementation of sections 5 through 7."
