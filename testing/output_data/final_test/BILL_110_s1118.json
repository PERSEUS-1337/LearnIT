Passenger automobiles are regulated for off-highway operation features. SEC. 3 focuses on the annual increase in average fuel economy standards. The \"Fuel Efficiency Energy Act of 2007\" updates fuel economy standards for automobiles and medium-duty trucks, with separate standards for different classes of vehicles. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe average fuel economy standards for each model year starting from 2012, with annual increases in fuel economy standards. The Fuel Efficiency Energy Act of 2007 updates fuel economy standards for automobiles and medium-duty trucks. For model year 2012, the average fuel economy standard for each class of automobiles is based on the 2011 performance. From model year 2013 to 2030, the fleet's average fuel economy must increase by at least 4% each year. The Secretary of Transportation can amend fuel economy standards as needed. The Secretary of Transportation can set a lower fuel economy standard for a class of automobiles if it is not technologically achievable, compromises safety, or is not cost-effective. The Secretary of Transportation can set a maximum fuel economy standard for a class of automobiles in a model year, which must be technologically achievable, maintain overall safety, and be cost-effective. Cost effectiveness is determined by considering the total value to the United States of reduced petroleum use. The curr_chunk discusses the analysis of external costs of petroleum use, including factors like value to consumers, economic security, national security, foreign policy, and the impact of oil use on various aspects such as sustained cartel rents, GDP, import costs, and trade imbalances. The curr_chunk focuses on the impact of oil shocks on import costs, wealth transfers, macroeconomic dislocation, adjustment costs, existing energy security policies, oil peaking problem, oil supply disruptions, OPEC's strategic behavior, and oil pricing elasticity. The curr_chunk discusses the short-term elasticity of energy demand, price increases from supply shocks, oil imports, military costs, security costs, diplomatic flexibility, geopolitical strife, terrorism, and environmental hazards under EPA jurisdiction. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of oil intensity on the US economy, oil import payments on political and economic developments, and costs of oil seepage and spills. The curr_chunk discusses factors related to oil seepage, spills, and landscape damage, as well as the minimum valuation of gasoline saved by the Secretary of Transportation. The curr_chunk discusses the national cost of gasoline and projected prices for a 20-year period, with amendments to Title 49 of the United States Code.

The curr_chunk discusses amendments to Title 49 of the United States Code related to subsections (c) and (g) of this section, including changes to section 32902 and the repeal of the credit for dual-fueled automobiles. The amendments to Title 49 of the United States Code involve the repeal of the credit for dual-fueled automobiles. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will measure fuel economy for dual-fueled and gaseous fuel dual-fueled automobiles manufactured from 2012 onwards. Amendments to Title 49 of the United States Code involve removing subsection (f) and redesignating subsections (g) and (h) as subsections (f) and (g), respectively. SEC. 4 requires a 10% annual increase in dual-fueled automobiles manufactured from 2012 to 2022. SEC. 5 states that these amendments will be effective from January 1, 2010, and apply to cars made from 2012 onwards."
