    "content": "The VR state grants program, authorized by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, supports employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities. Originally part of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, it continues under the Rehabilitation Act with annual appropriations adjusted for inflation. It is the largest program under the Rehabilitation Act. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA) reauthorized programs in the Rehabilitation Act, including VR state grants, which account for approximately 90% of the funds appropriated under the act. WIOA designates VR state grants as core programs aligned through a unified state plan and monitored by performance accountability indicators. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (WIOA) reauthorized programs in the Rehabilitation Act, including VR state grants, which make up 90% of the funds. WIOA introduced new purposes into the Rehabilitation Act, emphasizing competitive integrated employment for individuals with disabilities. This includes a new definition of competitive integrated employment as minimum wage employment where individuals interact with non-disabled persons. WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to prioritize competitive integrated employment for individuals with disabilities, encouraging employer involvement and collaboration. States can now use VR funds for outreach and services to support employment opportunities for VR clients, with a focus on youth services. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) emphasizes community-based competitive integrated employment for individuals with disabilities, particularly youth and students transitioning from secondary school. WIOA mandates state VR agencies to reserve 15% of grants for pre-employment transition services. Coordination between state VR agencies and local educational agencies under IDEA is also required. Implementation of WIOA is gradual, with current VR state grants program operating under pre-WIOA provisions. The VR state grants program, as amended by WIOA, is administered by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the Department of Education. The program receives mandatory funding through the appropriations process, with annual appropriations adjusted for inflation. If authorization expires, funding remains at the prior year's level. WIOA authorizes $3,302,053,000 per year for VR state grants for FY2015 through FY2020, matching the FY2014 appropriation level. VR state grants are subject to sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, potentially reducing funding available to states. The Office of Management and Budget announced a 7.3% reduction in nondefense mandatory spending programs, including VR state grants, for FY2015. This resulted in a decrease from $3.335 billion to $3.091 billion available for VR state grants. The allocation of VR grants to states is determined by a formula based on population, per capita income, and original allotment in 1978. Grant sizes are influenced by population and original allocation, while inversely related to per capita income. The formula for the District of Columbia and territories differs slightly from that of the 50 states, with a minimum grant size requirement set by statute. The VR state grants formula requires a match from states, with a federal share of 78.7% and states providing 21.3%. Grant recipients can contribute additional funds. States not providing a full match have their federal grant reduced, with remaining funds reallocated. Reallocated funds must be matched by states. Preference is given to states with smaller increases in prior years for reallocated funds. Unused funds are returned to the Treasury if not reallocated. State VR agencies determine client eligibility and provide services, with discretion in assessment and service delivery. States must submit and have approved a unified state plan (USP) for VR grants, aligning with labor force needs and WIOA core programs. The USP and alignment of workforce programs are key components for grant approval. The USP and formal alignment of state core workforce programs under WIOA require approval by the Secretary of Labor and Education. State plans must be submitted by March 2016 and effective from July 1, 2016. Specific requirements for VR grantees in the USP include implementing waiting lists, personnel development, and ensuring comparable benefits before using VR funds. The state agency will determine if comparable benefits or services are available from another source before providing VR funds. The agency will produce an annual report with detailed data on individuals served, services provided, and employment outcomes. Cooperative agreements will be established with other stakeholders, and a triennial assessment of rehabilitation needs for individuals with disabilities will be conducted. Each state has the option to designate a state agency to carry out the VR component of the USP. The USP designates a state agency to implement the plan, with the option for a single VR agency serving all eligible clients or separate agencies for blind and other clients. The designated state unit (DSU) works with a State Rehabilitation Council (SRC) to advise on performance and state plan development. SRC must have 11 represented groups, majority being individuals with disabilities not employed by DSU. WIOA's Section 116 establishes common performance indicators for core grant programs. The WIOA establishes common performance indicators for core grant programs, focusing on employment and credential attainment. The six indicators include measures such as percentage of participants in unsubsidized employment post-program and median earnings of participants in unsubsidized employment. The WIOA establishes common performance indicators for core grant programs, focusing on employment and credential attainment. These indicators include measures such as percentage of participants in employment or training programs leading to a recognized postsecondary credential, measurable skill gains, and effectiveness in serving employers. States must identify expected performance levels for each indicator, which may be negotiated with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education. The Rehabilitation Act under WIOA establishes standardized performance accountability measures for state VR grantees. States failing to meet performance levels will receive assistance and may face sanctions or reduced federal grant levels. Previously, standards were set by the RSA commissioner, but now they are uniform across core programs. Reporting requirements include data on applicants' characteristics and clients' progress. State VR grantees must collect additional data on applicants' characteristics and clients' progress to inform program performance discussions. VR services are provided by designated state units with some flexibility in service delivery. State agencies assess eligibility for VR services based on physical or mental criteria. To be eligible for VR services, an assessment must show a substantial impediment to employment due to a physical or mental impairment. Beneficiaries of SSDI or SSI are presumed eligible. State VR agencies use existing information for eligibility determinations. State VR agencies must base determinations of ineligibility on individual consultations with applicants, not on their category of disability. Ineligibility can only be determined if the applicant cannot benefit from VR services due to the severity of their disability after exploring their abilities through trial work experiences. If resources are limited, the agency must notify RSA. State VR agencies must implement an order of selection plan to prioritize services for individuals with the \"most significant disabilities\" before others. The core of the VR service model is the Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE), which outlines the client's employment goal and the services provided to achieve it. An IPE is required to include the client's chosen employment outcome. The Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) must include the client's chosen employment outcome, necessary VR services, timeline, service provider, progress evaluation criteria, client and agency responsibilities, supported employment services, and potential post-employment services. Informed choice is emphasized in the development and implementation of the IPE. Informed choice is crucial in developing an Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE), where clients select the best options for their needs. State VR personnel must approve all components of the IPE. Clients have the final say but can seek mediation or due process if they disagree with state agency decisions. VR services can be provided by state agencies, other state entities, or private providers. Clients must exhaust federal funding sources before state VR agencies cover services. The VR agency will pay for services such as counseling, job search assistance, training, supportive services, and supported employment. Services may vary based on individual employment plans. Clients must apply for federal aid before VR agency funding kicks in. VR agencies provide a range of services to help clients retain or advance in employment, including assistive technology, supported employment, and post-employment services. WIOA mandates that states reserve 15% of VR grants for pre-employment transition services for youth with disabilities, emphasizing coordination with entities under IDEA. The Education Act (IDEA) mandates states to provide pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities, including job counseling, work-based learning, and self-advocacy. Coordination with relevant government entities is required for the transition from secondary school. The Education Act mandates states to provide pre-employment transition services for students with disabilities, including job counseling and work-based learning. Coordination with government entities is necessary for the transition from secondary school. Local VR agencies must work with schools to provide services and opportunities for students with disabilities, including internships and summer employment. WIOA amended the Rehabilitation Act to involve employers in VR programs and provide services to employers hiring workers with disabilities. Services provided by state VR agencies for employers hiring workers with disabilities include technical assistance, training on disability awareness and ADA requirements, work-based experience opportunities, recruitment of qualified applicants with disabilities, training for employees with disabilities, workplace accommodations, assistive technology, and financial support utilization. VR agencies may close a client's case after achieving competitive employment outcomes in an integrated setting, with other outcomes like supported employment or self-employment also considered. State VR agencies may close a client's case if they have not achieved an employment outcome and decline further services. Agencies must report reasons for termination without employment outcomes. The VR grant allotment process considers population, income, and FY1978 allocation. Each state receives an allocation based on its 1978 grant, with the first $759,317,831 distributed annually. The VR grant allotment process distributes funds based on population, income, and FY1978 allocation. The excess amount not allocated by the 1978 grants is divided equally into two parts. Each state's allotment percentage is calculated based on its per capita income compared to the national average. The state's allotment percentage is calculated based on its per capita income relative to the national average, with an inverse relationship. States with below-average incomes receive higher allotment percentages. Allotment percentages range from 33.3% to 75%, with adjustments made if outside this range. Excess amounts are divided into two parts, with the first half allotted using a formula. The state's formula allocation for excess amounts is determined by multiplying the state's population by its allotment percentage, then dividing by the sum of all states and territories. The second component is calculated by multiplying the fraction by one-half of the excess amount. The next step involves squaring the allocation percentages to determine the second half of the excess amount allocation. This increases the influence of allotment percentages on grant distribution, favoring states with higher percentages. States with higher allotment percentages receive more funds in Step 6 compared to Step 4, while states with lower percentages get more in Step 4. The allotments from steps 1, 4, and 5 are combined for the state's preliminary grant. If a state's grant is below the minimum threshold, adjustments are made to meet the required minimum."
