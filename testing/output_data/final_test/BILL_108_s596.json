A 5.25 percent tax is imposed on a corporation's excess qualified foreign distribution amount under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This tax is in lieu of the tax imposed under section 11 or 55 on the specified amounts for the taxable year. The excess qualified foreign distribution amount is defined as the excess of dividends received by the taxpayer during the taxable year. The excess qualified foreign distribution amount is subject to a 5.25 percent tax under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code. Dividends received during the taxable year from controlled foreign corporations must be reinvested in the United States as per an approved domestic reinvestment plan. The base dividend amount is defined as an amount designated under subsection (c)(7), not less than the average dividends received during the fixed base period from controlled foreign corporations. The fixed base period refers to a specific time frame for calculating dividends. The term 'fixed base period' refers to 3 taxable years among the 5 most recent years ending on or before December 31, 2002, excluding the highest and lowest dividend years from controlled foreign corporations. If the taxpayer has fewer than 5 taxable years, a shorter period is considered. The term 'fixed base period' for tax purposes is defined as a specific period of taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2002.

Rules similar to section 41(f)(3) apply to acquisitions or dispositions of controlled foreign corporations.

The regulations apply to all corporations that are controlled foreign corporations where the taxpayer is a United States shareholder. If the taxpayer is part of a consolidated group of corporations filing a consolidated return, the election must be made by the common parent of the group and applies to all members. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations to carry out the section's purposes. The regulations apply to controlled foreign corporations where the taxpayer is a United States shareholder.
