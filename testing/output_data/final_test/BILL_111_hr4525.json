Phase-in exception for certain chapter 61 disability retirees from January 1, 2011. Qualifying service-connected disability defined for qualified retirees.\" The text discusses the criteria for receiving disability benefits for retired military personnel under different circumstances. The text outlines the criteria for disabled veterans to receive benefits based on their disability rating and retirement status. The text specifies the disability rating criteria for veterans to receive benefits and the special rules for Chapter 61 disability retirees with 20 years of service. The retired pay of a member under chapter 61 of this title with fewer than 20 years of service is subject to reduction under certain conditions. The retired pay of a member under chapter 61 of this title may be reduced under sections 5304 and 5305 of title 38 if it exceeds a certain percentage of the member's years of service multiplied by their retired pay base. Additionally, veterans' disability compensation may affect the concurrent receipt phase-in. The section discusses veterans' disability compensation for disabilities rated at 40 percent or less, or zero percent, with clerical amendments made to the section heading and table of sections. The amendments allow for concurrent receipt of retired pay and veterans' disability compensation, effective January 1, 2011. The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives will make necessary adjustments in the budget for fiscal year 2011 to implement these changes."
