The summer of 2010 brought Pakistan's worst flooding in 80 years, affecting 20 million people and 62,000 square miles of land. The floods began in July following heavy monsoon rains in various regions, leading to a significant impact on property, livelihood, and infrastructure. The Pakistani Government reported that 82 out of 122 districts were affected, with over 12 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The summer of 2010 brought Pakistan's worst flooding in 80 years, affecting 20 million people and 62,000 square miles of land. The floods devastated infrastructure, with over 1.9 million houses damaged or destroyed, nearly 2,000 lives lost, and 60,000 troops involved in relief operations. The floods also submerged 17 million acres of croplands, killed over 200,000 livestock, and washed away roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, and communication facilities. The devastating floods in Pakistan in 2010 destroyed infrastructure, homes, and crops, causing over 2,000 deaths and affecting 20 million people. The disaster also led to the emergence of cholera and the loss of 5.3 million jobs. Concerns are rising about the long-term impact on Pakistan's economy, food supply, and political stability. Temporary protected status was granted to those fleeing dangerous situations. Granting temporary protected status to nationals of Pakistan after the devastating floods in 2010 is in line with U.S. interests and values, supporting those fleeing dangerous situations. The Congress believes that Pakistan qualifies for temporary protected status in the U.S. due to flooding conditions. Pakistan is designated for temporary protected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act for 12 months. Aliens from Pakistan must meet specific criteria to be eligible for this designation. Aliens granted temporary protected status must register in a manner established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary may give consent for travel abroad in emergency situations. An alien with temporary protected status may travel abroad with authorization and will be treated the same as any other returning alien with temporary protected status."
