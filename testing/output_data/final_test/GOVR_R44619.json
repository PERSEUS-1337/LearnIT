    "content": "Housing assistance for families and individuals after disasters has been provided since 1951 through various programs like the disaster loan program and Disaster Unemployment Assistance. The IHP program was established in 1974 under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The IHP program, established in 1974, provides housing and other needs assistance to families and individuals impacted by disasters. Assistance includes monetary aid for alternative housing costs, repairs, and replacements, with a maximum total assistance of $33,000 per household. Housing costs are covered by the federal government for up to 18 months under Section 408. The IHP program offers various types of assistance for housing needs after disasters, including monetary aid for rent, repairs, and temporary housing units. Assistance is tailored to individual needs, such as providing manufactured housing while repairs are being made. There is no cost limit for direct assistance with temporary housing units, which can be placed in existing mobile home parks or new sites. The IHP program provides repairs as the preferred form of assistance for housing needs after disasters, helping survivors return to familiar housing in their community. These repairs may include mitigation measures to make the house less susceptible to future damage and ensure it conforms to building codes. The program contributes towards the replacement of owner-occupied residences lost in a disaster event, but may not cover the full replacement cost. The Other Needs Assistance (ONA) program, cost-shared with the state government, provides assistance for specific needs created by a disaster's impact, such as clothing, furniture, funeral expenses, and emergency medical help. ONA funding can also be used for group flood insurance policies offered by FEMA after major flood disasters, with a $600 premium per household paid from ONA funds. The state provides household names to NFIP for group policy coverage, funded by ONA at $600 per household. Policy covers max IHP awards, lasts 36 months starting 60 days post disaster declaration. FEMA issues coverage certificates and reminds households to obtain standard flood insurance before policy expiration. Case Management Services available for assistance in accessing various forms of help. The governor of an impacted state may request Disaster Case Management (DCM) after a presidentially declared disaster with Individual Assistance. DCM provides immediate services for disaster-caused unmet needs, including technical assistance and outreach. It can also offer long-term assistance through State Grants. Assistance to individuals and households is not automatic and must be requested by the governor. The governor can request Disaster Case Management (DCM) after a presidential declaration for Individual Assistance. The request includes estimates of need based on a preliminary damage assessment (PDA), detailing factors like the cause of damage, types of homes affected, and insurance coverage. FEMA's operations manual outlines the validation criteria for Individual Assistance requests. During 2004-2013, there were 561 major disaster declarations, with 211 declarations for both Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA), 25 for IA only, and 325 for PA only. Around 40% of declarations included IA. Declarations specify areas covered and types of assistance available. For example, a major disaster declaration for South Carolina in 2015 (DR-4241-SC) is illustrated. The disaster declaration for South Carolina in 2015 (DR-4241-SC) illustrates the types of assistance provided for individual counties within a state or tribal areas. The initial county designations and any subsequent additions are published in the Federal Register. When the IA program is designated, FEMA activates the National Processing Service Centers to receive applications via phone or online. Disaster Recovery Centers may also be set up to accept applications in person for those without power or access to phone or online services. The National Processing Service Centers (NPSCs) receive applications for disaster assistance by phone or online. These centers work with disaster survivors to determine eligibility by asking questions about primary residence ownership, insurance coverage, household residents, and needed assistance. Trained operators assist applicants in Maryland, Texas, and Virginia. FEMA uses Lexis/Nexis to verify primary residences and reduce improper payments. Referrals to SBA for disaster loans can provide more resources for repairs. This dialogue can inform FEMA of additional needs and expedite the recovery process for applicants who do not qualify for a loan. The IA interview process arranges inspections of damaged properties. During inspections, FEMA verifies primary residence status, insurance information, and ONA requirements. Inspectors assess damage, discuss housing status, insurance coverage, and home ownership. Approval rates for owned homes and renters seeking FEMA aid are around 69% and 61% respectively. Managing expectations is a challenge in the disaster recovery phase, especially for aid to families and individuals. The management of expectations in aid distribution, particularly for families and individuals, is complex due to unclear aid limits and the discretionary authority of the President (delegated to FEMA) in determining housing assistance types based on cost effectiveness and convenience. The President has the authority to consider various factors in determining housing assistance types. Families and individuals can appeal program decisions. FEMA has a pilot program to negotiate with private property owners for temporary housing. Two pilot projects in Iowa and Texas showed cost-effective repairs for increased housing. Repairing seven units in Iowa cost $44,709.83. The property owner in the Cedar Valley apartment complex in Iowa received $76,854 from FEMA for monthly operating costs, saving $362,522 compared to manufactured housing. In Texas, FEMA approved $402,538 for repairing 32 units in Carelton Courtyard Apartments over 30 months. The total operating costs for the Cedar Valley apartment complex in Iowa were $76,854, saving $362,522 compared to manufactured housing. In Texas, FEMA approved $402,538 for repairing 32 units in Carelton Courtyard Apartments over 30 months, resulting in estimated savings of $1,753,266 compared to manufactured housing. The approach provides an opportunity to create temporary housing resources in disaster areas and is codified into law by the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act. The primary types of assistance provided under IHP are repairs, rental assistance, and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). The majority of assistance is given through grants for home repairs, followed by rental assistance and ONA payments. Manufactured housing is a last resort option. Assistance mainly goes to owner-occupied housing, with a significant amount spent on repairs, rental assistance, and ONA. Hurricane Katrina stands out with more funds allocated to rental assistance due to extensive damage and displacement. Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage to rental properties, leading to limited temporary housing options for survivors. Many survivors had to leave the area to find available rental units, resulting in significant rental assistance payments. In contrast, homeowners affected by disasters like Hurricane Sandy typically prefer to repair their homes and stay. FEMA established temporary housing units to help people remain in their communities after Katrina. Following Hurricane Katrina, FEMA established large mobile home parks to provide temporary housing for those wishing to stay in their communities. The use of mobile homes in 2005 was the largest operation FEMA had ever attempted, leading to issues with unsafe units due to high levels of formaldehyde. FEMA later established standards for formaldehyde levels in units. FEMA established standards for formaldehyde levels in temporary housing units after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, FEMA decided to provide manufactured homes built under HUD regulations for long-term housing. These homes include residential fire sprinkler systems for disaster survivor safety. During the Katrina recovery period, FEMA provided limited assistance to mobile home parks in rural areas without quick access to fire departments. FEMA's support now includes \"wrap around services\" such as social services, transportation, emergency healthcare, and utilities for temporary housing sites. FEMA provides various forms of disaster housing assistance, including IHP for presidentially declared disasters and SBA loans for events not declared by the President. Different tiers of assistance are available based on congressional actions, with programs like the STEP program offering essential assistance to maintain habitability. These programs can complement each other but may also cause confusion. Different disaster housing programs, including CDBG-DR, can complement IHP but may also cause confusion for applicants. Congress provides additional resources through CDBG-DR for catastrophic events, allowing states to reprogram annual CDBG funds. This supplemental assistance is not part of every disaster declaration but can be applied widely to respond to disasters. The CDBG program provides flexibility for state and local governments to address unexpected situations, including natural and man-made disasters. Additional CDBG funds through disaster supplemental appropriations (CDBG-DR) are crucial for affected states, as seen after Hurricane Sandy when funds were distributed beyond the directly affected states. The CDBG program provides flexibility for state and local governments to address unexpected situations, including natural and man-made disasters. CDBG funds from the Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriations are still available in accounts in 17 states and 17 local areas for disaster relief, recovery, infrastructure restoration, housing, and economic revitalization. The CDBG program provides flexibility for state and local governments to address disasters. CDBG funds have been used for mitigation projects and to assist low-income residents with housing needs. However, CDBG-DR assistance is not available for every disaster, and smaller disasters could benefit from this federal help. The Administration's budget request for FY2017 includes a proposal to address this issue. The Administration's budget request for FY2017 includes a proposal to consolidate administrative funds for HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) to enhance the usefulness of remaining funds for disaster work. This proposal aims to address the limited capacity of CPD's internal management structures to handle the unpredictable scope of CDBG-DR supplemental appropriations. The Administration's budget request for FY2017 proposes consolidating administrative funds for HUD's CPD to improve disaster response capabilities. Extending the availability of funds beyond September 30, 2017, will allow for better program management and reprogramming of CDBG funds for disaster response. This could lead to a more reliable and equitable approach for all disaster declarations. The discussion suggests setting aside a pool of CDBG funds for major disaster declarations to enhance housing options. Group Flood Insurance policies could be linked to FEMA programs or HUD's CDBG program to help vulnerable households. Some social service groups propose extending policies to help low-income households with flood insurance. Catholic Charities USA urged FEMA to develop mechanisms for maintaining policies for disaster-affected individuals who cannot afford insurance. The maximum assistance for individuals under the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 was $25,000, now adjusted to $33,000. Congress may consider further extensions. The maximum assistance for individuals under the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 has grown to $33,000. Congress may consider if this amount is sufficient for post-disaster help. FEMA does not deduct the cost of a manufactured housing unit from the assistance limit. Increasing the amount could boost the local economy and aid in replacing damaged private residences. A larger award could help households comply with flood insurance requirements after a major disaster. The Sheltering and Temporary Essential Power (STEP) program, similar to CDBG, assists homeowners with essential repairs to restore power, heat, and hot water. This program allows residents to safely shelter-in-place while awaiting more permanent repairs. The STEP program, funded under Section 403 of the Stafford Act, provides significant home repair spending after disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. It offers immediate repairs to thousands of units, such as in New York City after Sandy, at a cost exceeding $466 million. This assistance may be sufficient for some households, but they remain eligible for additional aid under the IHP program if needed. The STEP program, funded under the Stafford Act, provides home repair assistance after disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. FEMA's IG reported favorably on the program during Sandy, and it could be scaled for use in disasters of all sizes. FEMA needs strong internal controls to ensure the program's success in saving lives and protecting property. The STEP program, funded under the Stafford Act, provides home repair assistance after disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes. FEMA needs strong internal controls to ensure program success in saving lives, protecting property, and addressing vulnerabilities in implementing pilot programs. The program can also assist owners of large buildings, addressing issues raised post-Hurricane Sandy regarding FEMA's treatment of condos and co-ops. Assistance for condo or co-op residents under the IHP program is limited due to complications in addressing common areas, which the 403 Essential Assistance program could potentially address. FEMA's policy guidance directs how to handle common areas in these buildings. FEMA's policy guidance states that common areas in buildings must be used for common purposes to be eligible for assistance. Condo associations limiting facility use to members are ineligible for FEMA aid, leading to ongoing discussions for potential solutions. Proposed legislation aims to address this issue, as FEMA assistance can be quickly available. FEMA assistance can be available swiftly, with applications reviewed and services beginning quickly. SBA disaster declaration can lead to larger home loans than IHP caps. CDBG-DR funds availability depends on congressional action, but CDBG grantees can reprogram funds for health and safety threats. The arrival of supplemental CDBG funds may be delayed after homeowners receive IHP assistance and make decisions on SBA loans, leading to potential conflicts if homeowners later qualify for CDBG grants. CDBG grants prioritize low-income families but can be adjusted for middle-income populations in large disasters. The role of states in disaster housing, as administered by FEMA, is limited. States do not contribute to disaster housing costs or assist in establishing temporary housing communities. Unlike other programs, states have a 25% cost-share for grants to families and individuals from the ONA program. The states work with FEMA regions to determine ONA grants after a disaster declaration. Congress may consider increased state involvement for better disaster recovery. Recent FEMA initiatives promote state participation in disaster recovery, including a proposal for a PA Deductible. This encourages states to establish programs and commit to the recovery process. The FEMA narrative emphasizes community engagement in emergency management to identify needs and resources efficiently. A Disaster Deductible proposal aims to incentivize proactive fiscal planning by states for disaster response and recovery. The availability of credits toward the deductible could incentivize increased planning and adoption of specific mitigation activities for disaster response and recovery. States may be encouraged to develop special programs, such as emergency management and individual assistance programs, which could be credited toward the deductible. Congress may consider greater state involvement in FEMA's disaster housing program to improve overall program effectiveness. The history of disaster housing has been focused on short-term missions, with limited resources and insufficient comprehensive approaches. Recent efforts have been made to address longer-term housing needs. In recent years, Congress has taken steps to improve temporary housing programs for disaster survivors, including authorizing Case Management Services and increasing FEMA's housing resources. FEMA has also implemented initiatives such as improved manufactured housing and wrap-around services. The combination of IHP, HUD's CDBG-DR program, and SBA disaster loans can provide various types of assistance tailored to individual needs after large disasters. However, the availability of such help in every declared disaster is not guaranteed. Improved communication by FEMA and its state partners is crucial to address remaining challenges in disaster housing assistance. Increased communication by FEMA and state partners is crucial to manage expectations regarding disaster assistance. Creating a culture of preparedness is important to emphasize that IHP assistance is limited and should not replace insurance coverage. While the IHP program is available for those without resources, individuals should prioritize insurance and mitigation measures for their own recovery. This would reduce the reliance on the IHP program and result in safer, more resilient communities. Prioritizing insurance and mitigation measures over IHP assistance would lead to safer and more resilient communities during disasters."
