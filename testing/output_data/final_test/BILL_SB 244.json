    "title": "SB 244",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 798.88 of the Civil Code allows for the enforcement of reasonable rules and regulations in mobilehome parks. Violators may be subject to injunctions. A petition for an injunction against violations of mobilehome park rules can be filed by the management in the superior court. A temporary restraining order may be granted if there is reasonable proof of a violation causing harm. A temporary restraining order can be granted if there is proof of a violation, and it must be personally served to the respondent. The order remains in effect for up to 15 days, with a hearing scheduled within that time frame. If a violation is proven by clear and convincing evidence, an injunction can be issued for up to three years. The management of a mobilehome park may petition for a new injunction if there are recurring violations or a threat of future violations. Legal counsel or self-representation is allowed in actions under this section. The remedy provided is nonexclusive and does not limit the park's rights to terminate a tenancy. Section 798.88 of the Civil Code is repealed, and Section 85 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended. An action or special proceeding is considered a limited civil case if the amount in controversy is under $25,000 and the relief sought is appropriate for a limited civil case. The relief sought in a limited civil case must be exclusively of a type described in specific statutes, including sections of the Civil Code and Food and Agricultural Code. Section 85 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as added by Section 4 of Chapter 99 of the Statutes of 2012, is repealed."
