    "content": "In FY2007, appropriations for EPA's clean water programs were being considered but not finalized. The President's budget requested $687.6 million for clean water state revolving funds, 22% less than the previous year. The House and Senate approved the funding level, but final action was delayed until the next Congress. In 2003, EPA revised rules for waste discharges from large animal feeding operations, which faced challenges from multiple parties. In 2005, revised rules for waste discharges from large animal feeding operations were challenged in court. The court upheld major parts of the rules, vacated others, and remanded some parts to EPA for clarification. In response, EPA proposed revisions to the rules in June 2006 and expects to finalize them by June 2007. Congress also enacted legislation providing a permanent exemption from stormwater runoff rules for oil and gas companies. EPA implemented this provision in June 2006. The Clean Water Act is the principal law regulating pollution in the nation's waters. The Clean Water Act, enacted in 1948 and revised in 1972, 1977, 1981, and 1987, aims to improve water quality by imposing regulations on industries and cities to reduce pollutant discharge. It also provides federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment construction. Industries must use Best Practicable Technology and later Best Available Technology to meet pollution control limits, while cities must achieve secondary treatment of municipal wastewater. The Clean Water Act of 1987 aimed to improve water quality by requiring cities to achieve secondary treatment of municipal wastewater. The Environmental Protection Agency administers the program, with state and local governments responsible for implementation. The 1987 amendments were the most comprehensive since 1972, addressing persistent water quality problems and establishing a program for controlling toxic pollutant discharges. The Clean Water Act of 1987 aimed to improve water quality by requiring cities to achieve secondary treatment of municipal wastewater. The 1987 amendments added programs to control toxic pollutant discharges, address nonpoint sources of pollution, provide $18 billion for wastewater treatment assistance, and revise regulatory and enforcement programs. Congressional oversight of water quality issues was limited after the enactment of these amendments. The Clean Water Act of 1987 focused on improving water quality through various provisions. Implementation issues, such as toxic pollutant control, nonpoint pollution management, and state revolving fund provisions, have been key areas of concern. Attention has also been on the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of clean water requirements. These issues have led to discussions on reauthorizing the Clean Water Act. During the 103rd Congress, discussions on reauthorizing the Clean Water Act led to the introduction of legislation in 1994. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported a reauthorization bill, S. 2093, but controversies and regulatory relief issues stalled progress. In the 104th Congress, the House approved a comprehensive reauthorization bill in 1995 (H.R. 961), which aimed to amend regulatory provisions, require new risk assessment procedures, and increase flexibility with regulatory relief. However, the Senate did not address the Clean Water Act during this time. In the 105th Congress, no major committee activity occurred regarding the Clean Water Act. Attention has focused on individual program areas, with no comprehensive reauthorization legislation introduced. Bills addressing specific water quality issues were passed, including strengthening protection of coastal recreation waters and reauthorizing existing CWA programs. In the 107th and 108th Congress, legislation was passed to address water quality issues, including funding for wet weather sewerage projects and remediation of sediment contamination in the Great Lakes. Attention also shifted to security and protection of the nation's water infrastructure after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Policymakers are considering legislative options for enhancing security at wastewater treatment plants, including physical security measures and coordination efforts. In the 108th Congress, a bill was passed in the House for $200 million in grants for security activities at these plants, but no further action was taken. The issue resurfaced in the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress addressed the ongoing water quality issues despite progress made in restoring rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. EPA reported that a significant percentage of assessed river and stream miles and lake acres do not meet water quality standards due to various sources of pollution. The Bush Administration has been reviewing clean water policies. The Bush Administration has been reviewing clean water policies and proposed a Water Quality Trading Policy in January 2003 to assist industry and municipalities in meeting Clean Water Act obligations. Water quality trading projects have been ongoing in the United States since the early 1980s. Congressional oversight has been extensive, covering various aspects of the Clean Water Act implementation. The 110th Congress is expected to pursue vigorous oversight of clean water and environmental programs, including wetlands protection and regulatory efforts. Meeting the nation's wastewater infrastructure needs is crucial for achieving Clean Water Act objectives. Congress has provided over $76 billion for wastewater treatment construction since 1972, but an additional $181 billion is needed nationwide for eligible projects. According to a Gap Analysis study by the EPA, the United States needs $390 billion over the next two decades to replace and build wastewater infrastructure. An additional $148 billion is needed for operation and maintenance. Without increased investment, there will be a $6 billion gap in annual capital expenditures for wastewater treatment. The 1987 amendments to the act addressed the federal role in assisting states and cities with wastewater infrastructure funding. It extended grants for sewage treatment projects and introduced a program for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds. States are required to deposit at least 20% of the federal grant into the fund. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) were established under Title VI of the Clean Water Act in 1987 to provide ongoing financing for wastewater treatment construction. The funds operate on a revolving concept where loan repayments from recipients are recycled for future projects. Despite some early funding and administrative issues, most states believe the SRFs are working well. The federal contributions were intended to help transition to full state and local financing by FY1995. SRF monies can be used for various financial activities, including loans for up to 100% of project costs at market interest rates or below, and to refinance cities' debt. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) were established under Title VI of the Clean Water Act in 1987 to provide ongoing financing for wastewater treatment construction. SRF monies can be used for various financial activities, including loans for up to 100% of project costs at market interest rates or below, and to refinance cities' debt. SRF monies may also be used to provide loan guarantees or credit enhancement for localities. Table 1 summarizes wastewater treatment funding under Title II (traditional grants program) and Title VI (capitalization grants for revolving loan programs). One issue of continuing interest is impacts on small communities struggling to participate in the SRF loan program. Small towns face challenges in participating in the SRF loan program due to limited resources and high capital needs. Congress is exploring options like a grant program or special loan rules to address this issue. Despite some criticism, the SRF program is generally well-supported, with a focus on helping small communities and funding high-cost projects like sewer overflows. The addition of Section 319 to the Clean Water Act in 1987 aimed to address nonpoint sources of pollution, such as runoff from various sources like farms, urban areas, construction sites, forestry, and mining sites. This was a response to the increasing importance of controlling nonpoint sources as industrial and municipal sources of pollution decreased. The addition of Section 319 to the Clean Water Act in 1987 aimed to strengthen laws regarding nonpoint source pollution. Critics argue the voluntary nature of the program lacks enforcement, while others believe regulating individual land management decisions is challenging. States were required to identify and manage pollution from runoff, with federal grants covering up to 60% of implementation costs. The Section 319 program under the Clean Water Act provides funding for states to implement nonpoint pollution controls. States are urged to use a portion of their funds from water quality program assistance grants for nonpoint source activities, but this diverts money from core state efforts. Concerns have been raised about the comprehensiveness of state plans in addressing nonpoint pollution issues, with criticism towards EPA for inadequate guidance on control methods. Some believe states should repeat nonpoint source assessments to reflect improvements in information. Cost estimates for managing nonpoint source pollution vary due to site-specific issues. In 1994, EPA estimated current spending at $750 million to $1.1 billion annually. Adequate funding is crucial for implementing state management plans to control nonpoint source pollution, especially from agricultural activities. Agricultural activities are a significant source of nonpoint pollution nationwide. Questions have been raised about the efficacy of the EPA state grant program and proposed reductions in appropriations for Section 319 funds. The White House Office of Management and Budget found that EPA had not demonstrated results under the program and urged a shift towards implementing plans in impaired waters. State officials are concerned about OMB's understanding of the extent to which Section 319 funds address nonpoint pollution control needs beyond agriculture. EPA and states negotiated changes in the mid-1990s to give states more flexibility in the 319 program. In 1996, EPA issued revised guidance for the 319 program to streamline federal and state processes, increase effectiveness, and address nonpoint pollution. States meeting nine criteria can be designated as leadership states, eligible for incentives like multi-year grants and reduced reporting requirements. This contrasts with the previous competitive grant approach. The EPA revised guidance for the 319 program in 1996 to streamline processes and address nonpoint pollution. Grants were awarded based on meeting specific requirements, with a focus on TMDLs for nonpoint pollution sources. EPA linked Section 319 implementation with TMDL activities, but faced criticism for being too restrictive, leading to modifications in 2002. In August 2002, EPA modified guidance for the Section 319 program to encourage development of nonpoint source TMDLs with more state flexibility. $100 million annually is allocated for nonpoint source TMDLs since FY2001. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires states to identify impaired water segments and develop TMDLs to control pollution levels. The EPA modified guidance for the Section 319 program in 2002 to encourage nonpoint source TMDL development with state flexibility. States must identify impaired water segments and develop TMDLs to control pollution levels under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Many states lack resources for TMDL analyses, leading to little implementation of the provision enacted in 1972. Controversy persists over the program's implementation and efforts to revise its rules and requirements, with lawsuits filed against EPA and states for noncompliance. In response to lawsuits against the EPA and states for noncompliance with the Clean Water Act, court orders have required the EPA to develop TMDLs quickly. Concerns have been raised about diverting resources from other water quality activities. In 1996, an advisory committee was created to address the TMDL problem, leading to proposed program changes in 1999. The proposal aimed to establish criteria for identifying impaired waters and developing TMDLs within 15 years, with more comprehensive assessments and cleanup plans. The proposal faced controversy due to potential burdens on states and impacts on agriculture. The controversies surrounding the revised TMDL program led to congressional hearings and pressure on EPA to revise or withdraw the proposal. Despite several bills introduced to modify the TMDL proposals, none were enacted. In July 2000, Congress approved a bill preventing EPA from finalizing or implementing new TMDL rules for FY2000 and FY2001. President Clinton signed the bill, despite the Administration's opposition. The EPA Administrator signed new TMDL rules before the President signed the bill, delaying the effective date until October 2001. The FY2001 appropriations act mandated studies by the National Academy of Sciences and EPA on the scientific basis and costs of implementing the revised TMDL rules. The NAS report recommended moving forward with the TMDL program using adaptive implementation. In June 2001, a House Transportation subcommittee held a hearing on the NAS report recommending adaptive implementation for the TMDL program. EPA estimated annual costs for TMDL development to be $63-$69 million, with implementation costs for pollutant sources ranging from $900 million to $4.3 billion per year. Inconsistent monitoring and data collection by states have hindered efforts to identify impaired waters. The Bush Administration delayed the effective date of the 2000 TMDL rule until April 30, 2003, for further review. EPA withdrew the rule in March 2003 to decide on revisions, citing the need for additional time. Various interest groups had sued EPA over parts of the TMDL rule. The 2000 TMDL rule was delayed by the Bush Administration for further review, and eventually withdrawn by EPA in March 2003. Current program requirements from 1992 and court-sanctioned TMDL schedules remain in place. EPA has considered other options, including a new rule, but no specific plans have been announced. Environmentalists suggest leaving the 1992 rules in place as the best course of action. Despite flaws, the 1992 rules are preferred over a new rule that could weaken the Clean Water Act program. States, cities, and industry groups want a new rule with more flexibility. EPA has struggled since the 1970s to regulate stormwater discharges effectively. Congress set deadlines for EPA to require permits for stormwater discharges, leading to rules issued in November 1990. The EPA issued stormwater permits for industries, municipalities, and construction sites larger than 5 acres. Rules for smaller dischargers were developed in 1999. Compliance with the rules remains a challenge for many industries and municipalities, especially small cities. EPA proposed a two-year extension for small oil and gas construction sites to comply with stormwater permit rules. The EPA proposed a two-year extension for small oil and gas construction sites to comply with stormwater permit rules. Congress enacted a permanent exemption for oil and gas companies from stormwater runoff rules, citing costly permitting requirements for short construction periods with little potential for pollution. Congress passed the conference report on H.R. 6 in July 2005, including the oil and gas stormwater provision. President Bush signed it into law on August 8 (P.L. 109-58). In June 2006, EPA promulgated a rule to conform the CWA to these provisions. 772 municipalities have combined sewers serving approximately 40 million persons, mainly in older urban and coastal cities. Combined sewer systems can be part of a city's water pollution control infrastructure but can lead to combined sewer overflow (CSO) during heavy rain or snowmelt, causing untreated sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater to be discharged into receiving waters. EPA issued a CSO permitting strategy in 1994, requiring cities to implement nine minimum controls by January 1, 1997 to address this issue. The EPA strategy issued in 1994 required cities to implement controls by January 1, 1997 to address combined sewer overflow (CSO) issues. Controls include management techniques and structural measures. EPA officials noted in 1998 that only half of cities with combined sewers had implemented the minimum measures. EPA is now working with states to remind cities of their obligations, but formal enforcement is not planned. Some cities are facing overflows from municipal separate systems. A recent issue in some cities is the problem of overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers (SSOs) that transport only sanitary wastes. Discharges of untreated sewage from these sewers occur from manholes, broken pipes, and deteriorated infrastructure, and can happen in wet or dry weather. EPA estimates that about 18,000 municipalities have separate sanitary sewers that can experience overflows. In 2001, the Clinton Administration finalized regulations to improve the operation of these sewer systems and reduce the frequency of overflows. The Clinton Administration proposed regulations to address overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers (SSOs) and clarify enforcement actions. Funding for Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) and SSO projects is a major concern, with estimates of $51 billion needed for CSOs and $88.5 billion for SSOs. Congress passed the Wet Weather Water Quality Act in 2000, authorizing a $1.5 billion grant program to reduce wet weather flows from sewer systems. The CSO policy on sewer overflows was not funded by Congress for two years. Debate on wetlands focuses on effectiveness and costs of protection efforts. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act protects wetlands, but critics say it's inadequate. Developers argue laws already intrude on land use decisions. Protection of wetlands and regulation of activities in wetlands are key issues. The protection of wetlands and regulation of activities in wetlands have become contentious environmental policy issues facing Congress. Recent legislative activity on Section 404 has been limited, with committee hearings focusing on issues arising from judicial decisions and implementation of current law. The 2001 Supreme Court case SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been a key point of discussion, with varying interpretations by federal courts. On February 21, 2006, the Supreme Court heard arguments in cases brought by landowners seeking to narrow the scope of the Section 404 permit program. The Court's ruling in Rapanos v. United States was issued on June 19, with a 5-4 decision led by Justice Scalia. The ruling vacated lower court decisions and remanded the cases for further consideration, but the implications of the ruling are unclear. The Supreme Court's ruling in Rapanos v. United States on the scope of the Section 404 permit program is unclear, leading to more case-by-case determinations and potential litigation. There is pressure on the Corps and EPA to clarify issues through rulemaking, with a hearing held by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. EPA and the Corps issued guidance in 2003, but new guidance is urged following the Court's ruling. The agencies received over 130,000 public comments on possible rule changes in response to legal decisions. In December 2003, EPA and the Corps announced they would not pursue rule changes concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands to avoid a contentious debate. Environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the decision. Interest groups have criticized confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance on wetland rules. Environmentalists are worried about reduced protection, while developers argue for a new rule to avoid contradictory interpretations. EPA reports highlight agricultural activities as a major contributor to water quality impairments, with animal feeding operations drawing increased attention for their environmental impacts. Animal waste from livestock feeding facilities can pose risks to water quality and public health by contributing pollutants like nutrients, sediment, pathogens, and ammonia to the environment. In 1999, EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture started a national strategy to improve compliance and regulations for confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to control adverse environmental impacts. Compliance with discharge permits for CAFOs was poor, with less than one-third of facilities having permits, and regulations were deemed outdated. In December 2000, EPA proposed a rule to increase the number of AFOs required to obtain CWA permits and restrict land application of animal wastes. Congress addressed impacts and costs on the agricultural sector, especially small farmers, and the 1999 National AFO Strategy's measures to control agricultural runoff. On December 15, 2002, the EPA Administrator signed a final revised rule to regulate waste discharges from CAFOs, modifying the 2000 proposal. The final rule on waste discharges from CAFOs retains much of the existing structure but includes new requirements for nutrient management plans. EPA estimates 15,500 CAFOs will be regulated with an annual compliance cost of $335 million. Farm groups find the regulations workable, while environmental groups criticize them for not adequately addressing animal waste runoff issues. A GAO report suggests EPA needs to increase oversight of state regulatory programs for effective implementation. In February 2005, a federal court ruled on challenges to the CAFO rule, upholding major parts but also favoring industry and environmental challenges. The court remanded the rule to EPA, overturning the \"duty to apply\" requirement for permits and addressing inadequacies in environmental concerns. The federal court rejected parts of the CAFO rule challenged by environmentalists as inadequate, including regulatory review of permits, nutrient management plans in permits, and public participation requirements. EPA was directed to clarify technical aspects of the 2003 regulations. In response, EPA proposed revisions to the CAFO rules in June 2006, with expected promulgation by June 2007. Funding questions for clean water SRF capitalization grants have continued to arise, with the President's FY2007 budget requesting $687.6 million, 22% less than FY2006 and 37% below FY2005 levels. The Administration proposed no funding for congressionally designated water infrastructure grants but sought $40.6 million for priority projects in Puerto Rico, Alaska Native villages, and the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates of the SRF program argued that cuts would hinder municipal wastewater treatment projects. State environmental officials criticized the budget for unfairly targeting state and local environmental grants. The House and Senate approved $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants in H.R. 5386. The House and Senate approved $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants in H.R. 5386, with the same funding level reported in S.Rept. 109-275. Final action was delayed until early 2007, with significant amounts allocated for clean water grants and congressionally earmarked water infrastructure projects. The House bill included funds for cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes, Section 319 grants, and Section 106 state program administration grants. The House approved an amendment to block EPA from implementing controversial 2003 policy guidance on Clean Water Act jurisdiction over isolated streams and wetlands. The House approved an amendment to block EPA from implementing controversial 2003 policy guidance on Clean Water Act jurisdiction over isolated streams and wetlands. The amendment goes beyond what the Supreme Court required in SWANCC, leaving many streams and wetlands unprotected from development. Critics argue that the amendment has been confusing and will make regulating activities affecting wetlands more difficult for EPA and the Corps. Congress had not completed action on appropriations legislation to fund EPA by the end of the 109th Congress, leading to a continuing resolution until February 15, 2007. The House and Senate approved legislation for FY2006 EPA appropriations (H.R. 2361, H.Rept. 109-188), signed into law by President Bush on August 2 (P.L. 109-54). The bill included $900 million for clean water SRF grants, $170 million more than requested by the President. The Administration had requested $730 million for SRF grants in FY2006, citing cuts due to Congress exceeding funding levels in FY2005. The White House planned to invest $6.8 billion in the clean water SRF program between FY2004 and FY2011, with federal funding ending thereafter. The FY2006 EPA appropriations bill included $900 million for clean water SRF grants, exceeding the President's request. Congress also provided $285 million for 259 earmarked special projects, despite a slight reduction due to rescission measures. State and local officials raised concerns about reductions in SRF funding impacting clean water goals. The President's budget did not allocate funds for congressionally earmarked water infrastructure projects but sought $70 million for U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Native Villages projects. The FY2006 EPA appropriations bill included $900 million for clean water SRF grants, exceeding the President's request. Congress also provided $285 million for 259 earmarked special projects, despite a slight reduction due to rescission measures. The final FY2006 appropriations for clean water SRF grants is $886.8 million, with $280.8 million for earmarked water infrastructure project grants. The President's budget included increases for some water quality programs, such as cleanup of Great Lakes contaminated sediment. The FY2006 EPA appropriations bill provided $900 million for clean water SRF grants, exceeding the President's request. Congress also allocated $285 million for 259 earmarked special projects. The bill included funding for cleanup of Great Lakes contaminated sediment and endorsed the Administration's request to not fund Water Quality Cooperative Agreement grants. Additionally, the bill prohibited EPA from finalizing or implementing a draft policy on sewage blending by municipal wastewater treatment plants.
