The country imports almost three-quarters of its energy needs, making it highly dependent on other countries. India's annual projected growth rate is 7.5%, and it has the potential to overtake the United States as the world's second-largest economy by 2050 in terms of purchasing power parity. Natural gas currently makes up 7% of India's total energy consumption. India is focusing on increasing its natural gas consumption, currently at 7% of total energy usage. Policy initiatives like HELP and infrastructure investments aim to boost this percentage. Forecasts predict a 6% annual growth in natural gas demand over the next five years in India, driven by domestic production and falling LNG prices. India is increasing its natural gas consumption, with a focus on building energy infrastructure to reverse recent declines. The Government of India aims to address the drop in domestic production by increasing LNG imports. India is growing as a natural gas importer but remains a minor player in global production. India is the 14th largest consumer of natural gas in the world, with consumption coming from domestically produced and imported LNG. It is the 5th largest importer of LNG globally and is expected to grow with the construction of more import terminals. India is seen as a key strategic partner by the United States in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. India's relationship with the United States on energy issues has grown closer in recent years, with the U.S. expanding technical assistance programs to help India meet its carbon emission reduction goals. Indian energy companies have signed contracts to import U.S. LNG. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown a strong interest in modernizing India's energy supply, particularly in Gujarat, eventually bringing electricity to all villages in the state. Modi's party, with the first parliamentary majority in 30 years, has enacted policy changes for a reliable energy supply. This includes loosening offshore exploration regulations and providing subsidies for fertilizer plants to purchase natural gas affordably. Congress has shown interest in enhancing energy cooperation between the U.S. and India. India's natural gas plans have implications for U.S. natural gas exports, energy investments in India, Indian investment in the U.S. energy sector, and India's energy self-sufficiency. India has made investments in its energy sector and has the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The country has political and economic relationships with regions like the Middle East and Central Asia. Foreign and domestic private companies are allowed to explore for oil and natural gas through joint ventures and foreign direct investment. The Indian government liberalized the gas industry to attract foreign investment through policies like NELP and HELP. The Modi government introduced HELP in 2016 to boost domestic oil and gas production, attract major investments, and create more jobs. This new policy aims to provide uniform standards for exploration and production, streamline revenue sharing, and encourage foreign companies to invest in the sector. The Indian government introduced the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016 to attract foreign investment in the gas industry. Despite reforms, more energy policy guidance is needed from the government to improve natural gas access and consumption. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas oversees 11 public sector undertakings focused on petroleum and natural gas production. The Indian government introduced the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) in 2016 to attract foreign investment in the gas industry. The Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell periodically revises natural gas prices under guidelines set in 2014. India's domestic natural gas production is mainly handled by state-owned and private companies like ONGC, Oil India Limited (OIL), and Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL). ONGC and OIL were responsible for three-fourths of India's total domestic natural gas production in 2015-2016. India's largest commercial marketer and distributor of natural gas is Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL). The government has promoted joint ventures like Petronet, formed by GAIL, ONGC, IOC, and BPCL, which is now a major player in India's LNG market. GAIL also agreed to buy LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass plant. India has private companies like Reliance Industries expanding into natural gas production. Reliance Industries, a Fortune Global 500 company and the largest private sector company in India, has invested in U.S. shale gas projects with Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron. India's 12th five-year plan aims to rely on coal for the majority of its electrical power supply, with plans to shift towards nuclear and renewables after 2030. India's 12th five-year plan focuses on coal as the primary energy source for electricity generation, with a marginal role for natural gas. The government aims to reduce its direct involvement in oil and natural gas contract administration through the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), making it easier for foreign companies to extract offshore resources. The first round of bidding for offshore drilling blocks is ongoing, with the 13th five-year plan expected to be published in 2017. India-U.S. energy relations have strengthened with initiatives like the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE) launched in 2009. The U.S. Department of Energy committed $25 million to support the U.S.-India Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Center (JCERDC), with an additional $50 million pledged by the Indian Ministry of Science and Technology. PACE was expanded in 2015, and in 2016, the first nine recipients of off-grid innovation funding were announced. The Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) and the U.S. Department of State signed an MOU to expand cooperation on India's shale gas resources. The U.S. shared experience and best practices through the Unconventional Gas Technical Engagement Program. A research partnership discovered significant natural gas hydrates in the Bay of Bengal, but current technology makes production uneconomic. Indian companies are investing in U.S. gas projects for technical expertise. Indian companies are investing in U.S. gas projects to improve technical expertise for potential shale oil and gas sites in India. U.S. natural gas reserves exceed India's, with coal dominating energy use in India. Demand for natural gas is expected to grow, but infrastructure limitations hinder consumption. India's domestic consumption of natural gas is dominated by various industries, with initiatives in place to make imported LNG more attractive. The government aims to reduce dependency on crude oil by increasing natural gas consumption, especially in the power and fertilizer sectors. India aims to reduce dependency on crude oil by increasing natural gas consumption, with the fifth-largest natural gas vehicle fleet in the world. The IEA predicts India will have the third-highest growth in natural gas vehicles by 2040. Companies like Petronet and IOC are experimenting with integrating natural gas into the transport industry, such as running long-haul buses on LNG. Natural gas consumption varies widely by region, with Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh consuming over 65% of India's natural gas. The government is supporting initiatives to balance distribution and consumption of natural gas across the country. India's natural gas usage is hindered by infrastructure limitations, particularly the lack of pipelines for distribution. Currently, India has 15,000 km of domestic natural gas pipelines, with plans to construct an additional 15,000 km. In comparison, the United States has a much larger pipeline network. India also lacks distribution pipelines to reach residential consumers. The government is working to address these shortcomings and aims to connect 10 million rural communities to low-carbon fuel sources in the next three years. The Government of India plans to connect 10 million rural households to the growing piped natural gas (PNG) network over the next three years, tripling the current number of connected households. Additionally, the Ujjwala welfare program aims to provide 50 million Indian families with free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections in the next five years to reduce in-home burning of wood and oil. India faces environmental challenges from climate change and local pollution despite low energy consumption per capita due to widespread poverty. India faces major environmental challenges from climate change and local pollution, primarily due to its heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation and increasing vehicular traffic and industrial activities. Despite being initially viewed as recalcitrant during the Paris Climate negotiations in 2015, India committed to reducing carbon intensity by 33-35% of GDP from 2005 levels by 2030. The government also aims to generate 40% of power from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, although currently only 7% of electricity comes from non-fossil fuels. Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change has mandated new regulations for power generation. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change has mandated stricter emissions limits for power plants starting in January 2017, favoring natural gas-fired generation and renewables. India aims to meet its INDC goals with $2.5 trillion over 15 years, facing challenges in financing. Initiatives like the issuance of \"Green Bonds\" by YES BANK in 2015 are examples of creative financing schemes to support sustainable development. The Government of India introduced a new natural gas pricing formula in October 2014, linked to international market prices. This scheme aims to balance prices for domestic gas consumers but has faced criticism from gas-producing companies for not providing enough financial incentives for investment in exploration and production. The price of natural gas in India is determined biannually by a weighted average of international gas prices. The government also controls the distribution of domestically produced gas through its Gas Utilisation Policy. The Indian government introduced a new natural gas pricing formula in 2014, linked to international market prices. It aims to balance prices for domestic consumers but has faced criticism for not incentivizing investment in exploration. The government controls the distribution of domestically produced gas through its Gas Utilisation Policy, prioritizing certain sectors before general public sale. Proposals have been made to combine imported LNG with domestic gas to increase accessibility and consumption in the power sector. In 2016, the Modi government proposed creating an Indian natural gas hub to make allocation more efficient and decrease political influence over trade. India plans to invest $20 billion in developing offshore deepwater natural gas potential over the next five to seven years. Despite discussions of importing natural gas via pipelines from Turkmenistan, Iran, and Russia, challenges remain. India is a significant market for LNG due to falling prices. India has emerged as a major market for LNG due to falling prices, with potential for shale gas to play a larger role in the country's energy future. Despite having significant shale gas resources, commercial production has not yet begun in India due to challenges such as land use, water availability, and community acceptance. The government has assigned rights to exploit shale gas to national oil companies and opened it to private investment under the NELP X licensing program in 2014. India's offshore territory holds potential for new gas discoveries, with larger findings expected offshore. Only 3,000 wells have been drilled in India's offshore basins, lagging behind the US Gulf of Mexico. The Krishna-Godavari basin has been a key area for natural gas extraction, with the KG-D6 reservoir discovered in 2002. However, technical challenges and high development costs have deterred investors, leading to a more pessimistic outlook for offshore production in India. The KG-D6 project in India's offshore territory has faced challenges such as high development costs and extraction issues, leading to a pessimistic outlook for investors. However, recent signals from the Modi government have sparked optimism, with BP and Reliance Industries planning to increase natural gas production. The new HELP policy aims to remove bureaucratic barriers by allowing companies to choose narrower exploration blocks and combining all extraction under one license, while also providing incentives for exploiting offshore resources based on geological difficulty. India has introduced a graded system of royalty rates to incentivize offshore resource exploitation, making profits more lucrative for energy companies. By 2015, India became the world's fifth-largest LNG importer, importing 21.7 billion cubic meters from various countries. In 2016, India received its first LNG shipments from the United States, indicating a growing demand for LNG in the country. India's rising demand for LNG is likely to be met by additional U.S. natural gas supply in the future. GAIL has secured 50% of the capacity at the Cove Point LNG facility in Maryland. India's domestic natural gas production peaked in 2010 and has been declining annually since then. The country's consumption of natural gas has also decreased, but not as rapidly as production. LNG imports have been increasing as a percentage of consumption due to cheap global supplies and improved import capabilities. Indian companies like Petronet have benefited from the increased bargaining power of consumers in the natural gas market. India's proximity to major gas producers in the Middle East and Australia allows for favorable renegotiation of long-term contracts with companies like Qatar's RasGas. Despite abundant global LNG supplies, it remains too expensive to replace coal in electricity generation. India needs to improve existing infrastructure and build new facilities to increase reliance on natural gas. With four operational LNG terminals in 2016, India's import capacity could reach 41 BCM by 2019 if all proposed terminals are built, improving access along the eastern seaboard. India's access to natural gas along the eastern seaboard could be enhanced by international pipelines like TAPI, IPI, and the Russia-India pipeline. TAPI, supported by the US, faces obstacles in Pakistan, while the prospects for the IPI pipeline have improved with the loosening of sanctions on Iran's oil and gas industry. The IPI pipeline's prospects in Iran's oil and gas industry seemed to improve, but in 2016, Iran's ambassador to India declared the project dead due to lack of investments in India's LNG infrastructure and anticipated opposition from the US. India and Russia then agreed on a costly pipeline from Siberia, leading to exploration of a gas swapping scheme involving China and Burma."
