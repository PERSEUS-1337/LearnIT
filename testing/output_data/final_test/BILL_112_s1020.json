    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Savings Enhancement by Alleviating Leakage in 401(k) Savings Act of 2011\" or the \"SEAL 401(k) Savings Act.\" It includes provisions for an extended rollover period for the rollover of plan loan offset amounts in certain cases. The \"SEAL 401(k) Savings Act\" allows for an extended rollover period for plan loan offset amounts in certain cases. This amendment specifies that a qualified plan loan offset amount is not subject to transfer restrictions after the tax return due date for the year it is treated as distributed from an employer plan. A qualified plan loan offset amount is distributed from a qualified employer plan to a participant or beneficiary due to the termination of the plan or failure to meet loan repayment terms upon separation from service. The term 'plan loan offset amount' refers to the reduction in a participant's accrued benefit under a qualified employer plan to repay a loan from the plan. This provision does not apply unless the loan is not subject to section 72(p)(1) due to section 72(p)(2). The amendments made by this section apply to transfers made after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury will modify Treasury Regulation to allow hardship distributions and make necessary changes to comply with the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, qualified employer plans are prohibited from making loans through credit cards and similar arrangements. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to prohibit loans from qualified employer plans through credit cards or similar arrangements. This change will apply to plan years starting 60 days after the enactment of the Act. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to limit the number of loans from a plan to a participant or beneficiary to 3. This change applies to loans made after 1 year from the enactment of the Act."
