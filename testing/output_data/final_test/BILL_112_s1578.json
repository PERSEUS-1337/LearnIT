    "content": "The Act titled \"End Unnecessary Mailers Act of 2011\" requires consumer confidence reports from community water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to specify the method of delivering consumer confidence reports from community water systems, including mailing requirements for violations of maximum contaminant levels. The regulations require community water systems to mail consumer confidence reports to customers if a violation of maximum contaminant levels has occurred during the year. If no violations have occurred, the system must still provide the report to customers. The community water system can choose to provide the consumer confidence report to customers by mailing it or making it available on a publicly accessible Internet site. The community water system must provide consumer confidence reports to customers in plain language and in the same manner as the customer pays their bill, whether in printed or electronic form. The community water system must remain compliant with maximum contaminant levels for regulated contaminants and provide consumer confidence reports on a publicly accessible Internet site or by mail. The amendments made by this section regarding mailing requirements take effect 90 days after the enactment of the Act. The Environmental Protection Agency must revise regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Environmental Protection Agency must revise regulations and take necessary actions to implement the amendments made by this section."
