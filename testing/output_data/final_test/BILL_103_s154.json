The \"Ronald Reagan Peace Dividend Investment Act\" allows for reducing the deficit and increasing the personal exemption if defense outlays are below the baseline for fiscal year 1994 and beyond. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits are made accordingly. The applicable baseline for defense outlays is calculated based on the total estimated discretionary outlays for the fiscal year. For fiscal year 1996 and beyond, the baseline is determined by the Congressional Budget Office baseline inflator multiplied by the defense outlay level from the previous fiscal year. Adjustments to discretionary spending limits are allocated for deficit reduction as per the Balanced Budget Act. The Balanced Budget Act of 1985 mandates a reduction in outlays and revenue for fiscal years 1993-1995. The Secretary of the Treasury will increase personal exemption amounts to offset reduced receipts. Legislation allows for Peace Dividend Investment.
