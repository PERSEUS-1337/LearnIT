    "content": "DIRECT LIFECYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. Section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act is amended to define 'lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions' as the total direct emissions throughout the fuel lifecycle, considering regional differences in renewable fuel production. The term 'lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions' includes emissions from all stages of fuel production and distribution, adjusted for global warming potential. The Administrator must make the emission measurement model public before publication. The Administrator may waive lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements for renewable fuel production if it is determined that the requirements are the primary or contributing factor of a failure to achieve the applicable renewable fuels standard. The Administrator may waive requirements for renewable fuel production if they are causing economic harm or increasing dependence on foreign oil. A renewable fuel manufacturer can petition for certification of an innovative production method with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Administrator can waive renewable fuel production requirements if causing economic harm or increasing dependence on foreign oil. A petition for certification of an innovative production method with lower greenhouse gas emissions must include a full lifecycle analysis. If the Administrator does not approve or deny a petition within 90 days, it is considered approved. No waiver may be granted for state low-carbon fuel standards. No waiver can be granted for a State low-carbon fuel standard unless it aligns with federal standards for greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuels. Measurements under the State standard must be based on observable data. The waiver for a State low-carbon fuel standard must align with federal standards for greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuels, based on observable data."
