    "content": "The \"Healthy Kids from Day One Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress finds that preschool years are crucial for determining obesity development later in life, with aerobic fitness and healthy eating supporting academic performance. Over 21% of preschool children are overweight or obese, and sedentary behavior is prevalent, with outdoor time decreasing rapidly. Children's outdoor time has decreased rapidly, while they spend nearly 8 hours a day in front of electronic media. Studies show overweight children at age 5 are more likely to be overweight at age 9. Obesity rates are higher for certain ethnic groups. Obese children have a greater risk of obesity in adulthood and chronic conditions. In 2005, 61% of children under 6 received regular child care. A 2008 survey found that 93% of parents believe child care health and safety standards should be improved. Child care settings should promote healthy habits and physical activity for children, including outdoor activities which offer numerous health benefits. The Let's Move Child Care initiative aims to improve children's health by promoting healthy eating, physical activity, and reducing screen time. It involves collaboration between governmental, nonprofit, and private sectors to support child care providers in establishing healthy habits for children. The pilot program will support child care collaboratives to reduce overweight/obesity in children aged birth to 5 through dissemination of tools and best practices. It aims to enhance child care centers' focus on healthy development through evidence-based policies and practices. After 3 years, the program will end and share best practices with other systems. The Healthy Kids Program, part of the Public Health Service Act, aims to define key terms related to child health. The curr_chunk defines terms related to child care and early childhood education, including 'child care center,' 'early learning council,' and 'family child care home.' These definitions aim to provide clarity on the types of facilities and programs involved in caring for young children. The curr_chunk defines terms related to child care and early childhood education, including 'child care center,' 'early learning council,' and 'family child care home.' It also mentions screen time limits and the definition of the term 'State.' The curr_chunk defines territories and possessions of the United States, including Puerto Rico and any other territory. The curr_chunk states that grants are provided under SEC. 399OO-1. The Secretary will award 3-year competitive grants to 5 eligible entities to reduce and prevent obesity among children aged birth to 5 in a State and promote parental engagement in child care settings. Eligible entities include State health departments, child care licensing entities, nonprofit organizations, or partnerships with expertise in child development. Grantees must use funds to establish child care collaboratives involving staff from multiple sites or family child care homes, or contract with organizations for expertise in child development. Each collaborative established under the grant must provide technical assistance, compile best practices, and create a sustainability plan without additional federal funding after the 3-year pilot program. Each collaborative established under the grant must share best practices and strategies for implementing evidence-based policies related to child development, including healthy eating and physical activity. The plan may include incorporating these practices into training for child care providers. Collaboratives are required to provide technical assistance and create a sustainability plan without additional federal funding after the pilot program. Collaboratives must provide 5-10 daylong training sessions yearly for child care providers on healthy eating and physical activity interventions for children aged 0-5, using culturally competent curricula and tools. This includes a handbook with recommendations and best practices. The curr_chunk provides recommendations, guidelines, and best practices for child care centers and family child care homes on healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time reduction. It also includes information on the availability of child care health consultants and health and wellness resources from various bureaus and organizations. The curr_chunk focuses on strategies for promoting healthy habits in children aged birth to 5, including parental engagement, overcoming barriers to healthy eating and physical activity, and providing guidance to child care staff. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for implementing policy changes to promote healthy habits in children aged birth to 5, including utilizing culturally competent curriculum, parental engagement, and removing barriers to healthy eating and physical activity. All activities must be evidence-based and data-informed. The Secretary will award grants to evaluate pilot programs, coordinate activities with the National Prevention Council, and provide technical assistance for states and pilot centers. The Secretary will provide technical assistance and disseminate information on evidence-based approaches to grantees. Evaluation metrics will be consistent across all funded programs, measuring outcomes related to healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time reduction. Upon completion of the pilot program, the evaluation will identify policies, best practices, and strategies to improve healthy eating, physical activity, screen time limits, and parental engagement in child care settings. The Secretary will disseminate evidence, strategies, best practices, and lessons learned to relevant agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. The Secretary will report to Congress within 180 days after the pilot program's completion, providing an evaluation and recommendations on incorporating lessons learned into future guidance documents and Federal programs. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014 is set at $1,500,000 each year."
