In this section, definitions are provided for key terms including 'importer' (pharmacist or wholesaler), 'pharmacist' (licensed to dispense prescription drugs), and 'prescription drug' (excluding controlled substances, biological products, infused or intravenously injected drugs, and drugs inhaled during surgery). The curr_chunk provides definitions for 'qualifying laboratory' and 'wholesaler' in the context of drug importation regulations in the United States. A qualifying laboratory is approved by the Secretary for specific purposes, while a wholesaler is a licensed distributor of prescription drugs, excluding those authorized to import drugs. The Secretary will promulgate regulations allowing pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from Canada into the United States, with safeguards to ensure compliance with safety and effectiveness requirements. Importers must comply with specified regulations. The regulations under subsections (d)(1) and (e) require importers of prescription drugs to submit specific information and documentation to the Secretary, including the active ingredient, dosage form, shipping date, and quantity of the drug. Additional provisions may be added by the Secretary to protect public health or facilitate drug importation. Importers of prescription drugs must provide detailed information including the quantity, origin, price, documentation from the seller, lot number, and importer's contact details. When importing prescription drugs, the importer must provide documentation showing the drug was received from the manufacturer and shipped by the first foreign recipient, along with proof that the quantity being imported does not exceed what was received by the first foreign recipient. When importing prescription drugs, documentation must show that each batch was sampled and tested for authenticity and degradation in initial shipments, and subsequent shipments must have a statistically valid sample tested. If the drug is not shipped directly from the manufacturer, proof of testing for each batch is required. Documentation must demonstrate that each batch in every shipment imported into the US was statistically sampled and tested for authenticity and degradation. Importer or manufacturer certification is required to confirm the drug's approval for US marketing, lack of adulteration or misbranding, and compliance with labeling requirements. Laboratory records with complete test data ensuring compliance with specifications and standards are also necessary. The Secretary requires documentation of testing conducted at a qualifying laboratory, along with any additional information deemed necessary for public health protection. The regulations mandate testing by the importer or manufacturer at a qualified laboratory, with the Secretary maintaining submitted information for a specified period.

The Secretary has the authority to grant waivers for the importation of prescription drugs or devices on a case-by-case basis, with guidance provided on when waivers will be granted.

The Secretary has the authority to determine necessary conditions for the importation of prescription drugs to ensure public safety. This section does not limit the Secretary's authority except for section 801(d)(1). Appropriations are authorized as needed for implementation."
