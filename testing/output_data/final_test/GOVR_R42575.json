    "content": "The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) regulates private sector collective bargaining, allowing workers to organize and negotiate as a unit. Union security agreements require workers covered by the contract to pay dues. States can enact right to work laws that supersede NLRA provisions on union security agreements. Right to work (RTW) laws in 24 states supersede union security provisions of the NLRA. Debate continues on expanding or prohibiting RTW laws, with supporters citing personal freedom and employer flexibility. Opponents argue that all workers benefit from union representation and should contribute financially. The report discusses the legislative history, origin, and recent state-level events related to RTW laws. The report discusses the origin and development of RTW laws, recent state-level events, and federal legislation related to RTW. It also reviews empirical research on the effects of RTW laws, highlighting mixed evidence on their impact on economic outcomes. Prior to federal labor laws, states regulated labor and collective bargaining with varying policies. The Railway Labor Act in 1926 guaranteed collective bargaining rights, while the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932 prohibited federal courts from intervening in labor disputes. The Norris-LaGuardia Act, enacted in 1935, regulates employer-union relations and collective bargaining for most private sector workers. Also known as the Wagner Act, it guarantees workers the right to organize and bargain collectively over wages, hours, and conditions of employment. The NLRA was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1937 to prevent industrial strife and obstruction of commerce. The NLRA, enforced by the NLRB, establishes procedures for union election and certification, unfair labor practices, and permits collective bargaining contracts with union security agreements. The Taft-Hartley Act amended the NLRA in 1947, treating employers, employees, and labor unions as equal parties in negotiations. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 treated employers, employees, and labor unions as equal parties in negotiations. It established unfair labor practices for unions, prohibited secondary strikes, and outlawed \"closed shops.\" Additionally, it introduced right-to-work provisions allowing states to pass laws prohibiting union security agreements. Amendments to the NLRA have been limited since then, with the Landrum-Griffin Act in 1959 increasing regulation of internal union activities. The NLRA was amended in 1974 to include employees of private nonprofit hospitals. In 1980, individuals covered by a union security agreement but belonging to a religion objecting to supporting a labor union could pay dues to a charity. No major federal legislation related to the NLRA or RTW has been passed since 1980. In RTW states, workers covered by collective bargaining contracts can choose whether to join the union and pay dues. States without RTW laws are subject to different regulations. In states without Right to Work (RTW) laws, union security provisions of the NLRA require workers covered by collective bargaining contracts to become dues-paying members within 30 days. However, in a union shop, employees cannot be forced to join a union but can choose to pay dues as financial core members. Financial core members are not full union members and cannot participate in union activities or vote on contracts. Financial core members are not subject to union bylaws or discipline but must pay dues for collective bargaining functions. They do not have to support non-bargaining activities, resulting in potentially lower dues than full union members. Workers under a union security agreement must be informed of the financial core membership option. Union shop agreements require workers to pay a representation fee but not join the union. Workers can opt for financial core membership instead, similar to agency shops. In cases of religious conflicts, workers can donate the fee to a non-labor charity. Collective bargaining rights for certain groups are covered by laws other than the NLRA, such as the Railway Labor Act for railway and airline employees. Postal workers' rights are also governed by separate federal laws. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 defines postal workers' collective bargaining rights, allowing dues deduction with written authorization. Federal employees' rights are outlined in the FSLMRS, permitting dues deduction upon employee's written consent. Taft-Hartley amendments allow states to pass laws prohibiting union security agreements, with 24 states enacting such laws. States can pursue RTW through legislation, ballot initiatives, or state constitution amendments, with details varying by state. The laws regarding Right to Work (RTW) vary by state, with Michigan excluding certain public safety occupations while Oklahoma's amendment is broader. Some state laws regulating workers not covered by the NLRA have faced legal challenges. Changes to federal laws on unions and RTW have been limited, but ongoing debates have led to proposals to amend the NLRA's provisions on union security agreements. Since the 104th Congress, National Right to Work bills have been regularly introduced in both the House and Senate. These bills aim to amend the NLRA by removing provisions allowing union security agreements, with similar changes proposed for the Railway Labor Act. Most national RTW proposals focus solely on prohibiting union security agreements and often garner significant support from cosponsors. Contrasting proposals to strike NLRA provisions allowing RTW laws have been introduced with less regularity. Indiana and Michigan enacted RTW laws in 2012, while other states like Ohio, Delaware, and Missouri have debated but not enacted them. Research shows RTW laws negatively impact unionization rates, with debates on causal effects. Effects on job growth and wages have also been studied. The impact of RTW laws on economic outcomes like job growth and wages has been studied, but findings are mixed with no consensus on the effects. Comparing states with and without RTW laws is challenging due to the inability to observe the counterfactual. For instance, comparing employment growth in RTW state Arizona and union security state New Mexico doesn't provide a clear picture of the laws' contributions to outcomes. Some researchers have attempted to estimate the effect of RTW laws by controlling for other factors, but diverse methodologies have yielded diverse conclusions. The review of RTW-related studies covers frequently cited and recent studies that isolate the effect of RTW laws on various outcomes, showing the union membership rate in RTW and union security states. The union membership rate in union security states is nearly three times that of RTW states (15.0% vs. 5.6%). In RTW states, about 19% of workers covered by a union contract are non-members, while in union security states, this share is about 7%. Researchers have proposed hypotheses to explain the differing unionization rates between RTW and union security states. RTW laws reflect states' opposition to unions, with diversity in preferences. Mixed evidence exists on the impact of RTW laws on unionization rates. Michigan had high union membership before RTW law, while Idaho saw a significant drop in unionization before its RTW law. The passage discusses the impact of Right to Work (RTW) laws on unionization rates, with a focus on the free-rider hypothesis. It explains how RTW laws, by making dues payment optional, can lead to a decline in dues-paying members and higher dues for remaining members. This can result in unsustainably high dues or limited representation services for workers. The share of workers covered by a union contract is higher in RTW states compared to union security states. The study by Sobel in 1995 found that in Right to Work (RTW) states, about 70% of nonpaying workers were \"induced free riders,\" meaning they did not value union representation. This reduces the bargaining power of unions and leads to lower membership in the long run. The 1987 study by Ellwood and Fine showed that Right to Work (RTW) laws led to a significant decrease in union organization and success rates. This decline in unionization levels may have a long-term impact, although the exact influence of RTW laws on unionization remains debated. Additionally, there has been a general decline in union membership rates in both RTW and union security states. The decline in union membership rates has been observed in both Right to Work (RTW) and union security states since 1983, including workers covered by collective bargaining contracts. Analyzing the impact of RTW laws on unionization rates is complex due to various factors at play, leading to inconclusive results in studies on higher-order outcomes like employment and wages. The report summarizes conflicting data and scholarship on Right to Work (RTW) laws' impact on employment growth. Two views exist: one suggests RTW laws create a favorable business environment, while the other argues business location decisions are driven by factors like labor supply and incentives, making RTW laws relatively insignificant. Table 4 data from 2002 to 2012 shows higher employment growth in Right to Work (RTW) states compared to union security states. However, there is significant variation within both types of states, with examples like Alaska and Montana experiencing growth in union security states while Mississippi and Alabama saw declines in RTW states. Critics argue that these diverse outcomes suggest RTW laws alone do not guarantee above-average job growth. Skeptics question the impact of Right to Work (RTW) laws on employment growth, pointing out that other pro-business policies also play a significant role. For instance, North Dakota, an RTW state, saw rapid employment growth due to various business-friendly policies and natural resources, making it challenging to isolate the effect of RTW laws on economic performance. The study compared manufacturing employment growth in Right to Work (RTW) states and union security states near state borders from 1947 to 1992. Counties in RTW states saw one-third faster growth in manufacturing employment. The author suggested that state policies influence site location, but expressed uncertainty about the impact of RTW laws. Holmes emphasized that the effect found in the study is an overall effect of state policy, not just a right-to-work law. He noted a strong correlation between RTW laws and other pro-business policies based on a ranking of states' business climates. Further research is needed to isolate the effect of RTW laws, as no widely accepted study has emerged yet. In 2012, wages in union security states were 16% higher than in RTW states. While there is little controversy over these aggregate numbers, the relationship between wages and RTW laws is debated. Previous studies have conflicting findings on the impact of RTW laws on union and nonunion wages. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of RTW laws on wages. The study by Gould and Shierholz compared wages between RTW and union security states, controlling for various factors. They found that working in a right-to-work state led to a 3.2% reduction in wages. Another study by Reed challenged this conclusion by examining state-level income data. After controlling for income levels in 1945, a study found that RTW laws were associated with wages 6.7% higher than in union security states. The effect was strongest in states with the lowest initial incomes, while states with higher incomes experienced weaker or negative effects from RTW laws. Additional research highlights the challenges in evaluating the effects of RTW laws comprehensively. Zullo's study on construction worker fatalities and RTW laws showed that higher unionization rates were linked to lower fatality rates, especially in union security states. Other studies found mixed results, with one showing little effect on employment but a positive impact on proprietors' incomes, and another evaluating stock performance in Louisiana and Idaho after passing RTW laws. The performance of stocks from companies based in states with key movement in RTW legislation increased 2% to 4% relative to the larger market. The ongoing RTW debate focuses on workers covered by collective bargaining agreements who do not want to pay union dues. Supporters argue for the right to choose, while opponents emphasize the need for all workers in the bargaining unit to financially support the labor organization representing them. Higher-order effects are also considered by both sides. Supporters of RTW laws argue for increased employer flexibility and efficiency, while opponents claim these laws harm unions financially, leading to reduced benefits for workers. Existing research on RTW effects is inconclusive due to the complexity of state economies and the inability to isolate union security policy effects. The ongoing debate on RTW is unlikely to reach a consensus soon. The ongoing debate on RTW may not reach a consensus soon, as factors other than empirical evidence related to economic outcomes drive the discussion."
