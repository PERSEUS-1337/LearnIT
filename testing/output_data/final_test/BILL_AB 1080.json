    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define \"Administrative budget\" as the budget for administrative costs of successor agencies as provided in Section 34177. The \"Administrative cost allowance\" is a percentage of property tax revenues payable to the successor agency, with a minimum amount set unless reduced by the oversight board. It excludes costs that can be paid from bond proceeds or other sources, and does not cover litigation expenses related to assets. Employee costs for project implementation activities, such as construction inspection and project management, are considered project-specific costs and not administrative costs. Litigation expenses related to assets, settlements, judgments, and asset maintenance costs before disposition are excluded from administrative cost allowances. The \"designated local authority\" is a public entity formed under Section 34173. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes bonds issued under specific government codes with required debt service and reserve set-asides. Bonds may have a reserve when necessary or when property tax allocation is insufficient for upcoming payments. Loans borrowed by the redevelopment agency for a lawful purpose must be repaid according to a required schedule or loan terms. Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state, or obligations imposed by state law, including pension payments, pension obligation debt service, and unemployment payments, are enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. Layoff or termination costs for city employees who worked for the former redevelopment agency are also considered enforceable obligations. The successor agency or designated local authority must reimburse the housing entity for any employee obligations when transferring employees to the entity assuming housing functions from the former redevelopment agency. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or settlements against the former redevelopment agency. They can also terminate agreements or contracts with approval and provide compensation if needed. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements required for the successor agency's operation, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance. Repayments owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. Loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created it within two years of the agency's creation may be considered enforceable obligations for the purpose of this part. Written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, solely for securing or repaying those obligations, may also be deemed enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements between former redevelopment agencies and public agencies for services or funding outside of project areas not properly authorized under Section 33000 are void, except for housing agreements. The department may consider agreements with joint powers authorities under the Military Base Reuse Authority Act as enforceable obligations. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to indebtedness obligations, oversight boards, recognized obligations, and recognized obligation payment schedules in the context of redevelopment projects under the Community Redevelopment Law. The curr_chunk provides definitions for key terms related to taxing entities, property taxes, the Department of Finance, and sponsoring entities in the context of redevelopment projects under the Community Redevelopment Law. The curr_chunk defines \"final judicial determination\" as a conclusive decision by a state court or appellate jurisdiction. It also specifies the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" as up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year. The housing entity administrative cost allowance is remitted by the successor agency to the local housing authority that assumed the housing functions of the former redevelopment agency. If there are insufficient funds in the Redevelopment Obligations Retirement Fund, the unpaid amount can be carried over to future payment schedules without a time limit."
