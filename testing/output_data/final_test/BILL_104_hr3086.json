    "content": "The \"Fast and Efficient Tax Filing Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 deems the postmark on a tax document as its delivery date. A recent court decision requires taxpayers to use the United States Postal Service for timely filing, even if using an overnight delivery service. It is crucial for tax documents to be promptly delivered to the IRS. (4) Major private delivery services in the US are as reliable as the USPS for document delivery. (5) It is unfair for taxpayers to be penalized for late filing when they sent their returns responsibly. (6) The 9th Circuit Court supports extending the timely-mailing-as-timely-filing rule to private delivery services, leaving the decision to Congress. Existing law should be changed to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to designate qualified delivery services, in addition to the USPS, for the \"timely-mailing-as-timely-filing\" rule. This would enhance the efficiency of the IRS and simplify tax return filing for US taxpayers. The Secretary of the Treasury may designate private delivery services for the \"timely-mailing-as-timely-filing\" rule, improving IRS efficiency and simplifying tax return filing for US taxpayers. Section 7502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include private delivery services as a valid method for timely filing and paying taxes. The Secretary of the Treasury can designate delivery services for this purpose. The Secretary can designate a delivery service for tax filing if it is available to the public, timely, reliable, and records delivery information electronically. The service must be equivalent to registered and certified mail. The Secretary can designate a delivery service for tax filing that is substantially equivalent to United States registered or certified mail. SEC. 4. USE OF PRIVATE DELIVERY SERVICES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include delivery by designated delivery services for tax-related notices. Sec. 7524. Use of private delivery services for tax-related notices."
