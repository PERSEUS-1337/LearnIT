    "content": "The President negotiates FTAs with foreign countries and submits legislation to Congress for approval. U.S. FTAs are typically approved by a majority vote of Congress as congressional-executive agreements. Congress may use expedited procedures for implementing bills if the President meets certain trade agreement objectives. After congressional approval, the President proclaims the agreement to have entered into force. FTAs require implementing legislation by Congress to enforce and comply with obligations. Changes to U.S. federal statutory law may be necessary to align with FTA provisions. Implementing laws often authorize the President to make adjustments as needed. FTAs require implementing legislation by Congress to enforce obligations such as tariff schedules, rules of origin, and customs user fees. Implementing laws authorize the President to modify or waive these provisions. Most FTA implementing laws provide for repeal if the trade agreement terminates. FTAs are approved as congressional-executive agreements rather than treaties ratified by the President with Senate consent. Under international law, FTAs are legally binding agreements subject to state-to-state dispute settlement or investor-state arbitration. Violations may lead to sanctions like trade retaliation, fines, or compensation to foreign investors. Under FTAs approved by Congress, dispute settlement panels and international investment tribunals do not change U.S. law. U.S. FTAs create binding international obligations, and withdrawal or termination can occur with advance notice as per the Vienna Convention. The Vienna Convention allows for withdrawal from FTAs with advance notice, requiring communication through authorized government officials such as the Head of State, Head of Government, or Minister for Foreign Affairs. This ensures that the representative has the authority to terminate the agreement on behalf of the state. The Vienna Convention allows for withdrawal from FTAs with advance notice through authorized government officials. Termination of an FTA would release the United States from obligations unless otherwise agreed. FTAs require advance notice for termination or withdrawal, as stated in NAFTA Article 2205. The U.S. FTAs have specific withdrawal provisions that set a time period between notice of withdrawal and termination of the agreement. The U.S.-Israel FTA has a 12-month period, while subsequent FTAs like NAFTA have a six-month period. Only one U.S. FTA has been suspended, the U.S.-Canada FTA when NAFTA came into effect in 1994. Section 125 of the Trade Act of 1974 outlines the process for Congress to consider implementing legislation for FTAs, including provisions for termination and withdrawal. Implementing laws for FTAs often include clauses for repealing provisions if the agreement ends or a party withdraws. Section 125 of the Trade Act of 1974, applicable to most FTAs including NAFTA, addresses U.S. withdrawal from an FTA. Subsection (e) states that duties or import restrictions under a trade agreement shall remain for 1 year after termination or withdrawal, unless restored by the President. The Trade Act of 1974, including NAFTA, allows for preferential tariff rates on imports from former FTA partner countries for a year after U.S. termination or withdrawal, unless adjusted by the President. The President must recommend appropriate duty rates to Congress within 60 days of termination or withdrawal. This process helps Congress enact new tariff rates for affected imports. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to terminate proclamations implementing FTA obligations, potentially including rules of origin for preferential tariff treatment. Most FTA implementing laws provide for repeal of statutory provisions upon agreement termination. NAFTA implementing law specifies provisions that cease to have effect if an FTA partner no longer belongs to NAFTA. The NAFTA implementing law specifies that certain provisions will cease to have effect if an FTA partner no longer belongs to NAFTA. This could be triggered if the United States withdraws from the agreement, affecting Canada and Mexico. Congress has the authority to amend legislation in such cases, as seen with the U.S.-Canada FTA suspension. The President's authority to unilaterally withdraw the United States from Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) approved by Congress is questioned, as the Constitution does not specifically address this issue. While FTA implementing laws provide for repeal of provisions upon termination, it is unclear if the President can withdraw from an FTA without Congress's approval, as authority over international trade is shared between the President and Congress. The President's executive power under Article II of the Constitution grants responsibility for foreign relations, including appointing ambassadors, submitting treaties, and acting as Commander in Chief. Congress, under Article 1, Section 8, has authority over regulating commerce with foreign nations and making necessary laws. FTAs regulate foreign commerce, an area where Congress holds specific constitutional authority. The President's executive power under Article II of the Constitution includes responsibility for foreign relations, appointing ambassadors, and acting as Commander in Chief. Congress has authority over regulating commerce with foreign nations. FTAs regulate foreign commerce, an area where Congress holds specific constitutional authority. It could be argued that Congress must have a role in decisions to terminate or withdraw from an FTA, but some suggest the President has exclusive authority in communicating with foreign powers. The President's power includes appointing ambassadors and engaging in direct diplomacy with foreign sovereigns. Congress lacks the authority to initiate diplomatic relations with foreign nations. If the President unilaterally withdraws from an FTA, it may be upheld as an exercise of his communication power. Some commentators may disagree with this characterization, but notifying trade partners according to the FTA's terms is deemed sufficient. The President's termination of an FTA to trade partners releases the United States from international obligations. Questions may arise regarding the impact on domestic law and the extent of the President's authority to withdraw from FTA provisions in domestic law. The President's notice of withdrawal is sufficient under international law, but he cannot repeal federal statutes implementing the FTA without proper procedures. The President cannot repeal federal statutes implementing the FTA without congressional action due to Congress's authority over duties and commerce with foreign nations. Congress could pass legislation to ensure FTA obligations remain in effect, but provisions may not prevent the President from terminating an FTA according to its terms. Congress may pressure the President not to withdraw from an FTA through various means, such as holding hearings, using the appropriations process, or refusing to approve treaties. Legislation has been introduced to repeal congressional approval of NAFTA and direct the President to withdraw from other FTAs, raising questions about Congress's power in such matters. Courts and commentators suggest that the Constitution gives the President, not Congress, the authority to communicate with foreign states. Congress may not be able to directly deliver notice of withdrawal from an FTA, as the President holds the power in communications with foreign entities. However, Congress could potentially repeal its approval of an FTA through legislation, though enforcing such a directive would be challenging. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations, providing a possible avenue for Congress to act. Repealing approval and implementation of an FTA in domestic law could pressure the President to withdraw from the agreement to avoid international dispute settlement. Congress could exert pressure through legislation or hearings. The President could be pressured by Congress to withdraw from an FTA through various means, such as holding hearings or refusing to approve treaties. Withdrawal from an FTA would release the United States from international obligations under that agreement. The termination of an FTA could lead to the repeal of implementing laws, releasing parties from international obligations under the agreement. For example, the U.S.-Korea FTA Implementation Act and CAFTA-DR specify that the provisions of the implementing laws would cease to have effect upon termination of the agreement. The NAFTA implementing law lacks clear language on repealing provisions implementing the agreement, but it could be interpreted as repealing some provisions when the US decides not to apply the agreement with a NAFTA partner country due to withdrawal. Congress can change these repeal provisions, as seen with the US-Canada FTA. Not all US laws consistent with a trade agreement obligation are in the implementing act. These repeal provisions may imply delegation of authority from Congress to the President. The delegation of authority from Congress to the President to determine when an agreement has terminated may raise separation-of-powers concerns. The Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. City of New York regarding the Line Item Veto Act is relevant in this context. The Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. City of New York found that the Line Item Veto Act violated the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution by allowing the President to effectively repeal acts of Congress without following the regular legislative process. The Court suggested that Congress may grant another branch of government the authority to repeal laws under contingent legislation. The Supreme Court's decision in Clinton v. City of New York found that the Line Item Veto Act violated the Constitution by allowing the President to repeal acts of Congress without following the regular legislative process. The Court suggested that Congress may delegate authority to repeal laws under contingent legislation, particularly in the areas of foreign trade and foreign affairs. The decision also indicated that the \"repeal\" provisions in Free Trade Agreements may be deemed constitutional due to the President's authority being dependent on a condition that did not exist when Congress passed the implementing law. The repeal provisions in Free Trade Agreements do not give the President discretion to repeal laws upon termination of the agreement. Instead, specific provisions will cease to have effect when the agreement ends, aligning with Congress's policy to ensure that domestic implementation of the agreement also ceases. The President cannot choose which provisions to terminate, delegating authority in foreign trade and affairs. The Constitution grants Congress the power to impose tariffs on imports from other countries, and the Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to delegate the power to set tariffs to the President. Congress has authorized the President to adjust tariff rates to implement Free Trade Agreement obligations, which the President has done by issuing proclamations altering tariff rates in accordance with Congress's delegation. In the absence of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the President would need to rely on statutory authority to adjust tariff rates. If the FTA implementing laws are automatically repealed upon termination or U.S. withdrawal from the agreement, presidential proclamations reducing tariffs may be invalidated. Tariff rates would then revert to their original levels without the President's authority to modify them under the implementing law. If an FTA is terminated or the U.S. withdraws, the President can adjust tariff rates using statutory authority. Section 125(e) of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restore tariff rates to pre-FTA levels, but Congress must approve new duty rates within 60 days. Repealing federal statutory provisions implementing FTA obligations requires Congressional action. Repealing federal statutory provisions implementing FTA obligations requires Congressional action. The President could rely on constitutional or statutory authorities to repeal or limit the effect of measures implementing FTA obligations. The executive branch has the authority to repeal, narrow, or relax rules implementing FTA obligations. This includes altering guidance documents or enforcement discretion to avoid certain obligations. The President can also choose not to implement trade obligations by exercising discretionary statutory authority, such as waiving domestic content restrictions for federal procurement for eligible goods and services of FTA partner countries. The President or executive branch agencies can revoke waivers of restrictions on FTA partner countries' goods and services, potentially facing judicial review for exceeding statutory authority or failing to enforce the law."
