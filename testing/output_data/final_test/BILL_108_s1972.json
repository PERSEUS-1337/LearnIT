    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business State Mandated Health Insurance Assistance Act of 2003\" introduces a credit for employee health insurance expenses related to state mandates under SEC. 45G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act \"Small Business State Mandated Health Insurance Assistance Act of 2003\" introduces a credit for qualified small employers equal to 50% of employee health insurance expenses, with limitations based on maximum employer contributions for self-only or family coverage. The term 'qualified small employer' refers to a small employer that provides health insurance coverage to all qualified employees and operates in a state where this is required by law. A 'small employer' is defined as an employer with an average of 2 to 500 employees. A qualified small employer must have less than 2 and not more than 500 employees on business days during the 2 preceding calendar years. If the employer was not in existence throughout the 1st preceding calendar year, the determination is based on the average number of employees expected in the current year. The term 'qualified employee health insurance expenses' refers to employer payments for health insurance coverage for employees who are qualified employees, excluding amounts paid under salary reduction arrangements. The term 'qualified employee' refers to an employee who provides services to an employer in a specific state and is not covered by various health insurance plans or laws. The term 'employee' under this provision includes individuals expected to receive $5,000 in compensation from the employer, excludes certain employees as defined in section 401(c)(1), and covers leased employees as defined in section 414(n). Compensation refers to amounts specified in section 6051(a)(3), and rules similar to section 52 apply. No double benefit deductions or credits are allowed under any other tax provisions. The provision allows for qualified employee health insurance expenses to be considered under subsection (a). The credit for employee health insurance expenses is added to the general business credit under section 38(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the credit can be used against the minimum tax as outlined in subsection (c) of section 38. The provision introduces special rules for the employee health insurance credit, applying sections 39 and 38 separately to the credit. Amounts in subparagraphs (A) and (B) are treated as zero, and the credit reduces the limitation under paragraph (1). The employee health insurance credit reduces the limitation under paragraph (1) and is subject to special rules under sections 39 and 38. Amendments are made to allow for the employee health insurance credit in certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Carrybacks of unused credits are not permitted. The employee health insurance credit cannot be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of section 45G. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code to reflect this change. The Internal Revenue Service, in collaboration with the Small Business Administration, will develop an educational program to inform businesses about the eligibility criteria, calculation methods, and documentation required to claim the tax credit under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code. These amendments will apply to expenses incurred in taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
