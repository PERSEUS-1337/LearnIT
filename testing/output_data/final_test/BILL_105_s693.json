    "content": "Section 1 introduces an exclusion from estate tax for historic properties under preservation easements. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on qualified historic property. The tax imposed by section 2001 allows for a deduction from the gross estate value for qualified historic property held by a qualified organization for preservation purposes. The tax deduction under section 2001 allows for qualified historic property to be included, with specific requirements for personal property associated with the qualified historic property. The term 'historic property' refers to any building designated as a National Historic Landmark for 10 years before the decedent's death and owned by the decedent or their family. The term 'qualified organization' is defined as per section 170(h)(3) and refers to any building designated as a National Historic Landmark for 10 years before the decedent's death and owned by the decedent or their family. Additionally, any other real property necessary for public view and visitation of the historic property is also included. In the case of a corporation where all stock is held by the decedent or their family, the stock shall be treated accordingly. For estate tax purposes, stock in a corporation can be considered qualified historic property if its value is linked to such property. However, to meet the requirements, all family members holding the stock must sign a written agreement. To qualify as historic property for estate tax purposes, a written agreement must be signed by all family members holding stock in a corporation, ensuring that activities at the property are related to public view and visitation. The written agreement for historic property must ensure public access for at least 20 years and reasonable admission fees approved by the State historic preservation agency. Food, lodging, and meeting facilities provided to the general public are subject to regular oversight. The regular provision of lodging and food for the general public on historic properties may not be considered substantially related unless certain conditions are met, such as charging admission fees and limiting the portion of the property used for food provision. The tax treatment of dispositions and failure to comply with agreements during the 20-year period specified in subsection (c)(1)(D) may result in additional estate tax. If a disposition of a qualified historic property violates an agreement or if there is a failure to comply with the agreement, an additional estate tax is imposed. However, no tax is imposed if the property is acquired by a qualified organization or a family member who agrees to be bound by the agreement. An additional estate tax is imposed on a disposition of qualified historic property that violates an agreement or fails to comply. The tax is not imposed if the property is acquired by a qualified organization or family member agreeing to be bound by the agreement. The amount of the additional tax is determined by the applicable percentage of the excess tax imposed by section 2001. The additional estate tax is determined by a percentage based on the year of the event occurring. The additional estate tax percentage varies depending on the year of the event, with decreasing percentages over a 20-year period. The tax is due 6 months after the disposition or violation, and liability falls on the agreement signatory. Certain individuals (excluding the executor) may be personally liable for the additional tax imposed. If multiple people are liable, they are jointly and severally liable. Special rules apply, including coordination with deductions for easement transfers and denial of deductions for indebtedness on excluded property. The Secretary requires annual inventories of qualified historic property for this section. Technical amendments include adjusting the basis of deducted property and inserting a reference to section 2057 in another code section.
