    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Michigan Lighthouse and Maritime Heritage Act\". It includes findings related to lighthouses and maritime heritage. The State of Michigan's unique maritime character is highlighted by its Great Lakes surroundings, providing opportunities for maritime heritage preservation. Michigan's access to the Atlantic Ocean has boosted its shipping industry and contributed to industrial development. Michigan boasts more deepwater shoreline, lighthouses, and the only freshwater national marine sanctuary in the US. The maritime history of Michigan includes fur traders, missionaries, copper mining, and agricultural settlements. In the 19th century, Michigan was a leading producer of iron, copper, and lumber in the US. The state's maritime heritage is evident in its numerous lighthouses and other maritime structures. Michigan's maritime history is rich, with submarine, ore docks, piers, breakwaters, sailing clubs, communities, industries, hotels, resort communities, maritime-related national landmarks, national lakeshores, units of the National Park System, State parks, sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, shipwrecks, underwater preserves, and a freshwater national marine sanctuary. The Great Lakes have been significant for Native Americans, fur traders, missionaries, settlers, and travelers. They have also played a role in distributing wheat, iron, copper, and lumber, providing recreational opportunities, and being the setting for stories of shipwrecks and rescues. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
