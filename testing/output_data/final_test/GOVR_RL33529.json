    "content": "India has already risen as a key player on the global stage, with a vibrant economy, cultural influence, and growing military power. The United States sees India's emergence as beneficial for both countries and the world. The U.S. and Indian governments have been working to sustain a substantive \"strategic partnership\" based on shared values such as democracy, pluralism, and rule of law. Numerous economic, security, and global initiatives, including plans for civilian nuclear cooperation, are underway. A ten-year defense framework agreement was signed in 2005 to facilitate expanded bilateral security cooperation. In 2005, a defense framework agreement was signed to enhance bilateral security cooperation between the U.S. and India. Large-scale military exercises and intelligence cooperation have increased. Significant U.S. arms sales to India are ongoing, reflecting the influence of the Indian-American community. Tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding Kashmir and cross-border terrorism, remain a focus for U.S. interest in South Asia. The United States strongly supports an existing India-Pakistan peace initiative to prevent conflict over Kashmiri sovereignty. President Obama aims to enhance cooperation with India, emphasizing shared interests and values as the world's largest democracies. However, there are concerns about waning momentum in the partnership. The partnership between the United States and India has seen a decrease in momentum, with lingering areas of friction hindering optimal cooperation. India's geostrategic, economic, and security circumstances, along with skepticism towards America's global role, prevent the envisioned \"special relationship.\" While the Obama Administration's engagement has not seen groundbreaking initiatives like the Bush Administration, the relationship's maturation into diplomatic normalcy is considered a hidden strength. There is a belief in policy circles that significant new breakthroughs in U.S.-India relations are unlikely, following President Obama's visit to India in November 2010. Obama's November 2010 visit to India may have brought the two countries to a plateau where meaningful interactions continue despite domestic and foreign policy challenges. Analysts suggest focusing on limited goals like defense trade and economic and security cooperation. Indian commentators emphasize the importance of engagement with the United States as a top foreign policy priority. India's top foreign policy objectives include stable Afghanistan-Pakistan region, influence in the Indian Ocean, \"rule-maker\" status, and global power through economic growth and military modernization, all requiring cooperation with the United States. However, differences over the U.S.-Pakistan alliance and India's reluctance to exert power in its region have constrained the bilateral relationship, leading to limited progress in U.S.-India ties. The relationship's broad scope and lack of focus are evident in joint statements, but efforts to enhance defense trade and economic and security cooperation continue following Obama's 2010 visit to India. The lead U.S. diplomat summarized U.S.-India relations into four major agendas: innovation, security, people-to-people, and growth. Progress is being made in areas such as energy security, civil nuclear cooperation, military relations, and increasing bilateral trade despite obstacles like limits on foreign investment and barriers to trade. U.S.-India cooperation faces challenges such as barriers to trade and intellectual property rights protection. Progress in civil nuclear cooperation has been delayed due to liability and monitoring issues. New Delhi's decision to narrow down competitors for a major defense contract excluded U.S.-based Boeing and Lockheed Martin, disappointing U.S. officials. The decision by New Delhi to exclude U.S.-based Boeing and Lockheed Martin from a major defense contract sparked debate over its implications. Major corruption scandals in late 2010 led to a crisis for the Congress Party-led government in India. U.S. Ambassador Tim Roemer resigned in April 2011 for personal reasons, coinciding with the deselection of the MMRCA. The interim Chief of Mission in India, Peter Burleigh, is a competent veteran American diplomat with regional experience. Observers warn that U.S.-India relations could suffer if a new permanent Ambassador is not appointed quickly. Ranjan Mathai was appointed as the new Indian foreign secretary, replacing Nirupama Rao, who became the Ambassador to the United States. President Obama and Indian External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna aimed to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the two countries. During her confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Clinton emphasized the importance of the growing friendship between the US and India, pledging to establish a strategic partnership, increase military cooperation, trade, and support democracies worldwide. However, concerns arose in India that the Obama Administration was not prioritizing the bilateral relationship as strongly as the Bush Administration had done. The Obama Administration was criticized for focusing too much on U.S.-China relations, potentially harming India's influence. Concerns also arose about deepening ties with Pakistan and pressure on India to join nonproliferation initiatives. Despite these worries, positive U.S.-India relations continued, with Secretary Clinton's successful visit in July 2009. In July 2009, President Obama visited India, signing agreements and staying at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai. In November 2009, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited the White House. The diplomacy was seen as disappointing by some, but showed alignment in strategic goals and plans for future cooperation. The visit by Indian Prime Minister Singh to the White House in 2009 helped address concerns in India about the Obama Administration's attitude towards India's role as a partner. Some observers criticized the administration for not paying enough attention to India's key concerns and potentially relegating it to a regional role. The U.S. and India reengaged in the U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue initiated under President G.W. Bush. During a visit to Washington, DC in June 2010, a delegation of high-ranking Indian officials, led by External Affairs Minister Krishna, met with Secretary Clinton and President Obama. The U.S. delegation praised India as an indispensable partner and a trusted friend, with Obama stating that the relationship between the two countries will be defining in the 21st century. Undersecretary of State William Burns emphasized the strategic importance of India's progress on the world stage for the United States, acknowledging the need for sustained efforts to strengthen the partnership. During a visit to Washington, DC in June 2010, Indian officials met with Secretary Clinton and President Obama, who praised India as an indispensable partner. The U.S. sees India through the prism of ties with Pakistan and China, but assured that relations in Asia are not a zero-sum game. The Strategic Dialogue produced a joint statement pledging to deepen linkages for mutual benefit and global peace. Bilateral issues included differences over regional roles, conflict in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear program, and high-technology exports. President Obama visited Mumbai in November 2010, laying a white rose at a memorial for the 2008 terrorist attack victims. He announced $10 billion in new trade deals, including a $7.7 billion contract for Boeing to supply 30 aircraft to SpiceJet, creating 50,000 U.S. jobs. Indian officials faced criticism for not considering American interests and concerns during discussions on civil nuclear and defense cooperation, among other issues. President Obama's visit to India in November 2010 resulted in $10 billion in new trade deals, including a $7.7 billion contract for Boeing to supply aircraft to SpiceJet, creating 50,000 U.S. jobs. Indian observers were concerned about the U.S.'s alliance with Pakistan, but President Obama emphasized the importance of stability in Pakistan for India's benefit during a meeting with Mumbai college students. In his speech to the Indian Parliament, he highlighted the partnership's focus on promoting prosperity, enhancing shared security, and cooperation in various initiatives. During President Obama's visit to India in November 2010, $10 billion in new trade deals were made, including a $7.7 billion contract for Boeing. The partnership between the U.S. and India focused on promoting prosperity, enhancing shared security, and cooperation in various initiatives. President Obama emphasized the importance of stability in Pakistan for India's benefit. In a joint news conference, President Obama and Prime Minister Singh discussed enhancing shared security, strengthening democratic governance, and human rights. President Obama praised the U.S.-India relationship as one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century. During President Obama's visit to India in November 2010, $10 billion in new trade deals were made, including a $7.7 billion contract for Boeing. The partnership between the U.S. and India focused on promoting prosperity, enhancing shared security, and cooperation in various initiatives. President Obama emphasized stability in Pakistan for India's benefit. In a joint news conference, President Obama and Prime Minister Singh discussed enhancing shared security, strengthening democratic governance, and human rights. President Obama praised the U.S.-India relationship as one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century. Both leaders expressed satisfaction with adjustments in U.S. export control regulations to facilitate greater joint cooperation in high-technology fields. President Obama received applause for endorsing a permanent Indian seat on the U.N. Security Council, a positive shift in U.S. policy. During President Obama's visit to India in November 2010, $10 billion in new trade deals were made, including a $7.7 billion contract for Boeing. The partnership between the U.S. and India focused on promoting prosperity, enhancing shared security, and cooperation in various initiatives. President Obama endorsed a permanent Indian seat on the U.N. Security Council, which was met with resistance in neighboring Pakistan. The visit was successful in strengthening mutual understanding on regional and global issues, accelerating bilateral cooperation, and elevating the India-U.S. strategic partnership. During President Obama's visit to India in November 2010, the trip was seen as a significant milestone in U.S.-India relations, marking a new level of partnership with concrete initiatives. The visit was praised for the President's calm demeanor and soaring rhetoric, although some critics felt he overlooked India's challenges with poverty, bureaucracy, and healthcare. The New Delhi government's failure to push economic reforms has made foreign investors wary, exacerbated by recent corruption scandals. Concerns exist about India being subsumed into a U.S. \"imperialist agenda\" and drawn into a military alliance. A Strategic Dialogue was held in July 2011, with hopes that Secretary Clinton's attendance could strengthen the incomplete U.S.-India relationship. Clinton traveled with a group of senior U.S. officials, including the Director of National Intelligence. Upon her arrival, Secretary Clinton highlighted three key issue areas: trade and investment, security cooperation (especially on counterterrorism and maritime security), and the civil nuclear agreement. The resulting Joint Statement emphasized a commitment to broaden and deepen the U.S.-India global strategic partnership for global stability and prosperity. The Joint Statement between the U.S. and India reaffirmed their commitment to consultation, coordination, and cooperation on Afghanistan, urged Pakistan to prosecute those involved in the Mumbai terrorist attack, reiterated support for the civil nuclear energy cooperation agreement, and planned to resume negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty. Secretary Clinton emphasized India's leadership role in the world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific and South and Central Asia, during a policy speech in Chennai. Secretary Clinton emphasized India's leadership role in the Asia-Pacific and South and Central Asia, urging closer cooperation with ASEAN countries and criticizing India's Burma policy. She highlighted the need for India to speak out against human rights violations and exercise its growing power and influence in the region. Secretary Clinton reiterated the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan post-2014 withdrawal, emphasized the need for a stable Pakistan free from extremism, and introduced the \"Silk Road\" initiative for economic and transit connections in South and Central Asia. The \"Silk Road\" initiative aims to create economic and transit connections in South and Central Asia, anchored in the Indian economy. This initiative was introduced by Secretary Clinton during successful bilateral discussions between the U.S. and India, highlighting the increased global diplomatic engagement of India due to the end of Cold War political constraints and its rapid economic growth. India has significantly increased its bilateral defense arrangements, from 7 in 2000 to at least 26 today. The country's vast market potential, worth $450 billion in the retail sector, has attracted international attention. However, some critics argue that India's timid global stance and regional/domestic issues hinder its ability to exert influence in geopolitics. India, as a rising power, has been criticized for its vague policy stances on global issues. New Delhi's leaders are facing challenges in avoiding taking on responsibilities in global issues, such as the Middle East uprisings and U.S.-led efforts to isolate Iran and Burma. India has been criticized for its cautious approach to international conflicts, like the Libyan conflict, where it opposed NATO's military action and abstained from voting on U.N. Resolution 1973. Pressure is mounting on India to be more proactive in foreign policy, with calls for greater assistance in addressing the Syrian regime's actions. India is urged by foreign governments to be more proactive in foreign policy, including issues in neighboring countries like Burma and Sri Lanka. Critics say New Delhi's responses are too passive and call for standing with people over dictators. Analysts believe India's foreign policy establishment is underdeveloped, hindering its potential as a great power. Without modernization, India's diplomacy may become focused on business rather than strategic or political concerns. Despite its growing global stature, India's diplomatic influence remains limited. India's diplomatic influence remains limited compared to China, with a focus on domestic development and poverty alleviation. Indian bureaucrats maintain a distrustful attitude towards American counterparts, impacting foreign policy. Two main approaches in India's foreign policy are \"21st century Nehruvian\" and \"great power advocates.\" The two main approaches in India's foreign policy are \"21st century Nehruvian\" and \"great power advocates.\" They both view India as a regional hegemon, prioritize strategic autonomy, and employ hedging strategies to balance against other major powers. The expert found broad consensus among Indian elites that Washington has replaced Moscow as New Delhi's most important external partner. Indian decision makers welcome the United States' power capabilities, innovation, wealth, and military power. They admire America's national will, soft power, and leading role in international institutions. After the Nixon Administration's actions in the Bay of Bengal, American military power in the Indian Ocean Region is no longer seen as threatening in New Delhi. India views the United States as a crucial ally against a potentially adversarial China, with policymakers balancing traditional nationalist rhetoric with pragmatic actions. Pragmatists in India prioritize legal-moral arguments and flexible pursuit of national interests over ideology. Their influence allows for closer U.S.-India ties, especially in nonproliferation. The longstanding rivalry with Pakistan stems from historical conflicts and unresolved issues like Kashmiri sovereignty. Both countries maintain large defense forces due to decades of military tension. The ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, rooted in competing territorial claims and cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and major Indian cities, remains a major concern for the United States. The U.S. strongly supports a revived India-Pakistan peace initiative to prevent open hostilities between the nuclear-armed countries. Senior Indian officials urge the U.S. to pressure Islamabad to take stronger action against anti-India terrorist groups in Pakistan. This bilateral conflict negatively impacts U.S.-led efforts for regional stability. The ongoing tension between India and Pakistan, rooted in competing territorial claims and cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and major Indian cities, remains a major concern for the United States. The effects of this bilateral conflict are seen to negatively affect U.S.-led efforts to stabilize Afghanistan. Most observers assert that U.S. success in Afghanistan is dependent on improved India-Pakistan relations, as Pakistan needs to feel more secure to shift its attention and military resources towards the west. Some in Pakistan believe that the warm U.S.-India relationship feeds their country's insecurities and foments regional instability. Indian leaders are concerned about a potential central role for Pakistan in mediating between Kabul and Taliban elements in Afghanistan's governance. India's interest in Afghanistan is a concern for Pakistani leaders, who accuse India of manipulating water resources. This exacerbates the bilateral relationship, with some complaints coming from militant Pakistani groups. Pakistan's then-foreign minister highlighted water as a serious issue in the relationship. Pakistan's then-foreign minister raised concerns about water becoming a source of tension between India and Pakistan. India denied violating the Indus Waters Treaty and criticized Pakistan's rhetoric as a distraction from its own water management issues. The bilateral peace process was suspended by India after the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack, but dialogue resumed in 2011 despite alleged attackers not being brought to justice. India outlined strategies for dialogue with Pakistan, focusing on actions to be taken by Pakistan. The experts highlighted key concerns for New Delhi including the 11/08 Mumbai attack, extradition of fugitives, and action against terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan. The pressures faced by Islamabad may shift focus away from conflict with India, potentially opening a window for improved relations. The bilateral \"Composite Dialogue\" between India and Pakistan has seen modest successes since its initiation in the 1990s. The bilateral \"Composite Dialogue\" between India and Pakistan, resumed in 2004, has achieved some successes like a formal cease-fire along the shared frontier and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. However, relations deteriorated in 2008 after the Mumbai terrorist attack. Disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved, with Pakistani officials expressing dissatisfaction over the lack of progress on the core issue of Kashmir. Despite the formal suspension of the peace process, high-level talks between India and Pakistan continued in 2010. Indian leaders remain firm on the issue of terrorist safe havens in Pakistani Kashmir, while President Obama emphasized the need for Pakistan to address the terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks during his visit to New Delhi. The reasons for India's engagement with Islamabad varied, including perceived failures of coercive diplomacy, U.S. pressure, and talks of reconciliation with the Afghan Taliban. India engaged in high-level talks with Pakistan in 2010, driven by various factors including perceived failures of coercive diplomacy, U.S. pressure, and talks of reconciliation with the Afghan Taliban. Despite the desire for cooperation, no new agreements or major initiatives were reached during these interactions. In 2010, high-level talks between India and Pakistan indicated ongoing mutual distrust. India's leaders refused substantive talks until Pakistan addressed the Mumbai attack. Despite this, Prime Minister Singh met with his Pakistani counterpart in Bhutan, showing a willingness to discuss mutual issues. Additional talks in Islamabad in June raised optimism for diplomatic progress. Despite suspicions of Pakistani involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attack, Indian leaders continued dialogue with Pakistan. The Congress Party announced a reengagement with Pakistan, facing opposition. A positive meeting in Islamabad led to an agreement to expand confidence-building measures. In July, new Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar visited New Delhi for talks with External Affairs Minister Krishna, aiming to reduce the bilateral trust deficit and promote peace. Despite some tensions over Khar's meeting with Kashmiri separatists, the Joint Statement resulted in loosened trade and travel restrictions across the LOC, signaling progress in the peace process. The Indian government demands Pakistan to take action against the terrorist group LeT responsible for a deadly attack in Mumbai. Accusations have been made against Pakistan's intelligence agency for overseeing the attack. Indian officials claim to have evidence from David Headley, an American involved in the attack. Indian officials claim Pakistan's main intelligence service is involved in the Mumbai attack, with Hafiz Saeed being a key figure. Pakistan denies having enough evidence to charge Saeed, who was briefly placed under house arrest. India accuses Pakistan of shielding the attack masterminds, leading to a legal battle in Pakistan's Supreme Court. In May 2010, Pakistan's Supreme Court upheld a decision to release Saeed due to insufficient evidence. Despite being under house arrest, Saeed is believed to still control the organization's operations. Pakistani authorities charged seven men for the Mumbai attack, including Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi. India seeks extradition of the suspects, but Pakistan has only held preliminary hearings, raising doubts about their commitment. In July 2011, the Pakistani foreign minister urged Indian officials to have patience and trust in the proceedings regarding the Mumbai suspects. The killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad led to increased Indian demands for extradition, but Pakistan did not comply. Analysts warn of a potential international crisis if another terrorist attack in India is traced back to Pakistan. The July 2011 terrorist bombings in Mumbai highlighted the city's vulnerability to attacks. The vulnerability of the city to terrorist attacks remains a concern, with little progress made in improving security measures. The Kashmir dispute is seen as crucial for regional peace, with India viewing it as an internal or bilateral issue and rejecting third-party involvement. Islamabad criticizes New Delhi's approach as insufficient for addressing the Kashmiri struggle. The Obama Administration maintains a hands-off approach to the Kashmir dispute, emphasizing the need for dialogue between India and Pakistan. The U.S. does not mediate on the issue, with officials like Richard Holbrooke avoiding direct mention of Kashmir. India claims the entire region but generally accepts the status quo. In practice, New Delhi controls two-thirds of the former princely state of Kashmir, including the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley. Indian policy aims to maintain territorial integrity but seeks to improve trade and people-to-people contacts across the Line of Control (LOC). A 2010 survey showed less than half of Kashmiris support separatist goals, with strong support for independence only in the Kashmir Valley. Despite decreased separatist violence, Indian officials remain wary of Pakistani support for militant infiltration across the LOC. In 2010, India accused Pakistan of supporting militant infiltration across the LOC and maintaining militant bases in Pakistani Kashmir. Indian officials claimed that Pakistan was not dismantling the \"terror infrastructure\" on its side of the border. The Indian Home Ministry reported ongoing efforts to train and infiltrate militants into the region, leading to increased separatist violence in Indian Kashmir. In mid-September, over 100 young protesters died in clashes with security forces in the Kashmir Valley. A curfew was imposed, separatist leaders were arrested, and Pakistani Foreign Ministry condemned the use of force by Indian security forces. Tensions escalated with diplomatic exchanges between India and Pakistan. The situation did not escalate further in the summer of 2011. India plays a significant role in assisting reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, committing $2 billion since 2001. It is the leading regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction, with wide-reaching assistance programs aimed at boosting development in all sectors of the country. Prime Minister Singh met with Afghan President Karzai in Kabul in May 2011 to announce new initiatives. Prime Minister Singh met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul to announce a new India-Afghanistan \"Strategic Partnership,\" pledging $500 million in bilateral development aid over the next six years. India will assist in Afghanistan's development as a trade and transportation hub, with projects including a power station, dam, Parliament building, and children's hospital. Indian engineers have also completed a road project linking Afghanistan's Nimroz province with Iran. India is involved in various development projects in Afghanistan, including a road project linking Nimroz province with Iran, providing school lunches to 2 million Afghan children, and participating in the TAPI gas pipeline project. Indian personnel are working on relief and reconstruction projects in Afghanistan, with Indian police forces guarding them. Indian firms are also seeking exploration rights in Bamiyan. Firms are competing for exploration rights in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, where the Hajigak mines hold 1.8 billion tons of iron ore. New Delhi supports Afghan-led peace efforts with the Taliban, emphasizing independence from external interference. Prime Minister Singh advocates for reconciliation without outside coercion. India is involved in various development projects in Afghanistan, including the TAPI gas pipeline. India's keen security interests in Afghanistan drive its investment in the country to bypass Pakistan, counter Islamist militancy, and curb extremism. However, Indian efforts to exert influence are hindered by geographical and ethnic factors favoring Pakistan, along with Islamabad's anti-India policies. India faces a dilemma in its involvement in Afghanistan due to Islamabad's anti-India policies, uncertainty about the benefits of continued investment, and the impending U.S. drawdown. The choice between maintaining efforts in Afghanistan or scaling back to ease Pakistan's insecurities poses challenges for India's regional dominance aspirations. India and Pakistan are engaged in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan, with high-visibility Indian targets being the primary focus of attacks. A July 2008 suicide bombing at India's Kabul Embassy was linked to militants with ties to the Pakistani military, sending a message to Indian leaders to withdraw from Afghanistan. Despite accusations from Islamabad, Secretary of State Clinton stated in 2009 that the U.S. government had seen no evidence of Indian interference in Pakistan. Pakistan's \"paranoia\" about India drives a zero-sum regional competition. Their main goal in Afghanistan is to counter Indian influence. Increasing cooperation between Kabul and Islamabad worries regional capitals, especially New Delhi. Despite a U.S. commander's warning, the U.S. continues to support India in Afghanistan while acknowledging Pakistan's security concerns. The Obama Administration seeks to reassure India of its role in Afghanistan and dispel fears of a U.S. abandonment. New Delhi is anxious about a potential Taliban presence in Kabul and the impact on India's security and influence. India lacks a clear plan for a U.S. withdrawal, with concerns about deteriorating security jeopardizing its standing in Afghanistan. India's concerns about U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan stem from a lack of consultation and fears of a Taliban resurgence. The country's strategic ambitions clash with China's expanding presence in the region. India is concerned about China's increasing presence in the Indian Ocean Region and fears encirclement. Analysts suggest the US should work with India to limit Chinese expansion through joint naval coordination. There are worries in India that the US may prioritize engagement with China over Indian interests, potentially relegating India to a secondary role in Asia. India and China have a history of conflict, including a border war in 1962 and ongoing territorial disputes in Kashmir. The 1962 clash between India and China over territorial disputes in Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh strained their previously friendly relationship. Despite warming aspects in bilateral trade, a final boundary agreement has not been reached. India remains concerned about China's nuclear capabilities and strategic intentions in South and Southeast Asia, influencing New Delhi's own defense programs. In 1993, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao signed an agreement with Beijing to reduce troops along the Line of Actual Control (LOAC) dividing the two countries. Despite ongoing border talks and joint working group meetings since 1981, territorial disputes remain unresolved. Beijing's military and economic support for Pakistan, including nuclear weapons transfers, adds to bilateral friction. Reports of Chinese military presence in Aksai Chin and links to intelligence agencies have raised concerns for Indian leaders. India and China have competed for trade partners and energy resources in developing regions. Chinese concerns over the growing strategic relationship between the United States and India have been evident. Beijing protested discussions to develop a quadrilateral group of democracies in Asia. The rivalry between India and China is characterized by Indian comparisons and Chinese complacency. India is sensitive to China's influence in Tibet, with the Dalai Lama living in India and visiting Arunachal Pradesh. Ladakh, near Aksai Chin, is ethnically Tibetan. Despite concerns about U.S.-China relations, India prioritizes its relationship with Beijing. India prioritizes its relationship with Beijing, with ongoing bilateral cooperation in various areas and a growing military-to-military trust. The two countries have established a strategic and cooperative partnership, with China surpassing the United States as India's leading trade partner. Trade between India and China exceeded $62 billion in 2010, showing a significant increase from the previous year. In 2010, India's trade with China surpassed $62 billion, up 43% from the previous year. China is India's largest import source, accounting for over $40 billion or 11% of all imports. It is also the third-largest export market for Indian goods, with $19.4 billion worth of exports. However, there are concerns about trade imbalances, with China contributing to nearly one-fifth of India's total trade deficit. India's electronics, machinery, and steel imports heavily rely on China, while iron ore is the primary Indian export to China. India has not fully utilized its advantages in the services sector, with analysts suggesting that trade with China could help offset its lagging manufacturing sector. Chinese state-owned companies have significant investments in India, particularly in power generation and infrastructure. The value of Chinese investment projects in India is around $30 billion, while Indian companies have a more modest presence in China. There are concerns in India about China's growing influence in South Asia, especially regarding its construction of port facilities in the Indian Ocean region. China's involvement in developing major new ports in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh has raised concerns about Beijing's aim to dominate sea lines of communication in the Indian Ocean region. This \"string of pearls\" strategy includes plans for overland transportation and energy links, as well as port access to strategically vital SLOCs. India is also vying for influence in the region, particularly with its interest in Iran's Chabahar port. India desires to see Iran's Chabahar port grow as a transit point into Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. China views Pakistan's Gwadar port as a future land-line for energy supplies to East Asia, reducing dependence on sea lanes. Analysts debate China's naval power projection in the Indian Ocean. Long-term strategic plans could give China a strong naval position relative to India in the region. China's naval power projection in the Indian Ocean is still in an early phase, with no naval bases in the region. Analysts debate the implications of China's \"string of pearls\" strategy and the need for stronger U.S.-India ties to counter Chinese dominance in the region. Some argue that a limited Chinese navy presence in the Indian Ocean is not inherently threatening. India's geographic and logistical advantages in potential conflict with China in the Indian Ocean are highlighted. Strengthening the Andaman and Nicobar Command and enhancing maritime intelligence-sharing with the United States are suggested as ways to bolster India's position. Speculation about a growing rivalry between India and China, despite increased trade, is noted. A new \"Great Game\" is unfolding between India and China, with a focus on Kashmir. India has increased military presence near the disputed border and tensions have escalated through diplomatic exchanges. China's decision to issue special visas to residents of certain Indian states has further strained relations. The unresolved border dispute continues to be a point of contention between the two countries. The unresolved border dispute between India and China is a significant obstacle to expanded economic and trade relations. Chinese patrols have been accused of transgressing the Line of Actual Control (LOAC), with reports of incursions continuing. Indian military officials have raised concerns about alleged Chinese troops in Pakistan-held Kashmir, which Beijing denies. Tensions have escalated with accusations of war rhetoric and enmity being spread by both sides. In August 2010, tensions between India and China escalated with diplomatic disputes over visas, alleged missile deployments, and Chinese naval presence near Indian shores. Indian officials expressed concerns about China's increasing interest in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. Indian officials are closely monitoring Chinese intentions in the Indian Ocean region. There is a growing negative view of Beijing's global role, with concerns that China may be seen as an erratic, ultra-nationalist state seeking to constrain India. Despite some areas of convergence, there is skepticism towards China's commitment to cooperation and dispute resolution. The potential for future conflict between India and China is being closely watched as power dynamics evolve in Asia. Despite tensions, both countries prioritize economic development, which acts as a deterrent to open conflict. However, analysts note mutual antagonism over trade imbalance. China's aggressive behavior in the Indian Ocean region could accelerate India's partnership with the United States and cause harm. The United States and any open conflict in the region could potentially harm the Chinese economy, leading to strong incentives for India and China to cooperate. Recent India-China animosity may have eased as they agreed to restore defense ties and address border disputes. India's relationship with Sri Lanka is culturally rich, marked by a history of interaction. The unresolved ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka has strained relations between the Sinhalese-Buddhist majority in the south and the Hindu-Tamil minority in the north and east. India intervened in the conflict in 1987 but later withdrew its forces after facing casualties. India continues to acknowledge Colombo's right to combat \"terrorist forces.\" The end of combat in Sri Lanka in mid-2009 led to strengthened bilateral relations with India offering a $115 million grant and other support for humanitarian crisis and resettlement efforts. During a mid-2010 visit, Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Singh agreed on various partnerships and a $800 million soft loan for railway reconstruction. Bilateral trade exceeded $3 billion in 2010, with revived defense ties. India considers its relations with Colombo to be strong. India remains concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka post-conflict, with Parliament members expressing worries about aid not reaching displaced Tamils. In 2010, then-Foreign Secretary Rao visited Sri Lanka as a Special Emissary to assess rehabilitation efforts and urged Colombo to initiate a political process for national reconciliation. New Delhi emphasizes the need for a negotiated political settlement of ethnic issues acceptable to all communities within a united Sri Lanka. In June 2011, top Indian officials urged Sri Lanka's President to quickly reach a political settlement with the Tamils. Despite India's active engagement and financial assistance, policies have not led to sustainable peace. Recommendations include closer collaboration with the US, EU, and Japan to press for a political resolution by lifting emergency rule and promoting reconciliation. India's relations with neighboring Bangladesh have been tense due to issues like cross-border infiltration of militants and illegal Bangladeshi migrants. The two countries share a long border, most of which India has tried to seal with fences, leading to occasional deadly clashes between their border forces. India and Bangladesh have had tense relations due to cross-border issues, but have cooperated on joint counterterrorism efforts. In 2010, India extended a $1 billion line of credit to Bangladesh for infrastructure development. Bilateral trade was valued at $3.5 billion in 2009/2010, showing a 12% increase from the previous year. Ties improved after the election of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2008, who has closer ties to India. During her 2010 visit to India, agreements were made on various issues. During a visit to Bangladesh, a 123-person delegation and 50-member business contingent agreed with Prime Minister Singh to establish a comprehensive framework of cooperation. They signed agreements on cultural exchange, security, crime prevention, and power supply. India also granted increased trade access for Bangladesh through its territory to Bhutan and Nepal. External Affairs Minister Krishna's visit in July 2011 resulted in the signing of new trade agreements and progress in bilateral power sector cooperation. However, Prime Minister Singh's remarks about Bangladeshis being anti-Indian caused controversy. Prime Minister Singh's upcoming visit to Bangladesh in September 2011 aims to improve relations strained by his remarks about Bangladeshis being anti-Indian. The visit is expected to address border disputes, trade, water issues, and climate change challenges. India seeks to enhance connectivity with Bangladesh for trade and regional cooperation, while some worry about China's influence in the region. Connectivity with the Indian Ocean littoral at the expense of India is a key issue for New Delhi. Border disputes and the use of Bangladesh territory by insurgents in India's northeast are ongoing concerns. Human rights groups criticize India's border security forces for a \"shoot-to-kill\" policy, leading to tensions with Bangladesh. Prime Minister Hasina has discussed cracking down on Bangladesh-based Indian separatists with Prime Minister Singh. Prime Minister Hasina's government in Bangladesh cracked down on Indian separatists, arresting and handing over key leaders to India. This led to improved ties with India, allowing them to counter Pakistani and Chinese influence in the region. Bangladesh sought Chinese assistance to build a deep water sea port in Chittagong, raising concerns about potential infiltration of operatives and terrorists into India. Bangladesh sought Chinese assistance to build a deep water sea port in the Bay of Bengal near Sonadia, aiming to become a key shipping hub for northeast India and China. Discussions are also ongoing for a highway linking Chittagong with Kunming, raising concerns for India about potential security implications. India-Nepal relations are close due to the 1950 Indo-Nepal Peace and Friendship Treaty, allowing unrestricted travel and residency across their shared border. India supports Nepal's transition to a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous state. Prime Minister Singh congratulated Prime Minister Bhattarai in 2011. Nepal is the world's only officially Hindu country, with India as its leading trade partner. India and Nepal have a close relationship, with India being Nepal's leading trade partner and source of foreign investment. India has played a key role in training the Nepal Army. The Madhesh people in Nepal's Terai region share cultural ties with India. Nepal's largely Hindu culture makes it similar to India. The bilateral relationship is influenced by Nepal's role as a buffer state between India and China, with India seeking to counter Chinese influence. The presence of a Tibetan community in Nepal adds complexity to this dynamic. Nepal's stance towards Tibetan refugees hardened in 2010, leading to a crackdown on Tibetan protests in 2008. Chinese ties with Nepali Maoists have raised concerns, with allegations of bribery involving a Maoist leader and a Chinese official. Former Prime Minister Prachanda's frequent visits to China raised suspicions of leaning towards China. Current Prime Minister Bhattarai emphasizes the need to balance security concerns of India and China. India was wary of Maoist intentions during Prachanda's previous government. India's key geopolitical interests in Nepal include maintaining political stability in Kathmandu and preventing Nepal from becoming a base for insurgents. There are concerns that a Maoist government in Nepal could support Maoist insurgency in India. Political stability in Nepal could lead to infrastructure development and tapping into the country's hydropower potential to address India's energy needs. India seeks to enhance connectivity with western Burma to address energy needs and maintain political stability, fearing refugee influx and China's influence. Good relations with Rangoon are crucial for addressing territorial disputes with China and Pakistan. India's cooperation with Burma is seen as crucial for battling separatist militants in India's northeast. Trade between India and Burma reached $1.2 billion in FY2009/10, with India involved in numerous projects to improve Burma's infrastructure. Despite international sanctions on Burma, India favored dialogue over punitive measures. India's assistance in constructing a port in northwestern Burma aimed at developing the country's natural gas industry. New Delhi's actions, part of its \"Look East\" policy, drew criticism for alleged complicity in Burmese repression. In 2010, the SPDC introduced laws restricting opposition parties like the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi, prompting international condemnation. India's response to the laws restricting opposition parties in Burma was relatively muted compared to other countries. New Delhi disassociated itself from a U.N. resolution condemning human rights violations but supported calls for free elections and the release of political prisoners. In a meeting between SPDC chief Than Shwe and Prime Minister Singh, discussions were held on border security, economic relations, and upcoming elections in Burma. Reports suggested that India planned to deploy additional Border Security Force troops along the border with Burma. India's response to Burma's restrictions on opposition parties was relatively muted. Despite calls for free elections and the release of political prisoners, India faced criticism for welcoming the Burmese leader and pursuing closer ties with the military regime. President Obama openly criticized India for not condemning Burma's suppression of democratic movements and human rights violations, urging democracies with global aspirations to take a principled stand. India's strategic interests in Burma were cited as a reason for their approach. India's strategic interests in Burma drove its policies, with Secretary of State Clinton urging New Delhi to press for democratization. Suu Kyi's release was welcomed by India, but she called for a more active role in promoting democracy. In June 2011, External Affairs Minister Krishna visited Rangoon but did not meet Suu Kyi. India's \"Look East\" policy, initiated by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in 1991, aims to deepen commercial and diplomatic relations with East and Southeast Asia. It includes security cooperation with eastern neighbors in response to China's regional influence. Indian leaders have consistently pursued greater engagement in Southeast Asia, viewing India as both a Southeast Asian and South Asian nation. India is an ASEAN \"Dialogue Partner\" and seeks to reconnect in the shared civilizational space with neighbors. At the India-ASEAN Post-Ministerial Meeting in Indonesia in July 2011, there was unanimous agreement to strengthen engagement in security and economic fields, combat international terrorism, and finalize a Services and Investment Agreement. India aims to increase trade with ASEAN states to $70 billion by 2012. India has been a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) since 1996, reflecting its growing engagement with the Asia-Pacific region and Look East policy. India's plan to set up a military command in the Andaman Islands may not be welcomed by China. The Andaman Islands, located northwest of the Strait of Malacca, are strategically important for China's energy and trade routes. Indian Navy received a warning from Chinese navy while sailing from Vietnam to Haiphong. India's relations with Iran are historically positive, with a strategic partnership focusing on economic, energy, and counterterrorism cooperation. India's policy has shifted towards closer ties with the United States and other Western countries, leading to unrealized aspects of the India-Iran partnership. New Delhi has embraced international sanctions against Tehran, causing tensions with Iran. Bilateral trade with Iran has decreased, and there are concerns that India may align more with the U.S. India's energy ties with Iran have been growing, with Indian firms signing long-term contracts for gas and oil purchases. Despite discussions about the IPI pipeline project, New Delhi has abandoned participation. India remains a significant market for Iranian crude oil, importing about 400,000 barrels per day. There are concerns in the U.S. about India seeking greater energy resources from Iran, as it goes against U.S. efforts to isolate Iran. New Delhi continues discussions with Tehran on the IPI pipeline project, LNG supplies, South Pars LNG project, Farsi oil and gas blocks, and Chabahar port and railway projects. India sees Chabahar port as a gateway to Central Asian markets, but its current capacity is below target due to security concerns in Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan region. India's plans to purchase a stake in South Pars Phase 12 gas project have been delayed by international sanctions concerns. India's investment plans in Iran have been hindered by global pressure over Iran's nuclear program. The Reserve Bank of India announced the Asian Clearing Union can no longer be used for energy trade transactions, a move praised by the Obama Administration to tighten sanctions on Iran. This decision may also be a strategic move by India to strengthen its bid for a permanent seat on the UNSC. Despite initial resistance from Tehran, agreements were reached to ensure ongoing shipments as both countries navigated the impact of the new regulations. In February, Iran and India agreed to use euros for transactions through an Iranian bank with German accounts. However, EU scrutiny of the bank in May halted Indian payments. Iran threatened a supply cutoff in August but later denied planning one. Iranian exports decreased, leading Saudi Arabia to increase sales to India. The impasse, now at $4.8 billion, may result in a complete cutoff. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act requires sanctions on foreign companies investing over $20 million in Iran's energy sector. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act requires sanctions on foreign companies investing over $20 million in Iran's energy sector. Indian firms potentially involved in the gas pipeline project could be sanctioned, as well as companies selling gasoline to Iran. Reliance Industries of Mumbai has stopped such sales. The United States previously sanctioned Indian scientists and chemical companies for transferring WMD-related equipment to Iran. New Delhi criticized these actions as unjustified. The Hyde Act emphasized U.S. efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and urged India's participation. India opposes new nuclear weapons powers in the region and prefers diplomacy over force or sanctions to address Iran's nuclear program. While there are concerns about India-Iran defense cooperation, relations are viewed as thin and patchy, with some Indian analysts advocating for increased cooperation for regional security. New Delhi values its strong ties with Moscow as a key pillar of India's foreign policy, despite warming relations with the West. Russia remains a trusted strategic partner, providing nuclear technology and military hardware maintenance contracts. The friendship was described as a special and privileged strategic partnership during a visit to Moscow by India's External Affairs Minister. India's strong ties with Russia include deep cooperation in various sectors such as nuclear energy, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. The two governments aim to increase annual bilateral trade to $20 billion by 2015. Despite diversifying defense suppliers post-Cold War, India still heavily relies on Russian firms for military hardware, accounting for over 80% of arms imports from 2006-2010. Russia's position as a main supplier of Indian defense equipment faces challenges, including disputes over projects like the refitting of an aircraft carrier. India's defense relationship with Russia faces challenges such as delays and cost overruns in projects like the refitting of an aircraft carrier. However, India has shifted towards more advanced cooperation, including joint design and production of weapons systems like the Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and the Brahmos cruise missile. India's relations with Japan have improved significantly since the 1998 nuclear tests, with both countries now having a strategic and global partnership launched in 2006. Leaders from both countries acknowledge common values and interests, aiming to create an arc of advantage and prosperity in Asia. India and Japan have a strong partnership, aiming to create prosperity in Asia. They have finalized a free trade agreement, with bilateral trade exceeding $14.5 billion in 2010. Japan has also provided a $4.5 billion loan for a railway project in India. Both countries share an interest in expanding the U.N. Security Council membership. The Indian government secured the largest-ever single-project overseas loan from Japan for the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor project, aiming to attract over $90 billion in foreign investment. Japan has been India's largest aid donor since 1986. The three countries - U.S., India, and Japan - conducted joint naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal in 2007, with a focus on trade and energy security cooperation. New Delhi prefers trilateral cooperation over a multilateral security alliance. India's historic engagement with Africa includes ancient trade patterns, support for liberation movements, and participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Prime Minister Singh offered a $5 billion credit line to African nations in 2011, emphasizing support for education and infrastructure. India's interests in Africa align with the U.S. due to shared values of secularism, pluralism, and democracy. India's commitment to secularism, pluralism, and democracy contrasts with China's mercantile approach in Africa. China's foreign exchange reserves are ten times greater than India's, leading to significant investments in natural resources in Africa. India's trade with Africa is less than half of China's, making coordination with India beneficial for the United States, especially in security initiatives. India's diverse population and commitment to representative government make it a valuable partner for engagement with African countries. India's political system is a federal republic with a robust democratic system. The prime minister holds most executive power, while the president has limited executive powers. The Lok Sabha is the main locus of national power with directly elected representatives from each state and union territory. Most prime ministers have come from the Hindi-speaking northern regions and have been upper-caste Hindus. The Indian political system is a federal republic with a robust democratic system. The Lok Sabha is the main locus of national power with directly elected representatives from each state and union territory. The Rajya Sabha may review legislation but has no power over the prime minister or the cabinet. National and state legislators are elected to five-year terms. Recent parliamentary elections saw the Congress-led coalition winning a convincing victory. In the 2004 elections, Congress under Sonia Gandhi's leadership formed a left-leaning coalition government with Manmohan Singh as the first non-Hindu prime minister. The victory was attributed to rural and urban voters feeling excluded from the BJP's \"India shining\" campaign. The 2009 elections saw Congress and its allies gaining national support, with strong performances against BJP and \"Third Front\" candidates. Over 1,000 parties competed, with a 60% voter turnout at 838,000 polling stations. In the 2009 elections, Congress and its allies gained 61 Lok Sabha seats, bringing their total to 206 seats. The BJP lost 22 seats, resulting in their second consecutive national defeat. The Left Front coalition suffered a significant loss of 35 seats. Prime Minister Singh leads the United Progressive Alliance ruling coalition, which has been in power for over seven years. Both Singh and party chief Gandhi remain popular national figures. Despite remaining popular national figures, both Singh and party chief Gandhi have seen their favorability decline due to corruption scandals. The UPA government has failed to capitalize on opportunities and is perceived as indecisive. Singh, admired for his honesty and intelligence, has struggled to push through the UPA's domestic agenda focused on development for India's poor citizens. Congress's electoral strength hit a low in 1999, attributed to various factors including weak pre-election alliances and doubts about Sonia Gandhi's leadership experience. Support for the Congress party declined following the assassinations of Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi, who took a more active role in politics in the late 1990s, revitalized the party by attracting more women and lower castes. In 2004, Congress regained parliamentary seats and currently leads India's government under the UPA coalition, with Gandhi wielding significant influence despite obstacles due to her foreign origins. Sonia Gandhi's foreign origins posed a challenge and influenced her decision to decline the prime ministership in 2004. Her son, Rahul, is considered the likely successor to Congress leadership. The BJP's parliamentary strength grew in the 1980s with the rise of Hindu nationalism. The party faced criticism for alleged involvement in communal violence in 1993. The BJP attempted to shift its image from right-wing Hindu fundamentalist to conservative and secular during its national coalition leadership from 1998-2004. The BJP, from right-wing Hindu fundamentalist to conservative and secular, faced setbacks in 2002 communal rioting in Gujarat. Led by Atal Vajpayee, the party's national influence has declined after losses in 2004 and 2009. Lal Krishna Advani's attempt to move beyond Hindu nationalism in 2009 failed, and Nitin Gadkari is the current BJP president known for supporting privatization. Nitin Gadkari, a former Maharashtran official known for supporting privatization, has helped the BJP rebrand itself as a party focused on development and good governance. Despite his success in quelling intra-party dissent, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi remains a strong contender for the prime ministership, despite controversy over his alleged involvement in anti-Muslim riots in 2002. The influence of regional and caste-based parties in Indian politics has grown significantly, with these parties receiving about half of all votes in the 2004 and 2009 national elections. The Congress Party's success in these elections was attributed to forming pre-poll alliances at the national level, particularly with parties like the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. The rise of regional parties is evident in the UPA's ministerial appointments and the coalition's focus on rural issues and state-central relations. Two of India's prominent regional parties, the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, are based in Uttar Pradesh, with the former holding 23 Lok Sabha seats and the latter controlling the state government. The Janata Dal (United) is another notable regional party from Bihar, led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and holding 20 Lok Sabha seats. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has a strong presence in West Bengal and Kerala but limited influence nationally. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has a strong presence in West Bengal and Kerala. They have been bitter rivals of the Congress in these states but cooperated against the BJP in 2004 due to a mutual commitment to secularism. The Left Front, consisting of CPI-M and smaller allies, criticizes closer India-U.S. relations and opposes bilateral civil nuclear cooperation. In the 2009 national elections, the Left Front suffered losses in their traditional strongholds, attributed to poor governance records. The 34-year communist rule in West Bengal ended in 2011. The 34-year communist rule in West Bengal ended in May 2011 with the Trinamool Congress Party's victory in the state assembly elections. Corruption in India has been a significant issue, hindering economic and social development, and leading to a decline in foreign investment. Major scandals in November 2010, including corruption in the Commonwealth Games and the sale of broadband licenses below market prices, have paralyzed the national government. In November 2010, corruption scandals in the Commonwealth Games and the sale of broadband licenses below market prices have cost the government billions of dollars. Senior Congress Party figures resigned under corruption allegations, with officials arrested for inflating costs. The telecom scandal, selling 2G spectrum rights cheaply, resulted in a loss of $39 billion for the central government. The government lost $39 billion by selling 2G spectrum rights too cheaply. Minister A. Raja resigned and was arrested for approving improper license sales. Other officials and a telecom executive were also arrested in connection with the scandal. Textile Minister Dayanidhi Maran resigned under investigation. In further embarrassment for the ruling coalition, the qualifications of a new anti-corruption official, P.J. Thomas, were questioned by the Supreme Court due to his alleged involvement in a palm oil import scam. Outrage from opposition parties led to Parliament being shut down for three weeks, hindering major legislation. The Congress-led coalition struggled to push through economic reforms, while the main opposition BJP also faced corruption scandals. In July 2011, Karnataka's ombudsman implicated the state's BJP chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, in a $3.5 billion illegal mining scandal involving iron ore. Yeddyurappa resigned after being accused of receiving a $2 million illicit payment and selling state land at an inflated price. Reports of political bribery also caused outrage, with allegations of payoffs to secure Parliament's endorsement of the U.S.-India civil nuclear deal. In July 2011, Karnataka's ombudsman implicated the state's BJP chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, in a $3.5 billion illegal mining scandal involving iron ore. Yeddyurappa resigned after being accused of receiving a $2 million illicit payment and selling state land at an inflated price. Reports of political bribery also caused outrage, with allegations of payoffs to secure Parliament's endorsement of the U.S.-India civil nuclear deal. Prime Minister Singh denied bribery allegations but faced criticism for alleged inattentive management style enabling corruption to thrive. Pressure mounted on the Congress-led coalition to combat high-level corruption, including repatriating illicit funds stashed abroad. In the midst of mounting pressure and scandals, Prime Minister Singh defended his actions, promised to tackle corruption, and expressed regret over the scandals during a nationally-televised interview in 2011. He eventually agreed to a parliamentary investigation into the telecom scandal, ending a two-month legislative paralysis caused by opposition filibustering. In early June 2011, prominent yoga guru Swami Ramdev staged a major anticorruption protest in the Indian capital, demanding government action to recover \"black money.\" Police dispersed the protesters with tear gas and batons, leading to injuries. Critics accused the government of mishandling the situation. In mid-June 2011, yoga guru Swami Ramdev ended his fast after attracting thousands of participants in an anti-corruption protest. Critics accused the government of using unnecessary force against peaceful protesters. Public officials were uncomfortable with the political influence displayed, and there was relief when the fast ended. Shortly after, social activist Anna Hazare began a similar protest in New Delhi demanding tougher anti-corruption laws. Anna Hazare led a protest demanding stronger anti-corruption laws in India, resulting in the government agreeing to establish a new ombudsman post. The composition of the committee drafting the legislation led to controversy between government officials and civil society activists. The government and civil society produced different versions of the Lokpal bill, with majority support for the civil society version. Top Congress Party leaders argued for multiple tactics against corruption. The government was criticized for not engaging with alternative civil society groups, while \"Team Anna\" faced criticism for allegedly dividing communities and receiving support from Hindu nationalists. India's federal cabinet approved a Lokpal bill in 2011 that did not include serving prime ministers. The Lokpal bill approved by India's federal cabinet in 2011 did not include serving prime ministers or the higher judiciary. Despite incorporating some provisions of the Jan Lokpal bill, activist Hazare deemed it \"unacceptable\" and began a fast in protest. He was arrested by plain-clothes police, leading to his supporters launching a \"second independence campaign\" for India. The government's actions were criticized as inept and undemocratic. In response to the government's arrest of activist Hazare, a wide range of actors united in support of his movement. Hazare refused release until allowed to launch a hunger strike without restrictions. A parliamentary committee began considering the Jan Lokpal bill, meeting a key demand of protestors. Despite a plea from the prime minister, Hazare continued his fast until certain provisions of the bill were guaranteed. After negotiations, an agreement was reached on the 13th day of his fast. Since late 2010, the Congress-led UPA faced criticism for ineffectiveness and corruption scandals. The decline in the party's standing was rapid, with many Indians losing faith in the coalition's ability to govern. Prime Minister Singh made minor changes to the cabinet in response to public anger, but they were deemed insufficient by the opposition BJP. Singh's nonpolitical demeanor, once seen as a strength, now appeared inadequate in the face of political upheaval. In the course of recent political upheaval, Singh's nonpolitical demeanor has become a liability as he appeared slow in reacting to national outrage over corruption. Poor economic news continues to erode support for the Congress-led government, with protests against high food prices and unemployment. The Congress Party almost lost a key coalition partner, the DMK, due to the telecom scandal involving a DMK figure. A. Raja, a DMK figure, was involved in a telecom scandal that almost led to the Congress Party losing a key coalition partner. Despite this, Congress President Sonia Gandhi maintained the DMK's role in the coalition by securing more Tamil Nadu state assembly seats. Gandhi's absence from the political stage due to illness has raised speculation about the future leadership role of her son, Rahul Gandhi, who is expected to be Congress's prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 elections. However, questions persist about Rahul Gandhi's ability to lead the party. Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat, has been praised for his effective governance and impressive development in the state. Despite controversy over his alleged involvement in anti-Muslim riots, Modi has focused on economic growth by improving infrastructure and attracting international investors. Gujarat now accounts for over one-fifth of India's exports, with annual growth rates exceeding 11%. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of Bihar has gained national attention for his success in promoting good governance over caste-based politics. He has been credited with restoring law and order, improving infrastructure, and enhancing education in the state. Kumar's Janata Dal (United) party, in alliance with the BJP, won a significant majority in the 2010 state elections. His achievements, along with those of Chief Minister Modi in Gujarat, have inspired leaders like Mayawati of Uttar Pradesh to shift focus towards governance. The movement for a new state in Andhra Pradesh, particularly Telangana, has caused public disturbances and protests. The UPA government's delay in forming the new state, which includes the high-tech hub of Hyderabad, has economic implications. In West Bengal, there have been protests and resignations over the issue. In West Bengal, the communist parties faced a significant defeat in the 2011 state elections, with Trinamool Congress emerging as the winner. Mamata Banerjee, the leader of Trinamool Congress, is now the Chief Minister and is tasked with improving the state's economy. In Tamil Nadu, the DMK party suffered a defeat in the state assembly elections, losing power to the AIADMK party. Jammu and Kashmir recently held local Panchayat elections. Jammu and Kashmir recently held local Panchayat elections, with over 5 million voters participating in the largely peaceful election. New Delhi is urging the state government to quickly implement a devolution plan to transfer more power to the newly elected village leaders. India's economy is rapidly expanding, with projections to become the world's third-largest, despite widespread poverty. Recent advancements in the technology sector have brought international attention to new high-technology centers in the country. India's economy faces obstacles such as excessive regulatory structures, corruption, high cost of capital, and poor infrastructure hindering its full potential. Despite progress in reducing corruption, India lags behind China in growth rates, foreign investment, poverty reduction, and trade barriers removal. The economy shows resilience amidst challenges like corruption, poor infrastructure, political uncertainty, and inflationary pressures. India's economy has faced obstacles such as political uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and declining rates of foreign investment. Despite these challenges, the economy has continued to grow by at least 8% annually in recent years. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported India's nominal GDP in 2010 was $1.538 trillion, making it the 9th largest economy in the world. However, with a population of 1.17 billion people, India's per capita GDP is $1,265, ranking 139th in the world. High income disparities have left much of India's population in poverty, with nearly a third of the population living in poverty according to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). India faced the secondary effects of the 2008 global financial crisis, with real GDP growth decreasing from 7.3% to 5.7% in 2009. The economic slowdown in Europe and the United States led to a drop in demand for India's exports, putting pressure on the rupee. The government passed a fiscal stimulus package to aid in the recovery. India implemented a fiscal stimulus package worth 3% of GDP in December 2008. Consultations have started for India's 12th five-year plan, with Deputy Chairman Montek Ahluwalia outlining four major challenges for the upcoming plan. These challenges include managing the energy sector, water resources, urbanization issues, and environmental protection amidst rapid economic growth. Ahluwalia noted India's success in meeting growth targets but highlighted persistent income and wealth inequality. India's economy is rebounding from the 2009 slowdown with real GDP growth reaching 8.5% in FY2011. The Planning Commission aims for 10% annual growth in the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-2017). However, India faces obstacles like poverty, poor infrastructure, corruption, inflation, and fluctuating foreign investment rates. Despite economic growth, India lags in human development measures. Despite impressive economic growth, India ranks poorly in human development measures, with increasing inequalities lowering its composite score by 30% in 2010. More than half of the world's poor people live in South Asia, with 645 million Indians considered \"poor.\" Critics argue that post-1991 reforms have favored only a fraction of the population, particularly in the services sector, while neglecting agriculture and failing to alleviate poverty for at least one-third of the population. Geographically, the benefits of India's economic growth have been uneven. Recent economic growth in India has been geographically mixed, with some states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi experiencing rapid growth, while others like Uttar Pradesh continue to struggle with underdevelopment. Malnourishment rates remain high in India's poorest states, with more than half of children under five suffering from developmental problems due to inadequate nutrition. Analysts suggest that economic growth is only benefiting narrow sections of society, particularly young females who are vulnerable to malnutrition. Central government social uplift schemes have had limited success in addressing these issues. Decades of central government social uplift schemes in India have had a poor record of success due to corruption and poor administration. Despite high spending on poverty-reduction programs, food, health, and job insecurity persist. India's inadequate infrastructure is seen as a major obstacle to economic development, with calls for political reforms at the state level to improve energy and transportation services. Only a small percentage of urban sewage is treated before disposal, and few cities have local bus service. India will need to invest $1.25 trillion in energy according to a U.S. State Department official. India needs to invest $1.25 trillion in energy production, $392 billion in transportation infrastructure, and $143 billion in health care by 2030 to support its growing population. Poor infrastructure costs India 2% in annual economic growth, with urban areas being particularly affected. A lack of toilets and poor public hygiene costs India $54 billion annually. The country's electricity generation and distribution system hinders economic growth due to undercapacity and poor management, leading to frequent blackouts. India's electricity system faces challenges with brownouts and blackouts, exacerbated by illegal tapping into the grid. Efforts to reform the system are hindered by corrupt local politicians. India's transportation infrastructure also requires more investment. The country ranks moderately corrupt in Transparency International's index, contributing to a lack of confidence in the economy. India's economy is facing a \"psychological crisis of confidence\" due to widespread corruption, which is a major concern for foreign investors. The Heritage Foundation's 2011 Index of Economic Freedom ranked India as \"55% free\" and 124th out of 179 countries, citing restrictive trade policies, government involvement in finance, and high corruption levels. Inflation remains a significant issue, especially for food prices, impacting the poor disproportionately. India's inflation, particularly food inflation, has been a major concern in India, with prices rising at annual rates of up to 18% in late 2010 and early 2011. The Reserve Bank of India has raised interest rates multiple times in an effort to reduce inflation, which has been attributed in part to the government debt crisis in Europe. Prime Minister Singh has warned that inflation rates above 8% are unsustainable and pose a serious threat to future economic growth. Rising food and crude oil prices have raised fears that India's high inflation rates may be structural rather than cyclical, due to supply constraints, shortages of skilled labor, and rising expectations among the populace. India has seen a drop in FDI and stock index in early 2011 due to bureaucratic hurdles, corruption scandals, and high inflation. Despite this, FDI levels started rising again by mid-2011, with a significant increase in June. The government also halted a $12 billion steel plant project in June, which was later approved after a five-year delay. The government's aim for economic development in India is hindered by protests from farmers' families blocking a project site, causing indefinite delays. India struggles with unemployment, underemployment, and bureaucratic red tape, relying on capital-intensive sectors like IT rather than labor-intensive manufacturing. Rural areas lack employment alternatives to agriculture. India's monetary policy is influenced by various pressures, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) playing a key role in regulating the financial sector. The government and RBI maintain a conservative approach to financial regulation to prevent excessive risk-taking. The RBI faces a dilemma in balancing economic growth by potentially lowering interest rates while also considering inflation concerns that may require raising interest rates. India's high interest rates are a factor in its financial landscape. India's high interest rates, ranging from 11% to 14%, have attracted capital inflows and strengthened the rupee. The RBI manages the exchange rate to support exports. India's bureaucratic system remains complex, with multiple layers of government and regulatory agencies. Energy security is crucial for India's economic growth, requiring a national energy policy and diversified energy sources. India is calling for an integrated national energy policy, diversification of energy supplies, greater efficiency, and rationalization of pricing mechanisms. The country aims to increase electricity generation by five-fold by 2030. The U.S. government is assisting India in developing stable energy markets through the U.S.-India Energy Dialogue. India was the world's fourth largest energy consumer in 2009 and is expected to become the third largest by the middle of this century. Power generation in India more than doubled from 1991 to 2005, with energy demands projected to quadruple by 2035. India's energy demands are expected to quadruple by 2035, requiring a 4% annual increase in energy consumption while reducing energy intensity. As of March 2011, India's power generation capacity mix was 54% coal, 22% hydro, 11% renewables, 10% gas, and 3% nuclear. India is a major coal producer and importer, with efforts to develop coalbed methane despite concerns about emissions and water resources. About 70% of India's oil is imported, mostly from the West Asia/Middle East region. India's energy demands are expected to quadruple by 2035, with a significant reliance on coal for power generation. India has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004, and hydropower is a growing sector, especially in the northeast. Nuclear power accounts for less than 3% of electricity generation. Transmission losses and lack of access to electricity in rural areas are major challenges in India's power sector. India aims to increase energy production by 65% in less than a decade, leading to a rise in demand for coal-fired power plants. The country's heavy reliance on oil imports poses strategic and economic risks, prompting a shift towards alternative energy sources and energy efficiency. New Delhi has set targets for renewable energy usage and forest conservation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. India plans to expand forest cover to create a new carbon sink and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. The Government of India aims to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels by developing alternative energy sources like solar. The Solar Mission's Plan faces challenges in increasing solar energy production to 20 gigawatts by 2020. The Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme was initiated to set efficiency standards for power plants, steel mills, and cement plants. India's land is under stress with 2% of the world's surface area, 4% of its fresh water, and 17% of its population. Over 70% of Indians depend on farm incomes, with 65% of Indian farms reliant on rainfall. Climate change is putting pressure on agricultural production due to degraded soils and water shortages. Approximately 45% of Indian land is seriously degraded. Groundwater depletion is causing erratic rainfall, with the water table in India's northwest falling by 1.6 inches per year. Global climate change is expected to lead to sea level rise and more intense weather events like cyclones in India. Climate change in India is expected to lead to more intense weather events like cyclones and alter monsoon patterns, affecting agricultural production and food security. Rising temperatures will also cause Himalayan glacial melt, impacting river flow. Agricultural yield growth has slowed, and there is a need for new crop varieties that require less water. India's National Action Plan on Climate Change aims to develop new wheat and rice varieties that use less water, promote sustainable energy sources like solar power, and focus on economic growth while emphasizing ecological sustainability. The plan includes components such as solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, water conservation, and sustainable agriculture. India could reduce its carbon footprint by half by 2030 through significant investment in energy efficiency. The Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change approved a National Mission for a Green India Initiative with plans for significant investment in India's forests. Despite some moves towards renewable energy, India has not taken a leadership role in addressing climate change globally due to concerns about hindering economic development. India's low per capita CO2 emissions compared to the US, UK, and China are projected to rise by 2030. Climate change could strain relations between India and the West, as both India and China fear that global carbon emission containment efforts will impede economic growth. Diplomatic finesse will be needed to align India with global climate change initiatives. The United States and India have collaborated on energy efficiency and carbon reduction projects, including the development of clean coal technologies and smart grids. Prime Minister Singh and President Obama launched a Clean Energy and Climate Change Initiative to enhance cooperation on energy security, energy efficiency, and clean energy. The November 2009 MoU aims to strengthen their global strategic partnership. India and China share the view that the Kyoto Protocol should be extended beyond 2012 to secure commitments from developed nations to reduce emissions. While India has pledged reductions under the Copenhagen accord, it is not bound by them. Developed nations pushed for a legally binding successor to the Kyoto Protocol during a meeting in Tianjin in October 2010, but India and China resisted accepting firm emissions goals. Developing nations argue that developed countries should do more to reduce emissions, given that they have historically been the main contributors to carbon emissions. India is also undergoing military transformation. India is transforming its military to have global reach, with a defense budget of over $38 billion in 2010. The army dominates with over 1 million personnel, but the navy and air force are gaining importance. The air force procurement budget for 2011 is $6.8 billion, while the army receives $4 billion and the navy $3 billion. The military expansion is in response to security threats, such as the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. In response to the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, India increased its security spending, focusing on enhancing the navy's surveillance capabilities, strengthening the National Security Guard, and raising new Border Security Force battalions. Defense planners shifted attention towards China, with discussions on the \"Cold Start\" doctrine to address escalatory issues with Pakistan's nuclear deterrent. The \"Cold Start\" doctrine was developed by India in response to Pakistani provocations in 2002, aiming for rapid retaliatory strikes with integrated battle groups. Despite official denials by Indian military leaders, leaked U.S. diplomatic cables suggest government endorsement of the doctrine. Concerns exist about logistical challenges, limited government support, and the risk of escalation above the nuclear threshold. The Indian military operates over 4,100 main battle tanks, including Russian-built T-72s and T-55s, along with 4,000 towed artillery tubes. The navy has 23 surface combatants, 16 submarines, and 17 landing ships capable of carrying troops and tanks. They have also developed a nuclear-powered attack submarine armed with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. India's military plans to arm its submarines with nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and lease a Russian Akula-class boat for sea-based strategic deterrence. The air force operates a variety of combat aircraft, including Russian MiGs, Su-30 MKIs, French Mirage, and Anglo-French Jaguar aircraft. The Strategic Forces Command oversees a significant number of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads, with plans to field new missiles with intercontinental capabilities. India has been named the world's largest weapons importer, accounting for 9% of global arms imports from 2006 to present. India remains the world's largest weapons importer, accounting for 9% of global arms imports from 2006 to present. The country's military focuses on tank and missile acquisitions, aircraft carrier and submarine programs, and acquiring advanced Russian-made Su-30 fighters. Russia is the main supplier of India's defense wares, with India willing to accept less advanced technology for lower costs and supplier reliability. India's economic growth has increased procurement budgets, allowing for larger defense purchases. New Delhi's rapid economic growth has boosted its procurement budgets, enabling the purchase of advanced weaponry. Israel and Russia are key defense exporters to India, with arms trade exceeding $2 billion annually. India is shifting towards co-production with foreign suppliers for advanced military imports. Deals with Russia and France involve technology transfers and joint development projects for fighter jets and submarines. India plans to replace its aging MiG-21 fighters with up to 186 new jets. India plans to purchase 186 new jets (126 for the air force and 60 for the navy) to replace its aging MiG-21 fighters. Recent military purchases include T-90 tanks, missile frigates, MiG-29K naval jets, Su-30s, and jet trainers. Efforts to modernize the armed forces may have little impact without major policy and organizational adjustments. India's efforts to modernize its armed forces, including improving procurement processes and creating a Chief of Defense Staff position, may not significantly enhance its ability to address security threats. Despite some improvements, transparency and corruption issues persist. The Kashmir conflict remains a major challenge, with daily casualties reported from gun battles and bomb blasts. Global attention is drawn to the territorial dispute with Pakistan over Kashmiri sovereignty. The Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan has been a major challenge since 1989, with global attention on the potential for interstate war. Despite a decrease in militant incidents, accusations of brutal tactics by New Delhi and support for separatist rebellion by Pakistan persist. The conflict continues to be a flashpoint for violence and territorial disputes. The Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan has been ongoing since 1989, with accusations of human rights abuses by India and support for separatist rebels by Pakistan. The US believes the issue should be resolved through negotiations between the two countries, with consideration for the wishes of the Kashmiri people. President Obama stated in 2010 that the US cannot impose a solution but is willing to help reduce tensions. The Kashmir problem stems from competing claims to the former princely state, divided by a Line of Control since 1948. India and Pakistan have fought wars over Kashmir, with some Kashmiris seeking independence. The US and UN are willing to help reduce tensions, but the UN only intervenes if both countries request it. The Kashmir conflict dates back to wars in 1947-1948 and 1965, with ongoing separatist violence in Indian-held Kashmir since rigged elections in 1989. Thousands have died in the conflict, with many Kashmiris disappearing and unmarked graves discovered. Various separatist groups, like JKLF and HuM, seek independence or union with Pakistan. The Hurriyat Conference was formed in 1993 to oppose Indian rule in Kashmir. The Hurriyat Conference, formed in 1993, is an organization opposing Indian rule in Kashmir. It consists of over 20 political and religious groups, including the JKLF and Jamaat-e-Islami. The group calls for a tripartite conference on Kashmir involving Pakistan, India, and Kashmiri representatives. In 2003, the Hurriyat split between hardliners and moderates, with efforts to reunify failing. In 2005, the Congress Party-led government engaged in high-level talks with moderate Hurriyat leaders. Levels of violence in Kashmir were high and steady through the mid- and late 1990s, peaked in 2001, and have been in steady decline since. The reduction in violence has allowed for a revival of the region's tourist industry. However, the issue of Kashmir continues to be a major obstacle in the India-Pakistan peace initiative. In reaction to their marginalization, separatist militants in Kashmir continue attacks on civilians and Indian security forces. Many believe Pakistan still supports Kashmiri militants. Despite moves towards peaceful resolution, militants resort to violent attacks to maintain relevance. In 2010, protests turned violent, leading to deaths and deployment of Indian army troops to restore order. Separatist leaders called for calm as civil unrest spread in Indian Kashmir. The unrest in Indian Kashmir escalated into a \"full-blown separatist uprising\" with large numbers of youths hurling stones at security personnel. New Delhi imposed an indefinite curfew in September, but the central government and Chief Minister Omar Abdullah were unable to quell the protests. International human rights groups urged the Indian government to avoid excessive force, while Prime Minister Singh convened a meeting to address the crisis and announced efforts to reduce the presence of security forces. In response to the separatist uprising in Indian Kashmir, Chief Minister Abdullah ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 paramilitary personnel as part of a peace initiative. Prime Minister Singh emphasized the need for security forces to develop nonlethal response methods following the 2010 protests. Hurriyat leaders discouraged further protests, with even separatist leader Geelani speaking out against stone throwing as a form of resistance. In October 2010, the UPA government appointed a trio of official and unofficial \"mediators\" to find a political solution for the unrest in Kashmir. The team's composition was criticized, and their preliminary recommendations included expediting cases of under-trials, permitting peaceful protests, and identifying jobs for young men and women. The UPA government appointed mediators in October 2010 to address unrest in Kashmir. Their efforts included training security forces, creating jobs, scholarships for Kashmiri students, and increasing assistance to widows and orphans. However, their focus on engaging only with pro-India Kashmiris and lack of dialogue with separatists and Pakistan hindered progress. The UPA government appointed mediators in October 2010 to address unrest in Kashmir, focusing on engaging with pro-India Kashmiris. However, progress was hindered by the lack of dialogue with separatists and Pakistan. Critics argue that key breakthroughs in Kashmir are made without government involvement, and resolution lies in maintaining pressure on violent separatists while empowering moderate Hurriyat figures. Kashmiri separatist leaders demand lifting of AFSPA, troop withdrawal, and release of political prisoners for talks with New Delhi. Chief Minister Abdullah criticizes Hurriyat leaders for not engaging with government interlocutors but meeting with Pakistani officials. State politicians advocate for dialogue with New Delhi as the way forward. Independent analyses suggest economic development and political devolution to address Kashmiri discontent, with a focus on a large-scale jobs program for the region. A large-scale jobs program for the region could be the most effective policy to address the growing numbers of disaffected Kashmiri youth. Despite initiatives like job training programs and language courses, without a substantive political settlement, these measures are seen as conflict management only. India's internal instability due to diversity is further complicated by colonial legacies, creating regional flashpoints. India faces internal instability due to borders that separate ethnic groups, leading to regional dissidence and separatism. Maoist rebels and separatist insurgents in remote northeast regions pose serious threats to internal sovereignty. Communal violence between Hindus and Muslims, especially in Gujarat, is a recurring issue. More than half of India's administrative districts experience chronic insurgent and terrorist activity. In India, 636 administrative districts face chronic activity by insurgent, terrorist, and separatist groups. The State Department's report on terrorism highlighted the decline in terrorist violence in 2010 but noted the loss of nearly 1,900 lives, making India one of the most terrorism-afflicted countries. Naxalites, Maoist insurgents active in east-central India, claim to fight oppression and exploitation for a classless society, while their opponents label them as terrorists and extortionists. Prime Minister Singh identified the Maoist insurgency as a significant threat in 2006. In 2006, Prime Minister Singh warned of a growing Maoist insurgency in India, with over 8,000 fighters operating in 20 states. The violence has claimed over 5,000 lives in six years, posing a threat to India's democracy and economy. The People's War Group and Maoist Communist Center are prominent militant outfits in the country. In 2004, the People's War Group and Maoist Communist Center merged to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist), designated as terrorist organizations by the Indian government. The Chhattisgarh state government sponsored the \"Salwa Judum\" militia in 2005, viewed as a grassroots anti-Maoist effort but criticized for its coercive tactics. The Salwa Judum campaign, supported by the Chhattisgarh government, was criticized by the Human Rights Commission and Human Rights Watch for human rights abuses. India's Supreme Court banned arming tribal militias to fight Maoists, and there is a debate on using a militarized approach or a development/welfare approach to address the Maoist rebellion. Naxalite activity is increasing due to ineffective Indian government policies. Shortage of police personnel hinders their ability to combat rebels. Top Indian leaders view Maoist rebels as a major security threat, deploying 60,000 paramilitary forces to affected states. New Delhi plans to increase assistance by providing more helicopters, establishing police stations, and improving road connectivity in affected areas. The Indian government is taking measures to address Naxalite activity, including creating a Unified Command for anti-Naxal operations in four most-affected states. However, efforts do not address the \"intellectual appeal\" of the Maoists. Prime Minister Singh noted a reduction in Maoist violence in 2010 but an increase in civilian casualties. The government seeks to implement an \"Integrated Action Plan\" for 60 districts in affected areas to control resources at the district level. Maoist militants continue to stage attacks on civilians and security forces. Maoist militants in India have been carrying out attacks on civilian and security targets, with a notable ambush in 2010 that killed 75 paramilitary soldiers. The violence in India's northeast region, involving various militant groups fighting for ethnic autonomy and tribal rights, has resulted in over 50,000 deaths since 1948. The violence in India's northeast region has resulted in over 50,000 deaths since 1948, with various militant groups fighting for ethnic autonomy and tribal rights. In Manipur alone, there are more than 20 separatist groups fighting the Indian army, resulting in over 8,000 lives lost in two decades. The central government's control in the region remains weak, and observers suggest that economic development and integration are key to resolving ethnic conflicts. Fatalities linked to separatist militancy in the northeast decreased significantly in 2010, indicating potential effectiveness of such policies. In India's northeast region, various militant groups, including ULFA, are fighting for ethnic autonomy and tribal rights. ULFA accuses New Delhi of exploiting resources and neglecting development, leading to conflict with the central government. The U.S. State Department listed ULFA as a concern in 2005. In 2011, a mutual agreement was signed between the central government and ULFA. In September 2011, the central government and ULFA signed a ceasefire agreement. Hindu-Muslim conflict in India has led to violent communal clashes, including the demolition of a mosque in Ayodhya in 1992 and terrorist bombings in Mumbai in 1993. In 2002, riots erupted in Gujarat after a visit to the Babri Mosque site. In 2002, riots erupted in Gujarat after a visit to the Ayodhya site of the razed Babri Mosque, resulting in 58 deaths. Up to 2,000 people died in the communal rioting that followed, with most victims being Muslims. The BJP-led state and national governments faced criticism for their inaction, with some suggesting complicity in anti-Muslim attacks. In 2011, a court found 31 Muslims guilty of setting fire to a train, leading to 11 death sentences and 20 life imprisonments. The U.S. State Department and human rights groups criticized New Delhi's efforts to bring those responsible for the riots to justice. The State Department denied a U.S. visa to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi due to his alleged involvement in severe violations of religious freedom. Despite being exonerated by a Gujarat state government commission in 2008, concerns remain about obstacles faced by victims seeking justice, internal displacement of families, and uninvestigated criminal cases related to the Gujarat riots. In September 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that Hindus and Muslims should share the Ayodhya site. In May 2011, India's Supreme Court suspended the ruling on the Ayodhya site, citing unnecessary litigation. India faces indigenous Islamist terrorism, with the \"Indian Mujahideen\" group implicated in bombings. The group was outlawed in 2010 and claimed responsibility for a bombing in Varanasi in 2010. In July 2011, three synchronized bomb blasts in Mumbai killed 17 people and injured around 130 during rush hour. No credible claims of responsibility were received, but Indian officials suspect India-based groups like the Indian Mujahideen (IM). The group's top operators, linked to SIMI, may receive training in Pakistan. Prime Minister Singh acknowledged the involvement of \"local elements\" in terrorist attacks, adding a new dimension to India's indigenous militancy problem. SIMI is seen as part of the international jihadi movement. India's indigenous militancy problem includes groups like SIMI, which align with the international jihadi movement and have links to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. The country also faces threats from militant Hindu nationalist groups, as seen in the 2008 Malegaon bombings where members of a \"Hindu terrorist cell\" were arrested, including an army lieutenant colonel and a Hindu nun with ties to the BJP. In late 2010, Hindutva extremist Swami Aseemanand confessed to involvement in terrorist attacks previously blamed on Islamist militants, including bombings in Malegaon and on the Samjhauta Express. Aseemanand claimed these attacks were in retaliation for Islamist terrorist acts on Hindu temples, sparking concerns about militant majoritarianism among Hindu nationalists in India. In 2008, violent attacks on Orissa Christians were seen as retaliation for the murder of a Hindu leader, leading to the burning of churches and displacement of thousands. Hindu radicals blamed local Christians for the murder, sparking concerns about religious freedom and political agendas. Communal strife in India in 2008, sparked by Hindu nationalist parties, led to violence against Christians. The country conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, possessing an estimated 60-100 warheads and producing plutonium for weapons. India claims a \"credible minimum deterrent\" for nuclear arms but lacks a clear definition. India conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, possessing an estimated 60-100 warheads and producing plutonium for weapons. India claims a \"credible minimum deterrent\" for nuclear arms but lacks a clear definition. The U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement and the 2008 Nuclear Suppliers Group decision have renewed New Delhi's access to the international uranium market, resulting in more indigenous Indian uranium available for weapons. India has refused to sign the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) or accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards on all of its nuclear material and facilities. Resolution 1172 urged India to adhere to NPT, CTBT, and refrain from developing nuclear-capable missiles. Despite resistance, India expressed commitment to global nuclear disarmament and proposed a Nuclear Weapons Convention for eliminating nuclear weapons globally. India has shown commitment to global nuclear disarmament by supporting the elimination of nuclear weapons within a specified timeframe and participating in negotiations for a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. Despite not signing the CTBT, India has imposed a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing and pledged to improve nuclear security standards. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced the establishment of a Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership in India, involving international participation from the IAEA and other foreign partners. The Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership in India, supported by the IAEA and other foreign partners, aims to enhance nuclear security. The United States and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2010 for cooperative activities at the center. Concerns were raised in a 2011 meeting about Pakistan's weapons proliferation and India's potential nuclear doctrine changes. The United States supports India's economic reform policies and bilateral trade relations. In 2010, U.S. exports to India totaled $19.222 billion, while imports from India were $29.531 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $10.309 billion. India was the 12th largest trading partner for the United States in 2010. The top imports from India to the United States include precious gems, pharmaceutical products, and mineral fuels. The cross-trade in precious gems and stones reflects a strong interrelationship between the two nations' industries. India is a major global supplier of precious gems and stones, while the United States is a major supplier of finished jewelry. In 2009, U.S. private services exports to India totaled $9.940 billion, with imports from India totaling $12.377 billion. The leading U.S. service export to India was education, while the leading service import from India was \"business, professional, and technical services.\" Annual inward foreign direct investment (FDI) to India has significantly increased over the years, with the stock of U.S. FDI in India standing at $9.4 billion as of March 2011. Major U.S.-based companies like Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, and IBM have made multi-billion-dollar investments in India. U.S.-based companies Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, and IBM have made multi-billion-dollar investments in India. Harley-Davidson opened a motorcycle manufacturing plant in India's Haryana state. Ford Motor Company plans to invest $1 billion in a new factory in Gujarat. Boeing projected India to spend $150 billion on new airplanes. India is also a fast-growing investor in the U.S., with Tata Group being a significant investor. The Tata Group, a major investor in the U.S., employs 19,000 people there. Key economic and trade issues between India and the U.S. include intellectual property rights, technology trade, market access, and participation in the GSP program. Commerce Secretary Locke led a trade mission to India in 2011 with 24 U.S. companies seeking deals. Commerce Secretary Locke led a trade mission to India in 2011 with 24 U.S. companies seeking weapons sales deals and capitalizing on the 2008 U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement. He raised issues of market access barriers and intellectual property protection, emphasizing the need for India to open its economy by reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and lifting restrictions on foreign direct investment. Locke highlighted the importance of a level playing field for American companies in India. In 2011, U.S. officials highlighted economic impediments for American exporters in gaining access to Indian markets, especially in agriculture. They emphasized the need to address trade and investment barriers to foster market openings for increased trade. The outgoing U.S. Ambassador emphasized the importance of a two-way street in the global partnership with India. The U.S. officials have urged India to implement economic reforms, particularly addressing restrictions on imports of solar power technology. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee agreed to enhance bilateral trade and investment links during a meeting in 2011. The U.S. urged India to ease investment barriers for economic benefits and integration. Intellectual property rights protection is a contentious issue between the two countries, with India on the U.S. Special 301 \"Priority Watch List\" in 2011. The U.S. acknowledged India's progress on enforcement but raised concerns about piracy and counterfeiting. India criticizes U.S. pressure on developing nations. India remains critical of U.S. efforts to pressure developing nations to adopt pharmaceutical laws favoring major companies. The U.S.-India High-Technology Cooperation Group discusses bilateral high technology commerce. A 123 Agreement on civil nuclear cooperation was concluded in 2007, addressing concerns about India's nuclear program and dual-use technology trade. Since 1998, concerns have been raised in the United States about India's ability to control the distribution of dangerous technology. Several Indian entities have been placed on the U.S. export control \"Entity List\" for weapons proliferation activities. Modifications to export licensing policies were made in 2004 and 2005, removing certain Indian entities from the list. In January 2011, more Indian space- and defense-related companies were removed from the Entity List. The United States seeks greater access to India's domestic markets, especially for agricultural goods. India's trade and investment barriers have been criticized by U.S. officials and business leaders for hindering economic development and U.S.-India ties. India is accused of using SPS regulations to limit U.S. agricultural imports, while India argues that U.S. farm subsidies harm its farmers. Multi-brand foreign retailers like Wal-Mart and Target are still prohibited in India to protect small local shops. The U.S.-India Business Council advocates for liberalization and greater international participation in India to create new employment opportunities and modernize supply chain management. India is a beneficiary developing country in the U.S. GSP program, facing debates in Congress over its eligibility. India is pushing for negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty with the United States. The United States and India are in talks for a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) that could lead to a free trade agreement (FTA) and increase foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. However, progress has been slow since initial discussions in 2009. The U.S. risks missing out on business opportunities as India pursues trade agreements with other countries. A U.S.-India BIT could benefit American investors and demonstrate a long-term economic commitment to Asia. Visiting Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk agreed to fast-track technical negotiations for an early conclusion of a BIT. India seeks greater access to the U.S. services market, particularly for Indian professionals. India wants the U.S. to increase or remove the limit on H1-B visas and views the U.S. farm subsidy program as providing unfair trade advantage to U.S. agricultural exports. India views the U.S. farm subsidy program as unfair, hindering progress in trade negotiations. The Doha Round was suspended in 2006 due to disagreements over reducing subsidies and increasing market access. India seeks more market access for its goods and services in developed countries. India resists opening its markets to subsidized agricultural products from developed countries, citing harm to Indian farmers and indigenous industries. The WTO's focus on economic issues excludes political and social variables important to New Delhi. Lowered farm subsidies in developed countries could benefit the Indian economy, but reducing tariffs may harm exporting sectors like textiles and garments. India's exporting sectors, especially textiles and garments, are protected by tariffs. Bilateral space cooperation with the United States has potential, with discussions on human space flight and Earth observation cooperation for agricultural productivity. Despite a setback in India's space program in 2010, opportunities for collaboration have increased with the removal of trade obstacles by the U.S. Commerce Department. India's GSLV faced a failure 47 seconds after launch, leading to the destruction of its telecommunications satellite payload. The GSLV's 50% success rate raises doubts about its reliability for commercial satellite launches. India's non-signatory status to the NPT limited its access to nuclear technology for over three decades, leading to the creation of export control regimes like the NSG. New Delhi criticized the NPT for creating a \"nuclear apartheid\" that allows some states to possess nuclear weapons while restricting others. Senior Indian officials believe that a civil nuclear deal with the United States was necessary to remove constraints on India from technology denial regimes. This shift in policy aimed to grant India the same benefits as other states with advanced nuclear technology. This move was crucial for India to access global trade in dual-use and nuclear technologies, overcoming past differences with the U.S. and paving the way for more extensive bilateral relations. President Bush promised to work on achieving full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with India, marking a reversal of U.S. nonproliferation policy. India agreed to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities and place the former under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. After difficult negotiations, U.S. legislation allowing a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with India became law in December 2006. President Bush signed the agreement into law in October 2008. In December 2006, U.S. legislation allowed for peaceful nuclear cooperation with India, which was signed into law by President Bush in October 2008. In September 2008, the NSG exempted India from some export requirements, enabling nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries. The U.S.-India nuclear initiative aimed for policy alignment with U.S. interests, with lasting symbolic effects. The U.S.-India nuclear initiative aimed to align policies with U.S. interests, but skeptics doubt its strategic benefits. Indian anti-colonial sentiments and independent foreign policy choices may hinder geopolitical benefits. Despite arguments for bringing India into the \"nonproliferation mainstream,\" no significant changes have been made to India's nuclear-weapons policies, and nuclear trade with U.S. companies has not yet begun. The U.S. and India signed an agreement on a reprocessing facility in India in July 2010. India insisted on the agreement before signing contracts with U.S. nuclear firms. Despite this, concerns remain about India's policies on liability for nuclear reactor operators and suppliers. India signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage in October 2010, but nuclear trade with U.S. companies has not started yet. India's Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, adopted in August 2010, is not consistent with the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC). U.S. officials have urged India to align its law with the CSC to ensure compliance. Despite India signing the CSC, additional steps are needed to address U.S. concerns about liability policies. India is urged by U.S. officials to ratify the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) and align its liability policies with international requirements. India plans to ratify the CSC by the end of 2011 and is consulting with domestic and foreign companies on framing regulations. Discussions are ongoing between Washington and New Delhi on monitoring arrangements for U.S. nuclear exports. India is urged by U.S. officials to ratify the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) and align its liability policies with international requirements. Discussions are ongoing between Washington and New Delhi on monitoring arrangements for U.S. nuclear exports to ensure accountability for nuclear materials, equipment, and technology sold to India. Defense cooperation between the United States and India is developing, with a focus on military ties. The India-U.S. Defense Policy Group (DPG) was revived in 2001 after India's nuclear tests and U.S. sanctions. The most recent session in March 2011 reaffirmed the importance of ongoing bilateral defense cooperation, focusing on joint military exercises, arms sales, and collaboration in multilateral operations, defense trade, technology transfers, and missile defense. The India-U.S. Defense Policy Group (DPG) was revived in 2001 after India's nuclear tests and U.S. sanctions, focusing on joint military exercises, arms sales, and collaboration in defense trade, technology transfers, and missile defense. A Maritime Security Cooperation Agreement in 2006 commits both countries to comprehensive cooperation in protecting the free flow of commerce and addressing threats to maritime security. The United States is fully committed to strengthening ties with India through the enhancement of their defense relationship. The Senate Armed Services Committee is committed to enhancing the U.S.-India security cooperation to strengthen ties and promote mutual national interests. Increased security ties are seen as a potential counterbalance to Chinese influence in Asia, with shared values and a new balance-of-power arrangement in the region identified as areas of convergence. The emerging \"strategic partnership\" between the United States and India includes increased intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation, as well as efforts to safeguard critical infrastructures from cyber attacks through initiatives like the U.S.-India Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism and the Indo-U.S. Cyber Security Forum. Top U.S. and Indian strategic planners have divergent perceptions and expectations on key issues such as the role of Pakistan, policies towards the Afghan insurgency, India's relations with Iran, and repressive governments in countries like Burma and Sudan. The U.S.-India Defense Relationship aims to defeat terrorism and violent extremism through mutual defense capabilities. Counterterrorism cooperation is a key pillar of the bilateral relationship, involving exchanges of best practices, joint military training exercises, and collaboration in international forums. The FBI and State Department provide training and share expertise with Indian law enforcement officials. The Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance program has conducted training courses for Indian law enforcement officials, with CIA and FBI personnel assisting in investigating terrorist attacks in India. In 2010, India was granted access to David Headley, an American national involved in the 2008 Mumbai assault. U.S.-India partnerships in security cooperation were highlighted, including plans for a National Counterterrorism Center in India. Lingering distrust of the United States remains a significant factor. Lingering distrust of the United States was evident after prior warnings about LeT intentions to attack Mumbai were revealed. Despite denials of withholding intelligence from India, skepticism remained. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano promoted counterterrorism cooperation during her visit to New Delhi and Mumbai in May 2011. A U.S.-India Homeland Security dialogue was established under the Strategic Dialogue, focusing on law enforcement issues like counternarcotics and illicit financing. Since early 2002, the United States and India have strengthened military relations through joint exercises, including \"Cope India\" air exercises, Special Forces training, and annual \"Malabar\" naval exercises. These activities aim to improve interoperability and deepen the bilateral defense relationship, attracting interest from countries like China and Pakistan. China and Pakistan closely monitor the growing military relations between the United States and India, viewing it as a potential precursor to a formal defense alliance. India is investing heavily in modernizing its military, with a projected $100 billion expenditure over the next decade. This has attracted U.S. weapons manufacturers and security companies looking to tap into India's market for advanced military equipment. While some see increased defense trade as a way to improve U.S.-India relations, many Indians remain cautious about deepening defense ties with the U.S. due to concerns about potential future conditions or restrictions. India's Army Chief expressed frustration with the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program in 2010, citing potential constraints on New Delhi's foreign policy freedom. Despite this, major defense sales from the U.S. to India have increased, including the sale of sophisticated military hardware. Notable sales include 12 counter-battery radar sets in 2002 and the purchase of the USS Trenton in 2006. In 2007, the INS Jalashwa, the second-largest ship in the Indian navy, set sail for India with six surplus Sikorsky UH-3H Sea King helicopters. The U.S. authorized the transfer of two Osprey-class coastal minehunter ships to India in 2010. A deal in 2008 sent six C-130J Hercules military transport aircraft to India, valued at nearly $1 billion. In 2009, India signed a $2.1 billion deal for eight P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft from Boeing. In 2009, India signed a $2.1 billion deal for eight P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft from Boeing, which also provide anti-submarine warfare capabilities. This sale set a new record as the largest-ever U.S. arms transfer to India. Other potential upcoming sales include 22 Boeing AH-64D Apache attack helicopters, along with accompanying General Electric engines, radars, missiles, training, and other support worth an estimated $1.4 billion. India is looking to purchase various military equipment, including 145 lightweight M777 towed howitzers, 26 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and 32 Mk-54 torpedoes. The most lucrative potential sale is for 126 new medium, multi-role combat aircraft, with Lockheed Martin's F-16 and Boeing's F/A-18 competing against other aircraft. In 2009, General Electric won a bid to provide India with jet engines for its Tejas light combat aircraft. However, in 2011, India announced it would not look to American firms for the larger aircraft sale. Some Indian officials are concerned about the United States being an unreliable partner for defense cooperation, leading to New Delhi's resistance to sign certain agreements. This includes the CISMoA, BECA, and LSA, which are opposed by influential Indian politicians for being intrusive. The issue was not addressed during the July 2011 Strategic Dialogue talks. New Delhi resisted signing certain agreements with the United States due to concerns about being an unreliable defense partner. Despite U.S. claims that lack of access to American equipment hampers India's military capabilities, Indian officials reported that the absence of these agreements does not significantly impact their operational abilities. In 2004, India sought to replace their aging fleet of MiG-21 combat aircraft due to frequent crashes. Requests For Information were issued to potential vendors, including Lockheed Martin, Dassault, Saab, and Mikoyan. By 2011, the competition narrowed down to the French Rafale and the Eurofighter, with the decision based on technical assessments of the aircraft. The Rafale and Typhoon were deemed best for India's air force needs, disappointing the US. India's choice sparked debate over the reasons behind it, with criticism from US and Indian analysts. The Indian decision to choose the Rafale and Typhoon for its air force needs sparked debate over the reasons behind it, with some analysts criticizing India for potentially damaging the U.S.-India partnership due to concerns about U.S. reliability as an arms supplier and annoyance with U.S. arms supplies to Pakistan. Supply reliability and technology transfer were also key factors in the decision-making process. The Indian decision to select Rafale and Typhoon for its air force raised concerns about U.S. reliability as an arms supplier and alignment with the United States. Some viewed it as a signal of discomfort with closer ties with the U.S., while others saw it as a normal diversification of strategic relationships. The overall relationship was not seen as diminished by this decision. The Indian decision to select Rafale and Typhoon for its air force raised concerns about U.S. reliability as an arms supplier and alignment with the United States. However, there was no \"strategic rebuff\" of the United States, and Indian doubts about American reliability in arms trade have diminished in recent years. The Indian procurement process worked as intended, divorced from political considerations, and corruption scandals in New Delhi did not play a significant role. The main threats to the defense partnership stem from a lack of vision, focus, and determination to create a strategic affiliation that serves common interests. The State Department's recent Country Report on Human Rights Practices for India highlights major human rights problems, including extrajudicial killings, protester deaths, and police brutality. Weak law enforcement and lack of accountability contribute to ongoing abuses in the country. The State Department's recent Country Report on Human Rights Practices for India highlighted various human rights issues, including weak law enforcement, lack of accountability, lengthy court backlogs, poor prison conditions, corruption at all levels, and violence related to caste bias, domestic violence, child marriage, bonded labor, and female feticide. The 2011 World Report of Human Rights Watch highlighted serious issues in India, including deaths, honor crimes, and female feticide. Insurgents in Jammu and Kashmir, Northeastern States, and the Naxalite belt committed abuses such as torture, rape, and killings. Authorities made little progress in reforming the police, improving healthcare, education, and food security, and protecting the rights of marginalized groups. Constraints on religious freedom for minorities were also a concern. India's Muslim and Christian minorities face violent persecution, along with caste-based discrimination, female infanticide, and \"honor killings.\" The State Department has attributed human rights abuses in India to its hierarchical social structure, ethnic and religious tensions, secessionist movements, and deficient police methods. The government's treatment of militants and terrorists can be severe and potentially unlawful, with the Armed Forces Special Powers Act granting security forces impunity in conflict zones. The Armed Forces Special Powers Act in India allows security forces to act with impunity in conflict zones, leading to human rights abuses. Reports of torture by security forces in Kashmir have been presented to U.S. officials. A 2010 report highlighted the rise in torture and prison deaths in India, criticizing the government for not addressing these issues. Human Rights Watch identified numerous human rights violations in India's treatment of terrorism in a 2011 report. India's treatment of terrorism suspects in India has been criticized for serious human rights violations, including unlawful abuses and sedition charges against activists. The colonial-era sedition law has been used to silence dissent, with activists like Dr. Binayak Sen and Arundhati Roy facing threats. Human Rights Watch has called for the repeal of this law. Despite being officially secular, India has faced challenges in maintaining religious tolerance, with periodic lapses in its Hindu-majority population. India's religious tolerance is protected by the government, but human rights groups warn of susceptibility to attacks by extremists. The Hindu majority of 82% coexists with a significant Muslim minority of 14%, while other religious groups make up less than 4% of the population. The government generally respects and protects religious freedom, but some state and local governments impose limits on this freedom. The national government, led by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), upholds an inclusive and secular platform. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) in India implements an inclusive and secular platform, respecting religious freedom. Despite the rejection of Hindutva by the national government, some state and local governments are influenced by it. The law provides remedies for violations of religious freedom, but enforcement is hindered by lack of trained police and corruption. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom noted India's mixed progress in protecting religious freedom, with slow and often ineffective justice for victims of communal violence. Positive steps have been taken by the central and state governments to address past issues. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom placed India on a \"Watch List\" due to violations of religious freedom, urging the U.S. government to assist New Delhi in protecting religious minorities and addressing violent attacks. The Hindu caste system and the challenges faced by lower castes, including the Dalits, were also highlighted. The U.S. State Department notes that legislation in India to protect lower castes has had limited impact, with few convictions for offenses against disadvantaged persons. In the 110th Congress, a resolution addressing untouchability in India was passed by the House but not considered by the Senate. India is also highlighted as a source, destination, and transit country for human trafficking. India is a source, destination, and transit country for forced labor and sex trafficking. The government is making efforts to combat trafficking but still faces challenges, including inadequate law enforcement against bonded labor and complicity of public officials in human trafficking. India's designation as a \"Tier 2 Watch List\" country was upgraded to \"Tier 2,\" but gender discrimination and female infanticide remain growing concerns. The incidence of female infanticide and gender-selective abortions is a serious human rights problem in India. Prime Minister Singh has called female feticide a \"national shame\" and stated the government's responsibility to address the issue. The country's 2001 census revealed a significant gender imbalance, with only 927 girls aged 0-6 for every 1,000 boys nationwide. A 2006 study estimated that up to 10 million Indian females are \"missing\" due to sex-selective abortions and infanticide over the past two decades. The prevalence of these practices continues to rise. The U.S. State Department Country Report on Human Rights for India highlighted Punjab and Haryana as states with a serious issue of female feticide. India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous country for women due to high rates of female feticide, infanticide, and human trafficking. Despite receiving over $15.9 billion in U.S. aid from 1947 to 2010, there was a 35% reduction in assistance programs for India in 2007. In 2007, there was a 35% reduction in U.S. assistance programs for India, mainly affecting development assistance and food aid programs. Additional cuts were made in 2008 due to the growing Indian economy. However, under the Obama Administration, aid levels have been restored to previous amounts through increases in Global Health and Child Survival funds. USAID focuses on economic growth, health, disaster management, energy, environment, and equity in India. The United States has provided approximately $175 million in military assistance to India since 1947, with over 90% of this aid distributed between 1962-1966. Recent security-related assistance has focused on export control enhancements, counterterrorism, counternarcotics programs, and military training."
