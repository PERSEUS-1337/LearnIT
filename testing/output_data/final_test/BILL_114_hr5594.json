    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Strategy for Combating Terrorist, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act\". The Congress recognizes the direct threat of terrorism financing to national security and global stability. Terrorist groups constantly evolve, forming new threats and adapting tactics. Some terrorists have symbiotic relationships with transnational crime syndicates, blurring the lines between funding for terrorism and criminal profits. Rapid changes in methods of concealing illicit funding pose new risks for governments to detect and prevent terrorism financing. The bipartisan requirement for a national anti-money laundering strategy expired in 2007, highlighting the need for an updated strategy focused on terrorism financing. It is crucial for the Government to have a unified and annually updated strategy to combat financial crime effectively. An updated strategy to combat financial crime, including terrorism financing, is crucial for the United States and should be revised annually to address evolving threats and assist Congress in setting priorities. The development of a national strategy is essential for combating financial crime and terrorism financing, with annual revisions to address evolving threats and assist Congress in setting priorities. The President, with the Secretary of the Treasury, will develop a national strategy to combat terrorism financing and illicit finance, in consultation with various agencies.

The national strategy to combat terrorism financing and illicit finance includes addressing high-risk areas, evaluating the effectiveness of efforts, and integrating the strategy into the broader counter-terrorism strategy of the United States.
