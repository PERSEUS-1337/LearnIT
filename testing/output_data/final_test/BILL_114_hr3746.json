    "content": "The Act is titled the \"State Marihuana And Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act\" and amends the Controlled Substances Act to make it inapplicable to marihuana in certain states. The \"State Marihuana And Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act\" amends the Controlled Substances Act to exclude marihuana in states that have legalized it for recreational or medical use, provided they have a regulatory regime in place to protect Federal interests. This includes preventing distribution to minors and ensuring revenue does not support criminal enterprises. The \"State Marihuana And Regulatory Tolerance Enforcement Act\" aims to prevent the diversion of marihuana to illegal markets, violence in its cultivation and distribution, drugged driving, and growing on public lands. The State agrees to study and report annually to the Attorney General on the outcomes of legalizing marihuana, including youth use, driving while intoxicated rates, diversion to other states, and drug-related organized crime activity. The Attorney General must make a finding within 90 days of receiving a request under this act. The Attorney General must issue a finding on whether specified conditions are met within a 3-year period for a State. If no finding is issued by the deadline, it is deemed that the conditions are met, with the option to revoke the finding later. The Attorney General's finding on specified conditions for a State lasts for 3 years, with the option for subsequent 3-year periods upon request. The effective date of the finding is tied to the State's regulatory regime. The Attorney General can review and potentially revoke the waiver for a State meeting the conditions. The Attorney General can revoke a finding if conditions are no longer met, providing notice and a 180-day period to correct any failures. This section does not prevent the Federal Government from offering assistance. The Federal Government can provide assistance to a State in implementing or enforcing State laws on marijuana. The term 'tainted' is defined as containing microbes, pesticides, or controlled substances other than marijuana. A clerical amendment is made to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. The text chunk \"Sec. 521. Inapplicability to marihuana in certain States.\" is a provision that exempts marijuana in certain states from specific regulations or restrictions."
