    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Neurotechnology Initiative Act\". The Congress acknowledges the advanced field of neuroscience but recognizes gaps in understanding brain function and limited ability to repair damage. Nearly 100 million Americans suffer from brain or nervous system issues, with a growing economic burden exceeding $1 trillion annually. Critical unmet medical needs exist in various brain and nervous system areas such as Alzheimer's, addiction, depression, and more. Neurotechnology has the potential to transform various aspects of our lives, including medicine, defense, education, and computing. There is a global race to lead the neurotechnology economy, with implications for employment and infrastructure. Federal leadership is needed to accelerate the development of neurotechnology for the benefit of the nation. The Federal Government should increase investment and coordination of neurotechnology research, development, and commercialization programs to benefit the nation's interests. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, the term \"Initiative\" refers to the National Neurotechnology Initiative, while \"neurotechnology\" encompasses the science and technology related to analyzing, understanding, treating, and healing the brain and nervous system. \"Qualified staff\" are FDA employees with expertise in neurotechnology or related fields, and \"related fields\" include neuroscience, neuromedicine, cognitive science, and other disciplines. The National Neurotechnology Initiative includes research in neuroregeneration, neurorehabilitation, neuromodulation, neurostimulation, biomedical engineering, bioengineering, molecular biology, computer science, and robotics. The term \"translational\" refers to research focused on converting laboratory findings into patient treatments. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The National Neurotechnology Initiative focuses on various areas of research including neuroregeneration, neurorehabilitation, neuromodulation, neurostimulation, biomedical engineering, bioengineering, molecular biology, computer science, and robotics. The term \"translational\" refers to converting laboratory findings into patient treatments. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The National Neurotechnology Initiative, led by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, aims to increase investment in Federal neurotechnology research and enhance interagency coordination in this field. The initiative focuses on areas such as neuroregeneration, neurorehabilitation, neuromodulation, and bioengineering. The National Neurotechnology Initiative, led by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, aims to coordinate, support, and extend neurotechnology-related activities of the National Institutes of Health. It also promotes neuroscience small business innovation research programs, facilitates testing of neuromedicine advances, and studies the social, ethical, and legal aspects of neurotechnology. The National Neurotechnology Initiative, led by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, aims to coordinate neurotechnology-related activities of the National Institutes of Health. The Secretary will establish a National Neurotechnology Coordination Office to coordinate federal neurotechnology activities among various agencies and serve as a point of contact for academia, industry, and other stakeholders. Public outreach and dissemination of findings will also be conducted. The National Neurotechnology Coordination Office will promote access to technologies and provide support to the National Neurotechnology Advisory Council. The Director will submit an annual report on the Initiative's status and effectiveness to the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a National Neurotechnology Advisory Council consisting of members from academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, and industry to provide advice on neurotechnology research and development. The National Neurotechnology Advisory Council will provide advice on education, technology transfer, commercial application, delivery, access, and ethical, legal, and social issues related to neurotechnology. Recommendations from various entities will be considered in appointing members to the council. The Director of the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office assesses trends, progress, revisions, funding levels, leadership, and management of the Initiative. Authorization of Appropriations: $4,000,000 for fiscal years 2009-2012 for subsections (a) and (b), and $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2009-2012 for subsection (c) activities of the Initiative. Programs related to the National Institutes of Health are outlined in Section 6. The Blueprint for Neuroscience Research program aims to address challenges and technological barriers in neuroscience research, while also providing support for the development of tools and resources for neuroscientists. Additionally, the Small Business Innovation Research Program directs the institutes of the National Institutes of Health to fulfill their duties in supporting small businesses. Directors of the National Institutes of Health institutes prioritize small businesses involved in neurotechnology research and report SBIR funding usage to the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office. They also give importance to small businesses in neurotechnology projects under the Small Business Technology Transfer Program. The National Institutes of Health institutes prioritize small businesses in neurotechnology research and report SBIR funding usage to the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office. Appropriations for neuroscience research and small business innovation research are authorized for fiscal years 2009 to 2012. Appropriations for neuroscience research and small business innovation research are authorized for fiscal years 2009 to 2012, with funding amounts increasing each year. The funding authorized cannot be used towards specific expenditure amounts required by the Small Business Act. SEC. 7. PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. The FDA is directed to improve the review process for neurology and psychiatry by increasing qualified staff and enhancing guideline creation and communication. Workgroups will be sponsored to develop standards for testing and trial endpoints for emerging brain and nervous system indications. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $26,000,000 for fiscal year 2009\n- $28,600,000 for fiscal year 2010\n- $31,460,000 for fiscal year 2011\n- $34,606,000 for fiscal year 2012\n\nNeurotechnology standards workgroups:\n- $4,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009-2012. SEC. 8. PROGRAMS RELATED TO ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES. The Director of the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office will establish an American Neurotechnology Study Center to research ethical, legal, and social issues related to neurotechnology. This center will also coordinate and disseminate studies on these issues, while integrating public input through discussions and events. The American Neurotechnology Study Center, established by the Director of the National Neurotechnology Coordination Office, will conduct a study on the responsible development of neurotechnology. This study will assess the need for standards, guidelines, and strategies to ensure responsible development, including safety of brain interface devices, human subject guidelines, use in enhancing human intelligence, defensive technologies, artificial intelligence development, and healthcare burden reduction. The National Neurotechnology Coordination Office will conduct an annual study on the economic impact of neurotechnology, assessing the economic burden of brain disorders, growth potential, national and global assets. $8,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. In fiscal years 2009-2012, $8,000,000 is authorized for subsections (a) and (b), and $2,000,000 for subsection (c) for the responsible development of neurotechnology. A limitation of $250,000 per fiscal year is set for subsection (a)(2)."
