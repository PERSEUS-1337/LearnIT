    "content": "Great Lakes pollution prevention. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program in the Great Lakes region to promote modern industrial source reduction practices. The Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program in the Great Lakes region establishes a registry of modernizing toxic use and waste reduction technologies for demonstration. Permit holders under section 402 can participate by implementing source reduction practices from the registry or other innovative practices approved by the Administrator. The Pollution Prevention Demonstration Program in the Great Lakes region allows participants to demonstrate technologies that can reduce pollutant discharges without increasing them in other environmental media. Participants are exempt from paying fees for developing revised effluent guidelines and may be granted an extension to comply with new standards if deemed necessary by the Administrator. The Administrator will establish a pollution prevention extension service in cooperation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and State technical assistance offices to promote pollution prevention by industrial discharges to the Great Lakes System. Additionally, a Great Lakes pollution prevention clearinghouse will be established to utilize research results from the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Reduction Engineering. The Administrator will establish a pollution prevention extension service in cooperation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and State technical assistance offices to promote pollution prevention by industrial discharges to the Great Lakes System. This includes demonstrations to provide information on source reduction methods to municipal and industrial dischargers in the Great Lakes region. The Administrator will also cooperate with Canada on information collection and dissemination. The Administrator offers technical and financial assistance to municipalities in the Great Lakes basin for reducing toxic pollutants in urban runoff, wastewater, and stormwater. Municipalities must apply with pollutant reduction goals and stakeholder interest documentation to be eligible. The Administrator will provide assistance to approved municipalities. Each approved municipality must provide technical assistance for developing a source reduction action plan and authorize the use of State revolving fund money for plan implementation. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include funding for activities related to the Great Lakes, including implementing a source reduction action plan approved by the Administrator."
