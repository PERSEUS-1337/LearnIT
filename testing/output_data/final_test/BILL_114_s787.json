    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"NTIS Elimination Act\". The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) collects and distributes government information, established in 1950. A GAO review found that NTIS only sold 8% of its reports between 1995 and 2000. The GAO estimates that 74 percent of reports added to NTIS's repository from 1990 to 2011 were readily available from other public sources, with 95 percent of them being free of charge. The most common source for these reports was websites like the Federal Internet portal and Google. In 1999, Secretary of Commerce William Daley acknowledged that the National Technical Information Service would become obsolete due to declining sales revenues, partly caused by other agencies making research results freely available online. According to a November 2012 GAO report, NTIS has had product expenditures exceeding revenues for 10 out of the past 11 fiscal years, resulting in an average loss of about $1.3 million on its products. The decline in revenue raises concerns about NTIS's viability as a self-financing repository of scientific information. NTIS has compensated for lost revenue by charging other Federal agencies for non-primary mission services. Future technological advances will impact NTIS. Future technological advances will make NTIS services even more unnecessary for essential government functions. The National Technical Information Service is addressed in Section 3. Repeal of the National Technical Information Act of 1988, transferring critical functions to other government agencies or contractors after consultation with relevant officials. Before the effective date set forth in subsection (a), the Secretary of Commerce is authorized to transfer critical NTIS activities to another office within the Department of Commerce after notifying relevant Senate committees. The Senate and House committees must identify and justify the transfer of critical activities or functions that are essential to the national economy. An activity or function critical to the national economy promotes economic growth by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery. Additionally, there is a provision for a repository of nonclassified information. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to maintain a repository of nonclassified scientific, technical, and engineering information. All Federal entities must send electronic copies of such reports to the Department of Commerce for inclusion in the repository. The Secretary of Commerce is required to notify specific committees in Congress about the repository of scientific information. The repository and its documents must be publicly available and searchable, with digital copies provided to the public for free. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to appropriate funds for maintaining the repository of scientific information. Selected bibliographic information products will continue to be provided to depository libraries. The Department of Commerce will use technology to collect scientific, technical, and engineering information efficiently. SEC. 4. NTIS REVOLVING FUND. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer unexpended balances in the NTIS Revolving Fund to the Department of Commerce for repository maintenance and dissolve the Fund. Before the effective date in section 3(a), the Secretary of Commerce must certify to the Senate and House committees that all operations of the National Technical Information Service, except those transferred under section 3(b)(2)(A), have been terminated."
