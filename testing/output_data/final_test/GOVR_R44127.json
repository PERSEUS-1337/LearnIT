It is a crucial partner for the United States in trade and security cooperation, supporting U.S. trade policy and security role in Asia while also maintaining close relations with China. Singapore gained self-rule in 1959 under Lee Kuan Yew's leadership. It attempted to unite with Malaysia in 1963 but the federation dissolved due to disputes over economic management and ethnic policies. In 1965, the Malaysian Parliament expelled Singapore from the federation, leading to concerns about its economic prospects. However, Singapore's economy quickly grew due to its strategic location and busy port, attracting foreign businesses and investment. Singapore's GDP per capita now exceeds that of the United States, Japan, and Hong Kong. The ruling party, PAP, has consistently won elections since 1959, aided by a fragmented opposition and electoral procedures favoring them. Opposition parties saw their best results in 2011, garnering about 40% of the popular vote. In 2011, Singapore's Parliamentary elections saw opposition parties gaining 40% of the popular vote, prompting PAP leaders to promise reforms addressing wealth disparities and reliance on foreign labor. By 2015, the PAP won nearly 70% of the vote after implementing limits on foreign labor and improving benefits for the poor and elderly. The government is led by the Prime Minister and cabinet, with the President serving as a ceremonial head of state. Lee Hsien Loong has been Prime Minister since 2004, succeeding his father Lee Kuan Yew who stepped down in 1990. Lee Kuan Yew, the architect of Singapore's success, resigned in 2011 to pass leadership to the next generation. Electoral reforms in 2010 aimed to increase non-PAP representation in Parliament. Singapore's leaders prioritize stability and prosperity over individual rights, with supporters praising the country's economic growth and living standards. Critics argue this approach stifles creativity and entrepreneurship, urging leaders to adapt to a more sophisticated society.

Singapore's Gross National Income Per Capita is $52,090, one of the highest in the world.

Singapore's hosting of the LCS showcases its role in the U.S. \"pivot\" to the region. The vessel is designed for shallow waters, with anti-mine and anti-submarine capabilities, and is suitable for exercises with countries with smaller naval forces. Singapore's advanced facilities and political standing allow it to host U.S. naval assets, while ongoing law enforcement cooperation between the two countries is also emphasized. Singapore is a transit point for individuals, including suspected terrorists, and has an active port for trans-shipment.

The PAP emphasizes social discipline and harmony, particularly addressing racial tensions. Race riots in the 1960s were a concern, with a recent incident in 2013 sparking rioting in Little India. This highlighted potential frustrations among migrant laborers. The Singaporean government has faced criticism for its control over the press and internet, with attempts to tighten control over bloggers who may not exercise the same restraint as mainstream media. In 2015, a teenage blogger was arrested for criticizing Lee Kuan Yew and sentenced to imprisonment.

Singapore ranks 154th in press freedom, below neighboring countries like Burma, Malaysia, and Thailand.
