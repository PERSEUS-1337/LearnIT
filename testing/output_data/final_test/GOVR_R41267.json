    "content": "Policymaking at the federal level emphasizes the importance of improving classroom instruction to enhance educational outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) established student performance standards and accountability measures, recognizing the need to enhance teachers' knowledge and skills. Congress amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to require all teachers to be highly qualified and created the Title II fund to support schools in meeting this requirement. Additional programs like the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants were also enacted to improve the teacher workforce. The NCLB highly qualified teacher requirement has been a cornerstone of federal teacher policy for nearly a decade, shifting focus from teacher input to teacher effectiveness. Congress passed provisions in the ARRA to improve teacher effectiveness by linking student achievement and teacher quality. The Secretary of Education used ARRA authority to encourage states to link student achievement and teacher effectiveness. ESEA flexibility package promotes teacher effectiveness through waivers exempting states from NCLB accountability provisions. Congress is considering ESEA reauthorization proposals and teacher-related issues like compensation and tenure. ESEA programs continue to operate with appropriations. The 113th Congress may amend and extend the ESEA. This report provides background information for legislative debates on these programs and issues. The report provides an overview of federal teacher policy, including demographics of the teaching workforce, supply and demand, attrition, compensation, certification policies, tenure rules, and unionization. It also discusses federal programs supporting teacher quality, such as Title II of the ESEA, TIF, TEACH Grants, and Title II of the HEA. The report highlights policy changes and ESEA reauthorization issues for Congress to consider, given the challenges posed by the large public K-12 educational system. The decentralized system of teacher policy in the United States involves almost 4 million teachers in 100,000 public schools across 14,000 school districts. States and localities have legal and administrative responsibility for K-12 education, with school districts controlling recruitment, hiring, evaluation, professional development, compensation, and retention of teachers. Certification procedures and tenure rules are dictated at the state level, while teacher preparation and training occur at higher education institutions. Teacher assignments and evaluations are typically managed by schools. The teaching workforce in the United States consists of 2.4 million elementary school teachers, 1.2 million secondary school teachers, and over 358,000 teachers in combined settings. The majority of teachers are female (76%), with a higher percentage in kindergarten and elementary education. The teaching force is predominantly white (84%), with 7% black, 7% Hispanic, and smaller percentages of other ethnicities. The average age of school teachers is 43, indicating an aging workforce. The teaching workforce in the United States is aging, with the average age of school teachers being 43. One-third of teachers are age 50 or older, and on average, they have 13 years of teaching experience. The impending retirement of Baby Boom generation teachers may lead to challenges and opportunities for teacher policy, including a potential shortage of teachers due to projected increases in student enrollment and teacher retirements. Public school enrollment has increased by 12% between 1993 and 2006 and is expected to continue growing. The average age of public school teachers has risen, leading to an anticipated increase in the attrition rate. Between 1998 and 2008, annual attrition from the teaching force rose by 41%. There are concerns about a potential teacher shortage as many teachers are eligible to retire, with estimates suggesting that half of the nation's teachers may retire in the next decade. The difficulty in quantifying the supply of teachers adds to the uncertainty about the existence of an overall teacher shortage. Roughly 41% of teachers are delayed entrants, starting teaching between one to four years after receiving their bachelor's degree. Research suggests that up to half of education graduates do not teach in their first year out of school. Teacher turnover, especially in hard-to-staff schools and subjects, contributes to the demand for teachers more than retirements. Teacher turnover is mainly due to failure to retain newly hired teachers rather than retirements. Schools with low teacher retention often hire to replace departed teachers. While retirements are increasing, turnover from other causes like job dissatisfaction is more significant. In 2008-2009, 526,000 public school teachers left their positions, with 256,000 transferring and 270,000 leaving teaching altogether. Teacher certification is a state function, ensuring minimal standards are met for teaching. The process of teacher certification varies by state, with requirements including education, testing, and experience. States may offer provisional licenses followed by longer-term licenses for successful teachers. Some states also grant intern and limited licenses to quickly fill vacancies, with the expectation of progressing to full certification through alternative routes. Initiatives like Teach for America and IBM's Transition to Teaching program provide additional pathways to certification. Teach for America and IBM's Transition to Teaching program offer alternative routes for non-traditional teaching candidates to enter the profession. Around 40% of current teachers took nontraditional paths. Districts typically handle the hiring process, with some giving schools more involvement. Human resource departments may review applicants' credentials, leaving the final selection to school-based hiring committees. Research has shown that teacher hiring processes are often influenced by district staffing rules based on seniority, leading to experienced teachers moving to schools with higher test scores. This results in high-poverty, low-performing schools having higher turnover rates with inexperienced teachers filling vacancies, creating funding inequities. The uneven distribution of teachers by experience can create hidden funding inequities in schools. Teacher seniority systems limit principals' control over staff decisions and can lead to vacancies being hidden. Teacher evaluation is typically the responsibility of school administration, but policies often lack detail on local approaches. Teacher evaluations are often more focused on the frequency of evaluations rather than providing guidance or standards for the process. Principals and vice-principals evaluate teachers using personnel files and classroom observations, but many teachers view the process as bureaucratic and not helpful for improving their instructional capabilities. Evaluations do not effectively gauge teachers' effectiveness in the classroom, as shown by a study from the New Teacher Project. Evaluation systems often fail to differentiate between levels of teacher effectiveness, with many districts using a binary rating system. Only a small percentage of teachers receive ratings below satisfactory. Some argue for reforms that include objective measures like student achievement in evaluations. In 2011, more states began factoring student learning into teacher evaluations. However, there are limitations in using student assessments to measure teacher performance. State laws provide job protection for teachers through tenure, outlining the process for gaining and potentially losing tenure. Probationary periods typically range from two to five years, with three years being the most common. During this time, teachers work under yearly contracts and can be evaluated for tenure. During the probationary period, a teacher is employed under a yearly contract and can be dismissed by the district's board of education for various reasons. Tenure provides job security unless dismissed for specific causes like incompetency or insubordination. Teachers' unions are often criticized as barriers to educational reform. Teachers' unions, specifically the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have faced criticism for prioritizing job protection and higher salaries over improving student instruction. Recent studies on teacher collective bargaining agreements suggest that their ambiguity can either positively or negatively impact school reform efforts. Union leaders are reconsidering their role in the evolving educational landscape. The ambiguity in teacher collective bargaining agreements can either empower aggressive principals seeking flexibility or hinder cautious ones reliant on explicit authority. In public education, regulatory obscurity often leads to inaction due to risk-averse leadership. Teacher pay levels are typically set by local school districts within statewide guidelines, allowing for salary increases based on additional education credentials. The average salary for public school teachers in 2006\u20132007 was $50,816, about 3% higher than in 1996\u201397, after adjustment for inflation. Salaries have generally kept pace with inflation since 1990\u201391, but there is debate over whether teachers are adequately compensated. Research shows a range of estimates when comparing teachers' salaries to similar skill sets or jobs. Research shows a range of estimates when comparing teachers' salaries to similar occupations. Efforts to reform teacher compensation include differentiating pay based on difficulty to fill positions and introducing performance measures. Teacher policy context is largely dictated at the local level. The federal role in K-12 teaching has greatly expanded since the 105th Congress, with funding for teacher programs increasing fivefold. Congress has redefined the nature of federal support, which previously focused on in-service training and professional development. In FY1998, the largest federal teacher program was the Eisenhower Professional Development program, allocating funds for professional development in core academic subjects. Other programs supported K-12 teaching, with a focus on in-service training, especially for teachers of students with disabilities under IDEA. In FY1998, federal funding supported various teacher training programs, including training for teachers working with limited English proficient students, advanced certification for current teachers, and hiring teachers through the Minority Teacher Recruitment program. The 105th Congress introduced new measures to focus on federal teacher policy, such as the Teacher Quality Enhancement program and the Class Size Reduction program. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized competitively awarded grants for teacher preparation programs, with funds allocated for state grants, partnership grants, and recruitment grants. These grants were used for activities like teacher preparation, reforming certification requirements, and professional development. The program had accountability requirements for teacher education programs, including reporting on pass rates of graduates and identifying low-performing programs. The 105th Congress established the Class Size Reduction program with $1.2 billion in funding through the FY1999 omnibus appropriations legislation. Funds were distributed to states based on their share of ESEA Title I-A or Title II funding. Low-performing teacher preparation programs risked losing state approval and financing, impacting their ability to receive professional development funding and enroll HEA-aided students. The Class Size Reduction program, established by the 105th Congress with $1.2 billion in funding, focused on federal support for hiring teachers to reduce class sizes. The program allocated funds to states based on their share of ESEA Title I-A or Title II funding, with states then awarding subgrants to LEAs based on poverty levels and total enrollment of children aged 5-17. The 106th Congress continued to redefine the federal role in K-12 teaching by specifying that funds above the FY2000 level were to be used for activities such as reducing the percentage of teachers without certification. The 107th Congress allocated funds for various teacher support programs, including Troops-to-Teachers and Transition to Teaching. These programs aimed to recruit and retain teachers with the necessary qualifications to improve academic achievement among low-income students. The No Child Left Behind Act further expanded the federal role in addressing teacher quality issues. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) signed into law in 2002 continued federal support for improving K-12 teaching by focusing on teacher quality and requiring all teachers to be \"highly qualified.\" States had to ensure all core academic subject teachers met this standard by 2005-2006. Regulations outlined the requirements for achieving highly qualified status. NCLB required Title I-funded states to establish annual measurable objectives for each LEA and school, including increasing the percentage of highly qualified teachers. States and LEAs had to publicly issue annual reports on progress. NCLB also increased federal teacher program funding and replaced existing programs with a new grant program to support professional development for teachers. The programs created by Congress aim to improve teacher qualifications, classroom management, instructional strategies, technology use, and working with special needs students and English language learners. Additionally, there have been advancements in teacher compensation, recruitment support, and federal involvement in teacher preparation and school leadership. The 109th and 110th Congress established federal teacher programs to support teacher compensation reform, encourage STEM majors to obtain teaching certification, support current teachers pursuing STEM master's degrees, and recruit STEM professionals into teaching. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 authorized the TEACH grant program providing scholarships for prospective teachers. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 expanded teacher preparation programs and emphasized teacher effectiveness. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act authorized $4 billion for the Race to the Top grant program to reform education. The Race to the Top grant program aims to reform education by focusing on standards, data systems, teacher effectiveness, and turning around low-achieving schools. The program includes a federal definition of an \"effective teacher\" based on student growth rates. The Race to the Top grant program focuses on standards, data systems, and teacher effectiveness. Teacher evaluation systems must include multiple measures, such as classroom observations and student growth, to inform human resource decisions. Evaluation systems must differentiate teachers based on effectiveness categories. The ESEA flexibility package announced by the ED in 2011 exempts states and school districts from certain NCLB accountability requirements, including those related to teacher qualifications. This allows school districts failing to meet NCLB highly qualified-teacher requirements to retain flexibility in using ESEA funds without developing improvement plans. The ESEA flexibility package announced by the ED in 2011 exempts states and school districts from certain NCLB accountability requirements, including teacher qualifications. In return, they must engage in education reforms focused on improving student academic achievement and instruction quality, based on four principles: college- and career-ready expectations, state-developed recognition and support, effective instruction and leadership, and reducing unnecessary burden. This includes developing teacher and principal evaluation systems for continual improvement and performance differentiation. The section discusses the criteria for evaluating teachers and principals, including using multiple measures, providing feedback, and informing personnel decisions. It also outlines federal programs authorized to address K-12 teaching, with a focus on programs in the ESEA as amended by NCLB. In amending the ESEA, NCLB continued Title II as the primary title for teacher programs, replacing the Eisenhower and CSR programs with a new state formula grant program. The fund awards formula grants to SEAs, which then award formula subgrants to LEAs based on a funding formula that considers school-aged population and poverty levels. Each state is guaranteed a base funding amount from previous programs. The state grant under NCLB is distributed to SEAs, who then distribute subgrants to LEAs based on a formula considering school-aged population and poverty levels. LEAs can use the funding for various specified activities, including recruitment and retention of qualified teachers and principals. Title II-A funds are used for recruiting and hiring qualified teachers, reducing class sizes, retaining teachers and principals, professional development, tenure reform, merit pay, and teacher testing. Title II-A funds are primarily used for class size reduction and professional development, with a shift towards more spending on professional development in recent years. Funds are awarded competitively to partnerships that include specific educational entities and high-need LEAs. Partnerships receiving Title II-A funds must use the money for professional development in core academic subjects for teachers, paraprofessionals, and principals. States can use the funding for activities like teacher certification reform, mentoring, and technology integration training for teachers. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for teacher qualification and professional development under state funding. It outlines the consequences for failing to meet annual objectives and the provision of funding for teacher-selected professional development activities. Additionally, it mentions the authorization of national activities funding for specific programs like the Advanced Credentialing program. The curr_chunk discusses funding for specific programs like the Advanced Credentialing program, School Leadership program, and partnerships to improve math and science instruction. The annual authorization of appropriations is $450 million for FY2002. The program awards three-year grants competitively or based on school-aged population in poverty with a 0.5% small state minimum. Partnerships must use grants for activities like professional development for math and science teachers, summer workshops, recruitment of majors to teaching, curriculum development, distance learning, and contact with mathematicians and scientists. The Secretary coordinates activities with the National Science Foundation to enhance partnerships between educators and professionals in math, science, and engineering. Partnerships must have evaluation plans to measure impact on student achievement. The NSF's Mathematics and Science Partnership program aims to improve teacher knowledge and student performance in math and science through competitive grants. Title II Part C, Subpart 1, Chapter A authorizes funding for the Troops-to-Teachers program, facilitating the transition of armed forces members into K-12 teaching. The program helps eligible members become certified teachers with a $150 million authorization for FY2002 and subsequent years. The Troops-to-Teachers program and Transition to Teaching program were provided funding for the next five fiscal years. The Secretary reserved $30 million in FY2002 for Troops-to-Teachers. These programs recruit mid-career professionals and others to teach in high need schools through partnership grants awarded to SEAs, high need LEAs, and higher education institutions. The projects aim to recruit qualified professionals and recent graduates to teach in high need schools, with support for financial incentives and teacher retention. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) aims to retain teachers in high-need schools by providing pre- and post-placement support, mentoring, and financial incentives. Participants must commit to a three-year service in high-need schools within high-need LEAs. Projects failing to meet goals risk grant revocation. TIF was funded through the FY2006 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Act. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) allocates $100 million for discretionary grants to improve elementary and secondary education quality. Grants are competitively awarded to local education agencies or states for developing performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools. Reforms must consider student academic achievement and classroom evaluations, providing incentives for educators to take on additional responsibilities and leadership roles. The Secretary allocates a 5% set-aside for the Center for Educator Compensation Reform to raise awareness about effective strategies for educator compensation reform. Program funds support the development of performance-based compensation systems for teachers and principals in high-need schools, covering incentives, professional development, evaluation tools, staff salaries, and project-related travel. The ESEA, Title V, Part D authorizes the Ready to Teach program, providing grants for national telecommunications-based programs and digital educational programming. Grants are awarded for five years and must be matched by applicants. The HEA, amended by the HEOA, addresses K-12 teacher issues through programs supporting teacher improvement. Title II of the HEA focuses on improving teacher education programs, recruitment efforts, and training for prospective teachers. It also includes reporting requirements for states and higher education institutions. Title IV authorizes TEACH Grants to encourage students to pursue teaching careers and offers loan forgiveness for teachers in high-need subjects. Title VIII supports Teach for America in recruiting college graduates into teaching. Title II, Part A authorizes Teacher Quality Partnership grants to enhance teacher preparation in high-need schools and early childhood education programs. Teacher Quality Partnership grants aim to improve teacher preparation in high-need schools and early childhood education programs by enhancing teacher training and accountability. Partnerships must include a high-need LEA, a partner IHE, and a school or department of arts and sciences within the partner IHE. Grant funds can be used for Pre-Baccalaureate Preparation programs, Teacher Residency programs, or both. Grants are provided for Pre-Baccalaureate Preparation programs to implement reforms in teacher preparation, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, clinical education, mentoring, and induction programs. Grants are provided to develop and implement teacher residency programs that prepare teachers for success in high-need schools and academic subjects, including rigorous graduate-level coursework for a master's degree. Teacher residency programs provide rigorous graduate-level coursework for a master's degree, guided teaching apprenticeships, mentorship opportunities, and clear criteria for selecting effective mentor teachers. Graduates are placed in targeted schools as a cohort for collaboration, receive a one-year living stipend, and must teach full time for at least three years in high-need schools. Leadership development programs are also funded to prepare individuals for roles as superintendents, principals, or other school leaders with strong leadership skills. The HEOA amendments established new programs in HEA, Title II, Part B, Enhancing Teacher Education to promote strong leadership skills for school leaders, improve academic achievement, engage parents and community stakeholders, and understand student learning. Grant funds must be used for various programs to develop school leaders. The TEACH Grant program, authorized by the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, offers $4,000 scholarships annually to high-achieving students committing to teach high-need subjects in elementary or secondary schools for four years. Recipients must serve full-time in a high-need school within eight years of graduation. The TEACH Grant program offers $4,000 scholarships annually to high-achieving students committing to teach high-need subjects in elementary or secondary schools for four years. Recipients must serve full-time in a high-need school within eight years of graduation. Qualifying teachers may receive relief from HEA, Title VI Stafford Loan debt by teaching in low-income schools for five consecutive years. Math, science, and special education teachers in low-income schools can receive up to $17,500 in loan debt relief. Teach for America, Inc. recruits recent college graduates to teach in high-need LEAs. Grant funds support teacher recruitment, training, placement in high-need schools, and ongoing professional development. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 authorized new programs to improve K-12 teaching. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 authorized new programs to improve K-12 teaching, including a Baccalaureate Degree program for STEM majors to obtain teaching certification and a Master's Degree program for current teachers to upgrade their skills. Grantees must prioritize underrepresented groups in STEM teaching and high-need LEAs. Teachers can deduct up to $250 a year for classroom expenses. The ARRA authorized the Race to the Top (RTT) program with $4 billion for discretionary grants to states. States must sub-grant at least 50% of funding to LEAs based on Title I-A shares. The remaining 50% can be used for state-level activities and other purposes outlined in the application. RTT aims to promote educational reforms in areas like standards, assessments, and data systems. The Race to the Top (RTT) program, authorized by ARRA with $4 billion for grants to states, focuses on promoting educational reforms in areas like standards, assessments, and data systems. Key reform areas include measuring student growth, recruiting effective teachers, and turning around low-achieving schools. States must have their application for funds approved and remove any barriers to linking student data for teacher evaluation to be eligible for RTT funds. Priority is given to certain criteria in the grant competition. The Race to the Top program focuses on promoting educational reforms, including teacher and principal evaluation. Priority is given to expanding statewide data systems to include information on teachers and principals. The data system should provide resources for improving instructional practices, support professional development, and make data accessible for research purposes. LEAs must sign a memorandum of participation to be eligible. To be eligible for participation in the Race to the Top program, LEAs must sign a memorandum of understanding with the state, demonstrating a strong commitment to education reforms, including teacher evaluation systems. Evaluations should be based on multiple measures of teacher performance, with student growth being a significant factor. An \"effective teacher\" is defined as one whose students achieve acceptable rates of student growth. Teachers must raise student learning to expected levels for effectiveness. Evaluations should focus on student growth, not one-time measures of achievement. Results should inform coaching, compensation, tenure decisions, and removal of ineffective teachers. States must ensure equitable distribution of effective teachers. The 113th Congress is considering whether to amend and extend the expired authorization for ESEA programs, with a focus on teacher policy issues. Federal policy has been silent on effective teaching definitions, but Congress is showing interest in increasing federal involvement in this area. Congress is considering various questions regarding teacher and principal effectiveness, including whether definitions should be written into federal law, adapting HOUSSE procedures for teacher evaluation, amending federal accountability requirements, targeting investments in training for evaluation systems, determining the best policy levers for reform, and feasibility of value-added methods for evaluating educators. Congress is considering federal policies to evaluate teacher and principal effectiveness, including using evaluations to inform high-stakes decisions like granting tenure and removing ineffective teachers. There is a debate on whether the federal government should have a sustained role in teacher and principal compensation and if it should focus on developing the capacity to link compensation to performance. The debate in Congress revolves around federal policies to evaluate teacher and principal effectiveness, including using evaluations for high-stakes decisions like granting tenure and removing ineffective teachers. There is a discussion on linking compensation to performance and addressing barriers that limit the role of teacher evaluations in decision-making. NCLB and RTT have provisions for equitable distribution of highly-qualified teachers, but the effectiveness of these requirements is uncertain. The new program requires states to define and identify \"effective\" and \"highly effective\" teachers, raising questions about teacher quality distribution, seniority rules, and pay incentives for improving equity in education. The federal government has a limited role in supporting pre-service teacher preparation, with fewer than 1 in 20 programs receiving funding through HEA, Title II-A. Programs must adhere to accountability provisions, including reporting pass rates on teacher certification exams. Congress has the opportunity to reauthorize federal teacher programs (ESEA, Title II-A and HEA, Title II-A) with the early expiration of Title II-A through FY2011. The federal government is considering reallocating funds from in-service teacher training to pre-service preparation and reworking support for traditional teacher preparation programs. There is a debate on whether accountability for teacher preparation programs should focus on effective training practices rather than identifying failing programs. Additionally, there is discussion on renewing certification reform efforts to incorporate teacher effectiveness into the awarding of full certification. ESEA, Title II-A funds are increasingly used for in-service professional development, but the training is often sporadic. Improving teacher training during ESEA reauthorization may involve amending the definition of \"professional development,\" enforcing effective practices, holding schools/providers accountable, and strengthening incentives for student achievement."
