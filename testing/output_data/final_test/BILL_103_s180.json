    "content": "The National Economic Council Act is the short title of this legislation. The Congress recognizes the importance of economic policy for national security and America's leadership in the world. A strong economy is crucial for national security, and the ability to compete internationally is vital for economic prosperity. Increased exports play a significant role in the country's GDP and output. Increased exports are crucial for job creation and economic growth, especially as America focuses on competing in world markets post-cold war. The President's National Security Council has been instrumental in developing national security policy since 1947. Policies to enhance international competitiveness require the same level of attention as national security to maintain economic strength. To strengthen America's economic competitiveness in the global market, a coordinated economic strategy is needed. This includes establishing a permanent council of experts to advise the President on economic policy, similar to the National Security Council for national security. An organization within the Executive Office of the President should be created to develop and coordinate economic policy in response to trade and global competition. The National Economic Council is crucial for national security, focusing on domestic and international economic policies at the highest government level.
