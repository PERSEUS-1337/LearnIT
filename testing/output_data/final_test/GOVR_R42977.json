The rules are prescribed by the Constitution or adopted by each chamber, impacting how business is conducted. The report discusses how congressional activities are regulated through rules governing sessions, including the terms session, adjournment, and recess. These terms have different meanings in daily and annual contexts, with a session defined as a period when a chamber is formally assembled to conduct business. The term recess refers to a temporary suspension of a session, while adjournment signifies the end of a session until reconvening. During a recess, the chamber is said to be \"in recess\" until it reconvenes. During a recess, the chamber is temporarily suspended until it reconvenes. The technical meanings of terms like recess, adjournment, and session can vary based on specific chamber rules and interpretations. This report aims to clarify the formal and informal uses of these terms in congressional contexts. This report clarifies how rules and practices regulate daily and annual sessions of Congress, including the use of \"legislative day\" and \"pro forma sessions.\" It also discusses implications of sessions, adjournments, and recesses on presidential actions, expedited procedures, and post-election sessions. Each chamber convenes by being called to order. During daily sessions of Congress, each chamber convenes by being called to order and remains in session until adjournment or recess. Official business can only be conducted when the chamber is in session, with a presiding officer present, members participating, and a quorum possibly required. In certain circumstances, no business may occur during a specific daily session. During daily sessions of Congress, each chamber convenes and remains in session until adjournment or recess. A calendar day on which a chamber convenes and then adjourns or recesses may be called a \"calendar day of session\" or simply a \"day of session.\" The term \"session day\" is used in Senate contexts, but not in the House. Sometimes a chamber remains continuously in session without adjourning until the next calendar day. During daily sessions of Congress, each chamber convenes and remains in session until adjournment or recess. A chamber adjourns its daily session by adopting a motion to adjourn or by unanimous consent. The term \"session day\" is used in Senate contexts, but not in the House. The Senate may adjourn by unanimous consent or pursuant to a previous order, while the House generally does not use the latter practice. The chair can declare a daily adjournment in the Senate in case of an \"imminent threat.\" Once adjourned, no official business can be conducted, but certain administrative tasks may be allowed. When a chamber reconvenes after adjournment, a new daily session begins with the prescribed order of business. The daily order of business in each chamber begins with a prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance. Legislation pending from the previous day becomes unfinished business. Chambers can set a time to reconvene after adjourning, or follow a normal schedule resolution. Chambers may also take a recess within a daily session. A chamber may recess within its daily session for various reasons, such as waiting for specific business or convening with the other chamber. Unlike adjournment, a recess does not end the daily session; business resumes where it left off. A recess can be brief or overnight, resembling adjournment in some ways. When the Senate reconvenes after an overnight recess, it follows customary ceremonies like prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance. A recess, whether brief or overnight, does not end the daily session in a chamber. When the House reconvenes after a recess, it often skips customary ceremonies and resumes business from where it left off. Unlike adjournment, a recess does not terminate a legislative day, and business continues from the point of suspension. A legislative day may include more than one calendar day of session. A chamber can be in recess or adjournment, but not both simultaneously. The House continues its daily session during a recess, while the Senate only allows certain actions during a recess. In the Senate, actions during a recess require an \"order, adopted by unanimous consent.\" The House remains in daily session during a recess, while the Senate may be considered \"out of session\" when in recess. Both chambers specify the time for reconvening during a recess, with the Senate giving high precedence to a motion to recess. In the Senate, a motion to recess is second only to a motion to adjourn and can be done by unanimous consent or an order previously adopted. In the House, a motion to authorize the Speaker to declare a recess is allowed, with the Speaker having the authority to declare a recess for a short time or in case of an emergency. The House cannot recess while sitting as the Committee of the Whole, it must first rise and then the House can recess. The distinction between recesses and adjournments underlies the concept of the \"legislative day.\" The term \"legislative day\" is often informally used to mean a calendar day on which a chamber is in session, but this is incorrect in most technical contexts. It is clearer to refer to a calendar day of session or a legislative day when discussing whether a chamber was in session on a specific calendar day. A legislative day does not necessarily coincide with a calendar day of session. It ends when the chamber adjourns and begins when the chamber reconvenes after an adjournment. Recessing overnight does not start a new legislative day, allowing a chamber to continue the same legislative day for many days or even weeks. In the Senate, a \"morning hour\" is prescribed at the beginning of each legislative day to handle routine business. In the past, the Senate would recess overnight to avoid dilatory tactics during the \"morning hour.\" Nowadays, both chambers usually adjourn at the end of each daily session, aligning the calendar day with the legislative day. When a chamber adjourns briefly and reconvenes on the same day, a new legislative day begins, allowing for multiple legislative days on a single calendar day. Senate and House Rules dictate specific timeframes for considering measures and special rules, respectively. The Adjournments Clause of the Constitution restricts each chamber from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other. This restriction also applies to daily recesses, preventing a chamber from adjourning to a day more than three full calendar days later. Congress has developed two means to satisfy the constitutional requirement for adjourning or recessing daily sessions for three days or more: adopting an \"adjournment resolution\" or establishing a schedule to meet at least every third day. Congress has two methods to meet the constitutional requirement for adjourning or recessing daily sessions for three days or more: adopting an \"adjournment resolution\" or holding \"pro forma sessions\" to avoid the need for consent to a longer break. The House or Senate is in session when formally convened, in adjournment when not in session, and in recess when taking a break. An annual session of Congress begins when formally convened and ends with an adjournment sine die. The Constitution mandates Congress to assemble at least once a year, typically starting on January 3rd. This period between convening and adjournment covers a significant portion of the year. Each Congress is elected for a two-year term with annual sessions that are concurrent. The session begins with the assembly of both the House and the Senate. Each Congress is identified by its numerical sequence, and each annual session is identified by its sequence within its own Congress. The Senate is normally convened by the Vice President or President pro tempore, while the House is convened by the Clerk. The House and Senate engage in organizing activities at the start of each Congress, including swearing in new members and electing officers. The President can call additional sessions of Congress for extraordinary occasions. An extraordinary session of Congress, called by the President for special occasions, is separate from regular annual sessions and receives a separate number. This presidential power is rarely exercised as regular sessions typically meet throughout the year. An extraordinary session of Congress, convened by the President for special occasions, is distinct from regular annual sessions and is assigned a separate number within the sequence. For example, the second session of the 76th Congress in 1939 was an extraordinary session, called after the sine die adjournment of the first session, making the subsequent regular session in 1940 the third session of that Congress. If the President calls Congress between the convening and adjournment of a regular session, the annual session continues without interruption. For instance, when President Truman summoned the 80th Congress back in 1948, it was a continuation of the second session that had not adjourned sine die. An adjournment sine die ends an annual session of Congress without setting a date for a future meeting. This termination marks the start of a new annual session when Congress reconvenes. For example, the sine die adjournment in December 2009 concluded the first session of the 111th Congress, and when Congress met again in January 2010, it began a new session. The adjournment sine die ends an annual session of Congress without setting a future meeting date. Once a session convenes, it remains \"in session\" until adjourning sine die. The period between sessions is referred to as an \"intersession recess.\" The Adjournments Clause of the Constitution limits adjournments to three days without consent. When Congress intends to adjourn its session sine die, both chambers adopt an adjournment resolution through a concurrent resolution. This resolution authorizes each chamber to adjourn sine die on a specified date. The actual adjournment is then accomplished by adopting a motion or unanimous consent request under the authority of the adjournment resolution. Congress typically adopts a concurrent resolution for a sine die adjournment, even if the next session is scheduled to convene within three days. The Adjournments Clause allows for a sine die adjournment even when the next session is close. A chamber can adjourn sine die without a concurrent resolution if the next session is about to convene. The Senate has clarified that daily adjournments do not lead to a de facto sine die adjournment, unless the next session is immediately following. The Senate can achieve a sine die adjournment even if the next session is close, treating the previous session as ongoing until the new session officially convenes. The House's ability to adjourn sine die within three days by daily adjournment is unclear. Chambers can also temporarily suspend their annual session by adjourning daily sessions to a later date, with the annual session continuing when the chamber reconvenes. The annual session of the chamber continues in progress, with a temporary break referred to as a \"recess.\" The term \"recess\" in relation to the annual session is not a parliamentary term but a widely understood reference. The significance of a recess within Congress depends on its length. The Adjournments Clause of the Constitution limits adjournments to three days without consent. This applies to recesses within the annual session, known as \"adjournments for more than three days.\" These are also called \"recesses of the session\" to distinguish them from intersession recesses. Adjournment Sine Die, also known as intersession recesses, require permission from each chamber through a concurrent resolution for adjournments of three days or more within the annual session. These resolutions, similar to those for sine die adjournments, establish the reconvene date for each chamber. Reconvening after a recess of the session resumes business from where it left off, similar to daily session recesses. When a chamber reconvenes after a recess of the session, business resumes from where it left off. Daily session adjournments for fewer than three days are also sometimes referred to as recesses in relation to the annual session. These shorter breaks between daily sessions occur routinely, such as adjourning on Friday and reconvening on Tuesday. The practical effects of a break between sessions are similar to a daily adjournment. The terms \"recess\" and \"adjournment\" are used similarly for annual and daily sessions. An adjournment sine die ends an annual session, while a recess of the session for more than three days does not. Chambers can schedule breaks without the other's consent. A recess of the session for more than three days does not terminate an annual session, but only suspends it. This differs from a sine die adjournment, which ends an annual session. The continuity of a chamber's daily session is maintained even during daily recesses. During an annual session, a chamber's daily session can be interrupted by recesses or adjournments, which temporarily suspend the chamber's ability to conduct business. The House typically recesses its annual session through adjournments of its daily sessions, while the Senate may recess its annual session by taking a recess of its daily session that continues throughout the annual session. This differs from a sine die adjournment, which ends an annual session. During an annual session, a chamber can adjourn its session sine die only by adjourning its last daily session. Pro forma sessions are held to prevent a recess of the session or a sine die adjournment. The term \"pro forma session\" is informally used to describe short daily sessions where little to no business is conducted. It is commonly used to extend weekend breaks and does not have a formal definition or status. Pro forma sessions are used by chambers to extend weekend breaks without requiring a formal recess of the session. These sessions typically involve little to no business being conducted, allowing members to remain in their constituencies. They are also used to establish constituency work periods without the need for a recess of the session. During a one-week constituency work period, pro forma sessions can be held on Monday and Thursday with short sessions and no business conducted. This allows for the chamber to remain in session without requiring a formal recess. The body is considered \"in pro forma session\" only during the convening and adjournment of the daily sessions on Monday and Thursday, not for the entire week. This period can be described as \"a period of pro forma sessions\" or \"a series of pro forma sessions.\" The pro forma sessions separate breaks of fewer than three days, preventing the chamber from being in a \"recess of the session.\" This has implications for congressional practice, including business continuity, presidential vetoes, lame duck sessions, recess appointments, and fast track procedures. Legislative business remains pending through daily recesses. During breaks of fewer than three days, pro forma sessions prevent the chamber from being in a \"recess of the session,\" ensuring business continuity. Legislative business remains pending through daily adjournments and annual sessions, with bills available for congressional action even after a recess or adjournment. Business only concludes with the final sine die adjournment of the last annual session of a Congress. The Senate's treatment of executive business differs from legislative business. Nominations pending at the end of an annual session are returned to the President, unless the Senate orders otherwise. Treaties remain before the Senate until action is taken, unless the President withdraws them. The President has 10 days to sign a bill into law or return it to Congress with objections. If neither is done, the bill becomes law unless Congress prevents its return by adjourning. Contemporary practice is unclear on what type of adjournment would prevent the return of a bill. If the allotted 10 days expire during an intrasession recess or a sine die adjournment between sessions of the same Congress, the return of a bill is not prevented. However, if the 10 days expire after the term of office of the Congress, the President can pocket veto the bill. The President may sign a bill into law within 10 days, even after Congress's term ends. If the 10 days expire after Congress adjourns sine die, the bill may be pocket vetoed. After a sine die adjournment, Congress may reconvene if necessary. Presidents sometimes return bills with objections even after adjournment, asserting that the bill should not become law. During a \"lame duck session\" of Congress, which occurs after the election but before the new term begins, the Congress in session is not the newly elected one. During a \"lame duck session\" of Congress, which occurs after the election but before the new term begins, the Congress in session is not the newly elected one. The post-election portion of the annual session typically adjourns in December, sometimes extending until January 3. This period is often separated from the pre-election portion by a recess, with pro forma sessions held during the election period in some cases. During a \"lame duck session\" of Congress, the authority to reconvene Congress if circumstances warrant may lead to sessions after the election for the following Congress. This authority is usually foreseen at the time the adjournment resolution is adopted, treating the previous adjournment as not a sine die adjournment. During a lame duck session of Congress, if the President reconvenes them after a recess during the election period, the previous session is considered to resume. However, if the President reconvenes them after a sine die adjournment, it would be a new extraordinary session. Another scenario for a new annual session would be if Congress adjourned sine die before the election after enacting its constitutional authority. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses, but it pertains to annual sessions, not daily ones. This clause has not been invoked since the 20th Amendment in 1934. The Recess Appointments Clause allows the President to make appointments during Senate recesses, whether intersession or intrasession. Presidents have historically made recess appointments during intersession recesses, but the extent of the President's power during different types of recesses has been debated. Since the 1920s, Presidents have occasionally made recess appointments during intrasession recesses of the Senate. There has been debate over whether the \"Recess of the Senate\" should be interpreted as the same as an adjournment for more than three days. Despite this argument, Presidents have traditionally made recess appointments during intrasession recesses only until recently. The meaning of \"recess\" in the Recess Appointments Clause cannot simply be identified with that of \"adjourn[ment] for more than three days\" in the Adjournments Clause. Some argue that the Constitution offers guidance on what may constitute a \"recess\" for recess appointments, with a three-day standard being suggested. The Adjournments Clause sets a three-day standard for recess appointments. The Senate uses pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by ensuring no recess of three days or more. This strategy assumes the recess appointment power is not available during adjournments or short recesses. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) issued a memorandum in January 2012 regarding recess appointments, suggesting that the President could determine when the Senate is 'not in session' for appointment purposes. This raised the question of whether the Senate could be considered 'in recess' even during pro forma sessions. The OLC opinion made arguments in favor of this proposition. The OLC opinion in January 2012 suggested that the President could determine when the Senate is 'not in session' for appointment purposes, even during pro forma sessions. This raised questions about the definition of a \"recess\" and its implications for recess appointments. The OLC opinion in January 2012 suggested that the President could make recess appointments during pro forma sessions. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning that recess appointments during a three-day intrasession recess were unconstitutional, but appointments during a recess of 10 days or more were permissible. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning that recess appointments during a three-day intrasession recess were unconstitutional, but appointments during a recess of 10 days or more were permissible. The Court determined that pro forma sessions count as sessions of the Senate, allowing the Senate to prevent the President from making recess appointments. Expedited procedures, also known as \"fast track\" procedures, govern the action of chambers on specified measures. Expedited procedures, also known as \"fast track\" procedures, are resolutions to approve or disapprove specific actions proposed by the executive, including congressional budget resolutions, reconciliation bills, and trade agreements. These procedures have the same force as standing rules, promoting timely congressional action by overriding leadership control and filibusters. They often mandate measure introduction, protect floor consideration, set time limits, and prohibit amendments. Expedited procedures place time limits on consideration and prohibit amendments. The prescribed periods may be measured through calendar days, days of session, and days of continuous session. Calendar days count every day towards completion, including weekends and holidays. Statutes generally define periods by days of session only for the Senate. The House defines periods by legislative days, treating both chambers similarly. Days of session exclude weekends and recesses. Congressional Review Act extends time for disapproving regulations. The Congressional Review Act extends the opportunity for Congress to disapprove regulations into a new session if Congress adjourns before the 60th session day. Days of continuous session are counted unless either chamber is in a recess. Weekend days count, even if neither chamber meets. Pro forma sessions do not affect calendar days. The occurrence of pro forma sessions affects the count of legislative days and continuous session. For example, a recess of the session does not count as days of session, but pro forma sessions do count. Pro forma sessions in each chamber prevent a \"recess of the session,\" ensuring that all days count towards a period of continuous session. This method accelerates the passage of legislative days, allowing for flexibility in extending or shortening the calendar length of a session. Some statutes define \"legislative day\" as a \"day of session\" to avoid confusion. The report discusses the importance of coordinating expedited procedures between both chambers of Congress to ensure smooth operation. It highlights the significance of aligning the start and end dates of periods for action, whether based on calendar days or days of continuous session. This coordination is crucial for efficient legislative processes. When measuring periods for action in Congress, using session days ensures that actions can only end on days when the respective chamber is in session, unlike calendar days which may end when both chambers are out of session. This discrepancy in schedules between chambers can lead to different end dates for expedited procedures. In Congress, using session days ensures actions end only when the chamber is in session, unlike calendar days. This can lead to different end dates for expedited procedures, which may expire during a sine die adjournment, truncating Congress's effective use of the procedure. Some provisions can limit Congress's use of expedited procedures by expiring during a sine die adjournment. If the period ends during this adjournment, it may still be available for action in the following session, but it could be too short for the new Congress to complete the process. This would require starting over with a new measure. In the Congress following the one where the President's proposal was submitted, expedited consideration is not allowed. Some expedited procedures allow for a new period for action if the previous Congress adjourned before the deadline. This may also apply to the beginning of a new session within the same Congress. Many statutes allow expedited procedures during the first period of days of continuous session of Congress after a designated event, with continuity broken by a sine die adjournment. If Congress adjourns before the required period is completed, a new session starts for expedited action to proceed. Interpreting provisions as applying only when the executive branch resubmits the proposal."
