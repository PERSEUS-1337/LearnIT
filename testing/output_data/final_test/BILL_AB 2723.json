    "title": "AB 2723",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to specify that a child meeting certain criteria falls under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court as a dependent child of the court. The amended Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code specifies that a child may be considered a dependent child of the court if they have suffered serious physical harm inflicted nonaccidentally by their parent or guardian, or if there is a substantial risk of such harm based on past injuries or actions indicating the child is at risk. \"Serious physical harm\" does not include reasonable spanking to the buttocks without evidence of serious injury. The child may be considered a dependent of the court if they have suffered serious physical harm or are at risk due to parental neglect, failure to provide basic needs, or inability to care for the child. The court gives deference to a parent's medical or spiritual treatment decisions for a child, based on recognized religious practices, unless necessary to prevent serious harm. Factors considered include the nature of treatment, risks to the child, and likelihood of success. The court considers a parent's medical or spiritual treatment decisions for a child based on recognized religious practices, unless necessary to prevent serious harm. Factors include the nature of treatment, risks to the child, and likelihood of success. The child remains dependent only as long as needed to protect from serious harm. The Legislature recognizes sexually trafficked children who are exploited for sex acts and whose parents fail to protect them as commercially sexually exploited children. The child may be suffering serious emotional damage due to the conduct of the parent or guardian, evidenced by severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or aggressive behavior. If the parent's failure to provide mental health treatment is based on religious beliefs, a less intrusive judicial intervention should be considered. The child may be suffering serious emotional damage due to the conduct of the parent or guardian, evidenced by severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or aggressive behavior. If the parent fails to protect the child from sexual abuse, there is a substantial risk of harm. The child, under five years old, may be removed from a parent's custody if they have suffered severe physical abuse, defined as acts causing permanent disfigurement, disability, or death, significant bleeding or bruising, bone fractures, or prolonged lack of food. The child may be removed from the physical custody of a parent or guardian due to severe physical abuse, unless the social worker has made an allegation of severe physical abuse. The child may be removed from the physical custody of a parent or guardian due to severe physical abuse, neglect, lack of support, parental incarceration, voluntary surrender, or inability of a relative to provide care. Additionally, the child may be freed for adoption if the parent has relinquished rights for 12 months. The child may be removed from a parent or guardian's custody due to abuse or neglect, or if there is a risk of abuse or neglect based on the sibling's situation. The court considers various factors to determine the risk to the child. The Legislature aims to avoid unnecessary disruption to families and not interfere with parental discipline or parenting methods. The section encourages voluntary services for families in need and directs savings from child welfare services to support family maintenance and reunification plans. The Legislature emphasizes that a parent's physical disability should not prevent them from caring for their children. A court's decision should focus on whether the disability hinders the parent's ability to provide care. Additionally, a child whose parent is deemed dependent by the court should not automatically be considered at risk of abuse or neglect based on the parent's status. In this section, a \"guardian\" is defined as the legal guardian of the child. Section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code states that individuals under 18 who violate laws are under juvenile court jurisdiction, except for certain offenses committed by those 14 and older. The prosecutor can charge a minor with murder if certain circumstances are met, or with specific sex offenses if the minor personally committed the offense and other conditions apply. The specified sex offenses that a minor can be charged with include forcible sexual penetration, sodomy, oral copulation by force or fear of bodily harm, and lewd acts on a child under 14 years old."
