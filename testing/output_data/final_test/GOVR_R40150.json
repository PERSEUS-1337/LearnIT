    "content": "In November 2007, Senator Barack Obama announced his intention to appoint a federal chief technology officer (CTO). President Obama appointed Aneesh P. Chopra as \"America's Chief Technology Officer\" in April 2009. Mr. Chopra serves as assistant to the President and CTO, promoting technological innovation to achieve national priorities. President Obama's vision for the CTO position includes using technology to reform government and improve information exchange with citizens. The report discusses the potential duties and challenges of the CTO role, reviews Aneesh Chopra's activities as CTO, and identifies issues for Congress to consider in creating the position. Obama plans to appoint the nation's first Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to enhance information exchange between the government and citizens, prioritize network security, and ensure agencies have modern infrastructure and policies. The CTO will lead efforts to implement top technologies, promote transparency, and utilize new technologies for citizen engagement. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) appointed by Obama will focus on using new technologies to improve democratic government functions, ensure technological interoperability, and oversee the development of a national wireless network for first responders. This will prevent failures in delivering critical public services during crises like Hurricane Katrina. President-elect Obama reiterated his intentions for the CTO to bring government into the 21st century using technology for reform. The Office of the President-elect aims to modernize government by using technology to improve information exchange with citizens and ensure network security. The appointment of the nation's first Chief Technology Officer (CTO) will lead efforts to implement best-in-class technologies and share best practices across federal agencies. Prior to Mr. Chopra's appointment, details about the CTO position were uncertain, leading to speculation about its duties and authorities. The CTO position aims to use technology to improve government services, increase transparency, and engage citizens. Key details about the CTO's duties and authorities have become clearer through Mr. Chopra's initiatives, congressional testimonies, and interviews. The main question for policymakers is defining the scope of the CTO's responsibilities, with two broad roles emerging. The CTO's role includes ensuring a secure information infrastructure, implementing best practices across agencies, and advocating for technological innovation to support national interests like economic growth and national defense. Lawrence Lessig proposed various roles for an Obama administration CTO before Mr. Chopra's appointment. The CTO plays a crucial role in using technology to address national challenges, including making government more efficient and transparent, advancing public policy on issues like global warming, and driving economic growth. The CTO is seen as essential in implementing recovery plans and innovation policies, with potential responsibilities in cybersecurity and ensuring broadband penetration for economic development. The CTO could act as a cybersecurity czar, advising the President on technology use for government efficiency and national security. The role aims to push the country towards being more entrepreneurial and high-tech, championing information and communications technologies broadly. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) role in the United States is debated between different groups. The CAP/NDP envisions a CTO role that straddles the public and private sectors to ensure robust and affordable ICT platforms. In contrast, the Association of American Universities (AAU) suggests a narrower focus for the CTO, primarily overseeing technology use within the White House and coordinating technology within the Executive Branch. The AAU also recommends that the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) remain the sole presidential advisor for science and technology. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) role in the United States is debated between different groups. The responsibility for coordinating and shaping science and technology policy across government agencies should remain with the OSTP Director. Factors defining the CTO's duties include President Obama's vision, congressional oversight, and potential statutory duties. Personal attributes of the CTO may also influence the role. Chopra led Virginia's technology strategy and economic development efforts. He previously worked at the Advisory Board Company in healthcare research. Congress and the Obama Administration may consider various organizational structures for the CTO role. The Clinton Administration's \"reinventing government\" initiative included the establishment of CIOs in federal agencies to manage information technology systems. The CIOs' mandate is to ensure effective implementation of information management solutions and create a more efficient government. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires each federal agency to have a CIO. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 mandates the appointment of a CIO in each federal agency to provide information management advice, develop information systems, and report on progress. President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 13011 established the position of chief information officer, outlined their responsibilities, and created the CIO Council chaired by the OMB deputy director for management. The E-Government Act of 2002 later codified the CIO Council as the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to information technology. The chief technology officer (CTO) role emerged in the private sector in the 1980s and some federal agencies have since established CTO positions. CTOs are responsible for monitoring, assessing, and selecting new technologies to improve organizational performance through new products, services, or internal processes. They work with various stakeholders due to technology's pervasive role in organizations today. CTOs in federal agencies work with various stakeholders to develop and implement technologies for better mission performance. The role of a CTO can overlap with that of a CIO, with a focus on information technology. Some CTOs have broader responsibilities, such as overseeing security technologies in transportation. Bush, the deputy director of management for OMB, served as the federal CIO overseeing agency-level CIOs and e-government initiatives. In 2001, OMB established the position of associate director for information technology and e-government to lead federal e-government efforts. Norman Lorentz became the first chief technology officer at OMB in 2002, tasked with coordinating technological architecture for e-government initiatives. President Obama appointed Jeffrey D. Zients as federal chief performance officer and Vivek Kundra as federal chief information officer. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) would work closely with the CPO and CIO to ensure transparency in government spending. The Clinton Administration's National Performance Review had functions similar to those outlined for a CTO in President Obama's campaign document. The National Partnership for Reinventing Government, established under Vice President Al Gore in 1993, aimed to make the Federal Government more efficient through the use of information technology. Renamed in 1998, the focus shifted to using technology to transform government operations, with an emphasis on citizen interaction. This evolution led to the development of e-gov with the goal of improving government services through technology. E-gov, a transformation in citizen-government interaction, aims to provide better access to government services. By the end of 2000, 40 million Americans were conducting business electronically. Access America and G-Gov were key technology-focused initiatives under the National Partnership for Reinventing Government. The director served as a senior policy advisor to Vice President Gore, advocating for technological innovation in government services. The Technology Administration, previously responsible for U.S. civilian technological innovation, was eliminated in 2007 under the America COMPETES Act. Its duties included conducting technology policy analyses to improve industrial productivity, technology, and innovation. The Technology Administration, responsible for U.S. civilian technological innovation, was eliminated in 2007 under the America COMPETES Act. Its duties included analyzing technology policy to improve industrial productivity, technology, and innovation, as well as determining the influence of economic conditions, industrial structure, and government policies on technological developments in various industrial sectors worldwide. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting technological innovation in the United States through various initiatives such as creating centers, joint ventures, cooperative research, and discussions among companies. It aims to encourage technology transfer, stimulate innovation, improve training programs, and promote investment in technology-related industries. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is responsible for science and technology issues in the White House. It was established in 1941 and later mandated by Congress in 1976 to provide scientific and technological analysis for the President. The OSTP plays a key role in advancing technological innovation in the United States and leveraging foreign innovations. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) advises the President on science and technology impacts, policies, and budgets. President Obama combined the CTO position with OSTP duties by appointing Mr. Chopra. Mr. Chopra has been selected to serve as both CTO and associate director of OSTP for technology. The CTO may face challenges in defining roles, recruiting talent, and negotiating responsibilities. Without statutory authorities and a dedicated budget, the effectiveness of the CTO may depend on the mandate provided by President Obama. The effectiveness of the CTO may depend on the mandate from President Obama, White House support, and personal attributes. Turf wars with other agencies could be a challenge, involving issues like technology policy and security. Overlapping authorities within the Executive Office of the President could lead to conflicts. The CTO may face conflicts with other agencies like the NEC, President's Council on Innovation, and Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator due to overlapping authorities within the Executive Office of the President. The co-location of the CTO within OSTP may enhance coordination but could lead to reporting and jurisdiction issues within OSTP and other EOP offices, as well as potential overlaps with OMB's CPO and CIO functions and other executive branch agencies like the FCC and Department of Commerce. The establishment of the CTO position may impact its ability to transcend presidential administrations. If the CTO relies solely on the President's executive authority, its existence would be at the discretion of current or future Presidents. In contrast, if the CTO is established by statute, it would continue to exist through changes in administrations unless eliminated by statute. President Obama has not sought legislation to create a statutory foundation for the CTO position. The CTO position remains largely undefined, with Mr. Chopra having a small staff to assist him. Appointment to the CTO position is at the President's discretion and does not require Senate confirmation. The CTO is organizationally part of OSTP, separate from the associate director of OSTP for technology. Mr. Chopra's role as CTO in the Obama Administration is not clearly defined, making it challenging to distinguish his activities as CTO from those as associate director of OSTP. He described his role as CTO as encompassing his duties as Assistant to the President and OSTP associate director for technology. In his role as Assistant to the President, Mr. Chopra coordinates technology R&D and policy, ensuring technology and innovation are integrated into various policy priorities. This aligns with President Obama's goal of incorporating technology into decision-making processes. Mr. Chopra's role as Assistant to the President involves coordinating technology R&D and policy to integrate technology and innovation into various policy priorities. This aligns with President Obama's goal of incorporating technology into decision-making processes. Mr. Chopra's responsibilities include assisting in implementing the President's Strategy for American Innovation, which focuses on investing in fundamental research, workforce skill development, infrastructure, and access to information technology tools. Mr. Chopra focuses on promoting competitive markets, driving innovations in healthcare technology, and catalyzing breakthroughs for national priorities through investments in energy, vehicle, and healthcare technologies. He aims to harness technology and innovation to create jobs and improve the economy. Mr. Chopra aims to execute the President's vision for a 21st Century economy by creating jobs, improving U.S. competitiveness, and expanding adoption of broadband technologies. He discussed his work in technology for open government, supporting the Open Government Directive to provide information to the public in accessible formats. Mr. Chopra utilized technologies like wikis, blogs, and posts to gather public input for the Open Government Directive. He also focused on improving government performance through research, development, and deployment efforts, as well as advocating for technology and innovation in education. The CTO, Mr. Chopra, focuses on identifying hidden talent in STEM fields and utilizing technology for innovation. His duties include policy development, public communication, and fostering agency collaboration. Congress has the opportunity to oversee the Administration's plans for this position. The White House has not provided detailed information on the roles and responsibilities of the CTO, its organizational structure, staffing plans, or relationship to White House offices and federal agencies. Representative Connolly introduced the Chief Technology Officer Act of 2009 to make the position of CTO permanent. The Chief Technology Officer Act of 2009 aims to establish the CTO as the spokesperson for technology in the federal government and the White House. It would create a statutory foundation for the Office of the Chief Technology Officer, outlining thirteen duties focused on information technology and national infrastructure security. The CTO would also provide analysis and advice to the President and federal agencies on IT policies and programs. The Chief Technology Officer Act of 2009 aims to establish the CTO as the spokesperson for technology in the federal government and the White House. The bill does not give the CTO a broad enough portfolio, according to the OMB. Concerns have been raised about the wide range of duties assigned to the CTO, potentially making them ineffectual. It is important for the CTO and CIO to have the authorities to facilitate participatory democracy. The act was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on May 4, 2009, with no action taken yet. The Chief Technology Officer Act of 2009 aims to establish the Office of the Chief Technology Officer in the Executive Office of the President with various duties related to information technology. Representative Ike Skelton offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, which was agreed to in the House. The provisions are similar to those in H.R. 1910, focusing on fostering IT development, public-private partnerships, and information collection and analysis. The Chief Technology Officer Act of 2009 proposes establishing the Office of the Chief Technology Officer in the Executive Office of the President. The CTO would be responsible for analyzing IT trends, advising on major IT policies, and producing annual reports on technological innovations. If Congress establishes the CTO position through statute, it would have various duties related to information technology. Congress may consider various issues if it chooses to establish the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) position through statute, such as defining the CTO's mission, duties, and authorities, determining the level of funding, deciding on the placement within the executive branch, confirming the appointment process, and structuring the CTO as a stand-alone position or part of an office/agency with its own staff. The composition of the staff for the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) position should include various occupations like scientists, engineers, IT professionals, lawyers, managers, and administrators. The CTO's duties should be defined in relation to other offices in the Executive Office of the President and executive branch agencies. The relationship between the President's CTO and existing CTOs and CIOs of departments and agencies should also be considered."
