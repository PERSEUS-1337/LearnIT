A simple method for estimating parameters in implicit models has been developed, which does not require knowledge of the likelihood function's form. This method is equivalent to maximizing likelihood under certain conditions in the non-asymptotic parametric setting. Generative modeling, a key aspect of machine learning, has gained attention with models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial nets (GANs) delivering impressive advances in performance. Generative models can be categorized as prescribed models or implicit models. Prescribed models have an explicit density specification, making sampling challenging due to the intractable normalization constant. Implicit models are defined by a simple sampling procedure, often involving a parameterized transformation of an analytic distribution like an isotropic Gaussian. Generative models involve a sampling procedure where z is sampled from a normal distribution and transformed using a function approximator like a neural net. The marginal likelihood of these models is characterized by a complex expression involving the probability density function of the normal distribution. Evaluating this expression numerically is challenging due to the exponential number of disjoint regions in the integration domain. Some generative models combine explicit density specification with a simple sampling procedure, making them both prescribed and implicit. Generative models like variational autoencoders and directed/autoregressive models use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate model parameters. However, directly maximizing likelihood can be computationally challenging due to the intractable partition function. Various techniques, such as variational methods and contrastive divergence, have been developed to address this issue. In the context of generative models, various methods have been proposed to address the challenges of maximizing likelihood, including variational methods, contrastive divergence, score matching, and pseudolikelihood maximization. Likelihood-free solutions, such as GANs, aim to minimize a divergence measure between data and model distributions. In the context of generative models, various methods have been proposed to address challenges in maximizing likelihood. GANs aim to minimize divergence between data and model distributions by using an infinitely powerful discriminator. However, practical challenges like mode dropping/collapse, vanishing gradients, and training instability arise despite theoretical results. These challenges are attributed to assumptions about the discriminator's modeling capacity, the number of samples, and the gradient ascent-descent procedure. In the context of generative models, challenges in maximizing likelihood have been addressed through various methods. One proposed alternative method for estimating parameters in implicit models involves finding the nearest sample to each data example and optimizing model parameters to pull the sample towards it. This method is likelihood-free but can be equivalent to maximizing likelihood under certain conditions, holding when the model capacity and number of data examples are finite. The proposed method optimizes model parameters by ensuring each data example has a similar sample nearby, avoiding mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and training instability. This contrasts with pushing each sample towards the nearest data example, which could lead to all samples being similar to one data example. The proposed method ensures stable training by optimizing model parameters through a simple minimization problem. Leveraging fast nearest neighbour search algorithms allows scalability to large datasets. Various distance metrics can be used, including Euclidean distance, with theoretical guarantees inherited from the Euclidean case. The approach can be extended to use other metrics, such as perceptual similarity metrics. The initial paper focuses on using Euclidean distance in the natural representation of data for simplicity and comparability. Alternative objective functions like minimizing reverse KL divergence have been proposed for learning generative models. One proposed alternative to traditional KL-divergence is to minimize reverse KL-divergence, which penalizes the model for generating implausible samples. This approach leads to a narrow model distribution that concentrates around a few modes, as opposed to a broad distribution that hedges between modes. The success of GANs in generating good samples is often attributed to this phenomenon, assuming access to an infinite number of samples from the true data distribution, which is rarely the case in practice. When only having access to empirical data distribution, the support of the model distribution must be contained within the support of the data examples. This is crucial for maximizing likelihood and ensuring that the model distribution covers all data examples. The maximum likelihood approach preserves all modes in the data distribution and utilizes all available training data to train high-capacity models with a large number of parameters. In contrast, minimizing reverse KL-divergence can lead to mode dropping, allowing the model to selectively choose which data examples to model, hindering the ability to learn the underlying data distribution effectively. When training high-capacity models to learn data distribution, mode dropping can hinder performance by sacrificing recall for precision. Full recall is guaranteed without mode dropping, allowing for improved precision without compromising recall. Sample quality may not necessarily indicate improved density estimation performance in this context. An improvement in precision is achieved without sacrificing recall when mode dropping is disallowed. Sample quality may not reliably indicate density estimation performance due to the potential for misleading results. An objective that disallows mode dropping is crucial for researchers to develop better models, ensuring that any improvement in sample quality is a result of a shift in the precision-recall curve. Table 1 shows the log-likelihood of test data under Gaussian Parzen window density estimated from samples generated by different methods. The restrictiveness of conditions for analytic distributions, distributions with unrestricted location parameters, distributions with location and scale parameters like Gaussian distribution, and distributions with density eventually tending to zero as distance from optimal parameter setting tends to infinity is examined. The conditions for analytic distributions, including Gaussian distribution, require smooth changes in parameters and non-orthogonal vectors. Applying a theorem may be challenging due to unknown coefficients. Ignoring coefficients leads to minimizing an upper bound on the objective, with tightness depending on likelihood differences at the optimum. Generative models trained using the proposed method on benchmark datasets like MNIST, TFD, and CIFAR-10. Models are feedforward neural nets with specific architectures and activation functions. For TFD, a wider architecture with two fully connected hidden layers of 8000 units each is used, followed by an output layer with 2304 units. The noise vector dimensionality is 100 for both MNIST and TFD. CIFAR-10 utilizes a simple convolutional architecture with 1000-dimensional Gaussian noise as input, consisting of five convolutional layers with 512 output channels and a kernel size of 5. Each layer produces 4 \u00d7 4 feature maps, followed by upsampling and activation layers. This design is repeated for different resolutions, resulting in 20 convolutional layers with output 512 channels, and a final output layer with three channels. Our architecture for the final output layer includes three channels with sigmoid activations, providing more modeling capacity than other methods like BID44. Intrinsic evaluation metrics, such as estimated log-likelihood and visual assessment of sample quality, measure different properties of the generative model. The estimated log-likelihood and sample quality are important metrics for evaluating generative models. They measure different aspects of the model's performance, with log-likelihood focusing on recall and sample quality on precision. It is crucial to consider both metrics as they provide complementary information about the model's density estimation performance. In heterogenous experimental settings, sample quality alone may not reflect a model's ability to learn the data distribution. While recall measurement is challenging due to issues with log-likelihood estimation in high dimensions, sample quality cannot detect sample diversity issues. Additionally, cherry-picked samples in research papers pose a solvable problem. The curr_chunk discusses the issue of cherry-picked samples in research papers and the importance of avoiding bias in sample selection. It also highlights the limitations of evaluation criteria in assessing density estimation performance. Despite these challenges, the proposed method is able to generate good samples for various datasets. The reverse KL-divergence is crucial for producing high-quality samples, contrary to the belief that maximizing likelihood results in poor samples. The samples generated using Euclidean distance in the objective are not desaturated or blurry, and exhibit diversity. The model's high log-likelihood scores on MNIST and TFD indicate no significant mode dropping or overfitting to training examples. Visualization of the learned manifold shows distinct samples and their nearest neighbors, demonstrating the model's robustness. The proposed method generates visually plausible images through linear interpolation in latent space, showing smooth transitions between samples. The model learns the geometry of the data manifold without collapsing to isolated points, as illustrated by the evolution of samples becoming sharper during training. The samples in training progress from initially blurry to sharper over time, demonstrating improved sample quality and stability. Results are obtained under full recall setting, suggesting a way to improve precision-recall curve without sacrificing accuracy. The paper focuses on improving sample quality by moving the curve upwards in the model. The approach is kept simple to avoid obfuscating the key idea and to lay a foundation for future research. Despite its minimal sophistication, the method outperforms other methods in generating plausible samples on CIFAR-10. Despite the simplicity of the method, it shows promise in improving sample quality. Other methods have incorporated additional supervision and task-specific modifications to achieve state-of-the-art results. The refinement of the architecture to leverage task-specific insights is an important area for future exploration. Concerns about maximizing likelihood leading to poor sample quality have been raised, but empirical evidence suggests otherwise. Increasing model capacity can help avoid mode dropping and improve sample quality by fitting a larger number of parameters. This approach aims to address the trade-off between maximizing likelihood and achieving good sample quality, which is often seen when using reverse KL-divergence. By increasing model capacity, it becomes possible to model all modes effectively and generate high-quality samples, making maximum likelihood a suitable choice in this scenario. When the model has infinite capacity, minimizing distance from data examples to their nearest samples will lead to memorization of data examples. Methods typically use a parametric model with finite capacity to avoid overfitting. In the parametric setting, the minimum divergence and distance from data examples to their nearest samples may not be zero, preventing overfitting. Arjovsky et al. (2017) note that data and model distributions are on low-dimensional manifolds with little overlap, causing practical issues for gradient-based learning. The gradient-based learning faces practical issues when the data and model distributions have little overlap, leading to gradients being zero almost everywhere. To address this, models like variational autoencoders use a Gaussian distribution with high variance for the conditional likelihood model. This issue does not affect our method, as our loss function differs from the log-likelihood function, resulting in different gradients. When the data distribution and model distribution supports do not overlap, the gradient is large, especially when data examples are far from the samples. The method presented is a simple and versatile approach for parameter estimation when the likelihood form is unknown. It involves drawing samples from the model, finding the nearest sample to each data example, and adjusting the model parameters accordingly. This method can capture the full diversity of the data and avoids common issues like mode collapse and training instability. It has shown promising results on various datasets like MNIST, TFD, and CIFAR-10. The proof involves showing the existence of a bounded set S in \u2126 such that certain conditions hold. By considering the closure of S, it is shown to be compact and differentiable on \u2126. This leads to the conclusion that certain inequalities hold for \u03b8 in relation to S. The proof establishes the existence of a bounded set S in \u2126 with specific conditions. It shows S is compact and differentiable on \u2126, leading to inequalities for \u03b8 in relation to S. This implies \u03b8 is the unique minimizer of N i=1 w i \u03a6(f i (\u00b7)) on \u2126."
