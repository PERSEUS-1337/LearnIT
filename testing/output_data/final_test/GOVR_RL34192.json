    "content": "The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) revised its estimates of people living with HIV/AIDS, stating that 33.2 million individuals are affected, a decrease from the initial 2006 estimate of 39.5 million. Improved data collection methods and analysis led to more accurate prevalence rates in 2007, with lower numbers reported in most countries. The revised estimates by UNAIDS show a decrease in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS globally, with India and five sub-Saharan African countries accounting for 70% of the reduction. While prevalence rates have stabilized and incidence rates are mostly declining, the total number of people living with HIV/AIDS continues to rise at a slower rate. UNAIDS predicts a lower number of new HIV infections in 2007 compared to 2001, but the number of AIDS-related deaths is expected to remain high. HIV/AIDS is also contributing to rising TB prevalence in high HIV/AIDS areas. In 2005, about 80% of all HIV-positive people with TB were found in Africa, with nearly 630,000 co-infected individuals. TB considerably shortens the survival of people with HIV/AIDS, with 160,000 of the nearly 195,000 co-infected patients who died from TB being African. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, TB killed 1.6 million people, including 195,000 who were also infected with HIV/AIDS. In 2005, 84% of TB cases occurred in 22 countries, mostly in Africa and Asia. Half of all new TB cases were in six countries. HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria are preventable diseases with catastrophic impacts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. People infected with one of the diseases are more likely to contract the others, with more severe symptoms. Each year, there are about 300 million acute malaria cases, causing over 1 million deaths annually, mostly in Africa. UNAIDS estimates it would cost billions to effectively combat these diseases. In 2006, Congress provided $3.4 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs. Global spending in 2006 reached nearly $9 billion, $6 billion less than UNAIDS advocated. Congress authorized $3 billion annually from 2004 to 2008 for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). PEPFAR aimed to assist millions affected by HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB. Since 1981, 65 million people have contracted HIV/AIDS, with over 25 million deaths. The US is the largest donor for global HIV/AIDS efforts, providing nearly 50% of all donor funding. The US is the largest single donor for global HIV/AIDS efforts, providing nearly 50% of all donor funds. There is debate about the effectiveness of PEPFAR, with some experts criticizing its single-disease approach and ideological factors. HIV/AIDS advocates urge harmonizing efforts with other donors to boost impact. Congress may debate how many diseases PEPFAR should address as it considers reauthorization. Since President Bush launched the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in June 2005, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) decided to exclude malaria spending from its annual reports to Congress. Budget requests for malaria would be separate from HIV/AIDS and TB. The Administration seeks support for PMI through USAID. Congress may need to decide whether to define PEPFAR solely as an HIV/AIDS initiative or one addressing multiple diseases. Consensus is growing among health experts for greater emphasis on HIV prevention in global programs. The international community has significantly increased access to HIV/AIDS treatment, but millions still lack treatment. In sub-Saharan Africa, treatment coverage has improved but remains below the needed levels. In 2006, 4.3 million people contracted HIV, with 2.8 million being African. 2.9 million people died of AIDS, with 2.1 million being African. Health experts advocate increased spending on PMTCT initiatives to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. UNAIDS estimates that 1,800 children worldwide are infected with HIV daily, with the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2005, less than 8% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries had access to services to prevent HIV transmission to their babies. Two-thirds of women without access to PMTCT interventions are from 10 countries, mostly in Africa. Some experts suggest integrating HIV/AIDS and family planning services for better care. Supporters propose offering contraceptives to women receiving PMTCT services to reduce the risk of HIV-positive births. The Ensuring Access to Contraceptives Act (H.R. 2367) aims to expand family planning and contraceptive access with a $150 million authorization. The bill aims to provide $150 million for family planning and contraceptives in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. There is also support for the United Nations Population Fund Women's Health and Dignity Act (H.R. 2604) to save women's lives, reduce abortion and maternal mortality, promote universal access to family planning, and address women's lower status in affected countries to prevent new HIV infections. In Africa, married women are at higher risk of contracting HIV compared to single women. Societal forces limit women's options, such as requiring husbands' permission for contraception. Global health activists criticize limited condom distribution to \"high risk groups\" and exclusion of married women. Some HIV/AIDS proponents advocate expanding U.S. condom distribution guidelines to include married young people, as married women are at higher risk of contracting HIV in Africa. Health experts are debating the role of circumcision in HIV prevention, with studies showing it can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV by more than half. Mass circumcision in high transmission areas could prevent millions of new infections and deaths over 20 years. The WHO and UNAIDS endorse circumcision as part of HIV prevention initiatives, estimating it could prevent 5.7 million new infections and 3 million deaths over 20 years. However, it is not a \"magic bullet\" and does not fully prevent virus acquisition. Health experts advise counseling men on maintaining other protective practices like abstinence, reducing partners, and using condoms. Some scientists question the validity of studies due to early termination, suggesting other factors may explain transmission reduction. Critics and advocates of male circumcision for HIV prevention agree that additional research is needed to determine its impact on transmission to women in Africa. Unhygienic circumcision procedures may contribute to higher HIV rates among circumcised individuals in sub-Saharan Africa. It is recommended that circumcision be part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, including other protective practices like abstinence and condom use. Male circumcision for HIV prevention should be part of a comprehensive package that includes treatment for sexually transmitted infections, promotion of safer sex practices, and provision of condoms. Health systems in Africa need to be strengthened to ensure safe procedures. However, some facilities lack necessary supplies, and there are concerns that increased focus on circumcision may disrupt other healthcare programs. Global health advocates urge Congress to ensure that male circumcision services are integrated with other services, particularly in areas with severe shortages of skilled health workers, should it include support for the practice in PEPFAR. Some experts argue that current U.S. AIDS-related spending restrictions negatively impact the effectiveness of PEPFAR programs. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Act mandates that no funds may be used to assist any group that does not explicitly oppose prostitution and sex trafficking, known as \"the prostitution pledge.\" Critics argue that this restriction should be eliminated. Critics argue that the \"Mexico City Policy\" and the \"prostitution pledge\" restrictions limit HIV/AIDS prevention efforts and reproductive health services. The House and Senate reports for FY2008 Foreign Operations appropriations aimed to prevent the \"Mexico City Policy\" from being the sole reason for withholding U.S. funds for contraceptives. A conference is pending on this issue. Some U.S. funds cannot be used for contraceptives. A pending conference is expected to address opposition to repealing the \"Mexico City Policy.\" Health experts criticize HIV prevention stipulations for emphasizing abstinence until marriage and limiting countries' use of prevention funds. PEPFAR funds allocation requires a percentage for prevention efforts, with a focus on abstinence-until-marriage programs. The Government Accountability Office found that PEPFAR's spending requirements restricted flexibility in prevention fund usage. OGAC increased prevention spending by almost 55% between FY2004 and FY2006, with mandates on how funds should be allocated for sexual transmission prevention and abstinence/faithfulness activities. Critics argue that these policies create additional reporting requirements and consume limited resources. Suggestions include eliminating spending restrictions, coordinating reporting requirements with other donors, and signing on to the International Health Partnership. Some in Congress support legislation to remove spending provisions related to abstinence-until-marriage requirements in global HIV/AIDS programs. The Bush Administration initially expressed skepticism about the use of generic ARV medication in PEPFAR programs. Access to generic HIV/AIDS treatments may be a key issue in reauthorization debates. The Bush Administration required generic drugs bought with PEPFAR funds to be FDA-inspected, sparking debate over delays in ARV distribution. GAO reported in 2005 that this policy limited ARV selection, didn't fully support treatment strategies, and lacked coordination with other initiatives. Coordination with focus countries and lower ARV prices could save millions for additional patient treatment or other plan aspects. In March 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found that the U.S. treatment policy for HIV/AIDS programs in Focus Countries complicated national treatment efforts. IOM recommended supporting WHO prequalification as the global standard for generic medication quality. OGAC has strengthened coordination with WHO, with 27% of ARVs purchased in FY2006 being generic. Over 50 generic ARVs have been approved for use in PEPFAR treatment plans by the FDA. Many health experts urge Congress to integrate PEPFAR-supported programs with other health initiatives to save lives. PEPFAR's disease-specific approach may overshadow support for nutrition, maternal and child health, and other infectious diseases. Malnutrition and food insecurity can increase HIV exposure and complicate ARV medication provision. HIV/AIDS patients may be too ill to work, reducing agricultural productivity and leading to a 40% drop in food consumption in affected households. Consumption drops by 40% in homes affected by HIV/AIDS, leading to challenges in maintaining treatment regimens due to decreased food production. Malnourished patients starting ARV therapy are six times more likely to die and more likely to suffer side effects, especially in rural communities with limited access to care. In AIDS-affected African countries, rural populations rely on agriculture for livelihoods. PEPFAR provides limited food assistance to vulnerable populations, including orphans, malnourished HIV-positive individuals, and pregnant/lactating women. OGAC contributed $2.45 million to the World Food Program in FY2006 and $4.27 million in FY2007. Ambassador Dybul acknowledged PEPFAR's limited engagement in food insecurity but stated it is intentional. Ambassador Dybul testified at a hearing that PEPFAR supports \"wrap around\" programs for HIV-affected populations, including clean water, education, and gender projects. The United Nations emphasizes the importance of skilled health personnel in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality rates, especially in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, 1 in 16 women die from pregnancy or childbirth complications, compared to 1 in 3,800 in industrialized countries. In industrialized countries, 1 in 3,800 women die from pregnancy or childbirth complications, while in sub-Saharan Africa, the rate is 1 in 16. Child survival rates are higher in areas with sufficient health workers, clean water, and access to nutritious food. HIV weakens the immune system, making infected individuals more susceptible to illnesses like malaria. Africa is the only region where new TB infections are rising, largely due to HIV/AIDS co-infection. In 2004, over 740,000 people with TB also had HIV/AIDS, with 600,000 cases in sub-Saharan Africa. Poorly equipped health systems in Africa struggle to contain TB due to limited resources and trained staff. Critics of PEPFAR urge Congress to consider the impact of unbalanced spending on overall health systems. The generous salaries and incentives offered by donor-supported HIV/AIDS programs draw health workers from public health facilities, threatening other life-saving interventions like maternal and child survival health initiatives. WHO states that the global shortage of healthcare workers is a critical issue, with the greatest shortages in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Africa has the greatest proportional shortage of healthcare workers in the world, with 36 countries facing critical shortages. WHO estimates that an additional 4.3 million health workers are needed globally, with Africa needing to increase its healthcare workforce by about 140%. Africa faces a critical shortage of healthcare workers, with 36 countries in need of more professionals. The World Bank's report highlighted the issue, stating that 20,000 skilled professionals leave Africa annually. The Malawi Ministry of Health has lost a significant percentage of its health administrators, nurses, and physicians in recent years. The Malawi Ministry of Health has lost a large number of healthcare workers to foreign NGOs, funded by various organizations. Efforts are being made to attract them back, mainly to distribute antiretroviral medication. However, there is a lack of support for programs to attract health workers to treat other common illnesses. Contrary to claims by Ambassador Dybul, a report by the Institute of Medicine suggests that PEPFAR may limit healthcare options for non-HIV patients. PEPFAR's focus on HIV/AIDS activities may worsen national shortages in health workforce, neglecting other health areas. Limited support for expanding the clinical workforce, despite being part of national plans, could exacerbate resource constraints. PEPFAR's focus on HIV/AIDS activities may worsen national shortages in the health workforce. IOM recommended closer collaboration with governments to analyze the impact on public health systems, particularly in maternal and child health. The report suggested increasing support for the education of new health professionals to strengthen health systems. The International Health Partnership (IHP) was launched by British Prime Minister and German Chancellor to strengthen health systems and combat infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Fragmented global health aid has reduced effectiveness due to competition for limited staff and lack of consideration for countries' priorities. DFID emphasizes the need to strengthen struggling health systems by focusing on training doctors and nurses, building clinics, and supporting basic health services. The IHP parties commit to improving donor coordination and supporting recipient countries' health plans. Health experts suggest increasing support for health systems research to address health systems failures. Less than 1% of research dollars are currently allocated to health systems research. Health systems research can help identify failures, improve interventions, and make healthcare more accessible and affordable. It can assist in developing effective forecasting and distribution systems for drugs, reducing stock-outs, and improving retention of health personnel. Data from this research can determine the needed care programs for the target population and make existing programs more efficient. Structural adjustment programs have led to a decline in public sector employment and limited investment in health workers. Health sector reform, including structural adjustment programs, has resulted in a decline in public sector employment and limited investment in health worker education. This has led to shortages of health workers in many countries, with unemployed health workers leaving for better opportunities abroad. Critics argue that these reforms have also caused a decline in the quality of education and training for medical students, shortages of health supplies and equipment, insufficient medicine and vaccine stocks, and a \"brain drain\" of African health workers. The continent of Africa spends about 1% of the world's health expenditure, with concerns raised about reliance on World Bank funding for health programs. The World Bank has lent $15 billion for health, nutrition, and population funds from 1997 to 2006, adding to countries' debt burdens. Oxfam estimates that half of the countries in the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still spending 15% or more of government funds on debt service rather than public health programs. Some health advocates urge Congress to encourage the IMF to maintain debt relief commitments for Highly Indebted Poor Countries. Legislation introduced in the 110th Congress authorizes funds for family planning, HIV/AIDS initiatives, and supply chain logistics. Acts like the Focus on Family Health Worldwide Act (H.R. 1225) and the U.S. Commitment to Child Survival Act (S. 1418) aim to improve health in developing countries. The African Health Capacity Investment Act (S. 805) assists sub-Saharan African countries in achieving health goals. The African Health Capacity Investment Act aims to assist sub-Saharan African countries in achieving health goals, including the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS, reducing maternal and child mortality, and improving healthcare capacity. UNAIDS estimates that there are 2.5 million children living with HIV globally, with nearly 90% in sub-Saharan Africa. The rate of new HIV infections in children is declining, and AIDS-related deaths among children have also decreased. HIV/AIDS not only affects children living with the virus but also those who lose parents to the disease and live in homes caring for orphans. Children orphaned by AIDS may face challenges such as leaving school to work, depression, and engaging in risky behavior. Those living in homes caring for orphans may experience food and education shortages. Advocates call for increased support for caretakers of these children. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act of 2003 allocates 10% of funds to support children affected by the virus. The Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children Act of 2005 established monitoring and evaluation systems for related assistance activities. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act of 2003 allocates funds to support children affected by the virus. The Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children Act of 2005 established monitoring and evaluation systems for related assistance activities. Congress is urged to appropriate funds for a permanent Special Advisor position to oversee U.S. spending on activities for orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS. The U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act of 2003 provides funds for children affected by HIV/AIDS. The Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children Act of 2005 established monitoring and evaluation systems for related assistance activities. Critics argue that creating a permanent Special Advisor position to oversee U.S. spending on activities for orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS would duplicate costs. UNAIDS reports that millions of children worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, with low access to treatment compared to adults in developing countries. Advocates urge increased spending on pediatric HIV/AIDS treatment to reduce child mortality rates. OGAC allocated 9% of ARV spending to children in FY2006. HIV/AIDS analysts recommend including countries with rapidly spreading virus in GHAI, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia where HIV cases have increased by over 150% since 2001. The Russian Federation and Ukraine account for the majority of new HIV diagnoses in the region. In the Caribbean, HIV/AIDS prevalence rates have stabilized, but remain high in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. 75% of those affected in the region live in these two countries, with 230,000 people HIV-positive and 11,000 expected to die from the virus. Legislation has been introduced to combat HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean, but there are concerns about expanding support without a clear commitment from Congress. HIV/AIDS advocates emphasize the need for long-term care for this chronic disease. HIV/AIDS advocates stress the importance of long-term care for the chronic disease, highlighting the need for countries to know the level and duration of support from the United States to expand initiatives."
