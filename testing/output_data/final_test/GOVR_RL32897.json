Legislation is being considered to reform the Homeland Security Advisor System for a more reliable national threat notification system. It is believed that a single entity should convey threat information consistently with other government communications during times of crisis. The federal government's warning notification process lacks coordination, leading to inconsistent messages about threats to the homeland. The effectiveness of the Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) in conveying threat information has been called into question due to speculative color-code changes and contradictory threat information from different agencies. The Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) was established in response to inconsistent threat information provided by different agencies. The system, created through Homeland Security Presidential Directive-3 (HSPD-3), gives the Attorney General responsibility for announcing threats to the nation. The Under Secretary of the Infrastructure Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Directorate administers the HSAS, providing warning information to state and local government agencies and the private sector. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibility of managing the HSAS from the DOJ to the DHS. There have been instances of uncoordinated national threat announcements between DHS, DOJ, and other federal entities. Leadership changes may help resolve future issues. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibility of managing the HSAS from the DOJ to the DHS. Recent changes in Departmental and Agency leadership may help resolve uncoordinated and premature threat announcements. Previous issues with threat announcements have eroded HSAS credibility, leading to congressional review. Attorney General Ashcroft announced a heightened threat level on September 11, 2002, based on intelligence regarding possible terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred responsibility of managing the HSAS from the DOJ to the DHS. Recent changes in leadership may help resolve uncoordinated threat announcements. Concerns arise over conflicting statements regarding terrorist threats on the anniversary of September 11 attacks. Security preempted the Attorney General's responsibility to announce threat information. Despite significant warnings from senior officials about potential Al Qaeda attacks, the HSAS status remained unchanged. The warnings highlighted the possibility of high-impact attacks with symbolic value, mass casualties, and severe economic damage. On February 7, 2003, the threat level was raised to Orange, following the enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Secretary of Homeland Security Ridge announced intelligence reports suggesting potential threats. Despite warnings from senior officials, the national alert status remained unchanged. On February 7, 2003, Secretary of Homeland Security Ridge announced intelligence reports of potential Al Qaeda attacks on soft targets. Varying descriptions of the threat's specificity were given by Administration officials during the alert level rise. Ridge mentioned vague intelligence on possible attacks, while Attorney General Ashcroft highlighted increased likelihood based on specific information. DCI Tenet testified that the threat alert was as specific as ever. Attorney General Ashcroft confirmed specific intelligence from multiple sources regarding a high terrorist threat level. The alert level was raised to Orange on March 17, 2003, due to intelligence indicating potential Al Qaeda attacks in response to the war in Iraq. Prior to the war in Iraq, officials believed that military operations would lead to terrorist attacks in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security lowered the threat level on April 11, 2003, citing assessments by the intelligence community. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld warned of potential attacks by Al Qaeda or former Iraqi regime agents. On May 20, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security raised the threat level to Orange due to intelligence indicating Al Qaeda's plans to attack the United States. Secretary Ridge reassured the public of increased safety measures. The Department of Homeland Security raised the threat level to Orange in response to intelligence reports on anti-U.S. terrorist group intentions and recent attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco. The alert was raised due to increased specificity in information, although there were no specific details on targets or timing of an attack. On December 21, 2003, the threat level was raised to Orange due to increased intelligence reports indicating possible attacks during the holiday season. Secretary of Homeland Security Ridge mentioned credible sources suggesting attacks on the homeland. The Homeland Security Advisory System (HSAS) has been raised multiple times to prevent potential terrorist attacks, with officials acknowledging that it's difficult to determine if the alert level actually stopped any attacks. Despite lowering the threat level, the FBI Director warned that the country should remain vigilant as another attack could still occur in the future. In 2004, there were public discussions about significant threat information causing anxiety among U.S. citizens. In March 2004, the FBI issued a threat advisory regarding a potential terrorist targeting of the Texas oil industry, causing concern among U.S. citizens and Congress. Despite the advisory coming solely from the FBI, questions arose about communication breakdowns between federal agencies. On May 26, 2004, Secretary Ridge and other authorities gave conflicting messages about the terrorist threat, causing confusion among the American public. Attorney General Ashcroft later warned of a specific intention by Al Qaeda to attack the United States in the next few months. Attorney General Ashcroft warned of a specific intention by Al Qaeda to attack the United States, citing intelligence suggesting an imminent threat. Despite this, Secretary Ridge expressed surprise and stated that there was not enough specific information to raise the National Color-code alert. Mr. Ridge responded that there was not specific enough information to raise the alert level. Representative Christopher Cox criticized the lack of coordination in disseminating terrorism warnings, pointing out the absence of Secretary Ridge from a recent news conference and conflicting messages from other officials. This lack of coordination suggests a general disunity in warning messages. Homeland Security employees complain of lack of respect from CIA and FBI colleagues, citing a lack of coordination and unity in threat warnings. DHS has been criticized for issuing terror alerts based on questionable information. Threat level raised to Orange six times from August 1 to November 10, 2004, due to Al Qaeda planning attacks on financial institutions. The DHS raised the threat level to Orange multiple times in 2004 due to Al Qaeda planning attacks on financial institutions and other targets in the US. Specific information indicated potential attacks on New York, Washington, D.C., and New Jersey. Additionally, there were mentions of threats to the US Capitol and Members of Congress, although specific, credible, direct threats were not confirmed. Secretary Ridge announced an increase in the threat level without mentioning specific targets. Later, he admitted the information was \"sketchy and incomplete.\" Senator Mark Dayton closed his office temporarily as a precaution to protect staff and constituents due to the uncertain intelligence and threat environment. The threat level was raised in Washington, D.C., causing confusion and loss of confidence in the system. Local governments and the public complained about the varying details supporting the decision. Hawaii decided to stay at the blue level when the federal government raised it to orange. The federal government raised the threat level to orange, considering the monetary cost of increased security and potential loss of life. Hawaii officials questioned the decision, stating that states and counties don't have to follow the federal recommendation. Business leaders called for better threat information from law enforcement. Business leaders called for better threat information and coordination among agencies to address the issue of contradictory threat levels and lack of unified messages. The confusion surrounding threat warning products for senior decision makers in the United States has prompted calls for clearer terrorism threat advisories. Options include clarifying DHS's role in alerting the nation, eliminating the Homeland Security Advisory System, or transferring responsibility to the National Counter Terrorism Center. The debate centers on whether DHS should have sole authority in conveying homeland security threats. President Bush recommended that the Department of Homeland Security coordinate communication with State and local governments, private industry, and the American people about threats and preparedness. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority and responsibility for distributing warnings and information to State and local government personnel, agencies, and the public. Congress could reemphasize DHS' primacy in alerting the Nation of impending threats, clarifying who is authorized to be the public face of national threat notifications. The current system of national threat notifications may be eliminated due to uncoordinated efforts, lack of uniformity, and public skepticism. The replacement system, if any, would need to address the unique nature of each threat situation. Threat information, geographic location, target location, timing of attack, and defensive measures should be considered for effective communication. The current national threat notification system may be replaced due to lack of coordination and public skepticism. The current color-coded system allows for assessment of threat levels, but a new warning-notice system may pose challenges in comparison to past warnings. The National Counter Terrorism Center, established under the Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, serves as the primary organization for analyzing and integrating intelligence related to terrorism and counterterrorism. It acts as a central knowledge bank on known and suspected terrorists, international terror groups, and their networks. The NCTC is well positioned to review terrorist threat information and coordinate warning messages to the public. The NCTC could be designated as the federal government's communicator of threat information to the Nation, allowing Congress to hold one organization responsible for terrorism analysis and warnings. DHS would still provide specific advice on protective measures, but based on threat information from the NCTC. Other Departments could disseminate threat information under exigent circumstances. The issue of coordinating threat information dissemination remains crucial, whether through the current HSAS system, situation-specific warnings, or transfer to the NCTC. Critics emphasize the need for a unified and clear message in national threat announcements to prevent public desensitization. Confusion and lack of coordination in the current process may erode confidence in threat notifications. The lack of confidence due to confusion in the current notification process could be a significant liability in an actual emergency."
