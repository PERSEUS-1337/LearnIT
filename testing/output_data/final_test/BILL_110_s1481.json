It focuses on early disclosure of healthcare errors, fair compensation for patients, promoting patient safety, and supporting states in developing these alternatives. Additionally, it includes a State Demonstration Program to evaluate alternatives to current medical tort litigation. The \"Fair and Reliable Medical Justice Act\" includes a State Demonstration Program to evaluate alternatives to current medical tort litigation. The Secretary can award demonstration grants to States for developing alternatives to current tort litigation in resolving disputes over injuries caused by healthcare providers. Up to 10 grants can be awarded for a maximum of 5 years each, with States required to create alternative dispute resolution systems. The Secretary can award demonstration grants to States for developing alternatives to current tort litigation in resolving disputes over injuries caused by healthcare providers. States must demonstrate how the proposed alternative makes the medical liability system more reliable, encourages disclosure of healthcare errors, and enhances patient safety by detecting, analyzing, and reducing medical errors and adverse events. Each State seeking a grant must identify sources of compensation for claims resolved under the proposed alternative to current tort litigation, which may include public or private funding sources. Funding methods should incentivize activities that improve patient safety. Each State applying for a grant must define a scope of jurisdiction for the proposed alternative to tort litigation, such as a specific geographic region or group of healthcare providers. Patients must be informed of services falling within this scope and given the option to opt out. The Secretary will give preference to States that have developed the proposed alternative through consultation with stakeholders, aim to enhance patient safety, and have State laws supporting the alternative. The Secretary will prioritize States that have consulted with stakeholders to develop an alternative to tort litigation, aim to improve patient safety, and have supportive State laws. States seeking a grant must submit an application containing required information to the Secretary, who will consult with a review panel of experts appointed by the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General will appoint 14-19 qualified individuals to serve on a review panel, ensuring fair representation for patient advocates, healthcare providers, attorneys with expertise in representing patients and providers, and medical malpractice insurers. The Comptroller General appoints 14-19 individuals to a review panel, including patient advocates, healthcare providers, attorneys specializing in medical cases, and medical malpractice insurers.

States must submit annual reports on grant effectiveness, and the Secretary submits a compendium to Congress. The Secretary offers technical assistance to states applying for grants. Technical assistance provided to States applying for or awarded grants includes guidance on non-economic damages, identification of avoidable injuries, disclosure of healthcare errors, and the development of common definitions and data collection infrastructure for reporting and analysis. The evaluation of grants awarded under subsection (a) will be conducted by a research organization contracted by the Secretary, in consultation with a review panel. The evaluation will begin within 18 months of the first program implementation and include reporting to Congress on effectiveness. The evaluation of grants awarded under subsection (a) will analyze the effects of the grants on specified measures, compare approved alternatives, and compare states receiving grants with similar states not receiving grants based on the nature and number of disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers. The evaluation of grants awarded under subsection (a) will analyze the effects on specified measures, including the nature and number of claims in tort litigation, dispute disposition, medical liability environment, health care quality, patient safety, and satisfaction with the alternative and medical liability environment.
