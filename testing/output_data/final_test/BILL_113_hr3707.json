    "content": "The U.S. policy supports ensuring the security of Camp Liberty/Hurriya residents, assisting in their resettlement outside of Iraq, and allowing their admission as refugees to the United States. The Congress recognizes the residents of former Camp Ashraf now in Camp Liberty/Hurriya as \"protected persons\" under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The residents renounced violence and disarmed over a decade ago, with some being permanent residents or political refugees in the United States. Camp Liberty/Hurriya residents provide valuable intelligence on Iran's nuclear weapons efforts and support for terrorist groups in Iraq. They share the desire for a peaceful, democratic, non-nuclear government in Iran. The residents are cooperating with the UN and Iraq to transfer out of the country despite Iraq's acceptance of the US commitment. Despite Iraq's acceptance of the US commitment to protect Camp Ashraf residents, they have been attacked multiple times by external forces, including Iraqi security forces, resulting in casualties. Iraqi security forces are stationed around Camp Liberty/Hurriya, restricting residents' movement and access to outside help. SEC. 3. ACTIONS TO PROTECT IRANIAN DISSIDENTS LIVING IN CAMP LIBERTY/ HURRIYA. The United States will ensure the safety of residents of Camp Liberty/Hurriya, provide assistance for refugee status processing, and timely admit residents as refugees without delay based on past affiliations. Within 90 days of the effective date of this Act, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will report to Congress on steps taken to protect the residents of Camp Liberty/Hurriya and facilitate their resettlement in safe locations."
