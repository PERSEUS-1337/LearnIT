    "content": "Hurricane Katrina caused unprecedented devastation to the nation's housing stock in 2005, with 1.2 million units damaged and over 300,000 seriously affected. Approximately 700,000 people in the most affected areas were displaced, with 1.25 million living outside their original zip code at the peak. Displaced families included homeowners waiting for insurance settlements, those securing repair loans, and renters facing uncertainty. Some families affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 faced uncertainty with their insurance settlements and housing options. While some quickly repaired their dwellings, others may never rebuild. The impact varied, with some finding permanent homes, others temporarily staying with friends or family, and some still displaced a year later. Economic stability also played a role, with some having savings and good insurance, while others were economically unstable before the disaster. The full extent of the hurricane's effects on these families may never be fully understood. The impact of Hurricane Katrina on affected communities, particularly in terms of poverty and homeownership rates, raised questions about the effectiveness of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. These questions revolved around the program's impact on existing voucher holders, its role in serving displaced families, and the potential need for modifications and expansions. The Section 8 voucher program provides rent subsidies for poor families to reduce housing costs. Families pay 30% of their income towards rent, with the government covering the rest up to a limit called the payment standard. Vouchers are for very low-income families, with priority given to extremely low-income families. The program's effectiveness in serving displaced families and potential modifications are under review. The Section 8 voucher program provides portable rent subsidies for low-income families. Demand exceeds supply, leading to long waiting lists in some areas. The program is overseen by HUD at the federal level but administered by local PHAs. PHAs operate on a fixed budget determined by Congress and receive administrative fees based on prior year allocations. Hurricane Katrina impacted both PHAs and assisted families. Hurricane Katrina affected PHAs and assisted families, with some PHAs temporarily ceasing operations. Families in hurricane-damaged areas receiving federal housing assistance faced challenges in using their aid elsewhere. HUD implemented policies and procedures for storm-affected agencies and families, including immediate actions like identifying vacant public housing units. HUD implemented immediate and longer-term actions in response to Hurricane Katrina, including identifying vacant public housing units for displaced families and establishing a toll-free number for assistance. PHAs were guided on serving displaced families and prioritizing HUD families for assistance by amending their PHA plans. The PHA's board must approve any changes regarding disaster-affected families and determine if a public hearing is necessary. PHAs must accept families with vouchers wishing to move, either absorbing the vouchers themselves or billing the pre-disaster PHA. Absorbing is simpler administratively, while billing can lead to delayed payments and administrative fees issues. The HUD encouraged PHAs to be flexible with portability billings for displaced families after Hurricane Katrina. A new initiative, the Katrina Disaster Housing Assistance Program (KDHAP), was announced on September 24, 2005, to provide rental housing vouchers to HUD-assisted families affected by the disaster. The Katrina Disaster Housing Assistance Program (KDHAP) was introduced on October 4, 2005, to provide rental housing vouchers to displaced HUD-assisted families. In December 2005, $390 million was transferred from FEMA to HUD for Katrina rental assistance. A new Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) replaced KDHAP in February 2006, with differences in subsidy levels and program rules. The Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) replaced the Katrina Disaster Housing Assistance Program (KDHAP) in February 2006. DVP provides a monthly rent subsidy based on the PHA's payment standard or actual rent, with no minimum payment required. Eligibility expanded to cover all KDHAP-eligible families, including those affected by Hurricane Rita. The Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) provides a monthly rent subsidy based on the PHA's payment standard or actual rent, with no minimum payment required. Families must pay for utilities not included in the rent, and PHAs receive a flat fee of $1,500 for each DVP family housed, plus an ongoing administrative fee. The DVP process varies for families based on their previous assistance history. The Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) provides a monthly rent subsidy based on the PHA's payment standard or actual rent, with no minimum payment required. Families must pay for utilities not included in the rent. New families enter the program by applying to a PHA or calling a national toll-free intake number. The PHA or intake worker screens the family for eligibility. If the family's original housing is available, they can move back or receive a DVP voucher. If not available, they receive a DVP voucher with the right to return when it becomes available. The Disaster Voucher Program (DVP) provides a monthly rent subsidy based on the PHA's payment standard or actual rent, with no minimum payment required. Families must pay for utilities not included in the rent. No additional families will be admitted to the program after September 1, 2007. PHAs heavily affected by hurricanes can choose to serve returning families under the DVP program, which is more flexible than the regular voucher program. Families with KDHAP vouchers were transitioned to DVP by March 1, 2006, requiring lease addendums to be filed by PHAs. Under DVP, families may pay less or more in rent compared to KDHAP, depending on their rent and the payment standard. Families could choose to transfer to KDHAP or stay in the regular voucher program. The receiving PHA bills KDHAP for assistance costs, and if costs exceed 100% of FMR, the originating PHA is billed for the difference. Families can still choose between DVP and the regular voucher program, with the PHA billing HUD for the entire cost. Under DVP, families in the program will return to the regular voucher program on December 31, 2007. HUD-assisted families without Section 8 vouchers may receive a voucher if their previous housing is not rebuilt. PHAs under DVP should prepare financially for families' return at the end of the program. Under KDHAP and DVP, homeless families are treated differently than HUD-assisted families. Those previously homeless are served separately in KDHAP-SN. Homeless families became eligible for DVP if they were in a disaster area before Hurricane Katrina or Rita. HUD issued guidance for both programs. To receive DVP housing assistance, homeless families must verify their eligibility by providing residency confirmation from housing providers or written records from homeless service providers. Once eligible, families can seek housing through participating PHAs with assistance from local homeless service providers and Katrina Aid Today for case management. The Katrina Aid Today program, in collaboration with social service organizations, offers case management assistance to Hurricane Katrina survivors. Some concerns were raised about the program, including reluctance from PHAs due to high costs of sheltering and transporting families, criticism for not including utility payments, and complexity in benefit calculation and interaction with other voucher programs. Many are worried about what will happen after the 18-month assistance period. The $390 million supplemental for DVP addressed concerns raised within KDHAP about participation, utility costs, and interaction with regular vouchers. However, DVP does not address the issue of transition at the end of the program. As of December 14, 2005, 12,500 households had been processed under KDHAP, out of potentially 75,000 eligible evacuees. The President's February supplemental request revised down the estimated number of DVP eligible families to 44,000. The February supplemental request revised down the estimated number of DVP eligible families to 44,000. HUD reported that more than 27,000 families have been assisted one year after the storm. As of August 31, 2006, HUD had obligated $110 million for DVP assistance and $97 million had been spent. Additionally, $46 million had been obligated for KDHAP with $44 million spent. Congress did not fund additional Section 8 vouchers for families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Displaced families could apply for existing HUD assistance, including Section 8 vouchers, but waiting lists are long. Some Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) gave waiting list preference to families displaced by Hurricane Katrina, requiring modifications to their PHA Plan. This decision can be controversial as it may preempt other poor families on waiting lists for many years and have budget implications due to fixed budgets and cost fluctuations. Given the inflation factor, displaced families from Hurricane Katrina may qualify for larger subsidies from PHAs, potentially straining PHA budgets. This could lead to reduced assistance for families or a decrease in the total number of families served. Additionally, portable vouchers may result in families leaving the jurisdiction of the issuing PHA, potentially causing the vouchers to be lost if not absorbed in the new community. The extent to which PHAs changed their preferences to prioritize Katrina evacuees is unknown due to the lack of a database. The number of PHAs that changed their preferences to prioritize Katrina evacuees is unknown. Some PHAs chose to prioritize evacuees, while others considered but ultimately decided against changes. Families displaced by Hurricane Katrina faced eligibility issues for assistance due to high incomes. A bill was introduced to waive rules for displaced families. After Hurricane Katrina, advocates called for additional Section 8 vouchers to help displaced families. Temporary vouchers have been created in past emergencies, offering advantages over trailers and cash grants. Vouchers are portable and provide a more effective housing solution. FEMA used vouchers to house displaced families after Hurricane Katrina, connecting them with local organizations for housing. Vouchers are cost-effective compared to trailers but have eligibility complexities and limited rental options. Once authorized, vouchers can be challenging to eliminate, as seen after the Northridge earthquake. After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA used vouchers to house displaced families, which proved cost-effective compared to trailers. Vouchers, once authorized, can be challenging to eliminate, as seen after the Northridge earthquake. Congress extended assistance multiple times before making it permanent, but there may be political reluctance to expand the program due to cost concerns. Legislation was introduced for new temporary vouchers for Katrina victims, but none were enacted before the close of the 109th Congress. Senator Reid introduced the Katrina Emergency Relief Act of 2005, including the \"Helping to House Victims of Hurricane Katrina Act of 2005,\" which would have provided $3.5 billion in emergency appropriations to HUD. The bill proposed $3.5 billion in emergency funding for HUD to provide temporary vouchers for families displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The vouchers would be authorized for six months, extendable for another six months if needed. Eligibility rules and payment limits would be relaxed, with assistance also available for security deposits and relocation. Senator Sarbanes introduced a similar amendment to the Commerce-Justice-Science FY2006 appropriations bill, which was adopted but later dropped. The Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief and Economic Recovery Act (S. 1765 and S. 1766) proposed new programs and additional funding in various areas. It included $3.5 billion for emergency Section 8 vouchers for housing, similar to those in the Reid bill. However, the bills were referred to the Senate Finance Committee with no further action taken. Instead of Section 8 vouchers, FEMA provided cash grants for housing costs as transitional housing assistance under the Stafford Act. The Individual and Household Assistance authority provided cash grants for housing costs as transitional housing assistance under the Stafford Act. The first payment of $2,358 was made in September 2005, representing three months of housing costs based on national average rent. Receipts were initially required to prove eligible expenses, but rules were later relaxed due to lack of guidance. The grants count towards FEMA's $26,200 limit per household, with potential extensions up to 18 months and adjustments for regional rent differences. Eligibility was determined upon registration with FEMA. Eligibility for FEMA assistance was determined upon registration and based on home damage. By August 14, 2006, 718,976 applicants received rental assistance, with 632,808 still eligible by August 23, 2006. FEMA provided trailer homes for up to 18 months post-disaster, with over 116,000 trailers given by August 29, 2006. Additionally, FEMA covered hotel costs for evacuees, peaking at 85,000 rooms and later reducing to 10,000 rooms by February 2006. FEMA provided temporary hotel payments for evacuees, initially planning to cease payments by December 1, 2005. This deadline was extended multiple times, with payments continuing until at least March 15, 2006. FEMA had plans to assist families in finding longer-term housing. Some cities also established their own voucher programs for evacuees. FEMA provided temporary hotel payments for evacuees until at least March 15, 2006. Cities established voucher programs, with Houston issuing 35,000 vouchers for rent. FEMA phased out the program, transitioning leases to a new housing program by March 1, 2006. HUD and FEMA entered an Interagency Agreement in July 2007. In July 2007, HUD and FEMA signed an Interagency Agreement transferring housing assistance responsibility for families displaced by Katrina to HUD. FEMA will provide resources for up to 18 months of rental assistance and case management services for approximately 45,000 families at a total estimated cost of $565 million. Eligible families include those currently receiving FEMA Section 408 assistance.

Eligible families include those currently receiving FEMA Section 408 assistance. Additionally, HUD invited PHAs in areas where families receiving FEMA housing assistance are located to participate in the new Disaster Housing Assistance Pilot Program (DHAP), providing pre-transitional case management to eligible families starting September 1, 2007. Beginning November 1, 2007, PHAs started receiving rental assistance payments from HUD for eligible families, equivalent to the FMR in the community. HUD worked with FEMA to transition families out of travel trailers into rental housing in the private market starting January 2008. The DHAP program was delayed, with HUD and PHAs assuming responsibility on December 1, 2008. 30,200 families were referred by FEMA to receive DHAP assistance initially, with an additional 8,400 families transitioning from FEMA trailers to DHAP by March 2008. Families were required to contribute $50 per month towards rent, increasing monthly. Hurricane Katrina led to a housing disaster, impacting many people, including the poor. The Section 8 voucher program played a minor role in helping displaced families. The DHAP program provided rental assistance, with families contributing $50 per month towards rent, increasing monthly. PHAs coordinated case management services to help residents get back on their feet. HUD worked to transition seniors and persons with disabilities into HUD programs after DHAP ended on March 1, 2009. The response to housing families displaced by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes was criticized as disorganized and inefficient. Various programs were created to assist evacuees, including the KDHAP/DVP program and FEMA's interim policies. Some cities and states developed their own voucher programs with expectations of FEMA reimbursement. Low-income housing advocates raised concerns about families not being adequately housed. Low-income housing advocates raised concerns about families struggling to use transitional housing funds due to tight rental markets and lack of clarity from FEMA. Some families misused funds, leading to eviction and criticism of the cost effectiveness of the assistance provided. The Administration conducted a review of its Katrina response, resulting in recommendations for HUD. The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina recommended HUD as the lead agency for temporary housing, utilizing its experience and network. FEMA was criticized for not utilizing HUD's expertise, leading to the transfer of housing assistance responsibilities to HUD. The Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina recommended HUD as the lead agency for temporary housing, transferring housing assistance responsibilities from FEMA to HUD. The findings and recommendations may result in vouchers playing a larger role in future disasters."
