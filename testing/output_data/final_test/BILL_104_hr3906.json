    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Congress finds that the development of new environmental technologies is a priority for the EPA. Current monitoring requirements hinder innovation by specifying rigid analytical methods. Regulations can promote the adoption of innovative pollution prevention technologies. The EPA is evaluating barriers to introducing new environmental monitoring technologies and considering a shift to performance-based monitoring methods. There is no set deadline for completing this review, and the Agency lacks a mechanism for effective communication with industry on monitoring methods and regulations. The market for environmental monitoring products and services is crucial for enhancing international competitiveness and export performance. The Agency should support the development of monitoring methods that improve environmental quality and the competitiveness of US firms. Current requirements for prescriptive analytical methods hinder the introduction of new technologies that may be more cost-effective and efficient. The Act aims to spur the development of new environmental monitoring technologies, shift to performance-based monitoring methods, establish deadlines for implementation, promote stakeholder participation, and set a timeline for completion by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Act aims to establish a deadline for the Agency to develop a plan for performance-based monitoring methods. The Act aims to establish a deadline for the Agency to develop a plan for performance-based monitoring methods. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms related to environmental monitoring methods, including Agency, Administrator, Industry, and performance-based monitoring methods. The Act defines key terms related to environmental monitoring methods, without prescribing specific procedures or techniques. SEC. 3. THE PERFORMANCE-BASED MONITORING METHODS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Performance-Based Monitoring Methods Advisory Committee is established by the Administrator to advise on policies, assist in developing reports, ensure uniform data quality objectives, and create a process for accepting monitoring methods. The Performance-Based Monitoring Methods Advisory Committee, established by the Administrator, advises on policies, assists in developing reports, and recommends changes to stimulate the use of new monitoring technologies. The Performance-Based Monitoring Methods Advisory Committee consists of 12 members representing various interested parties, including the EPA, analytical instruments industry, environmental testing labs, state regulatory agencies, public interest groups, and technical societies. The committee provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator before initiating activities outlined in the Act, and is not subject to the duration restrictions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Performance-Based Monitoring Methods Advisory Committee meets regularly to provide recommendations to the Administrator. The Administrator will provide necessary staff to support the committee's work. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment, outlining a plan for a performance-based monitoring methods approval process. The report will align with the provisions of section 5 of the Act and will be delivered to the appropriate House and Senate committees. The Administrator will establish a performance-based monitoring methods approval process within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Approved analytical methods existing at that time will be accepted until deemed otherwise. The Act does not allow for favoritism of one technology over another or require approval of environmental technology. The Administrator will establish a performance-based monitoring methods approval process within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Approved methods will be deemed equivalent to existing EPA methods for compliance with environmental statutes and regulations. Compliance with data quality objectives is required for regulatory acceptance. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is limited to the amounts specified in subsection (b), with the Administrator authorized to appropriate necessary funds for its purposes."
