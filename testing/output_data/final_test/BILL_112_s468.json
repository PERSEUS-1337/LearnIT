    "content": "The \"Mining Jobs Protection Act\" is the short title of the Act. Permits for dredged or fill material are addressed in Section 2. Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to give the Administrator authority to prohibit the specification of disposal sites if it will have adverse effects on water supplies, shellfish beds, fishery areas, and wildlife. The Administrator has the authority to prohibit disposal sites if they will harm water supplies, shellfish beds, fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. The Administrator must notify the Secretary of any concerns within 30 days of receiving a proposed specification. The Administrator must notify the Secretary within 30 days of any concerns regarding disposal sites that may harm the environment. If the Administrator intends to disapprove a specification, they must provide a statement of disapproval within 60 days, including reasons for the decision. If the Administrator fails to act on a proposed specification, they will have no further authority. The Administrator's authority to disapprove or prohibit a specification terminates 60 days after receiving it from the Secretary. This authority cannot be used after the Secretary issues the specification. Before the date of enactment, the Administrator can reevaluate and reissue a disapproved specification or choose not to reissue it, as per the Mining Jobs Protection Act. The Administrator loses authority to disapprove a specification once issued by the Secretary. The Mining Jobs Protection Act states that once the Secretary elects a modified specification, the Administrator cannot disapprove it further. This decision is considered final agency action. This subsection applies to all pending or requested specifications issued under subsection (a) after the date of enactment. SEC. 3. REVIEW OF PERMITS. Section 404(q) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include agreements and higher review of permits before issuance. Section 404(q) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include higher review of permits. The Secretary or Administrator must consult with State agencies and obtain official consent for designating areas as aquatic resources of national importance. Failure to obtain consent may result in consequences. The Administrator or Federal agency must obtain State consent for permits under Section 404(q) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Failure to do so prohibits seeking higher review of the permit. Requests for higher review can only be made once per permit. This provision applies to permits submitted after January 1, 2010."
