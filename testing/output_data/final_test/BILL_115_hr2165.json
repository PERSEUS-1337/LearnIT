    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"TSA Misconduct Accountability Act of 2017\" and includes requirements for addressing employee misconduct. The \"TSA Misconduct Accountability Act of 2017\" amends Subchapter II of chapter 449 of title 49, United States Code, by adding a new section that requires the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to revise the employee code of conduct policy within 90 days. This revision includes a process for disciplining employees who have received a certain number of disciplinary actions and guidance on reporting misconduct. The \"TSA Misconduct Accountability Act of 2017\" requires the TSA Administrator to revise the employee code of conduct policy, address employee misconduct, submit the policy for review, and appoint a senior official to oversee the policy. The TSA Administrator must implement discipline procedures for employee misconduct, identify causes through data analysis, and introduce human capital initiatives in consultation with the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security. The TSA Administrator must address employee misconduct by modifying performance plans, notifying applicants of disqualifying offenses, and providing training for supervisors. The Chief Human Capital Officer must review the TSA employee code of conduct policy within 60 days. The Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security reviews the TSA employee code of conduct policy and penalties to ensure alignment with departmental policies. Monitoring of the TSA employee code of conduct implementation will be conducted through fiscal year 2020. Definitions in this section include consequences for employee misconduct, including removal from Federal service. The TSA employee code of conduct policy defines misconduct as a failure to comply with rules or laws within the employee's duties. No new funding is authorized for this section, and it will be carried out using existing funds. A clerical amendment is made to the analysis of title 49, inserting a new item after section 44946. Requirements for addressing employee misconduct are outlined in section 44947."
