    "title": "SB 1465",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The 2024 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act, also known as the Act, defines key terms such as \"Endorsing municipality,\" \"Games,\" \"Games support contract,\" \"Joinder agreement,\" and \"OCOG.\" The Act pertains to the selection of Los Angeles as the site for the games and outlines the roles and responsibilities of the Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG). The Act aims to provide assurances to a site selection organization for selecting a city to host the games. It includes definitions for key terms and outlines the financial obligation of the state not exceeding $250 million. Hosting the games in California is expected to generate billions of dollars for the state\u2019s economy. The OCOG has developed a self-sufficient bid and plan for financing the games based on realistic revenue scenarios. The endorsing municipality plans to host sustainable and environmentally responsible games, with a focus on youth programs and a unique cultural program. The endorsing municipality's bid for hosting the games in California involves a diverse group of stakeholders. They anticipate generating net revenue exceeding expenses for legacy programs post-games. The Governor may execute games support contracts on behalf of the state, accepting financial liability up to $250 million to provide security for amounts owed by the OCOG and any financial deficit accruing from hosting the games. Liabilities exceeding $250 million are the responsibility of other parties. The Governor may execute games support contracts on behalf of the state, accepting financial liability up to $250 million. The games support contracts may include provisions required by the Governor. A special fund called the \u201cOlympic Games Trust Fund\u201d is established in the State Treasury. The state can fund the trust fund as it deems appropriate, with the funding mechanism determined around the time of selecting the host city. The funds in the Olympic Games Trust Fund can only be used to fulfill state obligations for security under a games support contract. The Controller can provide cashflow loans to the General Fund using the trust fund. No additional state funds will be deposited once the account has enough balance for security. The Olympic Games Trust Fund will be maintained if the endorsing municipality is chosen as the host city, until state security obligations are met. If not selected, the fund will be terminated, and all funds will revert to the General Fund. The Olympic Games Trust Fund established in Section 5 will be used for state security under a games support contract, with a maximum liability of $250,000,000. The state's obligations for the Olympic Games Trust Fund are solely payable from the fund, without using the state's credit or taxing power. The state will only step in as a last resort for security expenses after the OCOG and endorsing municipality have exhausted their funds. The OCOG must exhaust all efforts to seek payment from third parties owing money. The state must be listed as an additional insured on insurance policies. The OCOG must not engage in any conduct that reflects unfavorably on the state or the games."
