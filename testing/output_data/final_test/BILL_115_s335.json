    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Land Freedom Act of 2017\" and includes findings. Congress finds that as of the date of enactment of the \"Federal Land Freedom Act of 2017,\" 113,000,000 acres of onshore Federal land are open for oil and natural gas development, while approximately 166,000,000 acres are off-limits. Despite the recent oil and gas boom, the number of leased Federal land for exploration has decreased by 24% since 2008. In 2013, only 36,000,000 acres were leased, compared to 131,000,000 acres in 1984, which harms economic growth and Federal revenues. In 2013, it took 197 days to process applications for permits to drill on Federal land, while States have sufficient regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"available Federal land\" refers to Federal land within a State that is not held by the US for a federally recognized Indian tribe, National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, or congressionally designated wilderness area. \"State\" includes a State and the District of Columbia. \"State leasing, permitting, and regulatory program\" refers to a program established under State law. A State leasing, permitting, and regulatory program regulates energy exploration and development on State land. State control of energy development and production on federal land is mandated by SEC. 4. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory programs allow states to transfer responsibility for energy development from the Federal Government. Upon declaration, states can lease, permit, and regulate oil, natural gas, and other energy forms on federal land within the state. State leasing, permitting, and regulatory programs allow states to transfer responsibility for energy development from the Federal Government without being subject to certain federal regulations such as the Administrative Procedure Act, Endangered Species Act, and National Environmental Policy Act. Any lease or permit issued by a State under section 4 must include provisions for collecting royalties equal to what would have been collected by the Federal Government. Revenues collected by a State must be deposited in the same Federal account. States can also charge processing fees for lease or permit applications."
