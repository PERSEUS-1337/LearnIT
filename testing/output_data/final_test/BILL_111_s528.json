    "content": "The \"Caging Prohibition Act of 2009\" prohibits voter caging. The \"Voter Caging Document\" is defined as any nonforwardable document sent to an individual at their registered address for voting in a Federal election, which is returned as undelivered or contains instructions to return but is not returned. The term \"voter caging list\" refers to a list of individuals compiled from voter caging documents. The term \"unverified list match\" involves matching registered voters with individuals ineligible to vote, unless proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This subparagraph establishes that identities must match for voter registration. Election officials are prohibited from preventing individuals from registering or voting in any election. Election officials are prohibited from challenging voter eligibility based on voter caging documents, unverified list matches, foreclosure status, or change of residence information, except when obtained in accordance with the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. Officials, other than State or local election officials, cannot challenge an individual's eligibility to vote in a Federal election without specific reasons and evidence, under penalty of perjury. Challenges based on certain evidence are prohibited. Individuals cannot challenge someone's eligibility to vote in a Federal election without valid evidence, such as voter caging documents, unverified list matches, foreclosure status, or change of residence information obtained in compliance with the National Voter Registration Act. Penalties apply for knowingly making baseless challenges. A State or local election official who knowingly challenges voter eligibility with the intent to disqualify individuals may be fined up to $50,000 per violation. This does not override the protections of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993."
