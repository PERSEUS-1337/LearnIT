    "content": "Since the anthrax mailings of 2001, policymakers have been implementing programs to decrease the vulnerability of the United States to terrorist use of biological weapons. This report discusses high-threat biological agents, focusing on the CDC definition for Category A pathogens, their treatment and detection, current policies, and possible future approaches to reducing their threat. Policy approaches for reducing vulnerability to biological terrorism involve addressing biological agents as a group and focusing on specific agents perceived as posing the greatest threat. The report discusses high-threat biological agents, treatments for exposed victims vary depending on the pathogen, experience in treatment is limited due to rarity of cases. Different biological agents are identified as high threat based on priorities, with CDC categorizing and ranking them. Category A diseases, including anthrax, plague, smallpox, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers, are considered the highest threat by the CDC due to their ease of dissemination, high mortality rates, potential for major public health impact, and need for special public health preparedness. Anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis, forms spores in response to environmental stresses, remaining viable for decades. Anthrax spores are hardy and can remain viable for decades in soil. Anthrax primarily infects animals through ingestion of spores. It is not contagious between people. The forms of anthrax infection are cutaneous, intestinal, and inhalation, depending on how the spores are contacted. Symptoms appear 48 to 72 hours after exposure. The symptoms of anthrax infection vary depending on the form of the disease. Cutaneous anthrax presents as a painless black ulcer, while intestinal anthrax causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Inhalation anthrax starts with cold-like symptoms and progresses to difficulty breathing. Early treatment is crucial for a better recovery rate, with cutaneous infection having a lower fatality rate compared to intestinal anthrax. Intestinal anthrax has a higher mortality rate, ranging from 25% to 75% depending on treatment effectiveness. Untreated inhalation anthrax is almost always fatal, but early treatment can significantly reduce the fatality rate. Different antibiotics are used to treat all forms of anthrax, with some strains being less sensitive to treatment. Prophylaxis through vaccination and post-exposure antibiotics can protect against anthrax. The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with other federal agencies, is working on developing a civilian anthrax vaccine policy due to a shortage of the FDA-licensed anthrax vaccine. The Department of Defense has a vaccination policy for troops potentially exposed to anthrax, as seen after the 2001 anthrax mailings. Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis bacteria, does not form spores and resides in host creatures. Plague bacteria do not form spores and are naturally found in host creatures like rodents. They travel within animal populations through insect vectors, causing bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. Bubonic plague, known as the Black Death, spreads through infected insect bites, while pneumonic plague can be person-to-person contagious. The bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague are different forms of the disease. Symptoms include swollen lymph glands, fever, weakness, and internal bleeding. The fatality rates vary, with septicemic plague having a higher mortality rate. The plague bacteria are naturally found in rodents and spread through insect vectors. The fatality rates for different forms of plague vary, with septicemic plague having the highest mortality rate. Effective treatment must begin within 18 hours to increase survival chances. Antibiotic therapy is used for all forms of plague, but natural antibiotic resistance exists. A plague vaccine was approved for human use but discontinued in 1998 due to manufacturing issues and ineffectiveness against pneumonic plague. Smallpox is caused by the variola virus, which has been eradicated naturally. The disease is highly contagious, with rash and pustules forming over a three-week period. Survivors are often scarred, and there are rare variants like flatpox and hemorrhagic smallpox. The fatality rate for smallpox is around 30%. Smallpox has a fatality rate of approximately 30%, with variants like flatpox and hemorrhagic smallpox having a near 100% fatality rate. There is no specific treatment for smallpox, but vaccination after exposure can reduce the severity of the disease. The vaccine is currently only available to select first responders and military members. For more information on smallpox disease and vaccination, refer to CRS Report RS21288 and CRS Report RL31694. Tularemia is caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which can survive for weeks in the environment. Tularemia bacteria, like plague, can be transmitted between animals via biting insects. It is very infectious, requiring only a few bacteria to cause disease. Different forms of exposure lead to various symptoms such as swollen lymph glands, sore throat, skin lesions, or pneumonia-like symptoms. The recovery rate for tularemia is relatively high. Tularemia has an incubation period of 3 to 5 days after exposure. The fatality rate for untreated tularemia is 60%, but with proper treatment, it can be reduced to 2%. Antibiotic therapy is used to treat tularemia, but some strains of F. tularensis have been engineered to be antibiotic resistant. FDA-approved antibiotics are available for treatment, and IND vaccines are being tested. Viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola and Marburg are caused by filovirus and arenavirus family viruses found in natural animal reservoirs. Viral hemorrhagic fevers are rare and believed to originate from natural animal reservoirs. These viruses are transmitted through contaminated body fluids, leading to symptoms like fever, muscle aches, and exhaustion. Severe cases can involve internal bleeding, with organ failure being the common cause of death. Recovery rates vary from 30% to 90%, with higher rates in developed countries due to advanced medical treatment. Viral hemorrhagic fevers have no established treatments besides supportive care. Ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, has shown efficacy against Lassa fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Vaccines are being developed for some viral hemorrhagic fevers, but access is limited. Protection against biological agents can be achieved through physical or medical means. Protective masks and clothing are essential for personal physical protection against biological agents. Masks filter inhaled air to remove particles, while garments minimize self-contamination. Gloves, overgarments, and face shields provide necessary protection from contagious pathogens, especially in the treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers. Isolation and barrier methods are also used to prevent the spread of disease. In the treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers, medical professionals use isolation and barrier methods for protection. Pre-exposure vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics are employed for populations at risk or following known exposure to pathogens like anthrax. Limited availability of vaccines for high-threat biological agents poses challenges for public distribution. Due to national security needs, anthrax vaccine is used to inoculate military personnel, while smallpox vaccine supply has improved for potential mass vaccination. Some high-threat biological agents have experimental vaccines available for emergency use. Prophylactic antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses, so they are recommended for potential exposure to bacteria. The detection of pathogens in covert releases can be challenging, requiring laboratory work-up to identify them. Laboratory-based techniques are sensitive but time-consuming, taking several hours to definitively identify specific pathogens. The BioWatch initiative aims to detect biological attacks using early warning sensors placed nationwide. These sensors collect particles from the atmosphere, which are then analyzed in laboratories for specific pathogens. Results could be available in as little as 12 hours. Research and development of monitoring technology is ongoing, with laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network involved in detecting pathogens. Commercial systems, like air monitors in Honolulu and a postal indoor system, are being utilized for pathogen detection. Screening devices using antibody tests or genetic tests are commonly used for field detection of biological agents. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used for rapid diagnostic testing of biological agents. Antibody tests are agent-specific, requiring different tests for different agents. PCR screens detect genetic markers to confirm the presence of a known pathogen. Field devices are not definitive for absence of an agent but confirm significant quantities. Further development of field devices is ongoing, with samples sent to labs for more sensitive tests to identify pathogens. The public health laboratory system faces a heavy burden in confirming samples that test negative through screening tests. Monitoring for pathogen release has become crucial, with upgraded networks connecting hospitals and labs to track disease outbreaks. Early detection of covert pathogen release by analyzing symptoms in hospital patients can help in identifying the time and location of release. Some cities have expanded programs to monitor purchases related to public health, such as tracking pharmaceutical and medicinal sales for early disease outbreak detection. The effectiveness of biological agents as weapons of mass destruction is debated due to their historical lack of use in causing mass casualties and inability to destroy physical infrastructure. The technical feasibility of terrorist groups disseminating biological agents is also questioned. The technical feasibility of terrorist groups using biological agents as weapons is debated. While some believe it may be beyond their capabilities, others argue that it could be easily done. Biological agents are not readily available for purchase or theft in large quantities, but their self-replicating nature could ease the difficulties of acquiring and manufacturing them. Even small amounts of pathogens can cause mass casualties, with estimates suggesting that 100lbs of anthrax spores could cause 150,000 casualties if efficiently disseminated in a metropolitan area. Terrorist groups have shown interest in biological weapons. Terrorist groups have shown interest in biological weapons, with few successful examples of their use. The Rajneeshee cult contaminated salad bars with salmonella in 1984, causing illness to several hundred people. The Aum Shinrikyo cult attempted to disseminate Bacillus anthracis in 1995 but used an avirulent strain, resulting in no casualties. It is unclear if terrorist groups would choose biological weapons due to conflicting views on their compatibility with political goals. Some argue that terrorist groups may use biological agents as weapons of terror to instill panic, as they require little infrastructure and can be effective even with limited supplies. The use of biological weapons may cause few casualties but create fear due to their frightening aspects. The anthrax letters of 2001 raised concerns about the potential for biological attacks, highlighting the vulnerability of the United States. Despite the fear of small-scale biological weapon use, some argue that terrorist groups are more likely to use conventional weapons due to the significant resources required for developing pathogens. The anthrax letters of 2001 were sent through the U.S. Postal Service to two U.S. Senators and two news outlets, contaminating postal equipment and infecting postal workers with inhalation anthrax. Questions remain unanswered about the mailer's identity and motivations, as well as the origin of the anthrax spores. Current federal policy includes nation-state level controls, increased domestic regulation, and accelerated research on medicines, vaccines, and detectors. Export policies are maintained for selected pathogens and biological dual-use equipment. Export controls are in place to prevent the acquisition and proliferation of biological weapons, primarily through multilateral agreements like the Australia Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act regulate the use, possession, and transfer of high-threat biological agents. Only individuals with a legitimate need are allowed to possess or use biological agents on the Select Agent list. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act regulate the use, possession, and transfer of high-threat biological agents. University researchers experimenting on Select Agent pathogens must pass an FBI background check. Individuals from countries declared as sponsors of terrorism are restricted from accessing these pathogens. The FDA has adjusted rules for drug testing, allowing approval based on animal testing results in cases where human testing is unethical. Some argue that skipping human clinical trials could expedite new bioterror treatments and attract more private sector research funding. The federal government invests in bioterror defense research and development, with a focus on new treatments, vaccines, detector technology, decontamination, and pathogen properties. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services play active roles in this area, funding research into biodefensive measures, countermeasures against biological weapons, and basic science like pathogen genetics. The National Institutes of Health administers most of the biomedical research funding. The Department of Health and Human Services funds biomedical research, while DARPA and the Department of Defense fund biological warfare defense programs. The Department of Homeland Security's Directorate of Science and Technology works on biological countermeasures. Research on high-threat pathogens is conducted at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Improving detector accuracy and sensitivity for rapid pathogen detection is a key focus. The development of sensitive, rapid detection systems for identifying appropriate treatment for victims is a key focus. New detectors based on different detection methods are being investigated for their capabilities. The military is working on the Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS) for fast, portable detection of biological agents. Research efforts are also focused on miniaturizing detector systems for easier portability. The National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense fund programs for handheld instruments to detect biological pathogens. Research on aerosol release diffusion, computer modeling, and decontamination is conducted to improve incident response and consequence management. After the anthrax mailings, the Hart Senate Office Building underwent extensive decontamination costing $42 million. Cleanup of other contaminated facilities is expected to exceed $150 million. Research is ongoing to develop more cost-effective decontamination methods for biological agents. Concerns have been raised about the potential national security threats posed by certain federally funded research publications in molecular biology. Some suggest federally funded research results should be reviewed for security implications before publication, while others argue it could hinder scientific progress. The effectiveness of self-regulatory measures by publishers is debated, with some proposing federal agency review. Significant investment has been made in the public health system to prepare for a bioterror event, including funding for response plans, hospital preparedness, and the expansion of the National Strategic Stockpile. Despite some critics, Secretary of Health and Human Services Thompson has stated that the country is well-prepared to respond to possible bioterrorism. The country is well-prepared to respond to possible bioterrorism attacks with federal response teams like the DOD's Chemical/Biological Incident Response Force (CBIRF) that can be deployed domestically or internationally at short notice. The FBI, U.S. Army, and National Disaster Medical System have specialized units for responding to biological and chemical threats. They provide analysis, identification, decontamination, and removal of biological hazards in various situations, including national events. Disaster Medical Assistance Teams, National Medical Response Teams, and Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams are available for deployment in national emergencies. The federal government is developing biological countermeasures, with the Department of Health and Human Services leading research and the Department of Homeland Security setting priorities. In FY2004, $266 million has been allocated for DHS's Science and Technology Directorate's biological countermeasures programs. The Department of Homeland Security will assist in setting priorities for HHS research, and the new Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) will prioritize research it funds. Research into new antiviral and antibiotic compounds for biological agents may have additional health benefits. Development of new vaccines for high-threat pathogens is a focus of congressional efforts due to the shortage of licensed vaccines. Development of new vaccines for high-threat pathogens has been a focus of congressional interest. The lack of a civilian market for biological weapon vaccines has hindered private sector investment. Some suggest the federal government should provide research incentives and a guaranteed market for these vaccines, with mechanisms like expedited drug approval and tax incentives being proposed. The FDA has already implemented expedited drug approval for biodefense drugs. President George W. Bush announced Project BioShield in 2003, which allows for expedited acquisition of biological countermeasures up to 5 years before licensing. The BioWatch prototype detector raises questions about its use for monitoring covert biological agent releases, providing early notification of potential danger. Biological agents can provide early notification of danger, aiding in early treatment of diseases. A city-wide network of sampling devices can detect pathogen releases and help identify the source. BioWatch detectors, coupled with EPA air quality monitors, may not provide adequate sampling of populated areas. The effectiveness of BioWatch detectors in identifying small releases or indoor release of biological agents is not established, and placement may provide a false sense of security. The cost of these detectors is reported at $1 million per year. Each metropolitan area chosen will have 10 to 12 distinct detectors built into different air quality monitors. The BioWatch program aims to provide detection for 80% of the American population by geographic distribution. There is a need for development of easily portable biological detection apparatus to detect unexpected pathogens that may elude current equipment. Policymakers may direct funding towards developing a broad assortment of inexpensive testing equipment or expanding the range of pathogens a device can detect. The cost of testing per incident may increase with more pathogen-specific detectors available, but decrease as more detectors are manufactured. Policymakers may need to address current methods of detecting bioterror events, as tracking through hospital admissions and physician reports may detect covert releases, but with a time delay for contagious pathogens like pneumonic plague or smallpox. Public health workers are determining the epicenter of a pathogen release, with debates on vaccination methods for smallpox. Some advocate for early detection through sensors, while others believe the current model is effective in limiting casualties. Increases in public health infrastructure have improved response capabilities. The federal government is debating funding for first responders and the standardization of their equipment for potential bioterror attacks. Some first responder teams feel prepared, while others lack necessary equipment. The federal government is debating funding for first responders and the standardization of their equipment for potential bioterror attacks. Some first responders feel the government has not provided enough oversight on equipment purchases, advocating for community choice in equipment selection. The Department of Homeland Security is developing a Standards Program to guide first responder equipment purchases. The adequacy of current first responder equipment, funding for protective gear, federal guidance to state and local authorities, and the need for oversight or legislation to equip first responders are being debated. Concerns exist about the efficiency of federal response teams and the structure of regional teams. Some advocate for parallel civilian and military response teams. Some advocate for parallel civilian and military response teams in case military teams are unavailable to civilians during wartime. Various reports provide information on biological weapons, smallpox, vaccine stockpiles, vaccination policies, first responder initiatives, emergency management funding, and public health security. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports related to public health security, bioterrorism preparedness, food safety issues, and terrorist motivations for chemical and biological weapons use."
