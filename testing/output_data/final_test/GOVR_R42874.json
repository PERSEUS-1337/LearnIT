    "content": "U.S.-Ghanaian relations are strong, highlighted by visits from Presidents Obama and Bush. Ghana is viewed as a key U.S. partner in West Africa and a success story with a growing economy and robust democracy. Despite facing poverty and development challenges, Ghana is seen as a model for achieving desired outcomes in the region. Ghana has received significant U.S. support through various programs and initiatives, including the MCC Compact, GCC, FtF, and GHI. It hosts USAID and DEA regional offices, as well as the West Africa Trade Hub. The country's oil reserves and energy production are of interest to the U.S. and may boost national income. Ghana's stability and commitment to constitutional governance have made it a key U.S. partner in the region, with successful transfers of state power following national elections. This has aligned with U.S. efforts to support regional solutions for global and U.S. energy security. Ghana has mediated armed civil conflicts in West Africa, hosted refugees, and continues to host refugees from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Some refugees have been detained or deported for allegedly destabilizing the government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire or committing crimes. Ghana is investigating attacks allegedly carried out from its territory in efforts to destabilize the government of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Critics argue that Ghana has not taken sufficient action to counter such acts. Ghana contributes troops to international peacekeeping operations and receives U.S. training and assistance for deployments. The country also faces threats from illicit narcotics trafficking, particularly cocaine being transported from South America to Europe via West Africa. U.S.-Ghanaian cooperation in countering drug trafficking is increasing. Despite challenges, Ghana has made significant progress in socio-economic development. In FY2013, Ghana exceeded 18 out of 20 Millennium Challenge Corporation policy performance criteria, including Economic Freedom, Investing in People, and Ruling Justly. It completed a $547 million MCC compact in 2012 and is likely to receive a second compact to support economic growth through increased access to credit, land tenure, and power. Ghana, a country that exceeded 18 out of 20 MCC policy performance criteria in FY2013, completed a $547 million MCC compact in 2012. It is now poised to receive a second compact focusing on economic growth through improved access to credit, land tenure, and power. This initiative aligns with national development priorities and aims to address economic constraints hindering growth in the power sector. Ghana's positive MCC scores, compact completion record, and potential synergies with other U.S. assistance programs have positioned it as a key partner for development efforts. Additionally, recent increases in U.S.-Ghanaian engagement, including private sector business deals, highlight the country's growing importance in regional development. President John Atta Mills of Ghana passed away on July 24, 2012, due to natural causes. He was elected in 2008, succeeding former President John Kufuor. Mills' policies focused on good governance, anti-corruption efforts, security force capacity building, economic growth, and investment, particularly through business-friendly reforms to spur growth. President John Dramani Mahama succeeded President John Atta Mills in Ghana after his passing in July 2012. Mahama focused on increasing access to credit, business-friendly reforms, boosting exports, investing in health, education, poverty reduction, and infrastructure development. Despite legal challenges, Mahama was elected president in December 2012 and inaugurated in January 2013. During the December 7, 2012, elections in Ghana, technical challenges with the biometric voter identification system caused delays in voting. Despite this, over 11.25 million out of 14.03 million voters cast their ballots. The presidential race was closely contested between Mahama of the NDC and Akufo-Addo of the NPP, resulting in Mahama's election as president with nearly 50.8% of the vote. The 2012 election in Ghana resulted in Mahama's election as president with nearly 50.8% of votes. Akufo-Addo garnered over 47.7% of votes. Despite some technical problems, the election process was deemed transparent and credible. NPP supporters protested the results and challenged the legitimacy of the vote in court. The NPP challenged the legitimacy of the 2012 election results in court, alleging violations and irregularities that affected the outcome. They filed a suit naming President Mahama and the Electoral Commission as respondents, claiming that 1.34 million irregular votes should be annulled. The NPP argued that without these votes, Mahama would have garnered 4.66 million votes (48.26%), while Akufo-Addo had won 4.85 million. In the 2012 election, Akufo-Addo won with 4.85 million votes (50.28%) against Mahama's 4.66 million votes (48.26%). The NPP also contested legislative seats, winning 123 seats compared to NDC's 148 seats. Despite winning fewer seats, the NPP had a larger popular parliamentary vote. In early November 2012, the NDC government faced backlash for authorizing a backdated pay raise for officials, including President Mahama. The move was criticized for lack of transparency and led to public outrage. Additionally, a survey showed growing dissatisfaction with economic trends, potentially impacting NDC's prospects in the upcoming election. The 2012 election in Ghana was crucial due to control over oil revenues and the economy. A televised debate between Mahama and Akufo-Addo highlighted key issues like corruption, economic growth, job creation, education, and healthcare. The winner was expected to have an advantage in the 2016 election. After the 2012 election in Ghana, Mahama worked to unify the NDC and address corruption scandals. He set out a policy plan based on Mills's priorities, including tighter regulation of state-private business transactions to prevent criticism. Internal NDC divisions were a key issue. Internal NDC divisions arose from personalized criticism of Mills by Rawlings, who initially endorsed Mahama for party unity but later supported his wife's candidacy with the National Democratic Party. Agyeman-Rawlings's bid was rejected, leading her to support the NPP, causing Rawlings to distance himself from the NDC. Ghana's economy has shown steady growth in recent years, with GDP increasing from $32 billion in 2010 to $39 billion in 2011. Export earnings have also risen, reaching $13 billion in 2011. The economy experienced a significant growth rate of 14.4% in 2011, driven by investments in the oil sector. Analysts believe that Rawlings's influence over Ghanaian politics has decreased, as seen in Agyeman-Rawlings's failed presidential bids and the NDC's victory despite Rawlings's absence from the campaign. The Ghanaian economy has shown growth, with GDP increasing from $32 billion in 2010 to $39 billion in 2011. The International Monetary Fund projected a decline to 7.3% in 2012 and 7.6% in 2013. Factors contributing to this decline include slowing new investment in the oil sector, lower initial oil output, and a temporary dip in cocoa prices. Despite diversification, agriculture remains a cornerstone of the economy, employing over half of workers and contributing about 27% of annual GDP. The Ghanaian economy has diversified with agriculture contributing about 27% of GDP, services 47%, and industry, notably gold mining, 25%. The government supports small-scale sectors and the Ghana Stock Exchange plans to establish a separate exchange for small firms. Ghana has received foreign debt relief and cooperates closely with international financial institutions. The World Bank's Doing Business report consistently rates Ghana positively. Ghana has a positive rating in reports, with better access to public goods and services than other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Poverty rates are decreasing, with average per capita income growing significantly. Access to cell phones is high, and most social indicators have improved. Despite periodic electricity shortages, efforts to improve electricity supply are ongoing, including the development of natural gas reserves for electricity generation and industrial use. Despite positive reports on Ghana's access to public goods and services and decreasing poverty rates, technical problems have hindered major industrial developments. The country faces challenges with piping gas from offshore and constructing a new gas processing plant. Additionally, an idled Chevron-operated pipeline has disrupted gas supply from Nigeria. Despite economic success, poverty remains widespread, especially in rural areas, and income distribution is unequal. A recent survey revealed that only slightly more than half of Ghanaians have access to essential services like piped water, tarred roads, sewage systems, and health clinics. Furthermore, 63% of respondents rated national economic conditions as \"bad\" or \"very bad.\" The recent survey showed that 63% of Ghanaians rated national economic conditions as \"bad\" or \"very bad,\" with a growing dissatisfaction over the past decade. Rising import demand, driven by the oil sector, led to a devaluation of the national currency in 2012, causing a rise in cocoa smuggling into C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. This was a reversal of the previous trend where Ivoirian cocoa was smuggled into Ghana. The start of oil production in 2010 from offshore fields has also impacted the economy. The recent discovery of offshore oil fields in Ghana has boosted export and state revenue projections. Large-scale oil and gas production is seen as a game-changer for Ghana's economic future, with the Jubilee field alone projected to place the country among the world's top 50 oil-producing nations. Ghana's total oil and gas reserves are difficult to estimate, but it is believed to have 660 million barrels of proven reserves. New discoveries and estimates continue to be made, indicating the high potential for increased production and additional reserves. Ghana's oil reserves are estimated to contain 278 MMBO, but could be as high as 1,500 MMBO. Total national reserves range between 3-4.5 billion barrels, with potential for even larger reserves. The Jubilee field, operated by Tullow Oil, produces around 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Ghana also has significant natural gas reserves, with 22.65 billion cubic meters of proven reserves. Ghana's oil production from the Jubilee field was projected to reach 120,000 barrels per day, with Phase 2 aiming for 240,000 barrels per day and potentially 500,000 barrels per day. However, initial production fell below projections due to technical issues. The start of oil production led to increased public spending and borrowing based on future oil earnings, causing external debt to rise significantly. Critics warn of financial over-commitments and excessive reliance on oil revenues, with debt estimated to reach $18.5 billion by 2018. Ghana's positive economic growth and diversification may allow it to borrow on international bond markets despite its reliance on oil revenues. Concerns exist about inadequate environmental oversight and oil spill response capacities. The government enacted a Petroleum Revenue Management Act in 2011 but has yet to pass a proposed Petroleum Exploration and Production Act. Civil society groups are monitoring Ghana's actions as an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative signatory to promote governance accountability in resource-rich countries. Ghana became the second African EITI signatory in 2009 and was judged EITI Compliant at the time. Energy sector governance, particularly transparency, accountability, and efficacy in public oil use, remains a focus. The World Bank provides technical assistance to address environmental challenges and promote transparency in Ghana's extractive industry. Public sector bribery is common, with high-profile corruption cases involving top officials. Despite some progress, corruption is still a concern, with 60% of Ghanaians believing it has worsened in the past three years. About 55% view the government's anti-corruption efforts as effective. President Mills pledged to reduce corruption to the barest minimum and make the penalty for corruption so high that it will become something to avoid at all cost. His tactics included improving anti-corruption government agencies, enforcing Ghana's Whistleblower's Act, and prosecuting official corruption. The government planned a massive education campaign against corruption involving state and civil society anti-corruption agencies. President Mahama has pledged to continue Mills's policies, including transparency issues. Ghana also faces challenges with illicit drug trafficking. Ghana faces challenges with illicit drug trafficking, including a rise in cocaine and heroin shipments from South America and southwest Asia. Methods of transportation include small aircraft, freighters, and containerized ship freight. There is also a growing methamphetamine production and export trade. Ghana serves as a departure point for drug couriers, known as mules. Ghana serves as a departure point for drug couriers, known as mules, who transport drugs on commercial flights. There have been arrests of Ghanaians in other countries for drug trafficking, and cases of corruption involving government officials. Gangs trafficking South American cocaine have established distribution networks in Ghana, run by Nigerian and Ghanaian criminals. Ghana's interest in attracting investment provides cover for foreign drug barons to enter the country. Investment in Ghana provides cover for foreign drug barons to enter the country under the guise of legitimate business. South American traffickers limit their personal involvement by relying on local partners, avoiding arrest. Ghana's counternarcotics cooperation with the international community, including the United States, is hindered by corruption, lack of resources, and porous borders. Law enforcement struggles to prosecute drug barons due to lack of expertise, overbooked attorneys, and witness non-appearance in court. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) faces challenges with interagency coordination in Ghana, but has made progress with extradition cases and law enforcement operations. A Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) was established in Ghana by the DEA in FY2010, composed of specialized counternarcotics investigators and police. The DEA country office in Accra coordinates drug-related law enforcement activities and liaisons in West African countries. The Department of Defense (DoD) also contributes to counternarcotics efforts. The DEA country office in Accra coordinates counternarcotics activities in Ghana, with support from the Department of Defense. Ghana is classified as a \"Tier 2\" country for trafficking in persons, with efforts to combat forced labor and sex trafficking. Ghana serves as a source, transit, and destination for trafficking victims. Ghana is classified as a \"Tier 2\" country for trafficking in persons, with efforts to combat forced labor and sex trafficking. Ghanaian nationals, notably children, are the majority of trafficking victims within the country, with transnational operations also victimizing foreign migrants. U.S.-Ghanaian relations are close, with a small population of Americans settled in Ghana. The Obama Administration supports Ghana's efforts to sustain middle-income status and achieve development goals by 2015. The United States sponsors various exchange visits and educational programs for Ghanaian officials and organizations. A Peace Corps program funded at $3.8 million in FY2012 supports work in information technology, education, business development, health, and food security. The Administration has requested $179.3 million in assistance for FY2013, with a focus on education, agricultural development, and food security. The United States provides funding for various programs in Ghana, including agricultural development and health-related capacity building. Ghana is a significant buyer of U.S. goods, with bilateral trade growing exponentially over the last decade. Total bilateral trade increased from $309 million in 2002 to $1.97 billion in 2011, with U.S. exports to Ghana rising from $634 million in 2009 to $1.2 billion in 2011. This growth is attributed to inputs for the oil sector. U.S. imports from Ghana increased from $135 million in 2009 to $779 million in 2011, resulting in a large trade surplus for the United States. Ghana is eligible for trade benefits under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), but exports under AGOA have declined sharply. AGOA exports were mainly processed fuel products and textiles. Ghana's exports under AGOA have declined sharply despite rising exports to the United States. Factors contributing to this trend include Ghana's lack of supply capacity, financial resources, and a national strategy on AGOA. U.S. firms are key investors in Ghana, with foreign direct investment totaling $2.3 billion in 2011, mainly in the oil sector and mining. Corruption can negatively impact trade and investment in the country. Foreign investors can operate easily in Ghana despite corruption affecting trade and investment. Accra and other cities offer advanced cell phone and Internet access. Doing business is straightforward with legal protections against nationalization or expropriation. Legal processes can be slow, but alternative dispute resolution is available through the Commercial Conciliation Center. U.S. trade capacity-building assistance in Ghana is significant. U.S. trade capacity-building assistance in Ghana, facilitated through activities under AGOA, is diverse and aims to increase exports from the region. The USAID West Africa Trade Hub focuses on promoting exports of various products like apparel, cashew, fish, and specialty foods. It educates buyers and sellers on exporting, connects importers and exporters, and addresses trade challenges. The USAID West Africa Trade Hub provides assistance to address regional trade challenges, including transportation and telecommunications issues. It supports initiatives like the ECOWAS free trade area to facilitate the movement of goods and persons within member states. Ghana receives bilateral trade capacity-building assistance in various categories, focusing on infrastructure development for trade-related industrial zones. The USAID West Africa Trade Hub provides assistance to address regional trade challenges, including transportation and telecommunications issues. Ghana receives bilateral trade capacity-building assistance in various categories, focusing on infrastructure development for trade-related industrial zones, trade facilitation, trade-related labor improvements, financial sector development, and environment-related capacity-building. U.S. TCB assistance to Ghana is primarily provided by multiple agencies, totaling $312.5 million from FY2007 through FY2011. Ghana received $312.5 million in bilateral trade capacity-building assistance from FY2007 through FY2011, with large variations in funding amounts each year. The close U.S.-Ghanaian relations are strengthening, with Ghana being selected as a Partnership for Growth country. Ghana's role as a new oil producer is increasing its strategic importance to the United States, leading to prospects for growing trade and investment relations. Congressional interest in Ghana may also increase due to these developments. Despite economic successes, Ghana faces deep socio-economic challenges and potential natural resource governance issues related to upcoming oil exports. Congressional engagement in development cooperation with Ghana is expected to continue."
