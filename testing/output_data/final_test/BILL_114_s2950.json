    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gold King Accountability and Compensation for Taxpayers\" or the \"Gold King ACT\". Congress finds that the Environmental Protection Agency caused the release of contaminated water from the Gold King Mine, takes full responsibility for the spill, and should be held to the same standards as the private sector in similar situations. The Environmental Protection Agency should be held accountable for the Gold King Mine spill and reimburse response activity expenses incurred after October 31, 2015. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"Gold King Mine spill\" describes the release of contaminated water from the Gold King Mine in Colorado on August 5, 2015. An \"independent contractor\" is defined as a person who had a contract with a Federal agency for goods or services related to the spill. The term \"injured person\" refers to individuals or entities that suffered injury from the Gold King Mine spill, including tribes, corporations, businesses, and governmental bodies. The term \"injury\" refers to any damage to property, personal injury, or death caused by a negligent act of a Federal officer, employee, contractor, or subcontractor. SEC. 4. GOLD KING MINE SPILL CLAIMS PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT. The Administrator is responsible for processing and paying claims related to injuries from the Gold King Mine spill under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Claims must be awarded or denied within 90 days of submission. The Administrator must award remaining payments within 60 days of enactment for partially awarded claims. Claims submitted at least 90 days prior to enactment must be awarded or denied within 60 days. Section 2680(a) of title 28, United States Code, does not apply to claims under this section. Allowable Damages for property loss resulting from the Gold King Mine spill may include costs for lost tribal or nontribal subsistence activities like hunting, fishing, and grazing on damaged land or water. Independent contractors are considered under claims brought in this section. Allowable Damages for property loss resulting from the Gold King Mine spill may include costs for reforestation or revegetation on tribal or non-Federal land, expenses to determine damages to agricultural land, water supply costs during compromised periods, and any other losses deemed appropriate by the Administrator. The claim for damages resulting from the Gold King Mine spill may include business losses such as damage to assets, lost income, overhead costs, and employee wages. It may also cover financial losses like insurance deductibles. The claim for damages resulting from the Gold King Mine spill may include business losses such as damage to assets, lost income, overhead costs, and employee wages, as well as uncompensated financial losses like insurance deductibles, lost wages, emergency staffing expenses, debris removal, and other cleanup costs. The Administrator may recoup payments for fraudulent or inaccurate claims within a 13-year period, and any compensation or award against the Government shall be sourced from a claim under this section. The government will pay claims under this section using unobligated balances from EPA appropriations. Congress intends no additional funds to be allocated for this Act. SEC. 5. GOLD KING MINE SPILL CLAIMS PURSUANT TO THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT. The Administrator will handle claims related to the Gold King Mine spill under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, including those that would typically be ineligible if the response action aligns with the national contingency plan. Claims must be awarded or denied within 90 days of submission. The Administrator will award or deny payment of claims related to the Gold King Mine spill within specific timeframes: partially paid claims must be awarded within 60 days of enactment, and previously filed claims must be addressed within 60 days if 90 days have passed since submission. SEC. 6. EFFECT OF ACT; REDUCTION IN PAYMENT. This Act does not diminish the Administrator's responsibilities under any other law. To prevent double payment for the same injury, compensation awarded under sections 4 and 5 will be deducted accordingly. SEC. 7. WATER QUALITY PROGRAM. In response to the Gold King Mine spill, the Administrator will develop a program for long-term water quality monitoring of the Animas River. This includes collecting water quality samples, providing public access to the data, assisting affected States and tribes with monitoring, and carrying out additional activities as needed."
