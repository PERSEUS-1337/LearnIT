The interstate market for child pornography, facilitated by the Internet, involves individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children and traffic in child pornography. This multimillion-dollar industry distributes child pornography with the expectation of receiving more in return.

The transfer of custody of children for child pornography production has a direct impact on interstate commerce as individuals involved may seek additional content from the interstate market.

The intrastate production of child pornography fuels the interstate market by providing a hidden and untraceable supply. Prohibiting intrastate activities can reduce both the supply and demand for child pornography. Federal control of intrastate incidents of child pornography production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, possession, and transfer of children is crucial for effectively controlling the interstate market.
