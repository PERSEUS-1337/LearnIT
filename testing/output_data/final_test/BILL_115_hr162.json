Congress finds that Hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti in 2016, causing over 1,000 deaths and affecting 2.1 million people. The storm damage was estimated at $1 billion, representing 11.4% of Haiti's GDP. This was the worst hurricane to hit Haiti in over 50 years, a country already struggling with poverty and illiteracy. Additionally, Haiti had previously experienced a devastating earthquake in 2010. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti caused massive devastation, destroying government buildings, hospitals, schools, and aid offices. An estimated three million people were directly affected, with many universities suffering significant damage. The State University of Haiti had 80 percent of its buildings destroyed, leading to the loss of lives of students and academics. Haiti's population faced challenges as 85 percent of those with a university degree left the island, highlighting the importance of a more educated population for long-term development. Establishment of scholarship program for certain Haitian students. The Secretary of State will establish a scholarship program for Haitian students affected by the 2010 earthquake or Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Eligible students must have been enrolled full-time in a Haitian university or US institution during these events and submit an application to the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs. The scholarship program for Haitian students affected by the 2010 earthquake or Hurricane Matthew will be established by the Secretary of State. The scholarship is awarded for one academic year and can be renewed for up to six academic years based on satisfactory academic achievement. Preference is given to students studying subjects important for Haiti's development. Haitian students affected by the 2010 earthquake or Hurricane Matthew can receive scholarships for their education.
