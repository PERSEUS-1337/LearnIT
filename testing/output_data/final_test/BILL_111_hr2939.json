    "content": "The Act titled \"Oncology Care Quality Improvement Act of 2009\" establishes the Oncology Care Quality Improvement Program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a pilot program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act to evaluate provider-led approaches to improve care quality and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. The approaches include adherence to evidence-based guidelines and providing patient education and care coordination services. The pilot program aims to improve care quality for Medicare cancer patients by offering educational sessions on cancer effects and treatments, continuous support, end-of-life planning, and counseling services to empower patients and families with information for making difficult treatment decisions. The OCQI program is designed to provide performance payments to oncology groups that implement specific approaches, with half of the program savings going to the groups and the other half retained by Medicare. Per capita expenditure targets will be established, considering the risk characteristics of the patients involved. The OCQI program will provide performance payments to oncology groups meeting performance goals and achieving program savings. The Secretary will limit participation to 75 groups over a 3-year period and prohibit patient selection by participating groups. Penalties may be imposed to prevent reductions in services. The Secretary may impose penalties on OCQI program participants who inappropriately reduce cancer therapies, based on evidence-based guidelines, by reducing performance payments. An advisory committee will collaborate with the Secretary on program development and expenditure targets. The advisory committee will advise the Secretary on selecting practices for the OCQI program and evaluate patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of services under the program. The OCQI program aims to improve care quality and reduce Medicare program expenditures by focusing on physicians' services, emergency room visits, hospital stays, drug costs, advanced imaging costs, and end-of-life care. Patient satisfaction and refining performance payments are key components of the program. If successful, payments for specific services paid under the program may become permanent covered services under Medicare."
