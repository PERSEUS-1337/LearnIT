    "content": "The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes programs to support individuals and institutions pursuing postsecondary education. The Act was last reauthorized in 2008, with funding extended through FY2015. The College Affordability Act in the 116th Congress aims to comprehensively reauthorize HEA programs and create new postsecondary education opportunities. H.R. 4674 is a comprehensive reauthorization of most Higher Education Act (HEA) programs, creating new postsecondary education programs and addressing certain higher education issues. It would authorize specific amounts of funds for programs with discretionary funding, leading to an estimated increase in mandatory spending of $161 billion over 5 years and $332 billion over 10 years. The increase in mandatory spending is mainly attributed to changes in federal student loans and Pell Grant programs. The enactment of H.R. 4674 would increase discretionary spending outlays by about $149 billion in the 5-year period from FY2020 to FY2024, largely due to extending authorized appropriations for existing programs. The bill aims to comprehensively reauthorize the Higher Education Act (HEA), amending various programs and activities supporting postsecondary education. The changes proposed in H.R. 4674 reflect key themes in the bill, focusing on providing a general understanding of its primary proposals. H.R. 4674 aims to expand financial aid availability for postsecondary students, implement borrower-focused student loan reforms, modify institutional accountability requirements, revise public accountability and transparency requirements, expand student services, provide federal assistance to institutions, and create new grant programs to reduce postsecondary costs. Title IV of the HEA authorizes federal student aid programs, with H.R. 4674 seeking to increase aid availability in various ways. H.R. 4674 aims to expand financial aid availability for postsecondary students, particularly through Pell Grants, which are need-based grants for eligible undergraduate students. The program is the largest grant program authorized in Title IV, with about 7.1 million grants awarded in AY 2017-2018 totaling $28.7 billion. Eligibility for Pell Grants is determined based on expected family contribution, and all eligible applicants receive grants. The maximum Pell Grant a student can receive is based on the difference between the total grant amount and the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Eligibility for the grant is determined by enrollment in an eligible program at an eligible institution. H.R. 4674 proposes to increase the maximum Pell Grant amount and expand eligibility criteria. H.R. 4674 aims to increase the maximum Pell Grant amount, with the total maximum grant for AY2021-2022 set to be $6,970. The increase in award levels would be funded by mandatory appropriations, and the grant amount would further increase annually based on inflation rates. The increase in the total maximum Pell Grant amount for AY2021-2022 would benefit currently eligible students by providing larger grants, with full-time recipients potentially receiving up to $625 more compared to the previous year. Additionally, H.R. 4674 would make some students newly eligible for Pell Grants by raising the lifetime eligibility limit to 14 full-time semesters and allowing Pell Grants for incarcerated individuals. H.R. 4674 aims to expand Pell Grant eligibility by allowing incarcerated and civilly committed individuals to receive Pell Grants, while restricting them from attending proprietary IHEs. It also proposes to extend Pell Grants to graduate students who have not exhausted their lifetime eligibility. Additionally, the bill introduces \"Job Training Federal Pell Grants\" for shorter programs. The bill proposes creating \"Job Training Federal Pell Grants\" for shorter training programs aligned with high-demand sectors, providing academic credit, and offered by eligible institutions under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The bill proposes creating \"Job Training Federal Pell Grants\" for shorter training programs aligned with high-demand sectors, offering a Pell Grant of up to $1,035 for a 150-hour program over 8 weeks. Additionally, a new Direct Perkins Loan program is being considered to replace the expired Federal Perkins Loan program. The Direct Perkins Loan program would replace the expired Federal Perkins Loan program, offering loans directly to students with terms similar to Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Undergraduate students could borrow up to $5,500 annually and $27,500 in total, while graduate and professional students could borrow up to $8,000 annually and $60,000 in total. Loan limits would be separate from those of the Direct Loan program. The Direct Perkins Loan program would offer fixed interest rates at 5% per year, with loan limits independent of the Direct Loan program. Annual authority for loans would be allocated to IHEs based on unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. H.R. 4674 would provide a base guarantee for loan authority, mandatory appropriations not exceeding $2.4 billion annually, and include loans previously made under the Perkins Loan program. H.R. 4674 authorizes changes to campus-based grant programs for IHEs, increasing appropriations levels. The FSEOG program provides funds to undergraduate students with financial need, with most IHEs required to match funds. In FY2019, FSEOG received $840 million in appropriations. FSEOG funds are distributed to IHEs based on past funding levels and student need. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the formula, considering unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. IHEs would receive the higher of their new formula grant or 90% of their FY2020 grant in FY2021, with a gradual transition to the new formula by FY2026. New institutional eligibility criteria would also be established. H.R. 4674 proposes increasing discretionary appropriations for FSEOG to $1.15 billion in FY2021, with annual increases up to $1.75 billion by FY2025. It also establishes an emergency grant program funded through a $12.5 million set-aside from FSEOG appropriations for FY2021-2026, requiring a 50% match from participating IHEs, prioritizing those with at least 30% Pell Grant-eligible students. The FWS program authorizes grants to support part-time employment for qualified students at various organizations. In FY2019, FWS appropriations were $1.13 billion, distributed to IHEs based on a formula similar to the FSEOG formula. H.R. 4674 proposes aligning the FWS formula with the FSEOG formula and distributing funds based on unmet student need. H.R. 4674 proposes a modified fair share formula for distributing FWS grants to IHEs, considering unmet student need and Pell Grant funds. IHEs would receive the higher of their grant under the new formula or 90% of their FY2020 grant in FY2021. The bill also establishes new institutional eligibility criteria based on Pell Grant recipients and zero EFC graduate students. It increases discretionary appropriations to $1.5 billion in FY2021, with a gradual increase to $2.5 billion by FY2025. H.R. 4674 would reserve a portion of the FWS appropriation for a new grant program for \"improved institutions\" based on Pell Grant recipients' share and performance. The reserved amount would be the lesser of 20% of the FWS appropriation exceeding $700 million or $150 million. These provisions would take effect two years after enactment. Individual eligibility for student aid programs is determined by assessing a student's family's ability to pay for education costs through expected family contribution (EFC) formulas. Students with lower EFCs typically qualify for more need-based aid. H.R. 4674 proposes changes to the Higher Education Act that could lower EFC levels, increasing aid eligibility for lower-income students. The bill includes provisions to expand automatic zero EFC eligibility, raising the AGI threshold to $37,000 and extending it to independent students without dependents. It also allows any applicant who received a means-tested benefit in the past 24 months to qualify for automatic zero EFC. H.R. 4674 proposes creating FAFSA pathways based on income and tax return complexity. Applicants who received means-tested benefits in the previous 24 months would not need to provide additional financial information. The bill also introduces a one-time FAFSA option for Pell-eligible students in their first year of postsecondary education. H.R. 4674 aims to expand eligibility for federal student aid to unauthorized immigrants who entered the U.S. before age 16 and met certain criteria. It also seeks to streamline procedures for foster care and homeless youth to establish their independent student status for FAFSA purposes. Title IV of the HEA specifies provisions for federal student loan programs, including the Direct Loan program, FFEL program, and Perkins Loan program. New loans are currently only authorized through the Direct Loan program. H.R. 4674 proposes student loan reforms for both the FFEL and Direct Loan programs, focusing on the Direct Loan program as the primary federal student loan program in operation. The Direct Loan program is the primary federal student loan program currently in operation under the Higher Education Act (HEA) as amended by the CAA. It provides financial assistance to support students' postsecondary educational pursuits through federal credit programs with mandatory and discretionary appropriations. Loans are originated and disbursed by the student's attending institution, while loan servicing and collection functions are handled by federal contractors hired by the Department of Education (ED). The Direct Loan program offers various types of loans to students, including Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans. Loan terms and conditions are specified in statute and may vary. In FY2020, an estimated 15.9 million new loans totaling $100.2 billion will be made, along with 755,000 Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $46.4 billion. As of the end of the third quarter of FY2019, $1.2 trillion in principal and interest on Direct Loan program. H.R. 4674 proposes borrower-focused reforms to the Direct Loan program, aiming to ease student loan burdens by amending loan terms, repayment options, administrative procedures, and refinancing availability. The changes are intended to make student loan repayment easier for individuals. H.R. 4674 aims to make student loan repayment easier by eliminating loan origination fees for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. Borrowers currently have various repayment plan options to choose from. Under income-driven repayment plans, borrowers make monthly payments based on a percentage of their adjusted gross income above 150% of the federal poverty guideline for their family size. Some plans cap payments at the amount they would pay under a standard 10-year repayment period, with potential loan forgiveness after 20 years. Under income-driven repayment plans, borrowers make monthly payments based on a percentage of their adjusted gross income above 150% of the federal poverty guideline for their family size. Some plans cap payments at the amount they would pay under a standard 10-year repayment period, with potential loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years. H.R. 4674 would establish two new loan repayment plans - a fixed repayment plan and an income-based repayment (IBR) plan for Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2021. The proposed IBR plan under H.R. 4674 would offer more generous terms for borrowers, with monthly payments based on 10% of adjusted gross income exceeding a specified income protection level. The income protection level is 250% of the federal poverty guidelines for AGIs of $80,000 or less ($160,000 for married borrowers), decreasing as AGI increases for those above this threshold. The proposed IBR plan would decrease income protection as AGI increases, phasing out entirely at $105,000 for single borrowers ($210,000 for married borrowers). Negative amortization would be allowed, with remaining balances forgiven after 20 years of payments. Interest subsidies may be provided by the federal government under certain circumstances. The Direct Loan program offers interest subsidies for need-based Direct Subsidized Loans, mainly for undergraduate students. Subsidized periods include in-school, grace periods, and deferment. Deferment and forbearance provide temporary relief for borrowers struggling with payments, but accrued interest is later capitalized. H.R. 4674 aims to make changes to the Direct Loan program. H.R. 4674 proposes making Direct Subsidized Loans available to graduate and professional students at public and private nonprofit institutions starting July 1, 2021. The bill also aims to keep the interest rate on these loans the same as Direct Unsubsidized Loans for graduate students. Additionally, it suggests that accrued interest during deferment or forbearance periods should not be added to the loan balance. H.R. 4674 proposes expanding borrower eligibility for loan discharge and forgiveness options, including borrower defense to repayment (BDR) provisions. Regulations specify standards and procedures for BDR discharge, with amendments effective July 1, 2020. Borrowers may have their loans discharged in whole or in part based on specified criteria. H.R. 4674 aims to amend the Higher Education Act (HEA) to define borrower eligibility for loan discharge more explicitly. It would allow for full or partial loan discharge based on certain criteria, with procedures for fair resolution of borrower defense to repayment (BDR) claims. H.R. 4674 aims to expand Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility by including new types of employees and allowing qualifying payments made on loans prior to consolidation or refinanced federal loans to count towards the required 120 payments. It also requires the Department of Education to develop tools to help borrowers determine their eligibility for PSLF. H.R. 4674 aims to streamline administrative processes for borrowers by allowing the Department of Education to automatically provide loan benefits, such as IDR plans and total and permanent disability discharge, without requiring action from the borrower. H.R. 4674 would authorize the Department of Education to automatically enroll certain delinquent borrowers into the IBR plan, recertify and recalculate repayments under the IDR plan, monitor income for disability loan discharge, and establish standardized administrative procedures for loan servicers and collection agencies. H.R. 4674 would require the Department of Education to establish two new loan refinancing options for qualified borrowers to refinance Direct Loan and FFEL program loans. Private education loans are not eligible for refinancing into a Direct Consolidation Loan. One option under H.R. 4674 would allow qualified borrowers to refinance Direct Loan and FFEL program loans into a refinanced Direct Loan with fixed interest rates pegged to specified Direct Loan program rates. Refinanced Direct Loans would have the same terms as the original loans, benefiting borrowers with higher interest rates. Interest rates for refinanced Direct Loans vary based on the type of loan and borrower, ranging from 4.53% to 6.08%. The refinanced Direct Loan option under H.R. 4674 allows borrowers to refinance their existing loans into a new Direct Loan with fixed interest rates. The interest rates vary depending on the type of loan being refinanced, ranging from 6.08% for graduate/professional student loans to 7.08% for PLUS Loans. Borrowers can also refinance private education loans into a Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loan with similar terms as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Federal Direct Refinanced Private Loans offer fixed interest rates based on Direct Loan program rates from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. Rates are 4.53% for undergraduate loans, 6.08% for graduate/professional loans, and 7.08% for combined studies. These loans do not count towards Direct Loan limits. The HEA provides institutional accountability measures related to educational and fiscal accountability, as well as Title IX requirements. H.R. 4674 aims to strengthen these accountability requirements. H.R. 4674 aims to strengthen accountability requirements for all types of IHEs, focusing on Title IV programs and proprietary IHEs. Educational accountability ensures quality programs, assessed through accreditation by ED-recognized agencies. Accreditation agencies evaluate student achievement in relation to an institution's mission, which may include course completion, state licensing exam passage, and job placement rates. Standards and procedures vary among accrediting agencies, with differing definitions for actions against institutions and disclosure policies. H.R. 4674 aims to standardize practices and increase transparency in accrediting agency and Department of Education practices. The bill H.R. 4674 aims to standardize accrediting agencies' evaluation of student educational outcomes, including completion, progress, and workforce participation. It also requires the Department of Education to establish standardized definitions for agency actions and disclosure requirements. Additionally, the bill makes changes to the recognition processes for accrediting agencies, including public availability of recognition applications and submission of information to Congress. H.R. 4674 aims to establish new accountability metrics for Title IV institutions, including on-time repayment rates and instructional spending. The bill also seeks to standardize accrediting agencies' evaluation of student outcomes and make changes to recognition processes. The bill aims to establish new accountability metrics for Title IV institutions, including on-time repayment rates and instructional spending. It would phase out the current institutional cohort default rate metric and replace it with a new adjusted cohort default rate. The bill proposes a new adjusted cohort default rate metric for Title IV institutions, taking into account the relative risk posed to students and taxpayers. Institutions could lose Title IV eligibility if their adjusted CDR exceeds certain thresholds over multiple years. Borrowers in forbearance for three or more years would be considered in default for calculating the adjusted CDR. The bill proposes new fiscal accountability requirements for Title IV institutions, including establishing metrics to assess program effectiveness in preparing students for gainful employment. Institutions must meet financial responsibility standards to participate in Title IV programs. H.R. 4674 proposes new financial responsibility standards for Title IV institutions, including requiring IHEs to post a letter of credit to ED under certain circumstances. It specifies conditions where IHEs may be considered financially responsible and prohibits ED from considering certain IHEs financially responsible in specific situations. H.R. 4674 proposes new financial responsibility standards for Title IV institutions, including circumstances for redetermining an IHE's financial responsibility. This includes situations like paying debts, lawsuits for financial relief, and potential borrower defense claims. It also allows ED to redetermine financial responsibility based on factors like state citations and high dropout rates. The bill also amends the 90/10 Rule. H.R. 4674 proposes amending the 90/10 Rule for proprietary IHEs, requiring them to derive at least 15% of their revenues from non-federal sources to maintain Title IV eligibility. It also limits marketing and recruitment expenditures for IHEs not meeting instructional spending requirements. Failure to comply would result in automatic loss of Title IV eligibility. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in education programs receiving federal funds. H.R. 4674 aims to block ED from enforcing proposed Title IX regulations. HEA focuses on public accountability and consumer information for college affordability. The Higher Education Act (HEA) addresses college affordability and consumer information by requiring the administration of the College Navigator website and Net Price Calculators on IHE websites. It currently prohibits the creation of a postsecondary student unit record system (SURS) to track individual student financing and outcomes. H.R. 4674 proposes amendments to the Higher Education Act to enhance public accountability, transparency, and consumer information requirements. These changes aim to provide consumers with more detailed information to make informed decisions about college attendance and student loan borrowing. H.R. 4674 aims to repeal the prohibition on creating a new SURS and develop a postsecondary student-level data system for evaluating metrics like enrollment, completion, and post-collegiate outcomes. It also requires IHEs to provide detailed cost and aid information, standardizes financial aid offer letters, and updates information provided to individuals before and after receiving federal student aid. H.R. 4674 would require ED to develop a standardized financial aid offer letter for IHEs, provide counseling for borrowers receiving Title IV student loans, and create new programs to support students. This includes the Student Success Fund, which offers grants to states or Indian tribes. The Student Success Fund program in H.R. 4674 would provide grants to states or tribes for implementing institutional reforms to improve student outcomes. The Pell Bonus Program would support IHEs with Pell Grant recipients, with funds allocated based on their share of bachelor's degrees awarded to Pell Grant recipients. Mandatory appropriations of $500 million per year would be authorized for both programs. H.R. 4674 authorizes $500 million per year for Pell Grant recipients. It also includes $162.5 million per year for remedial education grants and grants for improving access to higher education for foster and homeless youth. H.R. 4674 aims to enhance postsecondary persistence and completion for students by authorizing $150 million for FY2021 and inflation-adjusted amounts through FY2026. It introduces the Jumpstart to College grant program with $250 million annually for early college programs. The bill extends funding for existing student support programs, notably increasing funding for TRIO programs. H.R. 4674 authorizes $1.12 billion for FY2021 for TRIO programs and $200 million annually for the CCAMPIS program to support disadvantaged students. The bill also increases funding for programs serving minority and needy students. The HEA authorizes grant programs for minority serving institutions (MSIs) to strengthen academic, administrative, and financial capabilities. Various types of MSIs receive separate grant programs, including American Indian Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, Predominantly Black Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Many of these programs are funded through annual appropriations. H.R. 4674 would permanently authorize mandatory appropriations under HEA Section 371 at $300 million annually and extend discretionary appropriations for MSI programs through FY2026. It would also reauthorize and create new grant programs to support MSIs, including the Endowment Challenge Grant program, with discretionary appropriations. Additionally, the bill would amend and reauthorize the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act of 1978 through FY2026. H.R. 4674 would create a new HEA, Title IV, Part J, authorizing grants to states, Indian tribes, and IHEs to eliminate or reduce tuition and fees at community colleges. The bill would provide grants to states to support community colleges in waiving tuition and fees for eligible students, including qualified Indian tribes. Eligible students must attend a community college on a not less than half-time basis and meet certain criteria, regardless of financial need. H.R. 4674 would create a new HEA, Title IV, Part J, authorizing grants to states, Indian tribes, and IHEs to eliminate or reduce tuition and fees at community colleges. The bill would provide permanent mandatory appropriations starting in FY2021, incrementally increasing to $16,296,080,000 in FY2030. Funds would be allocated to states based on a formula developed by the ED. States would need to provide a nonfederal share equal to 25% of the national average resident community college tuition and fees per eligible student to receive the grant. The bill H.R. 4674 would require states to waive community college tuition and fees for eligible students and supplement, not supplant, other funds. Participating states must maintain financial support for public higher education and need-based financial aid. H.R. 4674 proposes new programs to provide grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities, and Minority-Serving Institutions to waive or reduce tuition and fees for eligible students for the first 60 credits. Grants would cover the actual cost of tuition and fees, multiplied by the number of eligible students enrolled, without requiring a nonfederal match. Eligible institutions must have at least 35% low-income students and meet criteria related to student services and supports. H.R. 4674 would provide permanent mandatory funding starting in FY2021, increasing incrementally to $1,626,040,000 in FY2030. It authorizes discretionary appropriations for new grant programs, including formula grants to states for students with unmet financial need. Initially available to Pell Grant recipients at public IHEs, the grants would later extend to other students. ED would also be authorized to carry out additional new grant programs as necessary. The bill authorizes grant programs for students at public and private nonprofit IHEs to address unmet financial need. States can also award grants to four-year IHEs to waive resident tuition and fees for eligible students. Programs would have a federal share of 75% and a nonfederal share of 25%."
