    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act\" or the \"SENSE Act.\" Standards for coal refuse power plants are outlined in the Act. The \"SENSE Act\" defines key terms such as Administrator, boiler operating day, coal refuse, and coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit. The \"SENSE Act\" defines a coal refuse-fired facility as a unit using fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy, with coal refuse making up at least 75% of the annual fuel consumed. The facility must be located on contiguous properties, fall under the same industrial classification, and be under the control of the same person or entity. The \"SENSE Act\" defines a coal refuse-fired facility as a unit using fluidized bed combustion technology to convert coal refuse into energy, with coal refuse making up at least 75% of the annual fuel consumed. The facility must be located on contiguous properties, fall under the same industrial classification, and be under the control of the same person or entity. An electric utility steam generating unit is defined as such in federal regulations. Emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide from these units are regulated under the Clean Air Act. The \"SENSE Act\" sets emission standards for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units. Operators must comply with either standard, not both. The \"SENSE Act\" establishes emission standards for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units. Operators must comply with specific emission rates for each pollutant. The \"SENSE Act\" sets emission standards for sulfur dioxide emissions from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units, with a limit of 1.5 pounds per megawatt-hour. Additionally, operators must ensure 93% capture and control of sulfur dioxide emissions across the generating unit or group of units. The \"SENSE Act\" establishes emission standards for sulfur dioxide emissions from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units, measured by a continuous monitoring system as a 30-day rolling average per unit or group of units at a single facility. The \"SENSE Act\" establishes emission standards for sulfur dioxide emissions from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units, passed the House of Representatives on March 8, 2018."
