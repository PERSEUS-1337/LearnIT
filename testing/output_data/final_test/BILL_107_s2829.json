This section will take effect on October 1, 2002. SEC. 2 amends Section 1213(g) of title 5, United States Code regarding disclosure of violations of law. It removes a sentence from paragraph (1) and replaces paragraph (3) with new provisions for informing individuals of reasons for non-action and alternative offices for disclosures. SEC. 3 protects certain disclosures of information by federal employees. Section 2302(b)(8) of title 5, United States Code is amended to clarify disclosures covered without restrictions on time, place, form, motive, context, or prior disclosure. It includes disclosures made in the ordinary course of duties that are evidence of any violation. The amendment to Section 2302(b)(8) of title 5, United States Code clarifies that disclosures can be made without restrictions on time, place, form, motive, context, or prior disclosure. This includes disclosures made in the ordinary course of duties that are evidence of any violation. An employee or applicant can make a protected disclosure if they reasonably believe it shows a violation of law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, danger to public health or safety, or a false statement to Congress. The curr_chunk specifies who can receive protected disclosures, including members of Congress and employees with appropriate security clearance. The curr_chunk amends sections of title 5, United States Code related to covered disclosures, rebuttable presumption, and nondisclosure policies, forms, and agreements. It clarifies the definition of \"disclosure\" and allows for the rebuttal of presumptions with substantial evidence. The curr_chunk further amends title 5, United States Code by adding provisions related to the implementation of nondisclosure policies and the authority of Special Counsel in civil actions. The Special Counsel is authorized to represent themselves in civil actions related to specific sections of the law and can seek judicial review of decisions by filing a petition in the United States Courts of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Special Counsel may petition for review of a Board decision under certain conditions, including first petitioning the Board for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals has discretion in granting the petition for judicial review. SEC. 4. NONDISCLOSURE POLICIES, FORMS, AND AGREEMENTS. Each agreement in Standard Forms 312 and 4414 and any other nondisclosure policy shall include a statement that the restrictions do not supersede employee obligations created by various laws and regulations related to disclosures to Congress, military members, illegal activities, and national security. The agreement must comply with laws related to national security, including specific sections of the United States Code and the Subversive Activities Act of 1950. Any nondisclosure policy lacking this statement cannot be enforced. Non-federal individuals involved in intelligence activities may have appropriate provisions in their agreements. The United States Government requires that any form or agreement related to classified information must include provisions for non-disclosure, except when authorized by the government. These forms do not prevent disclosures to Congress or authorized officials in cases of reporting significant legal violations."
