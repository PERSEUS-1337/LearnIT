The bill clarified elements of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act and overruled judicial interpretations. It was signed into law on October 6, 2006. Federal trademark law clarifies undefined elements of the FTDA and overrules judicial interpretations inconsistent with legislative intent. Unlike copyright and patent law, trademark law's basis is the Commerce Clause. Trademark rights can arise from federal and state law, a unique feature not found in other IP fields. State common law provides legal protection for trademark owners in addition to federal trademark law. A trademark is a symbol used to indicate the source of goods or services and distinguish them from others. For example, the \"swoosh\" logo on Nike shoes signifies the company's quality and reputation. Trademarks assure customers of the authenticity of the products they are purchasing. Trademark law, governed by the Lanham Act of 1946, empowers consumers by providing critical information for purchasing decisions. The Act requires merchants to register their marks with the US Patent and Trademark Office for federal protection. To obtain federal protection for a mark, registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is necessary. While state common law provides some protection once a mark is used in commerce, the Lanham Act offers significant benefits for seeking federal registration, including nationwide notice, evidence of validity, the ability to bring legal action in federal court, and the basis for registration in foreign countries. To obtain federal protection for a mark, registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is necessary. The mark must be \"used in commerce\" or have a good faith intention to use it. The degree of trademark protection depends on the mark's distinctiveness, which prevents generic or descriptive terms from being monopolized. Courts categorize word-based marks into four levels of protection: Fanciful and arbitrary terms are inherently distinctive (e.g., KODAK, APPLE). Suggestive terms also require imagination (e.g., COPPERTONE, 7-ELEVEN). 7-ELEVEN is a convenience store originally open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Descriptive words, geographic terms, and personal names are not inherently distinctive and generally cannot be registered. However, they can be registered if they have acquired \"secondary meaning.\" Generic terms represent the basic name of a product or service category and cannot be protected as trademarks. Some once distinctive terms can become generic through \"genericide,\" losing their distinctiveness. Examples include THERMOS, ASPIRIN, and KLEENEX. The owner of a trademark has the exclusive right to use it and can take legal action for infringement. Federal registration allows for additional legal remedies under the Lanham Act. The Lanham Act provides legal remedies for trademark infringement, including civil action for unauthorized use of a registered mark likely to cause confusion or deceive consumers. Section 32 claims are for owners of registered trademarks, while section 43 claims can be brought by owners of both registered and unregistered marks. Both aim to prevent deceptive use of marks, with section 43 covering a broader range of practices. Trademark infringement is based on the standard of \"likelihood of confusion,\" requiring no actual confusion to be shown. Trademark infringement is based on the standard of \"likelihood of confusion,\" where consumer confusion as to the source of goods is probable. The usual remedy is injunctive relief, with monetary relief also available. The U.S. Supreme Court has described trademark law as reducing customer costs by preventing others from copying a source-identifying mark and encouraging the production of quality products. Trademark infringement is based on the standard of \"likelihood of confusion,\" aiming to prevent consumer confusion about the source of goods. In contrast, trademark dilution focuses on the lessening of a famous mark's capacity to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of competition or confusion. This concept discourages the marketing of unrelated products under a strong trademark, like KODAK mayonnaise, which could dilute the original mark's distinctiveness. Dilution law aims to protect the uniqueness and strength of a famous mark, such as KODAK mayonnaise, by preventing its erosion through unauthorized usage. This concept, originating from a 1927 law review article, has been adopted by many state jurisdictions to preserve the advertising value and distinctiveness of well-known marks. Dilution can occur through blurring, where the famous mark's ability to identify its product is impaired by a similar mark, potentially affecting consumer perceptions and the company's reputation. Dilution by tarnishment is the second form of dilution, where the reputation of a famous mark is harmed by negative associations from a similar mark. This can happen when a famous trademark is linked to products of poor quality or portrayed in an unfavorable context, affecting consumer perceptions. Unlike traditional trademark infringement, dilution does not require a likelihood of confusion. The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (FTDA) created the first federal cause of action for trademark dilution, allowing owners of famous marks to seek injunctive relief against commercial use that causes dilution of the mark's distinctive quality. Monetary relief and destruction of infringing articles are also available for willful violations of the FTDA. The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (FTDA) allows owners of famous marks to seek injunctive relief against commercial use that causes dilution of the mark's quality. Protection is reserved for owners of prominent, renowned marks, regardless of federal registration. Unlike traditional trademark law, dilution law benefits only the trademark owner, not consumers. The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (FTDA) aims to protect famous marks from losing their distinctiveness. The law provides three exemptions to dilution claims, including fair use in comparative advertising, noncommercial use, and news reporting. Some trademark owners have misused the law to restrict parody and criticism. Several federal courts have narrowly interpreted the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA), creating stricter barriers to obtaining dilution protection than intended by the statute's drafters. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court also narrowly construed the FTDA, causing concern among experts. For example, in a case involving THE CHILDREN'S PLACE trademark, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the FTDA does not protect descriptive marks, even if they have acquired secondary meaning. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that famous marks like MCDONALD'S and DISNEY may not be eligible for protection under the FTDA if they have acquired distinctiveness. In a separate case, Mattel, Inc. sued MCA Records over the song \"Barbie Girl,\" claiming it diluted the Barbie trademark. The Ninth Circuit found that Barbie qualified for relief. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the song \"Barbie Girl\" qualifies for relief under the FTDA as a famous and distinctive mark, but MCA is shielded from liability due to the \"noncommercial use\" exemption. The court found that the song's use of the Barbie mark falls within this exemption as it lampoons the Barbie image and comments humorously on cultural values, thus entitling it to full First Amendment protection. Mattel's dilution claim against MCA failed as a result. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the argument that the FTDA requires a separate test for fame and distinctiveness for federal dilution protection. Scholar J. Thomas McCarthy agreed, stating that \"distinctiveness\" is used as a synonym for \"fame\" in the statute. Basic trademark principles dictate that a mark must be distinctive to qualify for protection under the FTDA. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit interpreted the FTDA differently, stating that the requirement of distinctiveness was intended to exclude protection for non-distinctive marks. They emphasized that many famous marks are common and should not automatically exclude new entrants. Therefore, distinctiveness is a separate statutory element that famous trademark owners must satisfy in the Second Circuit to obtain relief. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that Ringling Bros. trademark was not diluted by Utah's use of a similar slogan. The Second Circuit disagreed, stating that the FTDA allows for injunctions to prevent harm before it occurs. The Second Circuit appellate court embraced a \"likelihood of dilution\" standard of proof to prevent harm before it occurs. The United States Supreme Court considered a case involving the VICTORIA'S SECRET trademark, where defendants operated a store named \"Victor's Little Secret\" in Kentucky, leading to a federal dilution lawsuit by the corporation owning the VICTORIA'S SECRET trademark. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the dilution injunction against the use of the famous VICTORIA'S SECRET trademark, citing tarnishing and blurring of the brand. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the summary judgment on the dilution claim in Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue, requiring a showing of actual dilution rather than likelihood. The VICTORIA'S SECRET trademark owner failed to meet the standard of actual dilution required for relief under the FTDA. Critics argue that this standard creates an undue burden for famous trademark owners to obtain injunctive relief. Many courts have since rejected dilution claims following the V Secret decision. The decision to narrowly construe the FTDA was made to provide more freedom for small businesses in their commercial speech. The \"actual dilution\" standard was seen as necessary to prevent judges from making speculative decisions and to protect the public interest in trademark law. The 109th Congress considered legislation, H.R. 683, amending the FTDA to clarify federal dilution law and address problematic judicial interpretations. The Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 makes changes to the FTDA, requiring a mark to be both famous and distinctive, allowing federal dilution protection for famous descriptive marks, and providing clarity on Congress's original intent with the dilution statute. The Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 clarifies federal dilution law by providing dilution protection for famous descriptive marks that have acquired distinctiveness. It defines \"famous\" marks and specifies that dilution may be actionable through tarnishment or blurring. The act requires a mark to be both famous and distinctive, with the standard of harm in a federal dilution case being \"likelihood of dilution.\" It also mandates that the defendant must have used the mark as a source designation for a dilution claim to be actionable, adding a free speech safeguard. Critics raise concerns about favoring major corporations over small businesses and potential limitations on consumer rights and free speech. The House passed H.R. 683 by a vote of 411 to 8 on April 19, 2005, and the Senate passed it with an amendment on March 8, 2006. The main difference between the House and Senate versions is the removal of the \"noncommercial use\" defense in the House bill. This change could impact cases similar to the Barbie Girl decision and raise questions about free speech rights. The Senate's amendment to the bill addresses First Amendment concerns by including the \"fair use\" defense for parodying, criticizing, or commenting on famous marks. Critics argue that the \"noncommercial use\" defense allows for quick and cheap escape from litigation, while fair use requires a complex analysis, making dismissal harder without expensive discovery and trial. The Senate's amendment to the bill includes a fair use exemption from dilution liability for nominative or descriptive fair use. It also shifts the burden of proof in civil actions for dilution involving unregistered trade dress. The Trademark Dilution Revision Act, signed into law in 2006, aims to clarify key provisions of the FTDA and make it easier for owners of famous trademarks to obtain injunctive relief against acts of dilution. The legislation defines elements such as \"famous,\" \"distinctive,\" \"blurring,\" and \"tarnishment,\" setting a high standard for qualifying for FTDA protection. The Senate's amendment includes a fair use exemption and shifts the burden of proof in civil actions for dilution involving unregistered trade dress. The Trademark Dilution Revision Act, enacted in 2006, sets a high standard for qualifying for FTDA protection, limiting eligibility to marks that are truly prominent and renowned."
