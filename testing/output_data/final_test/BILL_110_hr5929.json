    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Nuclear Terrorism Deterrence and Detection Act\". Congress acknowledges the critical security challenge of terrorist detonation of a nuclear device on American soil. Nuclear forensics aids in deterring and responding to nuclear terrorism by analyzing nuclear materials for attribution to their source. Improvement in the nation's nuclear forensics capability is needed, particularly in workforce training. The Nation faces challenges in nuclear forensics, including a shortage of skilled personnel and outdated equipment. Efforts are needed to accelerate workforce training and develop advanced field equipment for more accurate radiation analysis. Additionally, international databases play a crucial role in identifying the source of nuclear material. The need for a shared international database of nuclear samples to aid in matching debris or intercepted nuclear devices with their source is emphasized. An independent group of experts should validate nuclear forensics investigations to address potential skepticism. Realistic drills are recommended to prepare for the time-consuming nature of nuclear forensics investigations. Realistic drills help senior leadership understand the strengths and limitations of the nation's nuclear forensics capability for better decision-making. Congress believes that a fellowship program for graduate students in nuclear chemistry should be established by the Administrator for Nuclear Security. The program should support at least 6 Ph.D. students per year, with students required to spend two summers in a national laboratory. Funding for the program should be no less than $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, increasing to $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2013. SEC. 4. Congress urges the Administrator for Nuclear Security to enhance nuclear forensics radiation-measurement equipment through research and development, with funding of at least $5,000,000 annually from 2009 to 2013. Section 3129(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is amended to include legislative, regulatory, or treaty actions to enhance international nuclear-material databases and enable prompt data access. Additionally, a Nuclear Forensics Advisory Panel is established. The Secretaries of Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security will establish a joint independent Nuclear Forensics Advisory Panel to validate Federal nuclear forensics analysis. A report on the panel's structure and membership must be submitted to specific congressional committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The President must submit a report on Cabinet-level leadership involvement in nuclear terrorism preparedness exercises with nuclear forensics analysis within 90 days of the Act's enactment to specific congressional committees."
