    "content": "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world's security landscape shifted to a system where nations and sub-national groups could acquire weapons of mass destruction. Strategies like containment and deterrence are deemed insufficient in the current threat environment. The National Security Strategy of the United States in 2002 emphasized the need to prevent the proliferation of WMDs. The Bush Administration aimed to strengthen nonproliferation efforts through diplomacy, arms control, and multilateral export controls. The Bush Administration's National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction in 2002 focuses on enhancing diplomacy, arms control, and threat reduction to impede states and terrorists seeking WMD. The plan includes efforts in counterproliferation, nonproliferation, and WMD consequence management, aiming to eliminate or \"roll back\" WMD from certain states and terrorist groups. Interdiction may involve the use of force and aggressive methods to prevent the acquisition of WMD-related goods, technologies, and expertise. The Bush Administration's National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction in 2002 focuses on enhancing diplomacy, arms control, and threat reduction to impede states and terrorists seeking WMD. A high-profile incident in December 2002 involving the interception of Scud missiles on a North Korean vessel highlighted legal impediments to the strategy. The Bush Administration concluded that there was no legal basis to arrest the vessel or seize its cargo. In May 2003, President Bush announced a new facet of the WMD strategy, the Proliferation Security Initiative. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a new facet of the WMD strategy announced by President Bush in May 2003. It aims to allow searches of ships and aircraft carrying suspected weapons-related cargo through partnerships of states working together to interdict threatening shipments of WMD and missile-related equipment and technologies. Undersecretary of State John Bolton emphasized the need for a dynamic approach to global proliferation issues. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) aims to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction by enhancing cooperation in interdiction efforts among nations. It focuses on intercepting threatening shipments of WMD and missile-related equipment, with the possibility of unilateral action if necessary. These developments raise questions regarding international law jurisdiction. The report provides an overview of the international law of jurisdiction in relation to interdicting WMD-related contraband on the sea and in the air. It outlines the legal regime for controlling WMD internationally and describes concepts central to the law of the sea. The report discusses the international legal framework for controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the challenges in preventing their spread to potential enemies. It highlights the complexities of regulating materials with dual-use capabilities that have both peaceful and potentially harmful applications. Under international law, sovereign States have the right to possess weapons for self-defense, with limitations on their use. While some States have agreed to limit production and possession of WMD and conventional weapons, they may revoke consent based on the conduct of other States. Secret development of WMD by a State that agreed not to engage in such conduct would breach treaty obligations but may not be considered a crime under international law. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is central to the nuclear nonproliferation regime. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) allows five nuclear powers to possess nuclear weapons but prohibits their transfer to other states. All other NPT parties agree not to acquire nuclear weapons in exchange for assistance in peaceful nuclear power development. The treaty also commits nuclear powers to negotiate on nuclear disarmament and complete disarmament under international control. States can withdraw from the NPT with three months' notice in case of extraordinary events. The NPT allows nuclear powers to possess nuclear weapons but prohibits their transfer. Non-nuclear-weapon States Parties can stockpile weapons-grade nuclear material under IAEA safeguards. Special inspections can be conducted in case of reported material loss. The IAEA can report violations to the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly but lacks enforcement power. Export control laws and multilateral groups help prevent nuclear proliferation by coordinating efforts and restricting trade. International efforts to regulate chemical weapons trade began over a century ago with the Hague Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 1925. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was the first to prohibit the manufacture and stockpiling of chemical weapons, calling for their elimination by 2007 and restricting trade in precursor chemicals. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibits the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons, requiring States Parties to declare facilities producing restricted chemicals for peaceful purposes. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) monitors implementation through inspections and may conduct challenge inspections in response to noncompliance allegations. The Conference of States Parties addresses concerns over violations and may request action from the U.N. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) addresses the development, production, acquisition, or stockpiling of biological agents or toxins for hostile purposes. States Parties undertake to prohibit such conduct and destroy existing biological weapons supplies. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) requires states to destroy biological weapons supplies and prohibits the transfer or acquisition of such weapons. Efforts are being made to strengthen the BWC with a protocol for compliance inspections, but the Bush Administration rejected it. States can complain to the UN Security Council if they believe another state is breaching the BWC. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) allows for investigations and cooperation from the accused, but lacks further remedial measures. States can withdraw from the BWC with three months' notice. While arms control treaties have helped limit the spread of weapons of mass destruction, they only apply to member States. Non-member States can still access WMD-related technology and materials, trade freely among themselves, and are not legally bound to refrain from stockpiling or transferring weapons. States Parties participate voluntarily and can withdraw from conventions at any time. The success of arms control arrangements relies on member States' cooperation and enforcement of laws against WMD-related activities. Sovereignty is central to the international political system, with nation-states having supreme authority over their territory and citizens. Jurisdiction refers to a State's authority to affect legal interests, prescribe laws, adjudicate, and compel compliance. The jurisdiction of a State involves its authority to adjudicate and enforce laws, including the ability to interdict, seize, and destroy weapons. Principles of international law determine a State's ability to assert jurisdiction over persons and things within its reach, with the territoriality principle being historically common. Other bases of jurisdiction include the nationality principle and the protective principle. The jurisdiction of a State involves its authority to adjudicate and enforce laws, including interdicting, seizing, and destroying weapons. Principles of international law determine a State's ability to assert jurisdiction over persons and things within its reach, with territoriality, nationality, and protective principles being common. States may also exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction under certain circumstances, but generally cannot enforce laws on another State's territory without permission. Universal jurisdiction may allow a State to try crimes that occurred outside its territory and did not involve its nationals. The United States has authority to regulate possession and transfer of WMD materials within its borders and can restrict conduct of U.S. citizens worldwide. However, it does not have the right to enforce laws in another state without permission. The United States can regulate WMD materials within its borders and restrict its citizens' conduct globally, but lacks the authority to enforce laws in another state without permission. International law does not automatically grant U.S. forces the right to intervene in WMD trade outside U.S. territory, unless authorized by relevant agreements or the UN Security Council under Chapter VII for specific threats. The permissibility of options to combat WMD proliferation varies depending on the location and whose laws are violated. Enforcement actions in another state implicate that state's sovereignty and are subject to its terms of agreement or resistance capacity. Enforcement actions in areas without sovereign authority, like the high seas, may face less resistance from other states. The law of the sea divides authority among nations to conduct activity in or above the oceans and external waterways. International law governs jurisdiction over vessels on the high seas, as outlined in the Convention on the High Seas and the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention. The United States is a Party to the former and a signatory to the latter. Despite initial objections, the US recognizes that UNCLOS generally confirms existing maritime law and balances the interests of all states. Both conventions affirm that the high seas are open to all states. The law of the sea divides authority among nations to conduct activity in or above the oceans and external waterways. It balances the rights of maritime States to navigate freely with the rights of coastal States to maintain security. The world's waters are divided into national and international waters, each with different rights and obligations for States and their vessels. National waters include internal waters, territorial seas, and other waters under a coastal State's control. A coastal State has complete sovereign control over its internal waters and territorial sea, with the right to stop and search private vessels. The territorial sea extends up to 12 nautical miles beyond the baseline, where foreign vessels have the right of innocent passage. The coastal State has the right to regulate its territorial sea and can enforce regulations to protect resources. Innocent passage by ships is allowed, but not for aircraft, and certain activities like military exercises are considered prejudicial. Submarines must remain on the surface, and vessels can only anchor or participate in rescue missions in case of distress. Cargo, destination, and purpose are not factors in determining innocent passage. Regulations must be necessary and reasonable, implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. The Conventions allow for innocent passage through territorial seas as long as restrictions are necessary and reasonable, implemented non-discriminatorily, and do not deny passage rights. Some States have special measures for warships, which the United States challenges through Freedom of Navigation exercises. Coastal States can also claim contiguous zones and Exclusive Economic Zones beyond the territorial sea. The contiguous zone allows a coastal State to control and enforce laws up to 24 miles from its coast. An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) can extend up to 200 miles for resource exploitation. Beyond the territorial sea, areas are considered high seas for jurisdiction enforcement. Straits overlapped by territorial seas have a special regime for transit passage. The high seas refer to all parts of the sea not included in the territorial sea or exclusive economic zone. Transit passage through straits allows vessels and aircraft of all nations to pass through without delay or using force, with coastal nations able to impose safe navigation requirements. Archipelagic waters are treated similarly to straits. Coastal states cannot suspend transit rights, even for warships of belligerent nations at war with others. The term \"high seas\" refers to parts of the sea not within a state's territorial sea or internal waters. The 1958 Convention prohibits any state from claiming sovereignty over the high seas. All nations' ships have the freedom to navigate, fish, lay pipelines, conduct scientific research, and build artificial islands on the high seas. Jurisdiction over ships on the high seas depends on their nationality and operator. On the high seas, ships are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State whose flag they fly. Warships and government-operated vessels have complete immunity from non-flag States' jurisdiction. Merchant ships have exceptions to exclusive flag State jurisdiction. Ships must sail under one State's flag and cannot change it without a real transfer of ownership. States determine ship nationality, registration, and flag rights. States may maintain \"open registries\" for ships, allowing foreign nationals to register vessels and fly the State's flag as a \"flag of convenience.\" Warships, defined as ships of a State's armed forces, enjoy sovereign immunity and cannot be arrested or searched by other States' warships. Police and port authorities can only board a warship with the Commanding Officer's permission. Warships are exempt from foreign regulations but must adhere to established principles. Warships are exempt from foreign regulations but must comply with international law. They are considered sovereign territory of their country, whether at sea or in a foreign port. Non-compliant warships can be asked to leave territorial waters. The concept of sovereignty expanded to include airspace control with the development of aerospace technologies. Some parts of customary law of the sea have adapted to apply to aircraft, with national and international airspace divisions in Law of the Sea Conventions. National airspace includes above the territorial sea, with no innocent passage right for overflight. The Convention on the High Seas includes airspace above international waters in freedom to navigate, but it's unclear if rights for \"ships\" extend to aircraft. The Chicago Convention recognizes state sovereignty over airspace, including territorial seas. It applies to civil aircraft and places restrictions on state aircraft, requiring authorization for overflight or landing in another state's territory. States must consider the safety of civil aircraft when issuing regulations. The Chicago Convention requires states to consider the safety of civil aircraft when issuing regulations and prohibits the use of civil aviation for purposes inconsistent with the Convention. It allows non-scheduled flights to enter each other's territories without prior permission, subject to possible landing requirements. States can regulate air traffic without nationality-based distinctions but may designate restricted areas for military or public safety reasons without discriminating based on aircraft nationality. Scheduled flight services require permission from the contracting State and must comply with its terms. Pilotless aircraft overflights need special authorization. Aircraft must be registered in one State, display nationality markings, and comply with regulations of the State of registration and overflown territories. Certain documents must be carried on board, and cargo of war implements requires permission to fly over a State's territory. State aircraft under the Chicago Convention are determined by use rather than ownership. Military aircraft, defined as those operated by armed forces and exempt from other States' law enforcement measures, are treated like warships. During peacetime, States enforce law enforcement measures on civil aircraft flying over their territory. Military aircraft crew are immune from territorial jurisdiction for official duties. Foreign officials cannot board state or military aircraft without consent. States can restrict trade and interdict unlawful materials. The law allows coastal States to enforce international prohibitions on the high seas. Jurisdiction over non-flag State vessels depends on their location and activities. Coastal States can interdict ships engaging in illicit activities in certain maritime zones without flag State permission. Warships can pursue foreign ships beyond territorial seas if there are violations of applicable laws. The coastal State can enforce laws on the high seas and interdict ships engaging in illicit activities in certain maritime zones. They may pursue foreign ships beyond territorial seas if violations occur, without discriminating based on nationality or cargo. Criminal jurisdiction on board a foreign ship passing through territorial seas is limited unless the crime affects the coastal State, disturbs peace, or is related to drug trafficking. Warships can only take action against ships of their own nationality or those with ambiguous nationality. Both UNCLOS and the Convention on the High Seas allow States to suppress unlawful activities on the high seas, such as preventing the transport of slaves and cooperating to repress piracy. Piracy is defined as acts of violence, detention, or depredation for private ends in international waters. Mutiny and hijacking do not constitute piracy unless the seized ship is used for piratical acts. Political acts by insurgents are not considered piracy. The Convention on the High Seas allows warships to stop and board foreign merchant vessels under certain circumstances, such as suspicion of piracy, slave trade, or other illicit activities. UNCLOS mandates cooperation in suppressing illicit drug trafficking and unauthorized broadcasting on the high seas, but does not address the transport of weapons of mass destruction. UNCLOS expands on the Convention on the High Seas by adding justifications for warships to stop and board foreign vessels, including suspicion of unauthorized broadcasting and lack of nationality. This allows warships to verify a ship's right to fly its flag and investigate further if suspicion remains. Enforcement Measures. Both UNCLOS and the Convention on the High Seas allow warships to board foreign vessels to verify their flag and investigate further if suspicion remains. If suspicions are confirmed, actions can be taken, such as seizing pirate ships or obtaining permission if the ship enters a foreign territorial sea. The pursuing warship should obtain permission from the State with sovereignty over the area before entering. If communication is not possible, the warship may enter another state's territorial waters but must leave upon request. Similar rules apply to piratical aircraft entering national airspace. UNCLOS allows a State to arrest unauthorized international broadcasters. If suspicions are unfounded, the boarded ship should be compensated for any losses. The Convention on the High Seas and UNCLOS are silent on whether the consent of the flag State is needed for a warship to seize a merchant vessel without nationality. In a specific case, the US Court of Appeals upheld the seizure of an unregistered ship carrying marijuana, stating that stateless vessels must accept the duties of registration for protection on the high seas. The law of the sea does not authorize the seizure of ships on the high seas suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction. Existing agreements and conventions do not directly address this issue. The authorization for interdicting vessels suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction may be negotiated on a bilateral or multilateral basis, potentially by the Security Council. The PSI initiative, involving eleven states, aims to take action in accordance with national and international laws, including UN Security Council resolutions. The PSI initiative, involving eleven states, targets countries or entities engaged in proliferation of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons and related materials. The Bush Administration emphasized coordination of existing export control regimes rather than a major departure from current nonproliferation efforts. The PSI initiative allows member countries to search and seize suspect cargo, including illegal weapons or missile technologies on the high seas. While the law of the sea permits searches on vessels flying their flag or no flag, consent may be required from non-member States. However, States of proliferation concern like North Korea or Iran are unlikely to consent to searches for WMD materials. There is no clear legal authority under international law for a State to seize WMD materials found on board a vessel, even if the flag State is a member of a nonproliferation treaty. PSI States have broad authority to inspect vessels at port facilities but stopping and searching a vessel in territorial seas could impede innocent passage rights. PSI participating States are encouraged to stop and search vessels suspected of carrying WMD-related cargoes and seize such cargoes. The PSI States have the authority to enforce conditions on vessels suspected of carrying WMD-related cargoes, subject to their national legal authorities and international law. Coastal nations may need flag-State consent to intercept and search vessels in territorial seas, unless the passage is non-innocent. During armed conflict, international law transforms, with the law of neutrality outlining the rights and responsibilities of belligerent and neutral States. Neutral States maintain basic rights, but measures involving force to deny aircraft passage or enforce landings for inspections may face objections from other nations. During armed conflict, international law governs the rights and responsibilities of belligerent and neutral States. A neutral State must maintain inviolable territory and impartiality, abstaining from participating in the conflict. Belligerents must respect a neutral's rights but can insist on impartiality. Belligerents are prohibited from using neutral territory for hostilities. The neutral State is responsible for ensuring its territory is not used inconsistently with its neutral status. A neutral State must maintain inviolable territory and impartiality during armed conflict. If a neutral is unable to police its territory, a belligerent may take action to stop misuse, even entering the territorial sea if necessary. A neutral can set conditions for belligent warships passing through its territorial seas, but cannot impede transit through international straits. Belligerents have rights to seize enemy ships, search neutral vessels for contraband, impose naval blockades, and use military force against enemy warships. During armed conflict, belligerent states have the right to seize enemy ships, search neutral vessels for contraband, impose naval blockades, and use military force against enemy warships. This includes the right of visit and search on merchant ships flying the flag of a neutral state for substantial contraband of war. The right of visit and search does not extend into the territorial seas of neutral states or international straits overlapped by neutral territorial seas. During armed conflict, belligerent states have the right to seize enemy ships, search neutral vessels for contraband, impose naval blockades, and use military force against enemy warships. Neutral merchant ships are exempt if traveling in a convoy protected by a neutral warship. Military aircraft also have the right of visit and search, directing suspected vessels to friendly warships or belligerent ports. Naval blockades can be set up to prevent ships from reaching their destination. A belligerent State can establish a blockade to prevent ships from reaching enemy harbors with weapons or goods. The blockade must be declared and enforced effectively and impartially. Neutral ships must avoid the blockaded areas, and attempting to run the blockade can result in capture and condemnation. Blockades must adhere to the U.N. Charter and the law of war, including principles of military necessity and proportionality. Civil aircraft entering a blockaded zone may be required to land for inspection and can be captured if carrying contraband. The concept of a blockade extends to airspace with \"no fly zones\" like those imposed over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rules on the use of force between States differ during war and peace, but the UN Charter emphasizes peaceful conflict resolution and limits war to self-defense. States have sometimes engaged in war-like acts outside of war contexts. The boundary between peace and war has become blurred, leading to the need for a new paradigm to protect States' interests. The right of self-defense in international law allows a State to use force to protect itself from imminent harm, including preemptive measures and response to attacks. The traditional right of States to use force preemptively or in response to an attack is a debated issue, with the UN Charter limiting aggressive force but preserving the right to self-defense. The traditional right of States to use force preemptively or in response to an attack is a debated issue, with the UN Charter limiting aggressive force but preserving the right to self-defense. Some argue that possession of WMD does not constitute an armed attack, and the concept of imminence may need modification in certain circumstances. The threat of an attack with WMD may be distant or inchoate, challenging the traditional doctrine of self-defense. A pacific blockade is a naval action taken in peacetime to pressure another nation by preventing ships from entering or leaving specified areas of its coast. The blockading State can only detain ships and must return them when the blockade is lifted. The pacific blockade is effective only against vessels of the blockaded State, not those of a third State. Some scholars view it as lawful only as a reprisal for an unlawful act by the target State. The legitimacy of reprisals depends on obtaining remedy for injury from illegal action, failed non-coercive methods, and proportionality. The 1962 \"quarantine\" of Cuba for procuring missiles from the Soviet Union did not follow the traditional blockade model. The 1962 \"quarantine\" of Cuba by the United States, in response to missiles from the Soviet Union, was a unique strategy that avoided war without invoking self-defense rights under international law. The term \"quarantine\" was used to imply restrictions on third-party vessels without declaring war, but this approach did not establish a new concept in international law. The international community accepted this strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis as a valid adaptation of existing laws to new circumstances. Some theorists argue that the U.N. Charter may allow the use of force to prevent adversaries from obtaining weapons of mass destruction. Most scholars interpret the U.N. Charter as prohibiting the use of force against another State, except when authorized by the Security Council or for self-defense. An alternate view interprets the prohibition on the use of force narrowly to only prohibit certain kinds of armed attacks. The legitimacy of a preventive attack against WMD or their components would rest on an interpretation of whether their destruction comports with the \"purpose of the United Nations.\" Some argue that eliminating WMD in the hands of a perceived unstable State could enhance international peace and security, justifying an otherwise unlawful attack. Israel's 1981 aerial bombardment of an Iraqi nuclear facility was viewed by some as justifiable under international law and the U.N. Charter. Some argue that the role of the Security Council under the U.N. Charter contradicts a narrow interpretation of the prohibition against the use of force, as States' practice since 1945 has shown voluntary compliance with non-proliferation regimes to be ineffective in curbing proliferant States and non-State actors seeking WMD. Proponents advocate for a paradigm shift in international relations, allowing States to use preventive or preemptive force against non-State actors seeking WMD. They argue that non-proliferation has become a customary norm, justifying self-help measures to eliminate WMD acquisition programs. Under the view that non-proliferation has become a customary norm in international law, States are obligated to refrain from developing or acquiring WMD. Participation in non-proliferation regimes is seen as mandatory and enforceable, with evidence suggesting near universal support for these regimes. The argument is made that international law supports initiatives like the PSI, citing statements by the President of the U.N. Security Council. The Bush Administration cited a statement by the President of the U.N. Security Council in 1992, emphasizing the threat posed by the proliferation of WMD to international peace and security. The Council reaffirmed the importance of disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation in maintaining peace, expressing commitment to enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations in these areas. Member States were urged to fulfill their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council emphasizes the importance of disarmament, preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and resolving conflicts peacefully. They commit to preventing the spread of technology related to such weapons and note the significance of countries adhering to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Security Council stresses the importance of disarmament, preventing weapons proliferation, and resolving conflicts peacefully. They emphasize adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, effective IAEA safeguards, and support for a universal convention on chemical weapons. They also note the significance of a UN register of arms transfers and the need for all states to provide required information. The Bush Administration highlights international coalitions' support for disarmament efforts. In June 2002, the G8 Leaders announced the \"G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction\" in response to the threat of terrorist groups obtaining WMD. The European Union published principles in 2003 emphasizing the need for a broad approach to address the global threat of WMD, including political and diplomatic measures as the first line of defense, with coercive measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter as a last resort. The UN Security Council should play a central role in addressing the global threat of WMD. The Proliferation Security Initiative may also contribute to the progression of international law in this area. However, these developments may not prove that nonproliferation has become an absolute norm. The statement by the UN Security Council calls for adherence to treaty commitments and cooperation in arms control negotiations. The UN Security Council emphasizes treaty commitments and cooperation in arms control negotiations, but nonproliferation may not be an absolute norm. While chemical and biological WMDs are more likely considered customary international law, nuclear weapons are not universally banned under the NPT. Five States are allowed to stockpile nuclear weapons, with discretion on criminalizing possession by sub-national groups. The inconsistency in criminalizing possession of nuclear weapons by sub-national groups under national laws of member States weakens the argument that State possession of nuclear weapons is a juscogens violation. Non-proliferation regimes are seen as more of a security pact, where weaker nations forego WMD programs for security promised by great powers. The Cold War's mutual deterrence no longer applies, leading non-nuclear States to reconsider their security needs and the strategic value of possessing nuclear weapons. The strategic value of possessing nuclear weapons may outweigh the benefits of remaining party to the NPT. Adherents of the \"broad\" interpretation of the U.N. Charter view preemptive use of military force against WMD facilities as legitimate only when authorized by the Security Council. The Security Council has primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, tailoring enforcement regimes against entities posing a threat. The Security Council has various options for addressing identified threats, including economic sanctions, interdiction of weapons, and military force through member States. It can authorize coalitions or organizations like NATO for enforcement. Nine \"yes\" votes from the Council are required, with no veto from permanent members. States have the right to interdict vessels and aircraft in limited circumstances. The legal authority for PSI nations to halt shipments of dangerous technologies to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern appears doubtful under current international law. Options include amending treaties to include WMD and missile trade prohibitions, enhancing compliance with proliferation treaties, and obtaining explicit authorization from the U.N. Security Council for interdicting WMD materials. The PSI nations are committed to interdiction principles to impede shipments of WMD and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. They urge all states to undertake effective measures for interdicting such transfers. The PSI nations are committed to interdiction principles to impede shipments of WMD and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. They should engage in interdiction activities to prevent the development, acquisition, or transfer of WMD and associated delivery systems. Streamlined procedures for rapid information exchange, dedicated resources for interdiction operations, and coordination among participants are essential. Strengthening national legal authorities and international frameworks to support these commitments is crucial. Take specific actions to support these efforts. The PSI nations are committed to interdiction principles to impede shipments of WMD and related materials. They should engage in activities to prevent the development, acquisition, or transfer of WMD. Strengthening national legal authorities and international frameworks is crucial. Specific actions include not transporting such cargoes and boarding vessels suspected of transporting them. The PSI nations are committed to interdiction principles to impede shipments of WMD and related materials. They should engage in activities to prevent the development, acquisition, or transfer of WMD. Strengthening national legal authorities and international frameworks is crucial. Specific actions include stopping and searching vessels suspected of carrying WMD-related cargoes and seizing them when identified. This may also involve enforcing conditions on vessels entering or leaving ports, requiring boarding, search, and seizure of suspicious cargoes. Additionally, they may consider allowing other states to board and search their flag vessels for WMD-related cargoes under certain circumstances. The PSI nations are committed to interdiction principles to impede shipments of WMD and related materials. They may require aircraft suspected of carrying such cargoes to land for inspection and seize them, or deny transit rights through their airspace. They can also inspect and seize cargoes at ports, airfields, or other facilities used as transshipment points for such cargoes."
