SAIL is shown to be as efficient as standard AIL and outperforms baseline methods on various control tasks. AIL algorithms learn robust policies by imitating expert actions from a few expert trajectories through adversarial training and reinforcement learning. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) and Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) use adversarial training to learn reward functions and robust policies. AIL addresses distributional drift from behavioral cloning and shows good performance with few expert demonstrations. Challenges include implicit reward bias and potential training instability. In this paper, a principled approach is proposed to address reward bias, training instability, and sample inefficiency in imitation learning. Support-guided adversarial imitation learning combines support estimation and adversarial reward signals to improve policy performance. The method sidesteps training instability associated with adversarial training and can learn from expert demonstrations. Support-guided Adversarial Imitation Learning (SAIL) combines support estimation and adversarial reward signals to improve policy performance in imitation learning. It addresses reward bias, training instability, and sample inefficiency, showing efficiency comparable to standard AIL algorithms like GAIL and AIRL. SAIL demonstrates better performance and training stability in benchmark control tasks, mitigating implicit reward bias. Behavioral Cloning (BC) learns a policy directly from expert trajectories via supervised learning, but is prone to distributional drift. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) estimates a reward from expert demonstrations followed by RL. In contrast to Behavioral Cloning, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) estimates rewards from expert demonstrations and applies RL using the estimated reward. Adversarial IRL, like Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), matches distributions between the expert and RL agent to imitate expert behavior efficiently. GAIL achieves expert performance with few expert trajectories but is sample inefficient. Recent works have addressed the sample inefficiency and stability issues of GAIL by using alternative methods such as non-parametric estimators, model-based RL algorithms, and off-policy RL algorithms. Generative Predecessor Models for Imitation Learning also imitates expert policies using generative models. The proposed method is related to AIL algorithms like GAIL and adversarial IRL, focusing on improving reward quality by constraining it to the estimated support of the expert policy. Wang et al. (2019) demonstrate using a fixed RL reward by estimating the support of the expert policy, introducing Random Expert Distillation (RED) to learn a reward function based on support estimation. Random Expert Distillation (RED) learns a reward function based on support estimation by minimizing a specific equation. It sidesteps adversarial learning and treats imitation learning as a standard RL task. However, its performance suffers in the challenging setting of sparse expert data. The task involves learning a reward function from a finite set of trajectories sampled from the expert policy within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this section, Support-guided Adversarial Learning (SAIL) is introduced as a method to achieve good performance in reinforcement learning by learning a policy based on a reward function. A clear advantage of Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is its low sample complexity with respect to expert data, requiring as little as 200 state-action tuples for imitation. The adversarial reward serves as an effective exploration mechanism for the RL agent, as shown in the theoretical analysis comparing SAIL with existing methods like GAIL. The adversarial reward in AIL incentivizes the RL agent towards under-visited state-actions, away from over-visited ones. It continuously drives exploration by evolving the reward landscape, but may suffer from survival bias. The authors address survival bias in tasks where the agent learns to move around the goal to accumulate rewards. They introduce absorbing states but require extra RL signals, including access to the time limit. Empirical evidence on Lunar Lander shows agents trained with GAIL hover over the goal. Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated training instability with AIL due to unreliable adversarial rewards in sparse expert data regions. The authors propose a novel reward function, combining adversarial and support guidance rewards to address challenges in training. SAIL leverages exploration mechanisms and constrains the agent to the expert policy's estimated support. Support guidance offers strong reward shaping, with parameters and learning rate specified for implementation. SAIL addresses survival bias in goal-oriented tasks by encouraging the agent to stop at the goal and complete the task. The method assigns higher rewards for completing the task and corrects bias by constraining the RL agent to the expert policy's estimated support. SAIL encourages the agent to explore state-actions within the expert policy's support, improving training stability on Mujoco benchmark tasks. The algorithm computes rewards based on the expert policy's support and updates the policy using TRPO. Constraining the range of the adversarial reward leads to lower-variance policies, with variants SAIL-b and SAIL. In this section, we compare SAIL to GAIL in terms of sample efficiency and RL signals on the expert policy's support. Both GAIL and SAIL converge to the expert policy's support in the asymptotic setting, ensuring successful imitation learning. This analysis can be applied to other AIL methods, showcasing the broad applicability of the approach. The text discusses the importance of characterizing the rates of convergence of SAIL and GAIL in imitation learning. It focuses on the sample complexity with respect to the number of expert demonstrations and the learning rates of the two methods. The goal is to leverage faster learning rates for support estimation. Currently, there are no results available to characterize the sample complexity of GAIL, so the focus is on relative learning rates. Proposition 1 compares the learning rates of RED, GAIL, and SAIL in estimating support. SAIL is shown to be at least as efficient as GAIL in sample complexity for expert data. Proposition 2 discusses the event probability for support estimation in SAIL. The analysis compares SAIL to GAIL in estimating support efficiently for expert data. It explains why combining r red + r gail is less effective and discusses the assumptions in practice. In comparison to GAIL, SAIL efficiently estimates support for expert data. Combining r red + r gail is less effective due to different assumptions in practice. The proposed method is evaluated against BC, GAIL, and RED on various control tasks. Learning rates for distribution matching with GANs are still an active research area. SAIL variants mitigate survival bias in Lunar Lander from OpenAI Gym by providing natural RL signal to avoid crashing. They outperform GAIL variants in average reward and have lower standard deviation. Performance results are presented in Table 1. In a no-terminal environment, all early termination features are disabled, removing RL signals. SAIL variants outperform GAIL variants by recovering the expert policy. The shaping effect from support guidance is visualized by plotting the average learned reward for different algorithms at goal states. SAIL-b assigns higher rewards to \"no op\" compared to other algorithms, aiding in agent learning. GAIL and RED also favor \"no op\" but with smaller reward differences, leading to less consistent landing behaviors. AIL methods oscillate between hovering and landing behaviors, indicating partial survival bias mitigation. SAIL's non-negative reward may limit full survival bias addressing, despite support estimation benefits. In experiments comparing SAIL against GAIL, RED, and BC on various Mujoco control tasks, sub-sampling expert trajectories every 20 samples presented a more challenging setting. BC was competitive with AIL when full trajectories were used. The results showed varying performance metrics for different algorithms on different tasks. Table 2 presents the episodic reward and standard deviation of different methods on Mujoco tasks over 50 runs. SAIL-b demonstrates the best performance with lower standard deviation, indicating robust learned policies. The experiment setup details are available in the appendix, with each algorithm tested using 5 random seeds. Performance comparison between algorithms is shown, with mean performance and standard deviation reported over 50 evaluation runs. The results of over 50 evaluation runs show that SAIL-b performs comparably to GAIL on Hopper and outperforms other methods on all tasks. SAIL-b achieves lower standard deviation, indicating robust learned policies, especially for Humanoid. Standard deviation is crucial for assessing policy robustness, as seen in occasional crashes in Humanoid. The histogram of 50 evaluations in Humanoid for RED, GAIL-b, and SAIL-b shows that SAIL-b performs consistently with expert performance. GAIL-b is slightly worse on average due to occasional crashes, while RED performs the worst but with no failure modes detected. SAIL-b produces policies with smaller standard deviations and better performances, likely due to equal contribution from support guidance and adversarial learning. Comparing SAIL against SAIL-b, the bounded variant generally performs better, especially for Ant and Humanoid. In the evaluation of different algorithms, SAIL-b shows improved performance compared to GAIL in various tasks like Reacher, Ant, and Humanoid. The results suggest that limiting the range of the adversarial reward could enhance performance. SAIL-b is more sample efficient and stable in tasks like Reacher, Ant, and Humanoid, and remains competitive in other tasks as well. This indicates that SAIL-b is at least as efficient as GAIL even when expert data is limited. In Reacher, Ant, and Humanoid tasks, SAIL-b outperforms GAIL with support guidance, showing better performance and training stability. GAIL struggles to imitate the expert in Ant and is sensitive to initial conditions, converging to sub-optimal policies in some cases. Support-guided Adversarial Imitation Learning combines support guidance with adversarial imitation learning to address challenges and utilize expert demonstrations effectively. Our results demonstrate that expert demonstrations are valuable for imitation learning. Combining reinforcement learning signals from expert demonstrations can lead to more efficient and stable algorithms. Using RND for support estimation, we set hyperparameters based on previous studies for fair comparisons. Our method shows promise for future research in imitation learning. The results show that introducing a virtual absorbing state (AS) improves performance in GAIL and SAIL, reducing survival bias significantly. Combining AS with support guidance yields the best performance with low standard deviations. The results indicate that introducing a virtual absorbing state (AS) and support guidance partially mitigate reward bias, showing improved performance with low standard deviations. Further exploration of this issue is planned for future work."
