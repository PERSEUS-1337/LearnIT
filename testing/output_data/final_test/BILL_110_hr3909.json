    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Airlift Requirements Act\" and includes a report on the size and mix of the Air Force intertheater airlift force. The Secretary of Defense is required to conduct a study on alternatives for the Air Force intertheater airlift force, focusing on the capabilities and costs of the C-5 and C-17 aircraft fleets. A federally funded research and development center will be selected to conduct the study, with a methodology to be developed within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The federally funded research and development center chosen for the study will develop and submit the methodology to the Comptroller General for review. The Comptroller General will then review the methodology within 30 days to identify any flaws or weaknesses and provide a report to the research center. The Comptroller General reviews the methodology for flaws and weaknesses, providing recommendations for improvements. The research center must modify the methodology within 30 days based on the Comptroller General's report. The federally funded research center must improve its methodology based on recommendations from the Comptroller General and submit a report to the congressional defense committees describing any modifications made. If the center does not follow a specific recommendation, it must provide a detailed explanation. The study will utilize previous Mobility Capabilities Studies and ongoing Intratheater Airlift Fleet Mix Analysis, along with other relevant studies. It will also consider results from the modified C-5A aircraft configuration. The study will address the current state of the intertheater airlift fleet. The study will assess the state of the Air Force's intertheater airlift fleet, including the impact of heavy airlift aircraft usage in recent operations, the adequacy of the current airlift force, and the optimal mix of C-5 and C-17 aircraft for future missions. The study will assess the appropriate mix of C-5 and C-17 aircraft for intratheater airlift missions, comparing the cost advantages of modernizing the C-5 fleet versus procuring new C-17 aircraft. It will also evaluate the military capabilities of both aircraft, including flight hours, cargo/passenger capacities, and mission capable rates. The military capability study for the C-5 aircraft will assess mission capable rates after completion of Avionics Modernization Program and Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program, including partially successful completion scenarios. The military capability study for the C-5 aircraft will assess mission capable rates after completion of Avionics Modernization Program and Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program, including partially successful completion scenarios. The study will also evaluate the tactical capabilities of strategic airlift aircraft, potential increase in use for tactical missions, value of having multiple aircraft types in the fleet, and the need for a larger replacement aircraft for the C-5. The Air Force's ability to restart C-5 production line after closure will be examined. The production line for the C-5 aircraft was closed for several years, and steps are being taken to ensure it can be restarted if needed. This includes analyzing the costs of closing and reopening the C-5 line, as well as assessing the costs for the C-17 line. The financial effects of retiring, upgrading, or maintaining the C-5A fleet on procurement decisions for the C-17 aircraft are also being considered. Additionally, the impact of increasing the role of strategic airlift aircraft in intratheater operations on the target number for strategic airlift aircraft is being evaluated. The current target number for strategic airlift aircraft is 301 airframes, with a focus on the appropriateness and efficacy of using C-5 and C-17 aircraft for intratheater missions. The analysis also considers the interplay of existing intratheater airlift aircraft like the C-130 and future Joint Cargo Aircraft with the increasing role of C-5 and C-17 aircraft. Additionally, it examines the most appropriate missions for C-5 and C-17 aircraft in intratheater operations and the potential for increased requirements in these areas. The study considers the appropriateness of using C-5 and C-17 aircraft for intratheater missions, as well as the potential need for increased production or longevity of these aircraft. It also evaluates whether replacing C-5 aircraft with C-17 aircraft will maintain a comparable strategic airlift capability. The study evaluates assets other than C-5 and C-17 aircraft for intratheater and intertheater airlift, potentially reducing the need for these aircraft. The federally funded research center will collaborate with the United States Transportation Command to conduct the study and submit a report to the Secretary of Defense and congressional defense committees by February 4, 2009. The Comptroller General will review and submit a report on the study conducted under subsection (a) within 90 days. The report will include an analysis of the study and an assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on the study to the congressional defense committees by a specified date in 2009. The report on the study required by subsection (a) will include a comprehensive discussion of findings, focusing on lift requirements and operating profiles for intertheater airlift aircraft to meet the National Military Strategy, with assumptions about current and future military missions, force structure growth of the Army and Marine Corps, and potential changes in lift requirements. Future Combat Systems by the Army include new capabilities in strategic airlift with the KC(X) aircraft, heavy lift aircraft utilization in intratheater combat missions, Civil Reserve Air Fleet assets application in military scenarios, air mobility requirements for the Global Rebasing Initiative, and support for peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The report will include potential changes in lift requirements based on equipment procured for Iraq and Afghanistan, assumptions regarding aircraft performances and loading factors, data and assumptions for program life cycle cost estimates, and a comparison of cost and risk between optimal mix airlift fleet and program of record airlift fleet. It will be submitted in unclassified form, with the possibility of a classified annex."
