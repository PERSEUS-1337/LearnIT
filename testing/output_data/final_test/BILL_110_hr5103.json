The majority of rubber used in the United States is synthetic rubber derived from petroleum. The tire industry is the largest consumer of rubber, using over 3 billion pounds annually to produce 250 million tires. Recycled rubber from scrap tires can be used in new tires if the particle size is fine and free from impurities. Incorporating 10 percent recycled rubber in tires can save a gallon of oil per tire produced. Using recycled rubber instead of synthetic rubber can prevent the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Air permeability in tires can be reduced by up to 50% with recycled content, potentially saving up to 750 million gallons of fuel per year if used in all passenger cars in the United States. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR PURCHASES BY VEHICLE FLEET OPERATORS OF TIRES MADE FROM RECYCLED RUBBER. This section introduces a new tax credit for vehicle fleet operators who purchase tires made from recycled rubber. The recycled rubber tire credit allows eligible taxpayers to receive $3 for each qualified tire purchased for highway motor vehicles used in their business. The credit is subject to dollar limitations based on the taxable year. The tax credit allows eligible taxpayers to carry over unused limitations to the next taxable year, with an aggregate limit of $100,000,000. The tax credit allows eligible taxpayers who regularly use more than 100 vehicles in any trade or business to receive a credit for purchasing qualified new or retread tires with recycled rubber powder. The tax credit allows eligible taxpayers who regularly use more than 100 vehicles in any trade or business to receive a credit for purchasing qualified new or retread tires with recycled rubber powder. A retread tire is defined as a tire used on highway motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of at least 2,600 pounds, retreaded in the United States, with the original use beginning with the taxpayer, and containing a certain percentage of recycled rubber powder. The percentage of recycled rubber powder in retread tires purchased during the first five years after the enactment of this section increases from 8% in the first year to 14% in the fifth year. The term 'recycled rubber powder' refers to recycled vulcanizate particulate rubber at a size classification of 80 mesh or finer. Controlled groups are treated as one person for tax purposes, with the dollar limitation allocated based on purchases of qualified tires. The basis of a tire is reduced by the amount of credit allowed. This section applies to tires purchased within a 5-year period after the enactment date. The tax code is amended to include a recycled rubber tire credit for eligible taxpayers. The credit is determined under section 45O(a) and applies to tires purchased within a 5-year period after the enactment date. The tax code is amended to include a recycled rubber tire credit for eligible taxpayers, determined under section 45O(a) for tires purchased within a 5-year period after the enactment date.

The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is updated to reflect this new item.
