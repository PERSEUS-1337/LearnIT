The Congress acknowledges the historic Apollo 11 mission, where Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins became the first humans to land on the Moon. This achievement honored the fallen Apollo 1 astronauts and marked a significant engineering, scientific, and political milestone for the United States. The Apollo 11 mission achieved President Kennedy's goal of landing on the Moon in the 1960s, showcasing US strength during the Cold War and securing leadership in space for future generations. NASA developed the powerful Saturn V rocket for the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s, completing 8 missions and landing 12 men on the Moon. The missions returned with groundbreaking scientific data and over 800 pounds of lunar samples, involving an estimated 400,000 Americans in the successful program. The Apollo program, which led to the lunar landing on July 20, 1969, involved NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, industry contractors, and political leadership. It inspired generations of students to pursue careers in STEM fields, fueling innovation and economic growth. The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing will be celebrated on July 20, 2019. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing. The coins will have specific weights, diameters, and metal compositions as outlined in the Act. The Act authorizes the minting of dollar coins weighing 11.34 grams and struck on a planchet with a diameter of 1.205 inches, following specifications for half-dollar coins. Additionally, up to 100,000 proof silver $1 coins weighing 5 ounces and containing .999 fine silver can be minted. These coins are legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins minted under this Act will have a convex shape similar to the 2014 National Baseball Hall of Fame 75th Anniversary Commemorative Coin, with the reverse being convex and the obverse concave. Congress suggests that the design should extend from the reverse to the obverse without significantly increasing the purchase price.

Each coin will feature a denomination, the year \"2019\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The Secretary will hold a competition to determine the design of the common obverse. The Secretary will hold a compensated competition to determine the design of the common obverse of the coins minted under this Act, emblematic of the US space program leading up to the first manned Moon landing. Proposals may be submitted by artists, engravers, and the public, with designs anonymized until a final selection is made. Compensation will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will determine compensation for the winning design of the common reverse of the coins, which will feature a close-up of the famous \"Buzz Aldrin on the Moon\" photograph showing the visor and part of the helmet reflecting the image of the United States flag, astronaut Neil Armstrong, and the lunar lander. Compensation shall not be less than $5,000. Coins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, except for coins described under section 3(a)(4). The Secretary may only issue these coins during a 1-year period starting on January 1, 2019. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price including the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All sales of coins minted under this Act include surcharges: $35 for the $5 coin, $10 for the $1 coin, $5 for the half-dollar coin, and $50 for another $1 coin. Surcharges received will be paid to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum for exhibit-related costs.

A portion of the proceeds will also be allocated to the Astronauts Memorial Foundation and the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation for various educational initiatives and scholarships in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Recipients will be subject to audit requirements. The Act limits the surcharge on coin issuance to prevent exceeding the annual commemorative coin program limit. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide guidance for this limitation. SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES: The Secretary must ensure that minting coins under this Act does not cost the government, and no funds are disbursed until all costs are recovered. SEC. 9. BUDGET COMPLIANCE. SEC. 9. BUDGET COMPLIANCE: The budgetary effects of this Act must comply with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, as determined by the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee before the vote on passage."
