    "content": "The majority of Latin American and Caribbean countries face institutional weaknesses and widespread public corruption, leading to protests and calls for greater transparency. From a U.S. perspective, corruption in the region poses a threat to security, fuels violent crime, and drives migration. U.S. anti-corruption strategies initially aimed to prevent bribery by corporations, later expanding to promote fair and transparent systems in developing countries. The report focuses on how corruption impacts public funds, distorts elections, and supports criminal networks. It examines U.S. efforts to combat corruption in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America, with recommendations for Congress on overseeing anti-corruption programs. Recent scandals, like the Odebrecht case, have made corruption a major concern in Latin America, affecting U.S. policy. Chronic corruption in Latin America has led to public distrust in politics, with some viewing bribery as a norm. Recent scandals involving high-level officials have further eroded trust in political parties. Despite this, 2018 saw anti-corruption candidates winning elections in the region. In 2018, anti-corruption candidates and campaigns won elections in Latin America, with populist and anti-establishment fervor marking campaigns in Mexico, Brazil, and other countries. Leading candidates abandoned traditional parties tainted by corruption allegations, embracing anti-establishment platforms that appealed to voter disillusionment with corrupt elites. Transparency International found that a majority of Latin Americans believe public corruption is pervasive and expanding. The sense of widespread corruption in Latin America is sparking anti-corruption activism, with civil society pushing for institutional reforms to enhance transparency and accountability in the public sector. This wave of anti-corruption campaigns may prove more enduring than past demonstrations, as organizations aim to combat corrupt behavior and demand accountability. In Latin America, Transparency International (TI) identified politicians, political parties, and police as the most corrupt sectors. The most common offenses included graft, influence peddling, extortion, bribe solicitation, money laundering, and political finance violations. Around one-third of respondents admitted to paying a bribe for basic public services like healthcare or education. Corruption levels vary across the region according to the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index. The Rule of Law Index by the World Justice Project shows varying levels of corruption in Latin America, with Chile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay ranking highest, and Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, and Venezuela ranking lowest. Peru, Venezuela, Mexico, and Bolivia were identified as the worst in terms of bribery, improper influence, and misappropriation of funds. Anti-corruption efforts may take years to show results in the region. Some commentators argue that lower-level corruption is simpler to identify and root out, while more widespread and higher levels of corruption are more difficult to contain. Compromised justice systems in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru result in impunity for powerful defendants, inhibiting successful prosecutions and diminishing belief in democratic legitimacy and the rule of law. Confidence in fairness is replaced with mistrust due to routine bribes by police and political kickback schemes. In the Western Hemisphere, populist leaders like Daniel Ortega and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro undermine democratic institutions by suborning court officials and judges. In Peru, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in 2018 over Odebrecht bribery allegations. Mexico, Brazil, and El Salvador saw successful anti-corruption campaigns against traditional parties in recent elections. Mexico's PRI party faced corruption allegations and performed poorly in 2018 elections. The prevalence of corruption in political parties can erode trust in democratic institutions and lead to significant economic costs. Efforts to combat corruption face political opposition and challenges in maintaining transparency. In countries like Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, the costs of corruption can be as high as 10% of GDP. Corruption in Latin America and the Caribbean is estimated to be as high as 5-10% of GDP, exacerbating inequality and instability. There is a growing anti-corruption activism in the region, with concerns about lasting reform and resistance to a culture of impunity. Foreign competitors like China and Russia are using investments in infrastructure and energy projects to further their own economic interests, potentially leading to hidden costs. U.S. programs aim to strengthen the rule of law and increase governmental transparency in Latin America and the Caribbean to support sustained economic development. Anti-corruption efforts have been ongoing in the region for about three decades, stemming from the exposure of bribery practices in the 1970s. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was enacted in 1977 to prevent U.S. corporate bribery of foreign officials. In 1996, the Organization of American States (OAS) adopted the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC), the world's first anti-corruption treaty. The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC) addresses corruption, international cooperation, and asset recovery among OAS member states. Implementation of the treaty is voluntary and relies on political will, with few high-level officials being held accountable for corruption. The Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, supported by the United States and binding only on OECD member nations, had a significant impact in Latin America. Despite initially only Mexico and Chile being OECD members, other countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Costa Rica adopted anti-corruption measures to align with international conventions. These measures allowed for the assessment of culpability in cases of corporate crime, such as bribery of officials, and encouraged corruption prevention. The \"safe harbor\" defense for companies encourages prevention of corruption by providing a motive to reform practices through internal safeguards and monitoring. Businesses can avoid criminal liability by implementing policies to prevent bribery, such as appointing an officer to monitor operations for corruption. This policy rewards self-monitoring and prevention efforts. The OAS has convened the Summit of the Americas since the early 1990s to address common agenda items in the Western Hemisphere, with initiatives supported by Presidents Obama and Bush to increase transparency and accountability in governance. The Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru in April 2018 focused on \"Democratic Governance against Corruption,\" with Vice President Pence attending. The U.S. has increased enforcement of the FCPA to combat public corruption and expand extraterritorial jurisdiction. Other countries like India, Thailand, and France are considering similar anti-bribery laws. The FBI opened an international corruption unit in Miami in February 2019. Corruption in Miami, Florida in February 2019 focused on violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Anti-corruption has gained international prominence due to domestic pressure, business risks, and the impact on economic development. U.S. advocacy has influenced global efforts to combat corruption, with varying approaches by country. International standards can guide domestic reform and mobilize pressure for anti-corruption policies, especially in natural resource exploitation. One key area for accountability is natural resource exploitation. Many countries with valuable resources have implemented transparency measures to prevent corruption and ensure revenue benefits public purposes. Legal reforms and citizen participation in decision-making are crucial in regulating extractive industries, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean. Global anti-corruption efforts play a significant role in combating corruption in natural resource sectors. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and global anti-corruption efforts have been important in combating corruption in Latin America. In 2018, corruption prosecutions increased significantly, leading to the emergence of anti-corruption candidates and campaigns during elections. Brazil's Lavo Jato investigation implicated many politicians, including Odebrecht, a multinational construction firm. In a landmark plea agreement, Odebrecht admitted to paying millions in bribes throughout Latin America to secure public contracts. The fallout extended to countries like Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Peru. Successful prosecution of cases connected to the plea deal received support from the U.S. Department of Justice. Transparency International endorsed a comprehensive package of reforms in Brazil to restore legitimacy to its political institutions. The anti-corruption package in Brazil includes proposals for institutional reforms, draft bills, and constitutional amendments to control corruption. Minister of Justice S\u00e9rgio Moro presented some of these proposals to the Brazilian Congress in February 2019. Former President Michel Temer was arrested in March 2019 on charges of bribery and money laundering, with allegations of taking over $2 million from Odebrecht during his vice presidency in 2014. Former high-level government officials in Brazil, including A\u00e9cio Neves and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, are facing investigations for taking bribes from Odebrecht. In Venezuela, an authoritarian government has led to an exodus of desperate Venezuelans, with over 120 high-level officials identified for criminal activity. In Venezuela, Odebrecht provided bribes to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his government, with conflicting reports on the amount paid. Ecuador's vice president, Jorge Gl\u00e1s, was convicted of taking bribes from Odebrecht and is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence. Former President Correa, who resides in Europe, is also linked to the scandal. Former President Correa, currently residing in Europe with his Belgian wife, is wanted by President Len\u00edn Moreno's government for arranging a kidnapping of an Ecuadorian official in 2012. Charges against Correa include economic mismanagement and ties to Odebrecht. In Colombia, high-level corruption networks were exposed in 2018, leading to the sentencing of top anti-corruption official Luis Gustavo Moreno for corruption. The investigation revealed a network of bribery involving high court justices and influential defendants. Attorney General N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez was linked to Odebrecht bribes while serving as legal counsel to the Aval Group. In May 2019, N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez resigned as legal counsel to the Aval Group due to his connection to Odebrecht bribes. Odebrecht executives admitted to providing $32.5 million in bribes for Colombia's infrastructure projects. The scandal implicated Colombian officials from previous administrations, including President Juan Manuel Santos and President \u00c1lvaro Uribe. Senator cooperation in the prosecution exposed the bribery scheme, leading to a popular anti-corruption movement spearheaded by former governor Sergio Fajardo. In Peru, the Odebrecht scandal has led to investigations of several high-profile political figures, including four former presidents. President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in 2018 to avoid impeachment and is now under investigation for alleged vote-buying and ties to bribery. Former president Ollanta Humala and his wife are also under investigation for money laundering and corruption charges. Peru's government seeks to extradite former president Alejandro Toledo for bribery charges. Alan Garcia died after shooting himself during arrest on Odebrecht-related charges. Keiko Fujimori was ordered to pretrial detention for laundering illegal campaign contributions. President Vizcarra increased funding to combat corruption. Andean nations held referenda on anti-corruption measures. In 2018, voters in Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru considered anti-corruption measures in public referenda. Ecuador approved all seven measures, Colombia's referendum was disqualified for not meeting voter threshold requirements, and Peru's President Vizcarra committed to tackling corruption after taking office. Mart\u00edn Vizcarra became president of Peru in March 2018 after Kuczynski resigned. He led a referendum on December 10, 2018, resulting in a ban on congressional reelection, judiciary reforms, and political party finance regulations. Guatemala and Honduras faced challenges with anti-corruption institutions due to government opposition when investigations implicated officials. In early January 2019, President Morales abruptly ended CICIG's mandate, disregarding the nation's top court and sparking a constitutional standoff. The Honduran government has also tried to undermine a similar anti-corruption organization, MACCIH. In the Dominican Republic, indictments were issued for 14 people, including a cabinet minister and two senators, for receiving bribes from Odebrecht. In the Dominican Republic, indictments were issued for 14 people, including a cabinet minister and two senators, for receiving bribes from Odebrecht. The investigation is ongoing, with no prison sentences yet. Charges were dropped against seven defendants in June 2018. Other prominent figures involved in the scandal include a senator and former public works minister from the dominant Dominican Liberation Party, potentially affecting the party's image before the 2020 national elections. Former first lady Ana Ligia de Saca reached a plea deal in April 2019 to avoid prison for laundering $25 million in public money in Panama. High-profile politicians in Panama, including former President Ricardo Martinelli, have faced charges related to illicit financial gains, such as receiving bribes from Odebrecht. Martinelli's sons were also arrested in the United States for illegal actions, including taking Odebrecht bribes. In Mexico, President L\u00f3pez Obrador campaigned against corruption and vowed to tackle corrupt elites. The Attorney General plans to prioritize the Odebrecht case, involving bribery to fund electoral campaigns. Cases against Mexican officials from the previous administration may need to be re-launched. Following the end of PRI President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's term in late 2018, the party is considering changing its name due to poor election results. Several former PRI governors, including Javier Duarte and Roberto Borge, are under investigation or in jail for corruption charges. Former PRI governors, including Javier Duarte and Roberto Borge, are under investigation or in jail for corruption charges. In Argentina, a scandal known as \"the Notebooks\" emerged in 2018, involving cash payments to former Presidents N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Santiago Narra, former head of FEPADE, alleges widespread corruption in the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration, with governors using intimidation and bribery to silence dissent. The residence of Presidents N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in Argentina was allegedly involved in a bribery scheme for public works contracts between 2008 and 2015, totaling $160 million. In August 2018, 12 former government officials and business executives were arrested on corruption charges. Fernandez de Kirchner has immunity as a senator but can still be prosecuted. Other investigations involve Julio de Vido and Daniel Cameron for receiving bribes for road construction tenders and other projects. In Santa Cruz, road construction tenders and other projects were allegedly involved in bribery schemes. Energy Minister Cameron was implicated in a gas pipeline expansion project with a Brazilian construction firm. Former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner faces bribery charges for allegedly taking $69 million in bribes. Paraguay has a history of corruption stemming from a military dictatorship that lasted until 2008. President Mario Benito Abdo Ben\u00edtez, elected in 2018, vowed to combat nepotism and promote transparency. A grassroots protest movement called \"escraches\" has led to the resignation of prominent politicians across the political spectrum in an effort to reduce impunity in the country's weak judicial institutions. Protesters have taken up long-unaddressed cases and pushed for prosecutions, but critics question the ethics of targeting officials' homes with protests and violence. On April 24, 2019, Paraguay's Comptroller General resigned ahead of his impeachment vote on corruption charges, supported by President Abdo Ben\u00edtez. Weak national institutions hinder investment, with Latin American economies ranking low in institutional performance. Brazil is praised for using its judiciary to combat corruption, while El Salvador struggles with low foreign investment due to insecurity. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central America has been hindered by extensive insecurity and corruption over the past decade. Corruption restricts funds needed for socio-economic challenges like controlling violence and crime, while criminal influence leads to instability that hampers economic growth. Private sector responses to corruption are often reactive, but some analysts believe business leaders can advocate for clean governance and anti-bribery laws to combat corruption's negative impact on competition. Private sector leaders in Latin America support anti-bribery legislation, with Mexico's COPARMEX advocating for full implementation of the National Anti-Corruption System. In contrast, business leaders in Guatemala and Honduras have opposed anti-corruption efforts. The Inter-American Development Bank calls for systemic change to reduce corruption in the region. The report criticizes previous interventions by multilateral and regional institutions as inadequate. It highlights the importance of corruption indicators used by rating agencies for investment and loans. Politicians often receive payoffs for favors, leading to distorted public-works bidding. Perception of corruption influences foreign direct investment, with Chile maintaining a low corruption perception. Scholars note that corruption hinders productivity. Public-sector corruption in Latin America affects productivity, competitiveness, and GDP. It hampers growth, distorts incentives, and erodes public services. Corrupt elites enable criminal networks to thrive, contributing to migration to the United States. Corruption also fuels violent crime, hindering government efforts to address migration factors and eroding public trust in state institutions. Weak criminal justice systems in Latin America, particularly in the Central America-Mexico drug transit zone, are easily penetrated by bribery and intimidation. This leads to increased criminal behavior, lack of trust in the justice system, and impunity for crimes, eroding confidence in judicial authorities and increasing corruption among criminal-justice personnel. The linkage between violence and corruption in Latin America has led to the region having the highest homicide rate outside of war zones. This has prompted protests and support for anti-corruption campaigns and candidates. Countries like Venezuela, Guatemala, and Honduras, known for high corruption levels, also have high homicide rates and emigration rates due to lack of trust in security forces. In February 2019, drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n was convicted in New York. \"Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, leader of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, was convicted in New York for drug trafficking, murder, torture, kidnapping, and money laundering. Testimony revealed high-level Mexican officials taking bribes, including former president Pe\u00f1a Nieto. The trial highlighted the deep-rooted corruption in drug trafficking, fueled by immense profits.\" The U.S.-supported Mexican efforts to combat drug trade have had limited impact due to ongoing police collaboration with criminal networks. Successful prosecutions are rare, with only 8% of homicide cases resolved. Mexico is working on establishing a separate attorney general's office for more independence in the judiciary. The appointment of a new official with political ties to Mexican President L\u00f3pez Obrador has raised concerns about the independence of the office. Extortion by criminal networks or officials can drain public funds, reducing resources for essential services like education and healthcare. Corruption in awarding contracts for public infrastructure projects can have deadly consequences. In Peru, a criminal group set up a fake government agency to extort contractors for recovery contracts after natural disasters. Corruption in public procurement and regulatory systems can lead to deadly consequences, as seen in the mine-waste dam collapse in Brazil. Charges of murder and safety violations are being considered for those involved. The regulatory body in Brazil approved a dam as low risk, but inspectors allegedly knew it was unsafe. The 2017 U.S. National Security Strategy highlights the national security challenge posed by corruption in weak governments. Solutions to control public corruption vary, with police and justice systems vulnerable to corruption when morale is low and external pressures are high. Abusive prosecutorial practices, such as torture or fabricating evidence, may prevail in such situations. The U.S. provides foreign assistance to combat corruption and improve the rule of law in Latin America, including judicial training and law enforcement techniques. This assistance also supports whistleblower protections and oversight of civil society to prevent corruption. Identifying corrupt partners can strain bilateral relations. The U.S. provides foreign assistance in Latin America to combat corruption and improve the rule of law, including judicial training and law enforcement techniques. This support also includes whistleblower protections and oversight of civil society to prevent corruption. The new proposed trade agreement signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico in late 2018 includes a chapter on anti-corruption, aiming to prevent and combat bribery and corruption in international trade and investment. The US provides foreign assistance in Latin America to combat corruption and improve the rule of law. The new trade agreement between the US, Canada, and Mexico includes a chapter on anti-corruption, with comprehensive measures to combat corruption through legislative, administrative, and promotional efforts. Assistance is provided by various US government agencies to support these anti-corruption measures. The U.S. government, through agencies like USAID and the State Department, funds programs to increase transparency, rule of law, and good governance. Anti-corruption activities are integrated into various programs beyond democracy and governance, including health, education, and economic growth. USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) provides rapid response programming to support peace and democracy. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) provides rapid response programming to support peace and democracy by assisting NGOs in combating antidemocratic forces, fighting corruption, and bolstering weak institutions. The State Department's International Narcotics and Law Enforcement bureau advances the rule of law and human rights by supporting criminal justice institutions, promoting accountability, and strengthening the rule of law. USAID and the State Department have funded programs in the last 30 years to reinforce institutions tackling corruption and promoting a \"culture of transparency\" and integrity. In 2012, USAID established the Center of Excellence on Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance to integrate anti-corruption goals into its development portfolio. Worldwide programming on combating corruption included roughly 330 projects over seven years, with funds for anti-corruption programs involving transfers from the State Department to the U.S. Department of Justice. The International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) works with foreign governments to develop transparent law enforcement institutions to combat corruption. The ICITAP field offices in Mexico, Panama, and Colombia aim to develop professional law enforcement institutions to combat corruption, transnational crime, terrorism, and protect human rights. The OPDAT provides capacity building in the justice sector by assigning experienced U.S. prosecutors to U.S. Embassies to train host country prosecutors and personnel. The U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation incentivizes good governance and transparency through funding requirements. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) awards funding to developing nations based on performance records, focusing on clean governance. The MCC's programs aim to promote sustainable anti-corruption practices. Several countries in the region have received threshold programs and large compacts, such as Honduras, Paraguay, Peru, and El Salvador. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has awarded roughly $800 million in assistance to countries in the Western Hemisphere over the past ten years through compacts and threshold programs. The U.S. Treasury Department also addresses corruption through programs like sanctions, listings, and asset seizures in cooperation with police. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers economic sanctions targeting foreign entities and persons involved in terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and other threats to U.S. national security and foreign policy. In Venezuela, 22 individuals and 27 companies are designated as \"specially designated narcotics traffickers\" under the Kingpin Act. In 2015, President Obama issued E.O. 13692 to target Venezuelan officials involved in corruption, violence, and human rights abuses. The Trump Administration has imposed sanctions on 74 officials, including President Maduro, Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, and high-level military officials. Strong sanctions were applied on Venezuelan oil in early 2019, restricting the government and PdVSA's access to the U.S. The Trump Administration has imposed sanctions on Venezuela, including restricting access to the U.S. financial system, banning purchases of digital currency and Venezuelan debt. Sanctions were also imposed on PdVSA to prevent Maduro's government from benefiting from oil revenue. The 116th Congress is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela to influence the government towards democratic rule amidst a humanitarian crisis causing a large refugee outflow. The exodus of Venezuelans, the largest outflow of refugees in the Western Hemisphere, has strained receiving countries. The Maduro government, known for corruption, has caused suffering in and beyond Venezuela. Sanctions on Maduro officials and the oil sector aim to address the crisis. If Venezuela transitions to democracy, extensive corruption may be revealed. The U.S. government has supported anti-corruption efforts in various ways. The U.S. government has supported anti-corruption efforts in Latin America, including in Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Efforts include cooperation with authorities, civil society, and justice systems to combat impunity, increase transparency, and dislodge corruption. In Brazil, the U.S. Justice Department cooperated on an international bribery case, while in Mexico, support focused on rule of law reforms and protecting journalists. In Central America, multilateral institutions and experts worked with weak governments to strengthen justice systems. Multilateral institutions and outside experts collaborated with justice systems in Guatemala and Honduras to uncover corruption. In Brazil, investigations like operation Lava Jato revealed systemic corruption involving high-level politicians and business executives colluding to fix contract bidding processes and receive kickbacks. Similar corrupt practices were found throughout the public sector. Investigations in Brazil have uncovered widespread corruption in the public sector, with businesses offering bribes for contracts. Over 900 individuals have been charged and 200 convicted for crimes including corruption and money laundering. Despite this, many politicians implicated in the scandals remain unconvicted due to a backlog in the Supreme Court. Legal and institutional reforms have been identified as key factors in facilitating anti-corruption efforts. The president selects the attorney general from a list of candidates created by federal prosecutors, enabling operational independence for pursuing politically sensitive cases. Improved investigations result from closer collaboration between the MPF and federal police, utilizing new tools. Brazilian prosecutors have approved over 200 plea bargain agreements to advance investigations, benefiting from cooperation with the United States and other international partners. Operation Car Wash prosecutors have issued numerous legal assistance requests. Operation Car Wash prosecutors have issued 269 formal requests for legal assistance to 45 countries, and received 279 requests from 36 countries. The United States and Brazil have a bilateral treaty on mutual legal assistance, allowing for various forms of cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. and Brazilian authorities engage in extensive formal and informal cooperation to investigate major corruption cases related to the Car Wash probe. This has led to coordinated resolutions with seven multinational corporations, resulting in over $1.9 billion in penalties to the U.S. and nearly $4.4 billion to Brazil. The future of Operation Car Wash and Brazil's anti-corruption efforts depend on the country's new actions. President Jair Bolsonaro appointed S\u00e9rgio Moro, the federal judge from the Car Wash investigation, as minister of justice and public security. Moro aims to push for political and judicial reforms to continue Brazil's anti-corruption progress. However, his alliance with Bolsonaro may undermine support for the investigation. The new government's anti-corruption proposals are facing resistance in Brazil. Initial anti-corruption proposals in Brazil face resistance in Congress where many legislators are under investigation. Corruption is a major issue in Mexico, costing up to 5% of GDP annually. US has supported anti-corruption efforts in Mexico since 2000, but lack of political will hinders progress. Efforts include transitioning to accusatorial justice system, establishing National Anti-corruption System, promoting transparency, and supporting investigative journalism. Transition to Accusatorial Justice System in Mexico involved constitutional reforms mandating a shift to an adversarial public trial system by 2016. The aim was to combat corruption, increase transparency, and ensure impartiality in the legal system. The United States supported these efforts since the late 1990s, with early adopters like Chihuahua showing progress. The United States has been supporting judicial reform efforts in Mexican states since the late 1990s, with assistance accelerating since the implementation of the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008. U.S. assistance has helped the federal and state governments adopt legislative frameworks, provided training for justice sector operators, and built support for the reforms in Mexican civil society. Despite Mexico technically meeting the deadline for adopting the new system in June 2016, serious implementation problems have arisen, with public opinion turning against the system and government funding for ongoing support diminishing. In 2015, Mexico approved constitutional reforms to prevent and punish corruption, leading to the creation of the National Anti-corruption System (NAS) in July 2016. The system granted investigative and prosecutorial powers, increased penalties for corruption, and required declarations from public officials and contractors. USAID supported these efforts and provided assistance to Mexican anti-corruption entities. Despite U.S. support and civil society pressure, Mexico's implementation of its National Anti-corruption System (NAS) has lagged, with government entities hindering efforts by denying requests for support. USAID funds are aiding in compliance with the NAS, conducting audits, developing codes of conduct, and supporting research and investigative journalism through partnerships with private sector entities. U.S. funds channeled through the World Bank and the U.N. Development Program also support civic participation in transparency secretariats at federal and state levels. The Mexican government has faced challenges in implementing the National Anti-corruption System, with delays in appointing judges for corruption cases and lack of personnel at the federal and state levels. President L\u00f3pez Obrador, despite his campaign promise to fight corruption, has not prioritized NAS implementation. However, a special anti-corruption prosecutor was named in February 2019. L\u00f3pez Obrador has also launched efforts to combat fuel theft from PEMEX. Investigative journalism is crucial for government transparency and accountability in Mexico. High-level PEMEX officials are being prosecuted for their involvement in oil theft, revealed by journalists. Journalists in Mexico face threats and attacks, with 74 killed in the past decade. Government officials and criminal groups intimidate and target critical journalists. The Mexican government and criminal groups target journalists investigating crime and corruption issues. US foreign assistance aims to help protect journalists and reduce impunity. USAID has provided funding for freedom of expression and journalist protection in Mexico. Progress has been reported in resolving some cases of journalists killed in 2017. In 2018, 16 journalists and media workers were murdered in Mexico, showing that the problem persists despite reported progress in resolving cases from the previous year. The U.S. government has supported anti-corruption efforts in Central America by backing the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), supported by the U.N., has recommended legal reforms and worked with Guatemalan institutions to dismantle corruption networks. This success led to the establishment of a similar institution in Honduras, the OAS-backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity. CICIG was invited by the Guatemalan government to combat a \"parallel state\" of criminal gangs, business elites, politicians, and security services undermining the elected government. Its mandate is to assist Guatemalan state institutions in investigating, prosecuting, and dismantling illegal groups responsible for organized crime and human rights violations. The International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) receives funding from the United States and other donors to support legal reforms and strengthen the rule of law in Guatemala. CICIG has assisted the Public Ministry in over 100 cases, leading to convictions of high-profile individuals like former President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina and Vice President Roxana Baldetti. It has also promoted legal reforms, identified criminal networks, and built the capacity of prosecutors and investigators. The U.S. State Department has recognized CICIG's achievements in combating corruption and organized crime. In its annual report on drug policy, the U.S. State Department highlighted Guatemala's anti-corruption efforts, including investigations by the Attorney General and the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). However, concerns were raised about the government's expulsion of CICIG, which raised doubts about its commitment to fighting corruption. Intimidation tactics, such as death threats and attempts to discredit officials, have escalated as anti-corruption efforts have expanded. President Jimmy Morales has been implicated in these issues. President Morales established zero tolerance for corruption as a key policy. Despite initially supporting CICIG, he and his inner circle are now under investigation. Morales has attempted to weaken and remove CICIG, replacing reformist officials with political allies. The Attorney General and CICIG called for Morales to be stripped of immunity for corruption charges, approved by Guatemala's Supreme Court. The battle to eradicate criminal networks in Guatemala has stalled since the President blocked the investigation into corruption charges. Despite the Supreme Court's approval, the request was blocked in Congress where many deputies are facing corruption allegations. Morales refused to renew CICIG's mandate and barred its Commissioner from reentering the country, defying Constitutional Court rulings. The Attorney General canceled police protection for CICIG staff, leading to a standoff when Guatemala tried to withdraw from the CICIG agreement. The Constitutional Court overruled Morales's decision to terminate CICIG, leading to protests and calls for Morales to resign. The U.N. supported CICIG's work but removed foreign staff due to safety concerns. The Morales Administration attempted to impeach members of the Constitutional Court. The U.S. has backed CICIG since 2007 through the State Department's INL. In March 2018, concerns were raised about a Russian businessman and his family regarding false passports, leading to a hold on $6 million in U.S. aid for CICIG. However, in July 2018, the State Department found no evidence to support the allegations, and funds were released. President Morales expelled CICIG in January 2019, prompting the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala to express concerns about the future of anti-corruption efforts in the country. In February 2019, most CICIG staff returned to Guatemala under safety plans, but Vel\u00e1squez and 11 investigators did not. Concerns arise that Morales's actions against CICIG aim to protect himself from prosecution, threatening Guatemala's democracy. Failure to comply with court rulings on CICIG could lead to a breakdown of the rule of law. Despite some institutional improvements, there are fears of a return to impunity for organized crime and corruption. Reducing CICIG's activity before the June 2019 elections could worsen the situation. The U.S. government supports efforts to combat corruption in Honduras through various means, including improving transparency, accountability, and imposing sanctions on corrupt officials. This is in line with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America to promote economic prosperity, governance, and security in the region. The United States has provided crucial diplomatic and financial support for the Organization of American States (OAS)-backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH). Honduran civil society demanded an international anti-corruption organization after discovering embezzlement from the Honduran Social Security Institute during President Porfirio Lobo's administration. President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, under pressure, negotiated a limited arrangement with the OAS instead of a U.N.-backed organization like the CICIG. The MACCIH, supported by the United States, aims to prevent, investigate, and punish corruption in Honduras. Despite initial focus on strengthening anti-corruption laws, the Honduran Congress has delayed and weakened reforms, hindering the mission's efforts. For instance, modifications to the law establishing anticorruption courts limited their jurisdiction and authority. The MACCIH, supported by the United States, aims to prevent, investigate, and punish corruption in Honduras. Despite initial focus on strengthening anti-corruption laws, the Honduran Congress has delayed and weakened reforms, hindering the mission's efforts. Changes to the law establishing anticorruption courts limited their jurisdiction and authority, including only hearing cases involving three or more people and excluding certain crimes. Additionally, modifications to the political financing law delayed its enforcement and removed a ban on campaign contributions from companies with public contracts. Proposed measures like an \"effective collaboration\" bill for plea-bargaining have yet to be enacted, despite their importance in anti-corruption investigations. MACCIH officials are collaborating with a new anti-corruption unit within the public prosecutor's office to combat corruption. The UFECIC and MACCIH are working together to investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases in Honduras. Charges have been brought in eight cases involving diversion of funds from social welfare programs to political campaigns or personal gain. The MACCIH is also supporting investigations into government collusion with drug trafficking organizations and corruption in public contracts, including the controversial Agua Zarca hydroelectric project. This progress has faced backlash. The Honduran Congress blocked a MACCIH-backed investigation into legislators' mismanagement of public funds, leading to backlash and the resignation of the head of MACCIH. OAS Secretary General nominated a successor, but faced resistance from the Honduran government. Legislators accused of embezzlement challenged the MACCIH's mandate's constitutionality. The Honduran Supreme Court ruled against the challenge to the MACCIH's mandate in May 2018. Despite ongoing challenges, the MACCIH and the public prosecutor's office are persevering in their anti-corruption efforts. Renewal of the MACCIH's mandate in January 2020 will require continued support from the United States and other international donors. The United States has provided support to countries like Brazil and Mexico in their anti-corruption efforts. The United States has supported anti-corruption efforts in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America through various programs and initiatives. This includes strengthening the justice system, implementing anti-corruption systems, and providing support to independent bodies challenging official corruption. Congress has shown interest in reinforcing Latin American responses to public corruption, which has led to the removal of several presidents in the region. The United States has supported anti-corruption efforts in Latin America by providing assistance to increase justice-system proficiency and judicial system support. This includes attitudinal coaching, education, and technical assistance to promote integrity, respect for law enforcement, and transparency in government. Salaries for judiciary and law enforcement are also important to resist bribery and uphold the presumption of innocence. The United States supports anti-corruption efforts in Latin America by providing assistance to increase transparency for government auditors, journalists, and the public. Threshold grants from the MCC aim to improve government practices through training, as seen in Paraguay. Sanctions are also used against individuals involved in corruption. Annual foreign operations appropriations require the Secretary of State to ban entry for individuals involved in significant acts of corruption. The U.S. government applies sanctions against corrupt officials in Latin America, including visa denials and economic sanctions. Sanctions are used to target individuals involved in significant acts of corruption, such as human rights violations and illicit practices. Critics argue that individually focused sanctions may not effectively end corrupt behavior, while broader economic sanctions may be used to pressure governments to remove corrupt individuals from power. The U.S. government applies sanctions against corrupt officials in Latin America, including visa denials and economic sanctions. Critics argue that sanctions may fail to achieve intended results and could have unintended consequences, such as exacerbating humanitarian crises. In 2017 and 2018, Congress passed bills focused on combating corruption globally. In 2018, Congress passed measures targeting corruption in Latin America, including required reports on narcotics trafficking and illicit campaign financing. The Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 authorizes sanctions on individuals responsible for human rights violations or corruption. Anti-corruption funding was also allocated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. In 2018, Congress passed measures targeting corruption in Latin America with funding for CICIG, MACCIH, and the attorneys general. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated $6 million for CICIG, $5 million for MACCIH, and $20 million for the attorney generals of the northern triangle. The 116th Congress may consider policy changes to NAFTA as part of the USMCA, including anti-corruption measures in Chapter 27. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about USMCA enforcement measures, pharmaceutical provisions, and labor rights. Senators want tariffs on Canada and Mexico lifted before further consideration. Congress may prioritize anti-corruption efforts in Latin America by supporting programs and conditional assistance to improve governance and rule of law. The U.S. Congress has appropriated foreign assistance with conditions on anti-corruption standards for countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Sanctions can be used to punish corrupt officials, but may not always achieve the desired change in behavior. This is an example of coercive diplomacy to modify a nation's leadership behavior. Some analysts believe that sanctions for regime change may not be effective as they could make compliance too costly for leaders. Civil society activism in the region due to corruption scandals may lead to a new commitment to integrity standards. The Financial Times editor noted positive changes in attitudes towards justice, transparency, corruption, and impunity in Latin America. Some analysts see the new activism in Latin America as an \"anti-corruption movement\" with a focus on eliminating corrupt leaders and implementing legislative reforms for more transparent governance. Expectations are set for U.S. relations with newly elected leaders in Mexico and Brazil who campaigned on anti-corruption promises. Mexico's new Prosecutor General, appointed in early 2019, aims to be independent from the executive branch and improve the office's reputation by resolving key cases. The U.S. government could support Mexico in implementing its National Anti-corruption System, developed with civil society and USAID. Anti-corruption programs should focus on enforcing existing laws and promoting a strong civil society to enhance accountability standards. The political will to achieve higher accountability standards can inspire courageous leaders to combat corruption. Congressional support for anti-corruption efforts in the region and adherence to OECD and OAS conventions are crucial. Evaluating the success of anti-corruption programs is challenging due to the complexity of establishing causality. Tailored approaches to anti-corruption efforts are necessary, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The sustainability of these efforts may depend on external political and economic variables. The timeframe for change and evaluating long-term sustainability in anti-corruption efforts can be complex. The threat of bankruptcy for firms involved in corruption can lead to economic instability and loss of crucial public infrastructure. Cynicism about democratic governance from widespread corruption can create instability. Some Latin American governments are discussing recovery from the Odebrecht scandal. The reduction in U.S. foreign assistance budgets has impacted anti-corruption funding and governance programs. The Trump Administration aims to cut federal spending, but Congress may need to prioritize addressing challenges from Russia, China, and other competitors in Latin America. Investing in reducing corruption and strengthening the rule of law can benefit U.S. investors and businesses in the region. Sustainable funding for good governance programs is a concern, but it may be more cost-effective than security assistance. Sustainable program funding is a concern for successful U.S. foreign assistance efforts. Plan Colombia is cited as a success, lasting nearly two decades and contributing to peace, reduced terrorism, and homicides. Bipartisan congressional support for foreign assistance goals is crucial for enduring success. The Trump Administration's priorities do not seem to focus on human rights, governance, and rule of law. The Trump Administration's priorities do not prioritize governance issues, focusing instead on security-related assistance like counternarcotics efforts. U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere is seen as decreasing, with a decline in regard for U.S. leadership. Positive views of bilateral relations are still rated favorably. The Trump Administration's focus on security-related assistance over governance issues has led to a decline in U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere. Attacks on the news media by senior U.S. leaders can reduce acceptance of U.S. assistance programs for freedom of the press. Regional institutions are taking up anti-corruption advocacy as it is no longer a top U.S. government concern. Multilateral development banks have analyzed corruption scandals in Latin America and the Caribbean, noting a lack of significant impact from donor assistance in combating corruption. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) recommended a more aggressive approach to addressing corruption, criticizing previous efforts as insufficient and focused more on reforms than enforcement. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) recommends a transformative approach to fighting corruption in Latin America and the Caribbean. They emphasize the need for an integrated framework involving public and private sector participation at all levels to address both supply and demand sides of corruption. Key targets for reform include political party financing, public financial management, government procurement, civil service reform, and internal oversight. CSIS advocates peer exchanges with veterans of fighting corruption from countries like Uruguay, Chile, and Colombia to assist struggling nations in the Northern Triangle countries of Central America. The emergence of civil society activism against corruption is attributed to the region's expanded middle class, which acts as a bulwark against corruption. The barometer study found that educated, male, and affluent individuals are more likely to view corruption as a top problem in their country. However, citizens from any background can be motivated to combat corruption when its link to economic issues and insecurity is clear. Illicit campaign finance is identified as a key factor in corruption, with examples like Guatemala's President Morales being investigated for undeclared campaign donations. The Odebrecht construction company admitted to paying bribes to public officials for political campaign financing in exchange for infrastructure contracts. Political donations off the record often exceed reported amounts in many countries. In Argentina, President Mauricio Macri and his opponent spent significantly more in the 2016 presidential race than publicly declared. U.S. assistance programs in Latin America aim to combat corruption and improve governance, with a focus on citizen-led anti-corruption movements. Structural and institutional reforms may be necessary for further progress in fighting corruption. Some practitioners advocate for an \"ecosystem\" of integrity-enhancing efforts in anti-corruption programs, which share common features with good development programming. Examples include abolishing opaque government rules and processes to increase transparency, as seen in Mexico's LAB Justicia online tool funded by USAID. Additionally, recruiting NGOs and corporations as partners in fighting corruption is crucial. NGOs and corporations are critical partners in fighting corruption, encouraging information sharing and citizen participation. Successful models should be adapted to local conditions. The CICIG in El Salvador was cited as a replicable effort. In early 2019, El Salvador cited the CICIG model as a replicable effort in fighting corruption. Mexico and Ecuador also considered similar frameworks for anti-graft commissions. International cooperation is crucial in tackling grand corruption cases. Independent journalism, social media, and whistleblower protections are key in building anti-corruption momentum. In Mexico, journalists play a crucial role in mobilizing rejection of criminal domination and violence, raising awareness of criminal impunity, and supporting whistleblowers. The OAS created the Mechanism for Follow-up on the implementation of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (MESICIC) in 2002 to help member states adhere to the convention and improve implementation through technical cooperation and sharing best practices. The MESICIC was created by the OAS in 2002 to harmonize anticorruption legislation in the Americas. It consists of the Conference of State Parties and the Committee of Experts, which oversee the mechanism's implementation and technical review process. The OAS General Secretariat supports the Committee of Experts in drafting reports to improve regulatory implementation. The MESICIC drafts reports to recommend better implementation of regulatory measures, aligning state commitments with IACAC goals. Civil society and NGOs participate by submitting information for review. The Committee of Experts adopts a hemispheric report summarizing progress and making collective recommendations. Some analysts suggest that the battle against corruption in the public sector in the Americas is more resilient now. Critics argue that the IACAC and MESICIC need updating to effectively combat new forms of corruption."
