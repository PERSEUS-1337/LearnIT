    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Cooperative Antiterrorism Act of 2002\" and includes findings related to terrorism. Congress finds that terrorism is detestable and illegitimate, international terrorist organizations pose a direct threat to the United States, and the proliferation of weapons makes the threat more dangerous. The war against terrorism must continue until the threat is eliminated, requiring cooperation from other countries and entities. Protecting the United States from terrorism is a top priority in foreign relations, requiring cooperation from the international community to prevent financing, share information on terror networks, eliminate cells, and combat anti-American propaganda inciting violence. The promotion of terrorism, intolerance, and anti-Americanism in state-owned media and education systems is a threat to the safety of the United States and global security. Cooperation in the global fight against terrorism is essential, as some countries are not countering pro-terrorist messages, which undermines US security interests. Countries that endorse international terrorism pose a direct threat to US security interests. US economic assistance and arms transfers are crucial in the global fight against terrorism. Recipients of US aid and munitions should support this effort. Existing laws like the USA Patriot Act and Foreign Assistance Act play a role in combating terrorism. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Arms Export Control Act, and Export Administration Act prohibit US assistance and export of items on the Munitions List to countries supporting terrorism. Implementation should include preventing promotion of terror in state-owned media and educational systems. The United States policy prohibits economic assistance and arms exports to foreign countries or entities not fully cooperative in the global war against international terrorism. The President can withhold economic assistance and oppose international financial institution lending to countries or entities not fully cooperative in the global war against terrorism. Additionally, arms exports require cooperation in the fight against terrorism. The President, with input from key officials, must create an annual unclassified report listing countries or entities not fully cooperative in the global war against terrorism. The report details specific failures and reasons for lack of cooperation. The annual report on countries or entities not fully cooperative in the global war against terrorism is submitted to Congress as part of the annual country reports on terrorism. The President must provide a classified briefing to Congress upon request. The President must provide a classified briefing to appropriate committees of Congress upon request for additional clarifying details on listed countries or entities under subsection (a)(1). SEC. 6. Presidential waiver allows US economic assistance or exports to countries/entities if deemed important for national security, with a report to Congress. SEC. 7. Definitions. In this Act, the term \"expression of support for terrorism against the United States\" refers to actions or expressions that provoke anti-American violence or advocate international terrorism. The term \"fully cooperative in the global war against international terrorism\" means a country or entity actively working to prevent the financing of terrorism. The Act prohibits financial support to terrorist organizations and sharing intelligence information with the United States related to terrorism. The Act requires states to cooperate in investigations related to terrorist organizations, provide access to suspects, and act against terrorist activities such as preventing attacks and disrupting their operations. The Act mandates countries to cooperate in investigating and combating terrorism, including providing access to suspects and preventing support for terrorism within their borders. The Act defines terms such as \"humanitarian assistance\" as goods and services for humanitarian purposes, and \"terrorist organization\" as designated by the Secretary of State. It also defines \"United States economic assistance\" as assistance provided by the United States. The term \"United States economic assistance\" includes various forms of assistance such as programs under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, sales under the Arms Export Control Act, provision of agricultural commodities under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, and financing under the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945. It does not include humanitarian assistance or assistance for cooperative antiterrorism, peacekeeping, counter-narcotics, nonproliferation, and counter-proliferation efforts. The term \"United States Munitions List\" refers to defense articles and services controlled by the President under the Arms Export Control Act."
