A novel regularization method penalizes covariance between hidden layer dimensions, promoting linearly uncorrelated nonlinear representations. This technique helps determine the underlying data dimensionality by disabling unnecessary dimensions, leading to improved performance on various tasks. Our approach is a simple and computationally cheap regularization method that can be applied to any gradient-based learning model. It aims to disentangle data by penalizing linear dependence between different dimensions in the representation space, resulting in a factorizable distribution that is easy to model. The proposed regularization scheme penalizes cross-correlation between dimensions in learned representations, promoting disentangled representations in neural networks. It is versatile and applicable to any gradient-based machine learning model. Unlike other techniques, it does not restrict the model used and encourages finding the data's dimensionality by disabling unnecessary dimensions. Experimental results show the model can learn all useful dimensions effectively. The proposed regularization scheme promotes disentangled representations in neural networks by penalizing cross-correlation between dimensions in learned representations. It allows for interpretability of activations, dimensionality reduction, and computational efficiency. Experimental evaluation shows that the approach effectively disentangles data while maintaining model performance on various tasks. The regularization scheme promotes disentangled representations in neural networks by penalizing cross-correlation between dimensions. It encourages minimal dimension usage in the representation, benefiting various models from autoencoders to deep convolutional autoencoders. Convolutional autoencoders trained on CIFAR-10 benefit from a novel regularizer, L \u03a3, which promotes uncorrelated and disentangled representations by penalizing covariance between dimensions in the coding layer. This regularization term can be applied to gradient-based models without altering their structure. The experimental evaluation of L \u03a3 regularization on various models shows its effectiveness in promoting uncorrelated representations. Different metrics are used to quantify the results, including Pearson correlation to measure linear correlation between variables. The CVR score is computed to measure the fraction of information captured in a linear uncorrelated fashion within the coding layer. Utilized Dimensions (UD) determines the number of dimensions needed to retain a set percentage of total variance, such as 90%. The experiment aims to disentangle independent data projected to a higher dimension using a random projection. An autoencoder model with a 10-dimensional coding layer and linear output layer is trained with covariance regularization. Data is generated from a 4-dimensional vector of independent features and transformed before being fed into the model to reconstruct properties of the original data. The model is trained on 10000 iid random samples for 10000 epochs with different values for the regularization constant \u03bb. Figure 2 compares residual linear correlation after training with L \u03a3 and L 1 regularization, while Figure 3 shows the resulting dimensionality of the coding layer. The experiment involved measuring scores using different regularization constants, with results reported in terms of MAPC and CVR. L \u03a3 consistently led to lower correlation and less MSE penalty compared to L 1. Higher L \u03a3 values reduced data dimensionality, affecting Pearson correlation scores between neurons. In the experiment, L \u03a3 consistently outperformed L 1 in terms of data compression and dimensionality reduction. It achieved a higher compression at a lower MSE cost and quickly converged towards optimal values, indicating no linear correlation. The data was compressed almost perfectly with L \u03a3, while L 1 struggled even with higher MSE costs. In the experiment, L \u03a3 outperformed L 1 in data compression and dimensionality reduction. The XOR problem can be solved by a neural network with one hidden layer, but the model used had two hidden layers of four logistic units to allow the network to discover the minimal structure by itself during training. The model used in the experiment consisted of two hidden layers with four logistic units each, trained on XOR examples until convergence with L \u03a3 regularization. The first layer learned the optimal structure of two dimensions, while the second layer was free from covariance. The second hidden layer encoded the result in one active neuron. Comparatively, a model trained without L \u03a3 regularization is shown in Figure 5. A feed forward neural network with L \u03a3 regularization was trained to solve the XOR problem. The model used two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, with a total of roughly 500,000 parameters. The regularization was applied to the coding layer with 84 dimensions, resulting in a bottleneck effect. The model was trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving low covariance in learned representations while maintaining reconstruction quality. The model was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 45,000 images for training, 5,000 for validation, and 10,000 for testing. L \u03a3 regularization was compared with L1 regularization and no regularization. The autoencoder was trained with a batch size of 100 and an initial learning rate of 0.001. The regularization parameter \u03bb was chosen to be 0.08. Results show that using L \u03a3 regularization leads to more disentangled high-level features with a lower covariance/variance ratio. Using L \u03a3 regularization in the model results in more disentangled high-level features with a lower CVR score of 6.56, compared to 20.00 without regularization and 4.03 with L1 regularization. The MSE for L \u03a3 regularization is 0.0398, similar to 0.0365 without regularization, both outperforming L1 regularization with an MSE of 0.0569. Increasing the regularization factor with L \u03a3 quickly reduces CVR while maintaining a consistent MSE. L1 regularization also decreases CVR but at a slower rate and worsens MSE. UD 90% results indicate that L \u03a3 encourages concentrated variation in representations. The L \u03a3 regularization encourages concentrated variation in representations, leading to lower UD 90% scores compared to L1 regularization. Disentanglement is crucial in learned representations, with various criteria proposed for learning disentangled representations. Principal component analysis (PCA) and nonlinear extensions like neural autoencoder models are techniques used for this purpose. Several techniques have been proposed for learning lower-dimensional representations, including self-organizing maps, kernel-based models, and independent component analysis (ICA). Non-linear ICA methods have also been explored, with a focus on learning additive components with statistical independence. One method involves training a neural network to transform data into a space with independent components using bijective transformations. The authors used a fixed factorial distribution as a prior distribution to encourage independent representations in a generative model for images and inpainting. They connected disentanglement and invariance in neural networks to information theoretic properties, proposing the use of the information bottleneck Lagrangian as a regularizer for weights. This approach can be applied as a regularization to learn uncorrelated components in any gradient-based model for internal representations. The authors propose using adversarial training to make a generative network learn independent components in a distribution. They resample from the joint distribution and train a discriminator to distinguish between the joint and the product of marginals. The authors propose using adversarial training to make a generative network learn independent components in a distribution. They introduce BID16, a reinforcement learning setting where policies interact with the environment to modify input representations. The paper presents L \u03a3 regularization, penalizing covariance between dimensions in a hierarchical model's internal representation. The proposed regularization scheme penalizes covariance between dimensions in a hierarchical model's internal representation, promoting the learning of linearly uncorrelated variables in a non-linear space. This method is flexible, portable, and can be applied to any feature-learning model trained with gradient descent, without impacting task performance but effectively disentangling the data."
