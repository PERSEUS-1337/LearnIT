The Act defines key terms related to athlete representation, including athletic director, Commission, endorsement contract, and intercollegiate sport. The Act defines key terms related to athlete representation, including athletic director, Commission, endorsement contract, and intercollegiate sport. A \"sport\" is a collegiate-level activity with eligibility requirements set by a national association. A \"professional sports contract\" is an agreement for employment as a player on a professional team. The term \"State\" includes various regions under US jurisdiction. A \"student athlete\" refers to a student participating in sports. The term \"student athlete\" refers to an individual eligible for intercollegiate sports, excluding those permanently ineligible for a specific sport. SEC. 3. REGULATION OF UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTACT BETWEEN AN ATHLETE AGENT AND A STUDENT ATHLETE. It is illegal for an athlete agent to recruit a student athlete using false information or promises, provide anything of value before signing a contract, fail to provide a disclosure document, or manipulate contract dates. An athlete agent must provide a disclosure document to the student athlete or their parent/legal guardian before entering into an agency contract. The document must be signed by the student athlete or their guardian and contain required language close to the signature. The athlete or student athlete under 18 must have a parent or guardian sign a notice warning about the consequences of agreeing to be represented by an agent. Both the athlete and agent must notify the educational institution's athletic director within 72 hours of signing the contract. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Violations of this Act are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission enforces this Act with the same powers and duties as under the Federal Trade Commission Act. SEC. 5. ACTIONS BY STATES. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action in federal court to address violations of the athlete agent regulations, seeking injunctions, compliance enforcement, damages, or other appropriate relief on behalf of residents. Before filing an action under paragraph (1), the attorney general of the State must provide written notice and a copy of the complaint to the Commission. An exemption applies if it is not feasible to provide notice before filing, in which case notice and the complaint must be provided to the Commission at the same time as filing the action. The attorney general files the action, and the Commission has the right to intervene in the action and be heard on any matter. The attorney general of a State can conduct investigations and administer oaths for civil actions. The Commission can conduct investigations, administer oaths, and compel witnesses or evidence. No State can initiate an action while the Commission's action is pending. Actions can be brought in a district court meeting venue requirements. Process can be served where the defendant resides or can be found. SEC. 6. PROTECTION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. Within 72 hours of signing an agency contract, the athlete agent and student athlete must inform the educational institution's athletic director. The institution has the right to take legal action against the agent for any damages caused by violating this Act. The educational institution can seek damages if it suffers losses due to the athlete agent's actions, including penalties or suspensions. The court may award costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party in such cases. This section does not limit any person's rights, remedies, or defenses under the law. Congress believes that states should adopt the Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 to safeguard student athletes and amateur sports from dishonest sports agents. This includes provisions for agent registration, contract requirements, athlete contract cancellation rights, disclosure obligations, and reciprocity among states."
