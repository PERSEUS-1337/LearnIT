    "content": "Conventional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for text generation face issues like reward sparsity and mode collapse, affecting sample quality and diversity. To tackle these problems, a novel self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm is proposed. SAL uses a comparative discriminator to compare text quality between samples and rewards the generator for improving upon previous outputs. This mechanism helps prevent collapsing towards a limited number of real samples, addressing reward sparsity and mode collapse issues in text generation. Our proposed approach addresses reward sparsity and mode collapse in text generation GANs, improving quality, diversity, and stability. Our proposed self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm aims to improve adversarial text generation by using a comparative discriminator to assess sample quality. This approach rewards the generator for producing better samples than before, addressing reward sparsity and enhancing sample quality, diversity, and stability. The proposed self-adversarial learning paradigm aims to alleviate reward sparsity and prevent collapse towards limited patterns in text generation. It shows substantial improvement in quality, diversity, and stability compared to previous approaches. Self-adversarial learning uses a comparative discriminator to improve text generation by fooling the discriminator. It is more effective than maximum likelihood estimation and aims to enhance quality, diversity, and stability in generated text. The text discusses the limitations of GANs in text generation, specifically regarding reward sparsity and mode collapse. To address these issues, a novel self-adversarial learning approach is proposed to improve the quality, diversity, and stability of generated text. The proposed self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm aims to improve text generation by rewarding the generator for producing better samples than its previous ones. This approach, inspired by self-play in reinforcement learning, uses a comparative discriminator to assess sample quality and provide informative learning signals. Compared to conventional GANs, SAL offers advantages in generating diverse and stable text outputs. The proposed self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm aims to improve text generation by rewarding the generator for producing better samples than its previous ones. SAL makes the assessment of sample quality better adapted to the current capability of the generator, reducing the risk of reward sparsity and generator collapse towards limited patterns. The self-improvement mechanism and 'tie' option in the comparative discriminator provide a reasonable baseline for training stability. The core component of SAL is the comparative discriminator, a pairwise classifier that learns a total order of sample quality by comparing samples. It provides more informative signals than binary classification, allowing for multiple feedbacks. Pairwise training examples are constructed from real and generated samples, with labels assigned based on quality comparison. The comparative discriminator in SAL assigns labels to pairs of samples based on quality comparison, enhancing generalization ability. It uses pairwise training examples from real and generated samples to distinguish between good and bad generated samples. Pseudo-real samples from later MLE training stages are paired with fake samples to train the model to compare their qualities effectively. The training procedure for SAL involves defining the learning objective for the comparative discriminator and the generator. The discriminator is trained to recognize quality differences in text samples, allowing the generator to receive rewards more easily based on the discriminator's predictions. Reward weights are assigned based on the quality comparison labels, enabling the generator to improve its output quality. The generator in SAL receives rewards based on the quality comparison with a reference sample, using a policy gradient algorithm for training. Unlike standard continuous GAN training, the generator obtains rewards only when a sample is fully generated, addressing this issue by following the practice in SeqGAN. The generator in SAL utilizes the Monte Carlo rollout method to approximate intermediate rewards and reduce variance in reference samples. The objective is to maximize expected final reward through self-adversarial training techniques borrowed from deep reinforcement learning. Scheduled rewarding is used to balance exploration and exploitation. In self-adversarial learning, the generator uses scheduled rewarding to balance exploration and exploitation. This technique adjusts rewards to encourage exploration early on and conservatism later in training. Additionally, a memory buffer is implemented to stabilize training by reducing correlation between generated and reference samples. In self-adversarial learning, a memory buffer is used to stabilize training by sampling reference samples from previous steps. The training process aims to achieve Nash Equilibrium where the generator models the distribution of real samples perfectly. The convergence of a non-Bernoulli GAN to this equilibrium remains an open problem. In self-adversarial learning, a memory buffer stabilizes training by sampling reference samples. The approach is evaluated on synthetic and real datasets using a generator, discriminator, and memory buffer. The training process aims to achieve Nash Equilibrium, with convergence based on Texygen as a benchmark platform. The text generation models evaluated in the study use a single-layer LSTM for the generator and a TextCNN-based discriminator. Hyperparameters were adjusted based on synthetic experiments. Quality is assessed using negative log-likelihood, while diversity is measured in terms of the generated samples. The study evaluates text generation models using a single-layer LSTM for the generator and a TextCNN-based discriminator. Quality is assessed using negative log-likelihood (NLL oracle), while diversity is measured with NLL gen. Real data experiments use BLEU scores and perplexity for quality, and backward BLEU and NLL gen for diversity evaluation. Frechet distance is also calculated for generated samples.

The proposed self-adversarial learning approach, SAL, is compared to previous adversarial text generation models like SeqGAN, RankGAN, and MaliGAN. Leak-GAN and RelGAN focus on architecture-level modification, which is orthogonal to SAL. The self-adversarial learning paradigm can be applied to LeakGAN and RelGAN as well. Five individual runs with different random seeds are conducted for each model to address sensitivity to random initialization and high variance in adversarial training. Table 2 displays the results of five runs with different random seeds for each model in the synthetic dataset. SAL outperforms previous GANs in quality-diversity trade-off, showing better stability and faster learning. SAL outperforms other text GANs in learning speed and performance, with consistent results across different datasets and metrics. In the WMT NEWS dataset, previous GANs struggle to improve MLE due to the large discrepancy between generated and real samples in long text generation. However, SAL consistently enhances sample quality and diversity, outperforming other GANs and closely matching MLE in performance metrics. SAL is shown to be much better than previous GANs and only slightly worse than MLE, reducing the risk of mode collapse. Human evaluation also confirms SAL's superiority over baselines in both COCO and WMT NEWS datasets. Samples generated by SAL are distinguishable from baseline models with high significance. Details of the human evaluation process and sample comparisons are provided in the Appendix. In the Appendix, comparisons of SAL with other models in real-world datasets are presented. Ablation tests were conducted on synthetic and real data using different evaluation metrics. SAL was compared with reduced models like CAL, w/o comparative, w/o \"\u2248\", and w/o scheduled. The ablation tests in Table 6 show the importance of the self-play paradigm in SAL, confirming the effectiveness of learning by comparison. The proposed pairwise comparative discriminator enables self-comparison, improving performance significantly. The \"\u2248\" option is crucial for enhancing results by making the task less trivial. Adversarial text generation models like LeakGAN, RelGAN, and RankGAN have been developed to improve performance by addressing non-differentiable issues through various architectures and optimization objectives for both the generator and discriminator. Scheduled rewarding and memory replay techniques borrowed from deep reinforcement learning have also shown to be beneficial. Our work introduces a self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm for adversarial text generation. Compared to existing models like RankGAN and RGAN, our approach utilizes a comparative discriminator that directly encodes inductive bias and assesses generated sentences with a pairwise classifier, providing more informative learning signals. The self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm for adversarial text generation rewards the generator for improvement, addressing reward sparsity and mode collapse issues. This leads to more stable training of text GANs and better performance in terms of quality, diversity, and lower variance. Future plans include generalizing SAL to other domains and modalities. Generated samples are provided for qualitative evaluation of different adversarial text generation models. The self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm improves adversarial text generation by rewarding the generator for enhancement, addressing reward sparsity and mode collapse issues. It leads to more stable training of text GANs and better performance in terms of quality and diversity. Samples generated by different models show that MLE training produces less realistic samples, SeqGAN has slightly better quality but lacks diversity, adversarial training with a proposed comparator improves quality but still lacks diversity, and self-adversarial learning enhances both quality and diversity of generated samples.

Samples generated by SAL and CAL in the EMNLP2017 WMT dataset show various scenarios and outcomes, including discussions on refugees, ministry statements, financial expectations, and international relations. The curr_chunk discusses the U.S. cabinet's role in an important company review, the Palestinian election warning before Obama's term, and Obama's stance on torture. Additionally, it mentions Trump's success in 2012 and a SeqGAN sample generation. The curr_chunk discusses a man who was tied up for 11 years, his return to fresh ties with his election, and his increased responsibilities. It also mentions a nine percent hike in 2015, government spending in the U.S., and threats from Islamic State militants. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of Islamic State militants on innocent people and comments on tech energy hub protests. It also presents examples of comparative discrimination and self-adversarial learning to address reward sparsity and mode collapse in adversarial learning. The curr_chunk discusses the use of comparative adversarial learning (CAL) and self-adversarial learning to improve sample quality in adversarial training. The self-improvement is easier to recognize by the comparative discriminator, reducing the chance of over-training and helping to alleviate reward sparsity and mode collapse. The model uses self-adversarial learning to achieve self-improvement and alleviate reward sparsity. A sentence generated in the late stages fools the binary discriminator. The ablated model variants are trained without self-play and a comparative discriminator. The difference between SAL and CAL is the use of a real sample for comparison instead of a previously generated one. The text discusses the use of backward-BLEU for evaluating the diversity of generated samples in GAN models. This metric measures generation quality and diversity by comparing generated samples to test data. The approach addresses issues with self-BLEU scores and aims to improve the evaluation process. BLEU is evaluated using the entire test set as a single reference with 10000 sentences. N-gram overlap is computed between the reference and prediction. The number of tokens generated is similar across different models. NLL gen measures the diversity of the generator by evaluating the negative log-likelihood of the synthetic dataset. NLL gen score is lower for diverse generators and higher for those with low diversity. NLL gen + NLL oracle is used to measure generation quality and diversity.
