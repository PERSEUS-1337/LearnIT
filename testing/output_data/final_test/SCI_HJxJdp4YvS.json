    "content": "The text discusses the challenges of generating visualizations and interpretations from high-dimensional data using clustering and representation learning. A new deep architecture called VarPSOM is introduced for probabilistic clustering, showing superior performance on static MNIST/Fashion-MNIST data and medical time series. The VarTPSOM extension for time series data combines VarPSOM modules with LSTM cells, inducing an interpretable representation. The proposed VarPSOM architecture uses a VAE to cluster data into clusters while maintaining a topological structure. It includes a SOM-based clustering loss and ELBO in the loss function. The VarTPSOM extension combines VarPSOM modules with LSTMs to predict future trajectories in both latent and original data spaces. The VarPSOM architecture utilizes a VAE to cluster data into clusters while preserving a topological structure. It incorporates a SOM-based clustering loss and ELBO in the loss function. The VarTPSOM extension combines VarPSOM modules with LSTMs to predict future trajectories in both latent and original data spaces. The Self-Organizing Map consists of nodes connected in a grid, with centroids updated based on input data. The Clustering Assignment Hardening method, introduced by the DEC model, performs well in the latent space of AEs. The proposed clustering method, PSOM, expands Clustering Assignment Hardening to include a SOM neighborhood structure over the centroids. It adds an additional loss term to achieve an interpretable representation by maximizing the similarity between each data point and the neighbors of the closest centroids. The PSOM clustering method maximizes similarity between data points and centroid neighbors by using a VAE for nonlinear mapping. The loss function includes KL divergence and SOM term, with the option to switch to Clustering Assignment Hardening. The VarPSOM method utilizes a VAE for embedding data points into a latent space, with an ELBO loss function that encourages compactness. This approach differs from previous SOM methods and offers advantages such as structured and disentangled factors in the latent space. Additionally, the model can be extended to handle time series data by incorporating a temporal component. To extend the VarPSOM model to time series data, a temporal component is added to learn interpretable trajectories on a SOM grid. To incorporate temporal information and enforce smoothness, a similarity loss between time points is introduced. Predicting future data points or embeddings can be achieved by adding a LSTM network across the latent embeddings of the time series. The VarTPSOM model uses a LSTM to predict the next latent embedding based on the current one. The prediction loss is calculated as the log-likelihood between the learned distribution and the next embedding. The model is trained in an end-to-end fashion with a standard network structure and specific latent dimensions for VAE and AEs. VarPSOM outperforms both DEC and IDEC in clustering and feature extraction using VAE. The performance is stable with no overfitting observed. VarTP-SOM is suited for temporal data and utilizes a VAE for interpretable unsupervised clustering. The VarPSOM and VarTP-SOM models utilize a VAE and a novel clustering method, PSOM, to achieve clustering and feature extraction. The SOM algorithm updates centroids and neighbors to converge the map. The models predict APACHE scores and mortality using variables from the eICU database. The DEC model evaluates different latent space dimensions using the AE. Trajectories of dying patients in the VarTPSOM model are distinct from healthy patients, especially in regions enriched for high APACHE scores. This results in better uncertainty quantification in the data. The model allows for better uncertainty quantification in ICU patient data by providing a soft centroid-based probability distribution for estimating discrete health states at different time points. This is visualized through a heat-map showing probabilities at each time-step, with a black line representing the overall trajectory. The circle and cross indicate ICU admission and dispatch, respectively."
