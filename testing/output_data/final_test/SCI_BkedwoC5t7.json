    "content": "Motivated by applications to unsupervised learning, the problem of measuring mutual information is considered. It is proven that serious statistical limitations are inherent to any measurement method, with distribution-free high-confidence lower bounds on mutual information limited to $O(\\ln N)$. The Donsker-Varadhan lower bound on KL divergence is analyzed, showing it cannot produce a high-confidence value larger than $\\ln N$. Despite the impossibility of large high-confidence lower bounds, estimators without formal guarantees can be used in practice. Expressing mutual information as a difference of entropies and using cross entropy as an entropy is suggested. Expressing mutual information as a difference of entropies and using cross entropy as an entropy estimator, it is observed that cross-entropy estimates converge to the true cross entropy at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Serious statistical limitations are established on any method of estimating mutual information, with a distribution-free high-confidence lower bound limited to $O(\\ln N)$. The bound on mutual information cannot exceed O(ln N) where N is the data sample size. Specific cases like the Donsker-Varadhan lower bound on KL divergence have limitations in producing high-confidence values larger than ln N. Similar constraints apply to lower bounds based on contrastive estimation, which do not establish mutual information of more than ln k where k is the number of negative samples used. The challenges arise when the mutual information I(x, y) is large, particularly when H(y) is large and H(y|x) is small, such as in the mutual information between an English sentence and its French translation. In the context of mutual information bounds, the DV bound and contrastive estimation play a role in estimating entropy and mutual information. Language and translation models are trained with cross-entropy loss, which can be used to estimate mutual information. However, the upper-bound guarantee for cross-entropy does not provide bounds for differences in entropies. This is relevant for tasks like maximum mutual information predictive coding. One can define MMI predictive coding as learning coding functions to maximize mutual information while limiting entropies. The goal is to preserve signal and remove noise in past and future sensory signals. Forms of MMI predictive coding have been introduced independently as \"information-theoretic cotraining\" and \"contrastive predictive coding\". The local version of DIM (DIM(L)) can be seen as a variant of MMI predictive coding. Another related framework is the information bottleneck BID17, which aims to learn a stochastic coding function to maximize mutual information while minimizing entropy. INFOMAX BID8 BID2 focuses on learning a coding function to maximize mutual information subject to constraints. Training models of marginal and conditional distributions is recommended when mutual information between variables is high. The main point is that high-confidence upper bounds on cross-entropy loss can be guaranteed to be close to the true cross entropy, unlike lower bounds on entropy. Theoretical analyses assume discrete distributions, but apply to continuous cases as well. Mutual information can be measured in both discrete and continuous scenarios. Theoretical analyses assume discrete distributions and apply to continuous cases. Mutual information can be written as a KL divergence, with the DV lower bound applying generally. The DV bound is derived from observations on distributions P, Q, and G. Sampling is used to compute KL-divergence where access to distributions P and Q is limited. The DV bound is used to estimate KL-divergences through sampling, but it is limited to measuring divergences of up to tens of bits. The MINE approach aims to maximize mutual information by applying stochastic gradient ascent on this lower bound. The DV bound is limited to measuring divergences of up to tens of bits. No high-confidence distribution-free lower bound on KL divergence can be used for this purpose. The optimal value for F(z) in the expression involves ln(P(z)/Q(z)), simplifying to KL(P, Q). For large KL divergence, F(z) is typically hundreds of bits, making it impossible to measure E z\u223cQ e F(z) by sampling from Q. The DV bound is limited to measuring divergences up to tens of bits, and cannot accurately model ln(P(z)/Q(z)) for large KL divergences. The outlier risk lemma can be used to analyze the risk of unseen outlier events in sampling from Q. This lemma can also be used to perform a quantitative risk analysis of the DV bound. The DV bound has limitations in measuring large KL divergences. To estimate B(P, Q, G) from samples S P and S Q, outlier risk must be considered for a high confidence lower bound on KL(P, Q). The largest possible value of B(S P, S Q, F) occurs when F(z) = F max for all z in S P and F(z) = 0 for all z in S Q. However, there is still a 1/4 probability of unseen outlier risk. Negative results can be strengthened by considering the preliminary bound where G(z) is involved. Our negative results can be enhanced by considering the preliminary bound (1) where G(z) models P(z) perfectly. Theorem 1 states that any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on KL(P,Q) computed with complete knowledge of P but only a sample from Q satisfies KL(P, Q) \u2265 B(P, S, \u03b4) with probability at least 1 - 4\u03b4. From a sample S \u223c Q N, we cannot reliably distinguish between distributions Q and Q. The distribution Q equals the marginal on z of a distribution on pairs (s, z) where s is a Bernoulli variable with bias 1/N. The probability that all coins are zero is at least 1/4. Mutual information is a special case of KL-divergence, and tighter lower bounds may be possible in this case. In this special case, a lower bound on mutual information implies a lower bound on entropy. Any distribution-free high-confidence lower bound on entropy requires a sample size exponential in the size of the bound. For continuous densities, differential entropy can be negative, but an O(ln N) upper bound on mutual information measurement for discrete cases also applies to continuous cases. The type of a sample S is defined as a function on distributions. The type of a sample S, denoted T (S), is a function on positive integers where T (S)(i) is the number of elements of S that occur i times. The type T (S) contains information relevant to estimating probabilities and entropy. Various authors have investigated estimating distributions and entropies from sample types. A negative result on lower bounding entropy by sampling is presented.

A negative result on lower bounding entropy by sampling is presented. For any distribution P and N \u2265 100, if the support of P has fewer than 2kN^2 elements, then the entropy H(P) is less than ln 2kN^2. If the support has at least 2kN^2 elements, a distribution P is defined on these elements. The theorem states that with probability at least (1 - \u03b4) over a draw of S, the bound B(T(S), \u03b4) is less than or equal to ln 2kN^2. The text discusses the estimation of probabilities and entropy based on sample types. It presents a method to calculate the probability of certain events occurring in a sample. The text also explores the relationship between mutual information and entropy, showing how measuring mutual information can be simplified by measuring entropies. The text discusses high-confidence distribution-free upper bounds on entropy and their relationship to cross-entropy. It explains how the gap between estimated and true entropy depends on the model's expressive power. The limitations on lower bounds do not apply to cross-entropy upper bounds, where naive sample estimates can produce meaningful results. Estimates of cross-entropy loss provide meaningful results. A cross-entropy estimator is defined from a sample S, with a bound on the loss of model G. In language modeling, a loss bound exists for models that back off to a uniform distribution on characters. Theorem 3 states a standard confidence interval for population distribution P and model distribution G. PAC-Bayesian bounds on H(P, G \u03a6) consider the training of G \u03a6 to minimize empirical loss. The PAC-Bayesian bounds apply to \"broad basin\" losses and loss estimates for parameterized class of models. The bound is instructive with \u03bb = 5, showing a residual gap when N \u2192 \u221e. The regularization parameter \u03bb can be tuned on holdout data. The regularization coefficient depends on F max, N, and the basin parameter \u03c3. Evidence suggests that distance traveled bounds are tighter than traditional L2 generalization bounds in practice. In MMI predictive coding, we aim to maximize mutual information while limiting entropies by learning coding functions C x and C y. Maximum mutual information (MMI) predictive coding is a method of unsupervised pretraining that aims to maximize mutual information by learning coding functions Cx and Cy. The approach involves representing mutual information as a difference of entropies and estimating them to maintain semantic signal while dropping uninformative noise. Representing mutual information as a difference of entropies and estimating them by minimizing cross-entropy loss is a statistically justified approach. Cross-entropy upper bounds on entropy do not provide bounds on mutual information. Lower bounds on entropy can be seen as evidence against the existence of superintelligent models. The feasibility of such proofs should not be surprising."
