    "content": "The federal government owns and manages roughly 640 million acres of land in the United States, with four major agencies managing 95% of this land. These agencies are Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Forest Service (FS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS). Most of the land is in the West, including Alaska, while the Department of Defense administers 2% of federal land. Controversy surrounds the ownership and use of federal lands, with conflicting public values raising questions about the extent of federal land ownership. The federal government owns and manages a significant amount of land in the United States, with key questions surrounding the extent of federal land ownership, resource allocation for maintenance and acquisition, balancing use and protection, and ensuring border security. Congress addresses these issues through legislative proposals, oversight, and appropriations for federal land management agencies. Federal lands have played a crucial role in American history, contributing to the government's strength, attracting settlement and economic development, and generating revenue for various needs. The formation of the U.S. federal government was influenced by the control of \"western\" lands. The struggle for control over the \"western\" lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River influenced the formation of the U.S. federal government. The cession of these lands to the new government, along with granting constitutional powers, transformed the weak central government under the Articles of Confederation into a stronger, centralized federal government under the U.S. Constitution. Federal land laws reflected two visions: reserving some lands for conservation and selling others for development and settlement, with East/West policy views. In the early days, policy views on federal lands had East/West overtones, with easterners seeing them as national property and westerners as necessary for local use. Settlement was promoted to pay debts and strengthen the nation, accelerated by acquisitions like the Louisiana Purchase and laws like the Homestead Act. Over 1.29 billion acres of federal land was transferred out of ownership between 1781 and 2015. Between 1781 and 2015, over 1.29 billion acres of federal land were transferred to private ownership, states, and Alaska. Most transfers to private ownership occurred before 1940, with new laws in the late 1800s reflecting concerns about rapid development threatening scenic treasures and future resources. This led to the evolution of a preservation and conservation movement to protect certain lands and resources. Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872 as the world's first national park, was protected by the U.S. Army from poachers. In 1891, forest reserves were created to address concerns over timber harvests. The emphasis in the 20th century shifted towards retaining and managing federal lands. Discussions during the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 acknowledged the difficulty of relinquishing federal lands to states. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 declared that remaining public domain lands would generally remain in federal ownership, leading to the Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s. Some western states are now interested in assuming ownership of federal lands within their borders due to concerns about federal land ownership, management decisions, and revenue. Efforts to change the level of federal ownership have been met with challenges. The creation of national parks and forest reserves led to the establishment of federal agencies like BLM, FS, FWS, NPS, and DOD, which manage 97% of federal lands. Other agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NASA also administer federal lands. The BLM was formed in 1946 by merging two existing agencies. The BLM was formed in 1946 by combining the Grazing Service and the General Land Office. It currently administers 248.3 million acres of federal lands, mainly in the western states. BLM's management responsibilities include multiple uses such as recreation, grazing, timber, watershed, wildlife habitat, and conservation. The agency historically emphasizes rangeland management, while the FS focuses on federal forests. Additionally, BLM administers about 700 million acres of federal subsurface mineral estate. The BLM administers 700 million acres of federal subsurface mineral estate nationwide. The Forest Service, established in 1905, manages 192.9 million acres of land in the US, with a focus on national forests. Originally created to protect lands and provide timber, the national forests' purposes were expanded in the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 expanded the purposes of national forests to include recreation, livestock grazing, wildlife and fish habitat, and wilderness. It directed that these uses be managed harmoniously to meet the needs of the American people. The act also emphasized sustained yield without impairing land productivity. The National Wildlife Refuge System, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, was established in 1966 to conserve plants and animals on 89.1 million acres of federal land in the US. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has a primary mission to conserve plants and animals, with wildlife-related activities given priority over consumptive uses like timber cutting and mineral extraction. The National Park Service (NPS) manages 408 units with 79.8 million acres of federal land in the US, with two-thirds of the lands located in Alaska. The National Park System in the United States consists of 417 units with 79.9 million acres, with two-thirds of the lands located in Alaska. The NPS has a dual mission to preserve unique resources and provide for public enjoyment, including natural areas, prehistoric sites, places in American history, and recreational opportunities. The Department of Defense (DOD) manages over 4,800 defense sites worldwide, totaling 26.1 million acres of land. In the United States, DOD owns 11.4 million acres, with individual parcel ownership ranging from 0 to 2.3 million acres. The tension between recreation and resource preservation poses management challenges in areas like the Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The Department of Defense manages over 4,800 defense sites worldwide, totaling 26.1 million acres of land. DOD's natural resource conservation program activities focus on supporting mission-related activities and ensuring access to land, air, and water resources for military training and testing while sustaining ecological integrity. The federal government manages roughly 640 million acres of land in the United States, representing 28% of the total land base. Data on federal land administered by major agencies and the Department of Defense in each state is provided in tables. The figures underestimate total federal land as they do not include lands managed by other agencies. There is significant variation in the percentage of land administered by federal agencies in each state. The federal government manages 640 million acres of land in the United States, with significant variation in federal presence among states. Nevada has the highest percentage at 79.6%, while Connecticut and Iowa have the lowest at 0.3%. Western states and Alaska have over 10 million acres each managed by federal agencies. Early treaties, land settlement laws, and state agreements contribute to this discrepancy. Management of federal lands can be controversial, especially in states where the federal government has a significant presence. Since 1990, federal land ownership has generally declined, with many disposals and acquisitions occurring. Total federal land ownership has decreased by 25.4 million acres, or 3.9%, with BLM and DOD experiencing declines while NPS, FWS, and FS expanded their acreage. Since 1990, federal land ownership has decreased by 25.4 million acres (3.9%). The NPS, FWS, and FS expanded their acreage, with the NPS having the largest increase. The decline in federal lands in Alaska was a significant factor in the overall decrease, with federal land in Alaska decreasing by 21.5 million acres (8.8%) due to disposals to the State of Alaska, Alaska Natives, and Alaska Native Corporations. Additionally, federal land decreased in the 11 contiguous western states by 6.6 million acres (1.9%). Federal land ownership decreased by 6.6 million acres in the 11 western states, with reductions in 4 states including Arizona and Nevada. Outside of Alaska and the western states, federal land increased by 2.8 million acres. Ownership debates persist, with some advocating for disposal to state or private ownership, while others support retaining federal lands or acquiring more. Some advocate for federal land acquisition and improved funding sources, focusing on land condition and infrastructure. Debates include land development, preservation, and recreation access, as well as the balance between national and local benefits. Border security and law enforcement roles near the southwestern border are also discussed. The ongoing debate in Congress revolves around the optimal extent of federal land ownership, with discussions on whether the government should retain, dispose of, or acquire lands. Advocates of federal land retention and acquisition highlight benefits such as protection of natural resources, open space, and public access for recreation. On the other hand, disposal advocates raise concerns about federal land management efficiency, accessibility for recreation, and potential financial gains from selling federal land. Some argue for federal land retention to protect natural resources and public access, while others advocate for disposal to improve land management efficiency and potential financial gains. Congress has granted varying authorities to federal agencies for acquiring and disposing of land, with the BLM having broad authority, the FWS having various authorities, the FS limited authority, and DOD also having acquisition authority. The NPS lacks general authority for land acquisition. The NPS lacks general authority for land acquisition, while the primary funding mechanism for federal land acquisition is appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FWS has additional funding from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. DOD lands that are excess to military needs can be disposed of. The disposal of DOD lands that are excess to military needs can be done under the surplus property process. Congress often enacts legislation to provide authority for land acquisition or disposal. The concentration of federal lands in the West has led to controversy over federal land ownership, with efforts to divest the government of land. Some western states are considering measures to support the transfer of federal lands. Some states are considering measures to support the transfer of federal lands to states or express support for federal land ownership. Previous efforts like the Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s and early 1980s aimed to divest federal lands but were unsuccessful. Supporters of federal land ownership argue against state challenges due to resource constraints, economic considerations, and environmental priorities. Some states have considered measures to support federal lands or limit their sale. The 11 western states and Alaska have significant federal land areas, with Alaska having 61.3% federally owned land. Debate continues on balancing new acquisitions with maintaining existing infrastructure and caring for federal lands. Some argue for focusing on improving the condition of current federal lands and infrastructure, prioritizing ecological restoration and maintenance activities. They oppose acquiring new lands until existing maintenance backlogs are addressed. Others believe expanding federal protection to new lands is necessary to provide public use areas and protect natural resources. The ecological condition of current federal lands, such as public rangelands suffering from overgrazing, has been a longstanding concern. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 was enacted due to the poor condition of public rangelands from overgrazing, leading to the creation of the BLM. Today, debates on federal lands' health focus on rangelands, forests, riparian areas, and various land uses like livestock grazing, recreation, and energy development. Factors impacting federal lands include wildfires, invasive weeds, and deferred maintenance, which accelerates deterioration and increases repair costs. The National Park Service (NPS) backlog for deferred maintenance was estimated at $10.93 billion in FY2016, with the majority allocated to roads, bridges, and trails. The backlog has increased since FY1999, with efforts to quantify maintenance needs across federal land management agencies. Maintenance backlogs are not exclusive to the NPS, as other agencies also face similar challenges. The FS, DOI, FWS, and BLM also have maintenance backlogs. In FY2016, FS estimated a $5.49 billion backlog, with 59% for roads, 22% for buildings, and 19% for other assets. DOI estimated FWS backlog at $1.40 billion and BLM at $0.81 billion. Combined, the agencies had a $18.62 billion backlog in FY2016, attributed to funding shortfalls over decades. Total funding for maintenance backlog remains unclear, with differing opinions on funding levels and sources. The debate over federal lands management includes issues such as development, recreation, and preservation. Controversies exist regarding traditional commercial activities like energy development, grazing, and timber harvesting. Questions also arise about restricting recreation, protecting wild horses and burros, and balancing land uses. Discussions continue on how much land to dedicate to enhanced protection and who should be responsible for protecting federal lands. Debates surrounding federal lands management include balancing national and local benefits, such as wood production, energy sources, clean water, biodiversity, and recreational activities. Compatibility of various land uses and values is considered, but conflicts may arise due to increasing demands on federal lands. Conflicts among uses and values on federal lands have escalated, especially on multiple-use lands managed by the BLM and FS. Debates include the balance between national and local control, with some advocating for more local control and others for maintaining or enhancing the federal role in land management. Border security on federal lands presents challenges due to limited law enforcement coverage and remote geographic locations. Federal lands along the southwestern border have seen an increase in illegal activity since the mid-1990s, as the U.S. Border Patrol implemented a national border enforcement strategy. Efforts to secure the border are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires evaluating potential environmental impacts before implementing programs. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has authority to waive environmental laws for border construction, sparking debate over protection of federal lands near the U.S. borders. The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to waive environmental laws for border construction, sparking debate over protection of federal lands near the U.S. borders. Within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexican border, there are approximately 26.7 million acres of federal lands, with various agencies managing different portions. The USBP is the lead agency for border security between ports of entry, but over 40% of the southwestern border abuts federal and tribal lands overseen by the FS and four DOI agencies with law enforcement responsibilities. The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to waive environmental laws for border construction near federal lands. Different agencies manage federal lands near the U.S.-Mexican border, with the USBP leading border security efforts. Memoranda of understanding were signed by DHS, Department of Agriculture, and DOI to improve coordination for border security on federal lands. Despite some challenges in interagency coordination, efforts have been made to enhance collaboration among agencies. In 2016, DOI Interagency Borderlands Coordinator Jon Andrews highlighted improved coordination among federal agencies for border security on federal lands along the borders."
