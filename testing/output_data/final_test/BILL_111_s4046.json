Congress recognizes the widespread harm of religious discrimination in employment and established religion as a protected class under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Failure to accommodate an employee's religious practice is considered discrimination. Eradicating religious discrimination is crucial for achieving equal employment opportunities. In Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, the Supreme Court ruled that employers could deny religious accommodations if it posed more than a minimal burden, limiting protection against religious discrimination in employment. This decision has led to ongoing discrimination based on religion in the workplace by federal, state, and private employers. Employers have a history of discrimination in denying religious accommodations related to garb, grooming, and scheduling. The Act addresses these requests but does not exclude other religious accommodation requests. The Supreme Court has authorized monetary damages for individuals against State governments violating Title VII. The Act addresses discrimination in religious accommodations, including garb, grooming, and scheduling, without excluding other requests. The Act aims to address discrimination in religious accommodations in employment, including garb, grooming, and scheduling, by prohibiting employment discrimination based on religion and invoking congressional powers to enforce the 14th amendment and regulate interstate commerce.
