    "content": "House procedures are not solely based on the Rules adopted at the beginning of each new Congress. They also include constitutional mandates, parliamentary principles, laws with rule-like effect, precedents, and informal practices. Additionally, committee rules, jurisdictional agreements between committees, and party caucus/conference rules are part of the parliamentary authorities. These documents serve as official records and are cited by Members when raising points of order or defending against them. The House procedures are based on various authorities, including the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, adopted Rules of the House, and rule-making statutes. Official reference documents compile House precedents, such as House Practice, Deschler's Precedents, Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents. Parliamentary reference documents are also prepared by committees and other organs. Parliamentary reference documents in the House of Representatives include Committee rules, Floor Procedure guidelines, How Our Laws Are Made, and rules of the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference. These documents are compiled by various House bodies and provide important procedural information. The report describes the format and content of parliamentary reference documents, including sample pages and access information. The appendices provide citations for printed reference documents and related CRS products. The report covers House parliamentary procedure and related CRS products. House rules are governed by multiple authorities, with principles such as the House's constitutional power to make its own rules and adherence to established practices. The House's parliamentary procedure is governed by various authorities, including its constitutional power to establish rules and adherence to established practices. The rules of the House are not the only authority, as interactions among different parliamentary authorities influence proceedings. The House exercises its rule-making power to determine internal procedures, including adopting rules at the beginning of each Congress and enacting special rules and rule-making statutes. Special rules define procedures for considering individual measures, while rule-making statutes govern House procedures for specific classes of measures. The House's rule-making authority involves setting terms for considering measures through special rules and rule-making statutes. These rules have the same effect as House rules and are enacted at the beginning of each Congress. The House can determine when its adopted rules should not govern its proceedings, allowing for actions that violate rules by unanimous consent or suspension by a two-thirds vote. Special rules can waive points of order, enforced by Members raising objections when the House is violating procedural authorities. When a point of order is raised, the chair rules on its validity based on House Rules and procedural authority. The chair's ruling stands as a precedent of the House and can prevent certain actions from proceeding. The chair may also enforce rules by refusing to entertain actions that are not permitted, and may remind members of decorum during debate. The chair enforces House rules and procedural authority by ruling on points of order. The chair's rulings serve as precedents and can prevent certain actions. The chair may also remind members of decorum during debate, but does not address constitutional violations. Constitutional matters are settled by a vote of the chamber. Actions based on party caucus rules are not enforceable. Actions based on party caucus rules or informal practices are not enforceable on the House floor. These rules and practices, while forming part of House procedure, do not have the same standing as the Rules of the House. Caucus rules are created and enforced by one party, while informal practices evolve over time as custom. Rules adopted by House committees generally cannot be enforced on the House floor, but can be enforced within the committee. Published precedents of the House outline how the chamber interprets and applies its rules, often established when the chair rules on a point of order. In practice, the House rarely entertains appeals of rulings by the chair, and usually votes to confirm the ruling by laying the appeal on the table. Precedents can also be set when the chair responds to a parliamentary inquiry or when the House makes a procedural decision by majority vote. These precedents influence current House proceedings. Precedents in the House influence the application of current rules by relating past decisions to the specific case at hand. Published precedents serve as guidance on how rules have been applied, complementing and supplementing House rules. Similar to case law, precedents are cited by Members to support their arguments or points of order, with the chair often citing predecessors' decisions. The House rarely disregards its precedents, which vary in weight based on the chair's disposition or House decisions by majority vote. Precedents in the House are crucial for applying current rules, with more recent precedents carrying greater weight. Members can seek advice from the Parliamentarian for precedents to support their arguments. Some House procedural actions are based on informal practices that have evolved over time. Informal practices in the House, not mandated by authoritative statements, are rarely challenged on the floor. Examples include the Speaker's recognition of Members for speeches and giving priority to committee members for offering amendments. The House Manual compiles parliamentary sources with annotations summarizing relevant precedents and practices. The House Manual compiles parliamentary sources with annotations summarizing relevant precedents and practices, including the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, and Rules of the House of Representatives. It is often referred to as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" but this is a misnomer as it contains more than just Jefferson's contributions. The House Manual, also known as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" is an official document published by the Government Printing Office in each Congress. It includes parliamentary authorities and annotations by the Parliamentarian summarizing relevant precedents. The Manual features a comprehensive index, annotations to provisions, and a preface unique to this reference source. The House Manual, also known as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" is an official document published by the Government Printing Office in each Congress. It includes parliamentary authorities, annotations by the Parliamentarian summarizing relevant precedents, and a preface presenting changes to House Rules adopted since the last Congress. The Manual is organized in numbered sections for easy reference, with citations by section number rather than page number. The House Rules were recodified in the 106th Congress, reducing their number from 52 to 28, which led to changes in section numbers in the Manual. The extensive index of the House Manual provides citations by section number for easy navigation. The House Manual, also known as \"Jefferson's Manual,\" includes parliamentary authorities and annotations by the Parliamentarian. The extensive index provides citations by section number for easy navigation. The index breaks major topics into subheadings with descriptive specifications. Annotations by the Parliamentarian, known as \"Parliamentarian's notes,\" provide historical context and useful information about procedural authority. The curr_chunk provides annotations on the history and contemporary application of provisions, including important precedents with citations to official publications. Citations are in various formats like Congressional Record and Precedents publications. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of precedents in parliamentary annotations, providing practical value by showing the relationship between specific clauses and precedents. It includes citations to official publications like Deschler-Brown Precedents, Procedure in the House, Pronouncements by the Speaker, United States Code, and United States Reports. The curr_chunk highlights the practical value of parliamentary annotations by showing the relationship between specific clauses and precedents. It includes citations to official publications like Deschler-Brown Precedents, Procedure in the House, Pronouncements by the Speaker, United States Code, and United States Reports. The discussion is updated with each publication of the House Manual, referencing important precedents not found in earlier compilations. The citations provided in parentheses serve as a time-saving research tool for readers seeking precedents related to specific clauses of House Rules or other parliamentary authorities. The House Manual includes the Constitution text with annotations by the parliamentarian explaining procedural requirements and practical applications in the House. It grants the House authority to adopt rules, keep an official journal, require a quorum, and conduct yea and nay votes. The annotations elaborate on how these provisions have been applied. House Rule XXVIII, dating from 1837, states that Jefferson's Manual governs parliamentary practice in the House. Thomas Jefferson wrote this manual, based on British House of Commons practices, as Vice President. The Senate does not consider the manual an authority on its own procedures. Jefferson's Manual is distinct from the House Manual and the adopted Rules of the House. The House Manual incorporates relevant sections from Jefferson's Manual, with annotations by the parliamentarian explaining their relation to current House procedures. Key parliamentary procedures in the House, such as debate rules and amendment considerations, are based on practices from Jefferson's Manual. The House approves an excerpt from Jefferson's Manual at the start of each Congress. The House Manual presents the Rules of the House with annotations by the parliamentarian, including any adopted amendments. The Rules are re-adopted at the start of each Congress with specified changes, usually recommended by the majority party. Non-germane amendments are prohibited, as detailed in the parliamentarian's annotations. The Clerk's Print, containing the House Rules as amended, is usually the first document available each Congress. The recodification of the Rules in the 106th Congress included a structural revision noted in the House Manual for subsequent Congresses. The recodification of the House Rules in the 106th Congress reduced the number of rules from 52 to 28. Explanations of the changes and how each rule is derived from previous provisions are provided in the Manual and on the House Committee on Rules website. The Clerk's Print, containing the amended House Rules, is the first document available each Congress. The House has authority over its rules through simple resolutions or statutory measures, which require agreement between both chambers and the President. These procedures have the same standing as House and Senate rules and can be changed in the same manner. The House has authority over its rules through simple resolutions or statutory measures, which can be changed in the same manner as any other rule of the House. Legislative reorganization acts exemplify rule-making statutes with effects on House procedures. Some statutory provisions establish expedited procedures for congressional action on specified matters, while others regulate the congressional budget process. The House Manual includes provisions from legislative reorganization acts, such as the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 and the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, which regulate House procedures. The parliamentarian's annotations in the House Manual discuss the origin and effects of these provisions on House procedures. Additionally, some provisions of these acts that are not incorporated into House Rules are annotated separately in the Manual. The House Manual for the 110th Congress outlines special procedures for Congress to approve or disapprove actions of the executive branch or independent agencies. These procedures, known as \"privileged procedures,\" allow for expedited joint resolutions in response to specified actions. These rules have the force of House and Senate rules and are considered a type of rule-making statute. The House Manual outlines privileged procedures for Congress to approve or disapprove executive branch actions. These procedures are considered rule-making statutes and include provisions from various statutes, such as the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The House Manual includes rule-making provisions from statutes like the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and the Trade Act of 1974, outlining procedures for congressional consideration of recommendations and fast-track procedures for trade agreements. The Congressional Budget Act requires Congress to adopt a resolution on the budget each year to set spending, revenue, and deficit targets for the fiscal year. The House Manual includes rule-making provisions for budgetary legislation and procedures for House floor consideration of the budget resolution. The budget resolution sets spending, revenue, and deficit targets for the fiscal year and includes procedural regulations for subsequent actions on budget-related measures. It is a concurrent resolution that becomes effective upon agreement between the two houses, operating with the same force as procedural rules of the respective houses. The budget resolution includes procedural regulations for subsequent actions on budget-related measures, with provisions that can be altered through internal procedures. These procedural provisions often pertain to Senate procedures and may have bicameral application, but are not comprehensively compiled in any single source. The procedural provisions in the House are not comprehensively compiled in any single source but can be identified by examining adopted congressional budget resolutions. These provisions establish new points of order against budgetary measures and are recorded in the parliamentarian's annotations in the House Manual. House precedents are recorded in the Congressional Record and compiled in five official publications: House Practice, Deschler's Precedents, Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents, Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Cannon's Procedure. These publications provide comprehensive information on contemporary House procedure and compile precedents illustrating principles and proceedings. Deschler's Precedents cover precedents from 1936, Hinds' Precedents up to 1906, and Cannon's cover a range of precedents. House precedents are recorded in various official publications, including House Practice, Deschler's Precedents, Hinds' Precedents up to 1906, and Cannon's Precedents between 1906 and 1936. These documents provide a digest of the current House practice with citations of precedential and other authorities. House Practice is the most up-to-date reference source for rules and precedents governing House procedure. Members seeking precedents for parliamentary arguments should consult the Office of the House Parliamentarian for official advice. House Practice is a comprehensive guide to the rules and precedents governing House procedure. It was initially prepared by William Holmes Brown and later updated by Charles W. Johnson III. The guide covers 59 subjects of House procedure and is organized into chapters presented in alphabetical order. Each chapter is divided into topical sections for easy reference. House Practice is a comprehensive guide to House procedure, organized into chapters with topical sections. Each chapter begins with a list of main topics and citations to parliamentary reference sources. The text summarizes House rules and precedents for each main topic and subtopic. House Practice is a comprehensive guide to House procedure, organized into chapters with topical sections. It summarizes relevant House rules and precedents, including terminology for parliamentary actions and budget process rules. The publication's index helps readers locate specific procedural topics efficiently. The House Practice chapter on the \"Previous Question\" is part of Deschler's Precedents, a series covering House precedents established after 1936. The series, initiated by Lewis Deschler and continued by his successors, includes sixteen volumes to date. Additional volumes are being prepared under the Parliamentarian of the House, with volume 10 onwards titled Deschler-Brown Precedents in honor of William Holmes Brown's contributions. Deschler's Precedents covers House precedents from 1974 to 1994, with later volumes extending coverage to the 105th Congress. Citations refer to rules before the House recodified in the 106th Congress. Revisions will incorporate new precedents. Deschler's Precedents organizes precedents in topical chapters that mirror the House's order of action. Each chapter is divided into numbered topical sections, often grouped under broader headings. Most chapters begin with an introduction summarizing the principles presented by the precedents that follow. Individual precedents are presented in numbered subsections for easy citation. Precedents in Deschler's Precedents are organized in numbered subsections for easy citation. Each subsection includes a catchline, bold headnote stating the principle, followed by proceedings that establish the precedent. Some precedents may have a \"Parliamentarian's Note\" for clarification or further direction. The Deschler's Precedents provide indexed references to parliamentary procedures, with each chapter corresponding to Procedure in the House for easy navigation. The precedents cover motions such as adjournment and postponement, with additional guidance available in Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives. Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents is an 11-volume series containing selected rulings and precedents of the House of Representatives from 1789 to 1936. Volumes 1-5 by Asher Hinds and Volumes 6-11 by Clarence Cannon provide valuable coverage of House procedures' historical evolution. Cannon's Precedents serve as a supplement to Hinds' Precedents, with volumes 9-11 comprising a comprehensive index. Volumes 9-11 of Cannon's Precedents serve as a comprehensive index to volumes 1-8 of the series, organized into topical chapters reflecting the order of proceedings in the House. The content is presented in sequentially numbered sections, with citations typically including volume and number. Cannon's Precedents includes modifications to reflect changes in House procedure, such as a chapter on the discharge rule not covered in Hinds' Precedents. The text discusses how each chapter in Cannon's Precedents presents Rules of the House and individual precedents, with citations to the Congressional Record and other sources. Sections describe procedural exchanges, rulings of the chair, and principles discussed. Multiple sections may illustrate the same principle, with a bold headnote for the first section in a group. Proceedings that illustrate more than one principle are typically set forth in only one section. Sections in Cannon's Precedents may have multiple headnotes to illustrate different principles. The comprehensive index helps locate specific procedural topics, and Cannon's Procedure serves as an index to Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents. Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents is useful for specific precedents cited in the 11-volume set. Before House Practice, Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives summarized House precedents from 1959 to 1980. A 1985 supplement covered precedents from 1981 to 1984, replaced in 1987 by one from 1981 to 1986. House Practice was meant to replace Procedure. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, created from 1981 through 1986, is organized in 37 chapters covering various topics of House procedure. It can be used as a reference source for precedential proceedings after the period covered by Deschler's Precedents. The chapter structure of Procedure parallels that of Deschler's Precedents, making it useful for locating materials indirectly. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives is organized into 37 chapters with numbered sections and paragraphs. Each section contains principles established by precedents or rules. When cited, it is usually referred to by its title, chapter number, section or paragraph number, and page number. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives is organized into 37 chapters with numbered sections and paragraphs. Each section contains principles established by precedents or rules. Some paragraphs state general principles or present a Parliamentarian's \"Note\" without specific precedents. Procedure does not include descriptions or quotations from procedural exchanges but references specific precedents by citing the Congressional Record. The supplement to Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, organized similarly to the main volume, includes additional paragraphs that replace or add to the main volume. Cannon's Procedure is a one-volume summary of major precedents, including some from 1936 to 1963, selected by Clarence Cannon. Clarence Cannon's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives is a one-volume summary of major precedents selected by Clarence Cannon. It includes citations to Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents and the Congressional Record, as well as sample floor dialogues for parliamentary actions. Some dialogues may no longer be relevant to current House practice, so informed judgment is necessary when using this resource. The suspension procedure in the House of Representatives includes outdated features such as the requirement for a seconded motion by a majority and specific days for such motions. Informal practices, not formally adopted by the House, also play a role in governing House procedures. These practices, although not official rules, help establish consistent standards of action. Some House procedures are governed by informal practices that establish consistent standards of action. These practices include announced policies of the Speaker and memorandums of understanding between committees. Speakers have developed policies to carry out Rules of the House and exercise discretionary powers, reflecting their authority under the Rules. Speakers periodically announce policies reflecting their authority under House Rules, often consulting with minority party leaders. These policies are reiterated at the start of each new Congress, sometimes through unanimous consent requests or in the House Calendar's \"Special Orders\" pages. The House Calendar contains policies for the 110th Congress, including privileges of the floor, introduction of measures, unanimous consent requests, decorum in debate, electronic votes, handouts on the House floor, and use of electronic devices. Standing committees create memorandums of understanding to divide jurisdiction over policy issues. Memorandums of understanding are prepared by standing committees at the beginning of a new Congress to advise the Speaker on the referral of legislation when jurisdictional mandates overlap. The Speaker, guided by House Rules and precedents, may also consider these memorandums in making referral decisions. Memorandums of understanding are important parliamentary references for determining jurisdiction over policy issues. Some are publicly available in the Congressional Record, while others are not. They have increased in importance due to rules changes in the House, such as the elimination of joint referrals. Designating a \"primary\" committee at the time of referral has become crucial, leading to the development of memorandums of understanding in the 104th Congress. The internal structure of the House of Representatives includes committees and party conferences. Memorandums of understanding developed in the 104th Congress specify primary jurisdiction over issues, with some committees receiving new jurisdiction and forming agreements. Committees in the House of Representatives, established by House Rules, develop legislative proposals. Party conferences assign members to leadership roles. Each group has its own rules affecting House proceedings. House Rule XI regulates committee actions, requiring each to adopt written rules. Each standing committee in the House of Representatives must adopt its own written rules of procedure, covering aspects such as quorum, voting requirements, markups, and committee reports. These rules must be consistent with House Rules and are enforced within the committee but generally not on the House floor. The House Committee on Rules compiles rules of procedure for all House standing committees. Committees also publish their rules in various formats such as pamphlets or legislative calendars. The rules of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the 105th Congress are adopted by House Members of the respective parties during early organizational meetings after the November congressional election. These rules are printed and distributed to Members without annotations or references, typically only within the respective party. They are created by authority of the parties in the House, not through the full House's constitutional power to determine its rules. The rules of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the 105th Congress are adopted by House Members of the respective parties during early organizational meetings after the November congressional election. These rules are not directly enforceable on the House floor and are not official parliamentary reference sources. However, they are binding on party members and govern actions in House proceedings. Key components include selecting party leaders, assigning members to committees, and governing floor procedures. The rules of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the 105th Congress are adopted by House Members of the respective parties during early organizational meetings after the November congressional election. These rules are not directly enforceable on the House floor and are not official parliamentary reference sources. However, they are binding on party members and govern actions in House proceedings. Key components include selecting party leaders, assigning members to committees, and governing floor procedures. In House-Senate conference committees, rules can affect how the chamber considers legislation. For example, Democratic Caucus Rule 38 directs party leadership not to consent to the consideration of certain measures by suspension of the rules under specific conditions. Republican Conference Rule 28 imposes similar restrictions. Additional publications provide valuable information on House parliamentary procedure and practices. Floor Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives offers practical guidance on parliamentary actions, referencing House rules and procedural language. It consists of 18 sections following the daily order of business in the House, with an appendix containing an \"Abridged Parliamentary Dictionary.\" The \"Floor Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives\" manual includes a section on the new House Rules regarding \"earmark\" provisions in legislation. It aims to provide a concise guide to the legislative process for House Members and staff. The manual was originally titled \"Floor Operations Manual\" and has been revised by various Republican Members. The \"Republican Floor Operations Manual\" was first published in 1953 by the House Judiciary Committee and provides a summary of the legislative process focusing on House procedures. It has been revised by various Republican Members and distributed to House offices by the Committee on Rules or its Republican members. The manual serves as a useful reference source for understanding how laws are made in the House. The 23rd edition of How Our Laws Are Made, published in 2003, serves as a reference for House procedures. It reflects changes since the 22nd edition and is available online. The Senate also has a publication called Enactment of a Law: Procedural Steps in the Legislative Process, explaining Senate floor procedures and officials' functions. The document \"Enactment of a Law\" provides information on House and conference procedures, presidential action, and illustrations of legislative documents. It was last printed in 1981, but an updated online version was prepared in 1997 by Senate Parliamentarian Robert B. Dove. The online version reflects changes in the congressional budget process and Senate rules since the last printed edition.
