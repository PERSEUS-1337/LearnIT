    "content": "The \"Cuba Human Rights Act of 2015\" includes sections on findings, sense of Congress, statement of policy, public diplomacy, religious freedom, trafficking in persons, support for the Cuban people, and an annual report. Since 1961, US foreign policy towards Cuba has been governed by various Federal laws, including the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963, supported by Federal laws, enforce the US embargo against Cuba, regulating commerce, trade, travel, and telecommunications. The Cuban regime, controlled by the Communist Party, restricts various freedoms including assembly, expression, and access to the Internet and foreign media. The Government of Cuba harbors fugitives wanted in the United States, such as Joanne Chesimard, who is on the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist List. Chesimard, also known as Assata Shakur, was convicted of murdering a New Jersey State trooper and fled to Cuba for political asylum. Cuba continues to detain its citizens for peacefully expressing dissenting political views and denies workers the right of free association. The Government of Cuba controls all religious activity on the island, repressing religious freedom through harassment, beatings, detainment, and unjust use of treason laws. The Government of Cuba unjustly uses treason laws to repress religious freedom by accusing religious individuals of being \"counter-revolutionaries\" and illegally harassing, beating, detaining, and jailing them without due legal process. Cuba is also a destination and source country for commercial sexual exploitation. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and several Latin American countries have condemned the human rights abuses of the Government of Cuba. In anticipation of the Summit of the Americas in Panama, individuals affiliated with the Castro regime attacked Cuban pro-democracy activists and US citizens during a peaceful gathering. Colonel Alexis Frutos Weeden, head of Cuban intelligence in Venezuela, was also mentioned in media reports. Colonel Alexis Frutos Weeden, head of Cuban intelligence in Venezuela, was identified as one of the assailants in Panama who attacked Cuban pro-democracy activists and US citizens. Despite these circumstances, President Obama recently announced his intention to normalize relations with Cuba without congressional approval or amending relevant laws. The sense of Congress is that the US-Cuba relationship should not change until Cuba stops violating human rights. The United States should vigorously oppose Cuba's human rights violations, maintain sanctions and embargo, deny Cuba any embassy or consulates in the US due to security concerns, seek cooperation from other democratic countries, and consider countries' willingness to cooperate in its relations. Federal laws and regulations should not be amended. The United States should maintain sanctions against Cuba until it respects human rights, including releasing political prisoners, protecting freedom of religion, returning confiscated properties, and upholding freedom of assembly and expression. The United States should maintain sanctions against Cuba until it respects human rights, including releasing political prisoners, protecting freedom of religion, returning confiscated properties, upholding freedom of assembly and expression, and taking steps to end discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities. This includes allowing access to refugee programs and repealing laws that criminalize peaceful dissent and independent media. The United States should maintain sanctions against Cuba until it respects human rights, including releasing political prisoners, protecting freedom of religion, returning confiscated properties, upholding freedom of assembly and expression, and ending discrimination against minorities. This also involves investigating and prosecuting Cuban officials and companies involved in human rights violations, settling outstanding claims totaling $7 billion, and extraditing fugitives convicted in the United States. The United States should cease sponsoring terrorist organizations like FARC, ETA, and FALN, and extradite fugitives involved in crimes. The United States should take measures to counter Cuba's jamming of Radio y Televisioon Martii signals and maintain support for the broadcasting service. Additionally, if certain conditions are not met, the US should oppose Cuba's membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council. SEC. 6. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. Congress believes Cuba should be designated as a country of concern for religious freedom if certain conditions are not met. \n\nSEC. 7. TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS. Congress wants the annual trafficking report to include an analysis of human trafficking involvement by Cuban officials or government-owned companies, including minors in the tourism industry.\n\nSEC. 8. SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE. SEC. 8. SUPPORT FOR THE CUBAN PEOPLE. The Act allows for the donation of food, export of medicine, and other forms of assistance to Cuba as specified in the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress on various aspects, including whether certain conditions have been met, efforts to promote access to Radio y Television Marti in Cuba, and lists of individuals persecuted by the Cuban government for their human rights activities. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress detailing individuals persecuted by the Cuban government for their human rights activities. The report should also include a list of persons who may qualify for protections under US refugee programs and information on the development of the rule of law in Cuba, such as progress towards democratic governance and the processes for developing legal acts. The rule of law in Cuba is assessed based on the publication and accessibility of legal acts, support for decisions with written statutes, equal treatment under the law, and independence of administrative and judicial decisions from political pressure. The rule of law in Cuba ensures decisions are free from political interference and reviewed by appellate entities. Laws are expected to align with international human rights standards, including those in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Secretary of State collaborates with NGOs and human rights advocates, including Cuban-Americans, to gather and assess reports on human rights in Cuba. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom should be consulted when preparing reports and efforts should be made to incorporate their input in the final version of the reports."
