    "title": "SB 1389",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that false confessions obtained during police interrogations are a leading cause of wrongful convictions, especially affecting mentally ill or disabled individuals. Innocent people may confess to crimes out of fear of harsh punishment or to please authority figures. False confessions lead to three injustices: innocent people being incarcerated, real perpetrators remaining free, and victims' families experiencing double trauma. Mandating electronic recording of interrogations for adults and juveniles in California will improve criminal investigations and reduce wrongful convictions. Evidence of a defendant's statement or confession is crucial in criminal trials, but can also lead to wrongful convictions. Complete recordings of interrogations can help evaluate the accuracy of the confession and any coercive influences. The Legislature intends to mandate electronic recording of custodial interrogations for adults and juveniles to reduce wrongful convictions from false confessions. Recorded interrogations provide the best evidence, prevent disputes about officer conduct, and spare judges and jurors from assessing conflicting accounts. Section 859.5 of the Penal Code is amended to require electronic recording of custodial interrogations for individuals suspected of murder or specified offenses, creating a presumption of accuracy for recorded statements. There are exceptions to this requirement under certain circumstances. Electronic recording of custodial interrogations is required for individuals suspected of murder or specified offenses, with exceptions for exigent circumstances, refusal by the person being interrogated, or interrogations conducted in another jurisdiction in compliance with their laws. During custodial interrogations, electronic recording is required unless certain exceptions apply, such as when the officer believes it would compromise safety or disclose confidential informants. The failure to electronically record the entire custodial interrogation was due to a malfunction of the recording device, despite reasonable maintenance. Timely repair or replacement was not feasible. Electronic recording is not required for spontaneous statements made during routine processing or booking by law enforcement personnel. The electronic recording of custodial interrogations is required unless there is a valid exception, which must be proven by the prosecution with clear and convincing evidence. Statements not recorded may still be admitted as evidence if certain conditions are met. The prosecution must prove that statements made voluntarily were not electronically recorded due to specific circumstances during custodial interrogations. Failure to comply with recording requirements can impact the admissibility of defendant statements. Failure to comply with recording requirements during custodial interrogations can impact the admissibility of defendant statements. Non-compliance can be used to argue that a defendant's statement was involuntary or unreliable. If a defendant was interrogated in violation of recording rules, the court must instruct the jury to view those statements with caution. The interrogating entity must keep a recording of a custodial interrogation until a conviction is final or appeals are exhausted. Copies of the recording can be made in a different format. Terms related to this section are defined. For the purposes of this section, \"custodial interrogation\" refers to questioning in a detention setting by law enforcement likely to elicit incriminating responses. It begins when a person should have been advised of their constitutional rights and ends when the questioning is complete. For minors, \"electronically recorded\" means a video accurately capturing the interrogation. (B) \"Electronically recorded\" for adult custodial interrogations refers to video or audio recordings. The Legislature encourages video recording when available. \"Fixed place of detention\" is a location where individuals are held in connection with a criminal offense. \"Law enforcement officer\" is a person enforcing criminal laws or investigating criminal activity. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as per the Government Code."
