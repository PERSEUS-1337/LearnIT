    "content": "The Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes (PATH) Act, signed into law on December 18, 2015, made certain tax provisions permanent and extended others through the 2016 tax year. This legislation, categorized as individual tax provisions, is estimated to increase the deficit by $628.8 billion from FY2016 to FY2025, with $47.7 billion attributed to the four provisions discussed in this report. The PATH Act made three extender provisions permanent, including Above-the-Line Deduction for Certain Expenses of Elementary and Secondary School Teachers ($2.9 billion over 10 years), Deduction for State and Local Sales Taxes ($42.4 billion over 10 years), and Parity for Exclusion for Employer-Provided Mass Transit and Parking Benefits ($1.8 billion over 10 years). Another provision extended through 2016 is Above-the-Line Deduction for Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses ($0.6 billion over two years). The PATH Act indexed the cap for the Above-the-Line Deduction for certain classroom expenses for inflation, starting in 2016. Eligible educators include elementary or secondary school teachers, counselors, principals, or aides who work a minimum of 900 hours per school year. The provision now includes professional development costs as qualifying expenses. Qualified expenses for the deduction include books, supplies, computer equipment, software, and other materials. The deduction of expenses for trade or business is an itemized deduction, benefiting higher income individuals. It is allowed when miscellaneous itemized deductions exceed 2% of income, including employee expenses, investment costs, and tax preparation costs. Teachers can take a charitable deduction for donations to the school. Teachers spent $1.6 billion on classroom supplies in the 2012-2013 school year, with an average of $485 per teacher per year in unreimbursed spending. Spending on classroom supplies is estimated at $485 per teacher per year. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to make the classroom deduction permanent and index it for inflation. The value of the deduction depends on the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, with higher-income individuals benefiting more. The classroom expense deduction, valued at less than $100 at a 35% tax rate, is more beneficial for higher-income individuals. Deductions are concentrated in higher-income classes, with over three-quarters taken by those with incomes over $50,000. Educators may increase spending on supplies with this deduction, but a small cap may limit its effectiveness. The provision of capping the deduction for classroom expenses may not effectively increase spending objectives, as it could be seen as promoting tax system equity. This adds complexity to tax forms and may hinder teachers from being fully refunded for their contributions. The deduction, which benefits higher-income individuals, could potentially provide more benefit if included in itemized deductions for employee expenses. The PATH Act made permanent the option to deduct state and local sales taxes, which was previously disallowed under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Unlike the previous deduction, the current version allows for a deduction for sales taxes in lieu of income taxes for individuals who itemize deductions. Individuals who itemize deductions may deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes. Taxpayers can use IRS tables for deductions, but certain items like cars and homes are not included. The value of the deduction is higher for those with higher tax rates, mainly benefiting higher-income individuals. Taxpayers in states without income tax but with sales tax benefit the most. The sales tax deduction benefits taxpayers in states without income tax, providing an alternative means to reduce federal tax liability. In 1986, concerns arose about the deduction not accurately reflecting actual sales tax paid, leading to its potential elimination. The PATH Act extended the above-the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses through the 2016 tax year, allowing taxpayers to deduct postsecondary education expenses from their adjusted gross income. This deduction includes tuition payments and fees for enrollment at eligible institutions, even if paid with borrowed funds. It is not restricted to itemizers and can be claimed for taxpayers, spouses, and dependents. The deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses allows taxpayers to deduct education expenses for themselves, spouses, and dependents. The deduction is not available for individuals who could be claimed as dependents, married persons filing separately, and nonresident aliens. It is reduced by grants, scholarships, employer-provided educational assistance, and other nontaxable income. The maximum deduction is $4,000 per return for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income below $65,000 ($130,000 for joint returns) and is phased out at higher incomes. The deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses allows taxpayers to deduct education expenses for themselves, spouses, and dependents, up to $4,000 per return for those with incomes below $65,000 ($130,000 for joint returns). Taxpayers with higher incomes face phase-outs. Critics suggest consolidating education tax benefits into a single credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit are education tax credits that provide benefits for undergraduate education. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is more advantageous for most taxpayers compared to the deduction, as it has a longer coverage period and phases out at lower income levels. The Lifetime Learning Credit, on the other hand, is not limited in years of coverage but has a lower maximum deductible amount. The deduction for education expenses may benefit higher-income families, but its impact is limited by the maximum deductible amount. Over time, fewer taxpayers may qualify for the deduction due to income limits not adjusting for inflation. Confusion between education benefits like the Lifetime Learning Credit and the deduction may lead taxpayers to miss out on optimal benefits. The exclusion for employer-provided mass transit and parking benefits is now permanent under the PATH Act. The exclusion for employer-provided transportation benefits, such as transit passes and parking, is now permanent under the PATH Act. The dollar limit for employer-provided parking is $250 a month for 2015, adjusted for inflation. This provision aims to align the limit for mass transit with the $250 allowed for parking, introduced in 1984 to encourage mass commuting. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 increased the exclusion limit on qualified transit benefits to match the parking benefit limit, encouraging mass commuting. This exemption lowers commuting costs for all urban commuters and benefits higher-income individuals more. The value of transit benefits depends on the recipient's marginal tax rate and employer location. The provision targets taxpayers in urban areas or places with limited parking, encouraging mass transit use."
