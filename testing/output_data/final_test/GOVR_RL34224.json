    "content": "The rising cost of attending U.S. colleges and universities is a growing concern, with many Americans worried about affordability, access for low-income students, and the burden of student loans. There is little consensus on the reasons for rising costs or how to address the issue. College costs have been increasing significantly over the past three decades, with tuition and fees rising more rapidly than household income. In the 1976-1977 school year, the average price charged to students was $2,577, compared to $17,447 in 2005-2006, a 577% increase. The focus is on undergraduates, particularly full-time undergraduates, and how they pay for postsecondary education using student financial aid. Tuition and fees at public and private four-year institutions and public 2-year institutions increased by 41% and 36% over two decades, while mean household income only increased by 9% and 10%. The disparity is more significant for low-income households, with their income either slightly increasing or declining. The complexity of factors influencing college prices and the diversity of postsecondary institutions make it challenging to pinpoint the underlying causes of rising costs. Congressional involvement in addressing college costs has historically focused on these issues. Congressional involvement in addressing college costs has historically focused on student access to postsecondary education. As Congress considers the reauthorization of the HEA, additional actions at the federal level are being considered to address college costs and prices, such as creating price indices, incentivizing cost control, and increasing public information availability. The effectiveness of these strategies and whether they should be implemented at the state or institutional level remains unclear. An expanded federal role in addressing college costs may be considered as the HEA reauthorization debate continues. This report explores college costs and prices, including the concepts of cost, sticker price, and net price. It discusses influences on costs and prices, and relevant issues for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The distinction between cost and price in college attendance is emphasized. College costs refer to what institutions spend on education and related services, while price is what students pay. Price distinctions include sticker price (tuition and fees), total price of attendance (including other expenses), and net price (what students pay after financial aid). The net price in college involves what students pay after financial aid is deducted from the total price of attendance. It is commonly analyzed in two ways: affordability, which subtracts only grants, and access, which subtracts all financial aid including loans. This helps students and families consider the out-of-pocket cost of college attendance. Financial aid in higher education can come in the form of grants, loans, and work opportunities, increasing access to postsecondary education. The price students pay to attend college may not necessarily be reduced by financial aid. State appropriations are a primary source of subsidy revenue for public institutions, helping students pay significantly less than the full cost of their education. Private non-profit and for-profit institutions rely on various sources of revenue, including donations, endowment income, and tuition fees. State appropriations are the main source of subsidy revenue for public institutions, reducing the cost of education for students. Revenue sources for higher education institutions have shifted over time and vary by institution type. The main revenue source for public institutions in 2003-2004 was state support, accounting for 28% of revenues. Private institutions rely more on tuition fees, with 29% of not-for-profits' revenues and 90% of for-profits' revenues coming from student tuition. Public colleges have seen an increase in state appropriations over the years, but it now represents a smaller share of their revenues. The revenue sources for public colleges have shifted over the past 25 years, with state support decreasing from 44% to 24%. Private support, including donations and endowment income, has increased from 3% to 7% of revenues. Tuition and fees have also played a larger role, accounting for 13% of revenues in 1980-1981 and 16% in 2003-2004. Economist Howard Bowen's \"revenue theory of costs\" suggests that college expenditures are determined by revenues, leading institutions to seek more funding for various activities. In 2003-2004, total expenditures for degree-granting institutions were about $315.5 billion, with educational and general expenditures accounting for about $239.2 billion, or approximately 76% of the total. These expenditures are categorized into various subcategories such as instruction, research, public service, academic support, student services, institutional support, operation and maintenance of plant, and scholarships and fellowships. In 2003-2004, educational and general expenditures for degree-granting institutions totaled $239.2 billion, representing 76% of total expenditures. Spending on instruction was similar across institutions, with public and private not-for-profit institutions allocating about one-third of expenditures to instruction. Private for-profit institutions allocated 29% to instruction, with the largest proportion going to student services, academic support, and institutional support. The cost of higher education has been a topic of debate, with scholarships and fellowships accounting for a small percentage of institutional expenditures. In the 2007-2008 academic year, many full-time undergraduates attended institutions charging less than $9,000 in tuition and fees, with 45% at public institutions paying less than $6,000. This sheds light on the affordability issue for students. The cost of higher education is a debated topic, with only 9% of undergraduates attending institutions charging over $30,000 for tuition. Public misconceptions exist about college prices, with the general public overestimating tuition costs. Changes in tuition, fees, and financial aid can impact student access, school choice, affordability, and degree completion. This section focuses on sticker price, while net price data is discussed separately. The cost of educating college students exceeds the sticker price charged by institutions. Institutions make up the difference through subsidy payments supported by state appropriations, endowment earnings, private donations, and federal grants. Both public and private institutions provide some level of subsidy to students. For example, if the cost of education is $10,000, and the institution receives $8,000 per student in state appropriations, each student then faces a tuition level of 20%. Institutions subsidize students by covering the difference between the cost of education and tuition fees. State appropriations, endowment earnings, donations, and grants contribute to this subsidy. Even students paying full tuition are subsidized. Increases in tuition may not reflect cost increases but rather a decrease in revenue sources. As state appropriations decrease, tuition rises to cover the gap, with students bearing a higher percentage of the actual cost. The reliance on tuition and fees for revenue has been increasing over time. The largest source of revenue for public institutions is state appropriations, while private not-for-profit institutions rely on investment income and donations. Public institutions are increasingly relying on philanthropic support, while private for-profit institutions price education higher to make a profit. Public institutions provide lower tuition for in-state students supported by state subsidies, funded by tax dollars. State leaders believe it is best to educate residents for long-term human capital gains, so in-state students are charged lower tuition than out-of-state students. Tuition for out-of-state students varies by state, with some charging full cost of instruction and others indexing it to in-state prices. Despite higher tuition for non-residents, they may still receive subsidies through pricing policies and scholarship aid. Tuition and fees have steadily increased over the past 30 years, with a 723% increase from 1976-1977 to 2005-2006. Four-year institutions saw a higher increase of 744% compared to two-year institutions at 599%. Public institutions had a faster increase in tuition and fees (709%) compared to private institutions (665%). Figure 1 shows the average tuition and fees at public and private universities from 1964-1995 to 2005-2006, indicating a continuous rise in college prices. In the 1980s and 1990s, tuition and fee increases varied for public and private four-year universities. Public universities raised rates by 9.28% and 6.38% annually, while private universities increased by 10.53% and 6.45% annually, respectively. In the 2000s, public universities saw a rise of 9.26% annually, while private universities had a slower increase at 5.72% annually. Adjusting college prices for inflation using an index like the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) allows for direct comparisons of tuition costs across different years by adjusting prices to be comparable with a base year. This means that tuition increases over the past 30 years, when considered in constant dollars adjusted for inflation, are substantially lower. The increase in tuition over the past 30 years, when adjusted for inflation, is substantially lower. For example, from 1976-1977 to 2005-2006, the tuition increase in constant dollars for all institutions was 140% compared to 723% in current dollars. This trend is evident for four-year, two-year, public, and private institutions. Increases in tuition that outpace inflation can be seen, with average tuition at public and private institutions increasing by 723% from 1976-1977 to 2005-2006. From 1976 to 2005, college tuition increased significantly, with public and private institutions seeing a 723% rise. Four-year colleges experienced a 744% increase, while two-year colleges saw a 599% increase. This growth far exceeded the 243% increase in the CPI-U during the same period. Family incomes have not kept pace with tuition hikes, especially for low-income families. College prices have been growing relative to family income over the past two decades, with tuition increasing faster than income. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, tuition levels rose four times higher than household income growth. Despite some reduction in the growth gap in the following decade, tuition increases continued to outpace income growth across public and private institutions. Analysis by household income quintiles shows a similar trend of tuition outpacing income growth. During the mid-1980s to mid-1990s, tuition growth outpaced household income for all income groups. The lowest quintile saw tuition increase eight times faster than income, the middle quintile 20 times, and the highest quintile 2.5 times. In the following decade, only the middle and highest income groups saw income growth, while the lowest income group experienced a decline. Tuition continued to outpace income growth for all groups, with the lowest income group being particularly affected. The proportion of household income needed to pay tuition increased over time for all income groups, with the lowest quintile facing the highest burden. Tuition consumed a larger share of income for lower-income households compared to middle- or higher-income households, especially at public institutions. During the 2005-2006 academic year, tuition, fees, room, and board at public four-year degree-granting institutions averaged $12,108, while private institutions charged more than double this amount. The difference in costs between public and private institutions was primarily due to variations in tuition fees. The cost difference between public and private four-year degree-granting institutions is mainly driven by tuition and fees, with public institutions costing $5,351 and private institutions costing $19,292. Room and board costs differ by about $1,300. Public two-year degree-granting institutions have average tuition and fees of just under $2,000. In over half of states, public two-year institutions have tuition and fees less than or equal to 50% of public four-year institutions. Net price, which considers financial aid, is the actual out-of-pocket cost for students to attend college. In 2006-2007, over $149.0 billion was awarded in student aid from various sources, with the federal government contributing about 58% of this amount through grants, loan guarantees, and tax credits. Federal grant aid totaled $19.6 billion, while federally backed loan disbursements amounted to $59.6 billion, focusing on providing access to postsecondary education for low-income students. Total federal aid has grown 128% over the past decade, reaching $59.6 billion in backed loan disbursements. Grant aid to students from various sources totaled $63.9 billion, with federal aid representing about 58% of all aid in 2006-2007. State, institutional, and private aid have been growing faster than federal aid, with private grants increasing by 206% and private loans by 989% over the same period. Despite the significant contribution of non-federal sources to lowering net price, the focus here is on federal student aid programs, particularly Pell Grants and federal student loans. The federal government provides various forms of financial aid to help students pursue postsecondary education, including Pell Grants and federal student loans. Pell Grants, the largest grant aid program, are need-based and serve as the foundation for federal student aid. There is no specific income threshold for eligibility, but most recipients are low-income students. The Pell Grant program provides financial aid to low-income undergraduate students, with nearly $13 billion awarded to 5.4 million students in FY2006. The maximum Pell Grant award in FY2007 was $4,310. The Federal Family Education Loan and William D. Ford Direct Loan programs offer low-interest loans to help students and parents cover postsecondary education costs, providing $56.2 billion in new loans in FY2005. In 2003-2004, 76% of full-time undergraduates received financial aid, with varying percentages based on the type of institution attended. Over 41% of students at public institutions received federal loans, while higher percentages were seen at private institutions. In 2003-2004, 76% of full-time undergraduates received financial aid, with varying percentages based on the type of institution attended. 64% of students at private not-for-profit institutions and 78% at private for-profit institutions received federal loans. Nearly a quarter of full-time undergraduates at private not-for-profit colleges received federal work study. Similar percentages of students in different income groups received financial aid, but the distribution of aid by income group varies significantly. Reliance on loans to finance higher education is increasing. Reliance on loans to finance higher education is increasing, with students and parents borrowing nearly $28.8 billion in federal student loans in 1996-1997, expected to double to $59.6 billion by 2006-2007. A study on college price and financial aid in 2003-2004 showed that the average net price for all students varied by institution type, with lower net prices for low-income families. Researchers have studied the issue of tuition increases for postsecondary education, finding that prices vary between public and private institutions. Despite difficulties in pinpointing specific factors driving price increases, it is suggested that institutional costs do not strongly correlate with price hikes. Most postsecondary institutions do not operate like businesses, except for-profit colleges. Providing higher education is labor-intensive, making productivity gains challenging. Factors driving institutional costs include revenue availability, institutional aid, mission, faculty compensation, and class size. Specific costs faced by institutions include faculty workload policies. Institutions face various costs such as technology provision, healthcare, government regulation, facilities, enrollment, and student expectations. Mission and discipline can impact costs, with research programs and science programs incurring higher expenses. Technology access for students and staff also adds to infrastructure and updating costs. Some institutions have introduced technology fees for students to help cover these expenses. States vary in their approach to setting tuition levels for public institutions, with some prioritizing low tuition for increased access to education while others opt for higher tuition with significant financial aid for low-income students. Tuition-setting authority may lie with the legislature, state agencies, system boards, or individual institutions. The primary authority to establish tuition levels is held by state coordinating/governing agencies in 13 states, individual institutions in 14 states, and system or local district boards in 26 states. Five states grant this authority to the state. States vary in their approach to setting tuition levels for public institutions, with some prioritizing low tuition for increased access to education while others opt for higher tuition with significant financial aid for low-income students. When setting in-state tuition, state general fund appropriations have the most significant influence on this decision. Many states operate under informal incentives to limit tuition increases, while some have self-imposed limitations on tuition hikes. An NCES-commissioned study provides evidence on factors related to tuition increases. The increase in tuition at public institutions is influenced by factors such as a decline in state appropriations revenue and an increase in instructional expenditures. Public two-year institutions, however, maintain low tuition by making other changes rather than relying on revenue and expenditure adjustments. For FY2006, state tax funds appropriated for higher education operating expenses totaled $67.2 billion, representing a 7.1% increase from the previous year and a 14.4% increase from FY2004. Overall state appropriations increased by 54.7% from FY1996 to FY2006, with every state showing increases in support for higher education. Financial difficulties in states may lead to smaller increases or reductions in support for higher education. State appropriations for higher education have been increasing over the years, but financial difficulties in states may lead to smaller increases or reductions in support. Public institutions, especially four-year ones, may see a decline in state appropriations, resulting in higher tuition costs. However, research shows that changes in revenues and expenditures have less impact on tuition at public two-year institutions, which may maintain current tuition levels by reducing course offerings or services. This could potentially limit access to postsecondary education. State appropriations for higher education may decrease, leading to higher tuition costs and potentially limiting access to postsecondary education, especially for low-income and non-traditional students. This could result in less institutional aid available for students, affecting their ability to afford college. In a discussion of non-public institutions, IHEP categorizes them into three markets: highly selective institutions, competitive institutions, and proprietary institutions. Highly selective institutions are primarily private not-for-profit institutions with excess demand, competing based on reputation and institutional wealth. Competitive institutions compete regionally through non-price mechanisms and tuition discounting for specific student groups. Prices at private not-for-profit four-year institutions are driven by internal institutional budget controls and external market conditions, with factors affecting tuition being more varied compared to public institutions. Higher costs for institutional aid are among the internal factors associated with higher tuition. The higher tuition at private not-for-profit four-year institutions is influenced by internal factors like higher costs for institutional aid and faculty salaries, as well as external factors such as availability of institutional aid and state per capita income. Tuition discounting is a strategy used to attract students by charging less than the sticker price, but its effectiveness in increasing revenue and enrollment is uncertain. The practice of tuition discounting at institutions raises concerns about potential revenue contributions, diversion of funds from needy students, impact on academic programs, and the effect on pricing strategies. A recent study by the Lumina Foundation found that while tuition discounting can be successful at some institutions, its overall impact across all institutions is uncertain. Researchers have found that tuition discounting can have adverse financial effects on low-income students in terms of accessibility and affordability. Data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study shows that institutional grant aid for higher-income undergraduates increased more rapidly than for lower-income undergraduates between 1995-2001. The use of tuition discounting may not always lead to increased net revenue or attract the most academically talented students. The analysis focuses on the recruitment of academically talented students based on SAT scores and the relationship between federal aid, college prices, loans, and tax credits. While federal grant aid doesn't directly impact college prices, the effects of loans and tax credits are less clear. Limited evidence suggests a possible relationship between tax credits and college prices under certain circumstances. Concerns have been raised about whether increased federal aid contributes to rising college prices. The debate in the 1980s focused on federal financial aid's impact on college tuition increases. By the 1990s, the discussion shifted to the relationship between federal loan aid and price. Students apply for aid through FAFSA, which calculates the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Institutions use EFC to determine financial need by comparing it to the cost of attendance. However, federal grant and loan aid amounts are capped, which may not fully cover the cost of attendance, leading to concerns about institutions increasing prices. Research has shown no clear relationship between federal grants and college prices, but there may be an indirect link between federal student loans and tuition. Some believe institutions may raise prices knowing students can apply for loans to cover increases, using the revenue to provide additional aid for students. Increased loan availability could reduce the need for institutions to raise prices to provide aid, as students can receive aid in the form of loans. NCES found little association between federal grants and loans and tuition costs, but institutional aid was positively linked to tuition increases at certain institutions. The NCES study found that federal grants and loans did not lead to tuition increases. Data on the impact of federal tax credits on tuition hikes is limited. A recent Government Accountability Office study highlighted challenges in isolating the effects of tax credits, grants, and loans on attendance, choice, completion, or costs. States mostly did not raise tuition in response to new tax credits, but many promoted federal tax credits to help finance college. The analysis found a relationship between tax credits and state support for higher education and changes in college prices. State appropriations to public two-year institutions charging less than $2,000 fell after the introduction of tax credits. Institutions had incentives to increase prices for students benefiting from tax credits, as the credits increased student income. Public two-year colleges raised prices higher than expected, especially for tax credit-eligible students. Strategies to address college costs include tuition and fees, reducing costs, and college credits. States and institutions are implementing measures to increase affordability for students. Several approaches have been taken to make college more affordable for students, such as eliminating tuition and fees for low-income families at Harvard University and the University of Virginia, implementing a voucher system in Colorado, and linking tuition increases to inflation in Arizona, Mississippi, and New York. Other states have proposed freezing tuition and fees at a certain level for a specific number of years, like Illinois keeping tuition constant for four years starting in 2004. In fall 2004, policies to lock in tuition have been considered in various states like Kansas, Texas, and Indiana. This allows freshman students' tuition to remain constant for four years or more, similar to a mortgage payment. Concerns have been raised about potential price differences between cohorts. Many states and institutions are already taking steps to reduce costs, such as forming health-care consortia, linking employee contributions to salary, and focusing on employee wellness for cost savings. Some institutions are focusing on employee wellness to achieve cost savings. Others are finding savings by sharing services, such as building their own fiber-optic network or forming consortia for office functions. Institutions are also accepting greater financial risks for long-term savings, like raising insurance deductibles and altering borrowing strategies. Energy efficiency in building designs and renovations is being considered for long-term savings. Cost-saving initiatives include replacing full-time faculty with part-time faculty and instituting differential tuition levels for more expensive programs. Institutions are focusing on reducing college costs by implementing differential tuition levels for more expensive programs and outsourcing services like facility management and housing. States are also enabling students to earn college credits prior to attendance through dual enrollment policies in 47 states. Many institutions award high school students college credits through Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) programs. Texas recently implemented a law granting IB diploma holders 24 semester credits at public institutions. All states have credit transfer agreements, often between two-year and four-year institutions. Articulation agreements facilitate credit transfer between different types of institutions, benefiting students. Some states have general education core curriculum requirements to ensure transferability of courses. 37 states have common core courses for general education. Overall, 37 states have general education common core courses that transfer between institutions, with some offering benefits like junior status transfer. Nine states also use common course numbering to facilitate course transfer. The reauthorization of the HEA has been ongoing since the 108th Congress, addressing affordability and accessibility concerns for college students and their families. The federal government's role in addressing college prices and costs is a key issue, with Congress historically focusing on access to postsecondary education. There is a need to develop effective federal policies considering the diversity of institutions and price drivers nationwide. Balancing affordability and access while maintaining quality education is crucial for Congress, which traditionally has not taken a strong policy stance on college prices. Congress has historically focused on access to postsecondary education rather than addressing college prices. However, proposals for indexing college price increases have been introduced in recent Congresses, comparing tuition hikes to the Consumer Price Index. Congressional debate may center on using price indices to control tuition increases. The implementation of a price index requirement for college tuition and fees raises the question of which measure to use. Options include the CPI-U, which tracks changes in the price of goods and services, and the Higher Education Price Index (HEPI), which measures price levels in higher education. The HEPI was created in 1961 and is now managed by the Commonfund Institute. The HEPI, managed by the Commonfund Institute, measures price levels in higher education through a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities. It includes professional and nonprofessional salaries, fringe benefits, contracted services, supplies, and utilities. The index helps institutions understand the cost of maintaining the status quo by reporting price changes only. The HEPI measures price levels in higher education through a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities. It focuses on personnel costs, goods, and services specific to higher education, unlike the CPI-U which includes a broader range of items. Different index options have been considered, including creating indices based on a market basket of higher education goods and services tailored to different types of institutions. The HEPI measures price levels in higher education through a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities. Different index options have been considered, including creating indices based on a market basket of higher education goods and services tailored to different types of institutions. Price indices may face difficulties in distinguishing between percentage and dollar increases in price, leading to potential penalties for institutions with low tuition and advantages for those with high tuition levels. One way to address tuition and fee increases is to establish an index for evaluation, with exceptions for small increases. Institutions may exploit large increases before the policy takes effect. College costs refer to actual expenses for education. Reducing costs could help lower price increases for students, but it comes with challenges like student subsidies. One way to address tuition and fee increases is by establishing an index for evaluation, with exceptions for small increases. Institutions may raise prices to reduce student subsidies rather than to cover actual cost increases. Congress has proposed incentive programs to address college costs, such as providing grants to consortia of institutions working together to reduce costs. This could lead to more consortia forming and potentially lower price increases for students. Examining cost savings achieved by existing consortia can help determine effective incentives for controlling college costs. Encouraging institutions to control costs may be more feasible than other methods, but could impact the quality and quantity of courses and services. Providing funding directly to institutions for affordability, rather than students, is not the traditional role of the federal government in higher education. Congress has focused more on college prices than costs, but could consider alternative approaches. One approach to addressing college costs indirectly is by focusing on college prices through legislation. Encouraging institutions to reduce price increases may lead to reductions in cost increases. Other strategies include articulation agreements, credit transfers, and dual enrollment programs to help students complete their coursework. These measures could result in cost savings for institutions and lower overall prices for students. Transfer agreements, also known as cooperative agreements, facilitate credit transfer between postsecondary institutions. They help students understand which credits will be accepted, reduce time and money needed for transcript review, and potentially lower the amount of federal aid required. Congress could require institutions to disclose their credit transfer policies or restrict denials based on accreditation. The use of articulation agreements can help reduce the burden of individually examining transfer applicants' transcripts, potentially saving time and effort for institutions. However, if institutions are required to assess transcripts individually, it could lead to increased costs for students in the form of higher tuition and fees. Widely publishing transfer of credit policies can help students make more informed decisions about their postsecondary education. Postsecondary institutions and researchers agree that regulations add to the costs of providing higher education. There are concerns about the burden of regulation and the need for public accountability through less costly measures. Implementing performance-based models could allow institutions more flexibility in meeting requirements. Congress has considered supporting innovative approaches in higher education delivery. The program aimed to support innovative approaches in higher education and student financial aid delivery at reduced costs. It sought to identify and modify regulatory requirements for more efficient federal student aid delivery and access to distance education. Congress may consider reducing regulatory burden during HEA reauthorization. Providing students with better information could help them make informed decisions about their postsecondary education. Congress may consider how to make better information more readily available to current and prospective students in the higher education market. This includes data on college costs, completion rates, and faculty information, with a focus on improving existing data collection strategies. The National Center for Education Statistics collects data from postsecondary institutions through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System surveys. Concerns exist about institutions not responding appropriately to the surveys and time lags in data release. Existing legislation requires institutions to provide institutional information to students and families, but there is room for improvement in data presentation for better user understanding. The U.S. Department of Education collects data from postsecondary institutions through surveys and there are concerns about data presentation and accountability. Congress could use the College Navigator website to provide additional information to the public and improve the usefulness of the data."
