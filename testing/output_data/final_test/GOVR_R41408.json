    "content": "The term revenue is funds collected by the government from various sources like taxes, fees, and fines. It is essential for funding government agencies and programs and can impact individuals and businesses. Congress has the power to collect taxes as granted by the Constitution. Congress has the power to collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, which are essential for funding government agencies and programs. Revenue legislation can increase or decrease revenues, redistribute taxation, and make changes to various taxes. This legislation is routinely considered by Congress either as a standalone measure or as part of another bill. Revenue measures in Congress are subject to various rules and requirements, such as the Origination Clause and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. These rules aim to centralize the development of revenue legislation, provide information to lawmakers, and control the budget impact. They shape the content and timing of revenue measures significantly. This report analyzes revenue-specific rules in Congress, including the Origination Clause from the Constitution. It defines what constitutes revenue and centralizes the development of revenue measures. The Origination Clause in the Constitution dictates that revenue measures must originate in the House of Representatives. The Senate can propose amendments to revenue bills but cannot introduce them independently. This clause was established to give the power to tax to the chamber directly elected by the people. The Origination Clause in the Constitution requires revenue measures to start in the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court can review cases related to this clause, and if a revenue bill violates it, the law could be invalidated. The House and Senate have internal procedures for enforcing the Origination Clause. The House can respond to a measure violating the Origination Clause by blue-slipping it, formally returning the bill to the Senate. Blue-slipping involves a resolution stating that the House's prerogatives have been violated. The House can respond to a measure violating the Origination Clause by blue-slipping it, formally returning the bill to the Senate with a resolution stating that the House's prerogatives have been violated. This resolution is highly privileged and takes precedence over other motions, except a motion to adjourn. If the Speaker deems it valid, the House immediately considers the resolution under the hour rule and, if agreed to, sends it back to the Senate along with the offending measure. The House has a constitutional duty to enforce the Origination Clause and cannot waive this responsibility. The Senate can respond to a measure violating the Origination Clause in various ways, such as not taking action on the measure, referring it to committee, using a conference committee, or raising a point of order. Any Senator can raise a constitutional point of order, which is decided by majority vote. The Origination Clause can also be enforced by the Senate. The House and Senate rules grant jurisdiction over revenue measures to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Legislation with revenue provisions must be referred to these committees. The Budget Committees can impact revenue legislation by setting revenue totals in budget resolutions and including reconciliation instructions. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have jurisdiction over revenue measures. House rules require measures with revenue provisions to be referred to the Ways and Means Committee. The Speaker designates a primary jurisdiction committee for measures touching on multiple committees. The Speaker designates a committee of primary jurisdiction for bills and may refer them to additional committees for consideration. The Ways and Means Committee is typically the primary referral for revenue-related measures. House rules protect the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee by requiring revenue provisions to be referred to them. The Ways and Means Committee has broad jurisdiction over revenue provisions, including import restrictions. Congress may also consider measures with user or regulatory fees, which are treated differently than revenues. User fees, also known as \"offsetting receipts or collections,\" are treated as negative spending in the federal budget process. They are not considered revenue and fall under the jurisdiction of standing committees of the House, excluding the Committees on Appropriations and Budget. These fees are levied on a specific class benefiting from a governmental service to support that service, program, or activity. The fee must be paid by a class benefiting from the service, program, or activity, with a reasonable connection between the payors and the agency or function receiving the fee. The fund that receives the amounts collected does not determine the existence of a fee or tax. The Committee on Ways and Means can recast broad-based fees as excise taxes and may refer measures with user fee provisions. The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over revenue measures, including revenue measures generally, tariffs, and import quotas. Measures with revenue provisions are typically referred to the Finance Committee, even if they contain other subject matter. Multiple referrals to committees are rare and require unanimous consent. The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over revenue measures, tariffs, and import quotas. Multiple referrals to committees are rare and require unanimous consent. Senate Rule XV, clause 5 protects committee jurisdiction. The Senate Finance Committee can report revenue measures before receiving them from the House. House and Senate rules require specific materials for revenue measures. House and Senate rules require specific materials to accompany revenue measures, providing Members with information on the budgetary implications of the legislation. The Budget Act mandates revenue estimates for measures affecting current revenue levels. The Budget Act mandates that any revenue measure must be accompanied by a statement containing a projection by the Congressional Budget Office of how it will affect revenue levels for the fiscal year and the following four years. If the estimate is not available when the report is filed, it must be provided before the conference report is considered. The Congressional Budget Act requires the CBO to use revenue estimates provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation. House and Senate rules mandate that committee reports include cost estimates for bills in the fiscal year reported and the following five years. House Rules XIII, clause 3(h), mandates a tax complexity analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation for bills amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The analysis assesses if the proposed provisions would add complexity or simplify the tax code for individuals, businesses, or administration. Bills from the Ways and Means Committee must include this analysis before consideration. The House Rules require a tax complexity analysis for bills amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The analysis evaluates if the provisions would add complexity or simplify the tax code. The rules aim to bring transparency to the process of congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits in revenue measures. House Rule XXI, clause 9 requires revenue measures to include a list of congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits. Failure to include this list may result in a point of order during floor consideration. This rule aims to increase transparency in the process of requesting earmarks or tax benefits. House Rule XXI, clause 9 applies to limited tax and tariff benefits, defining them as provisions benefiting 10 or fewer entities. Earmark disclosure rules cover congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits. The disclosure requirements under House Rule XXI, clause 9 apply to directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits in legislation, including authorizing, appropriations, and revenue bills. These rules cover measures reported by committees, unreported measures, \"manager's amendments,\" Senate measures, and conference reports, but not legislation considered under \"suspension of the rules\" or certain types of amendments. Senate Rule XLIV requires certification of disclosure of congressionally directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits before a vote. Failure to meet certification requirements may result in a point of order against consideration of the measure or conference report. Amendments with additional items must be printed in the Congressional Record promptly. Rule XLIV does not apply to legislation considered under \"suspension of the rules\" or certain types of amendments. The Congressional Record must promptly print items such as congressionally directed spending, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits. These rules apply to specific tax and tariff provisions benefiting a limited group of entities. The disclosure requirements apply to various legislative documents, including bills, committee reports, conference reports, and joint explanatory statements. The rule can be waived by unanimous consent or a three-fifths majority vote. The annual budget resolution plays a key role in coordinating budget decisions and enforcing revenue totals on the House and Senate floor. The budget resolution sets revenue totals enforceable on the House and Senate floor and includes reconciliation directives to committees. It acts as a framework for Congress to consider legislation on spending, revenue, and debt limit. The resolution must include appropriate levels for total Federal revenues as required by the Congressional Budget Act. The budget resolution sets revenue totals enforceable on the House and Senate floor, including reconciliation directives to committees. It acts as a framework for Congress to consider legislation on spending, revenue, and debt limit, with appropriate levels for total Federal revenues as required by the Congressional Budget Act. The budget resolution also includes recommended revenue levels for future fiscal years. In fiscal years 2011 to 2014, federal revenues increased from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. The budget resolution outlines changes in revenue levels, with adjustments needed to reach desired amounts. Reconciliation directives may be included to help achieve budgetary goals. The budget resolution sets revenue levels and committees develop legislation to achieve budgetary goals. Revenue measures under reconciliation have specific rules. The budget resolution enforces revenue levels by prohibiting consideration of legislation that breaches them. Section 303(a) of the Budget Act restricts bills that increase or decrease revenue until a budget resolution is agreed upon. Section 303(a) of the Budget Act prohibits legislation that would impact revenues until a budget resolution is agreed upon, enforced by points of order in Congress. This rule ensures that all spending and revenue legislation aligns with the levels set in the budget resolution. The House can consider legislation exceeding the revenue level, referred to as the \"revenue floor.\" Section 311(a)(1) applies to all House legislation and can be enforced by a Member raising a point of order. The Pay-As-You-Go exception exempts revenue legislation from violating the \"revenue floor\" if it does not increase the deficit when combined with other legislation. The Senate's PAYGO rule, outlined in Section 311(a)(2) of the Budget Act, prohibits legislation that would decrease revenues below budget levels. This rule applies to all Senate legislation and can be waived by a three-fifths vote. Both chambers have used PAYGO rules, with statutory PAYGO reinstated in 2010 to prevent deficit increases. The Senate's PAYGO rule, established in the FY2008 budget resolution, aims to prevent deficit increases by prohibiting direct spending or revenue legislation that would cause an on-budget deficit. PAYGO does not apply to discretionary spending and only affects new legislation considered by Congress. It does not enforce changes in revenue or spending due to economic factors. The Senate's PAYGO rule, established in the FY2008 budget resolution, aims to prevent deficit increases by prohibiting direct spending or revenue legislation that would cause an on-budget deficit. The rule applies to any bill affecting direct spending or revenues and allows the use of a \"ledger\" to provide flexibility. Surpluses from earlier legislation can be used as offsets for future spending or revenue reductions, but deficit reduction from reconciliation legislation cannot be recorded on the ledger. The Senate's PAYGO rule, established in the FY2008 budget resolution, aims to prevent deficit increases by prohibiting direct spending or revenue legislation that would cause an on-budget deficit. Surpluses from earlier legislation can be used as offsets for future spending or revenue reductions, but deficit reduction from reconciliation legislation may not be recorded on the ledger. Provisions in a measure can be exempted by designating them as an \"emergency.\" The Senate PAYGO rule can be waived by a three-fifths vote of all Senators. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, known as \"statutory PAYGO,\" seeks to ensure deficit neutrality in new direct spending and revenue legislation enacted over a given year. The Senate's PAYGO rule aims to prevent deficit increases by prohibiting direct spending or revenue legislation that would cause an on-budget deficit. Statutory PAYGO is enforced through sequestration, where the President must make across-the-board cuts to non-exempt direct spending programs. Budgetary effects of new legislation are recorded on separate scorecards covering five and ten-year periods, with exemptions for emergency provisions. Debits are evaluated at the end of a session to determine if a deficit has been created. The President must issue a sequestration order if a deficit is found, leading to across-the-board cuts in non-exempt direct spending programs. Some programs are exempt from sequestration, such as Social Security and veterans' programs. House Rule XXI makes it harder to pass federal income tax increases by requiring three-fifths of the House to agree. House Rule XXI makes it difficult to pass federal income tax rate increases by requiring a three-fifths majority vote. Additionally, House Rule XXI, clause 5(c), prohibits retroactive tax rate increases. The Budget Act prohibits revenue-increasing bills from taking effect until a budget resolution is agreed upon, with a waiver possible by a simple majority vote in either chamber. House rules require revenue measures to be considered by the House in the Committee of the Whole, either under suspension of the rules or with limited debate and no amendments. This practice is established by Rule XIII, clause 1, and Rule XVIII, clause 3. Revenue legislation in the House requires a two-thirds vote for approval and may be considered under special rules from the House Rules Committee. The Senate does not have specific rules for revenue measures but may use the reconciliation process, which has unique procedures. The budget reconciliation process governs revenue legislation, enforcing revenue totals agreed upon in the budget resolution. Congress may need to pass legislation to alter current spending and revenue laws to achieve these totals and reconcile existing law with current priorities. The budget reconciliation process assists Congress in making changes to revenue legislation to achieve budgetary goals. Reconciliation directives included in the annual budget resolution trigger the process, detailing which committees should report legislation and the budgetary changes needed. The reconciliation process allows Budget Committees to assist Congress in implementing budgetary changes outlined in the budget resolution while protecting legislative committee jurisdiction over revenue laws. Directives instruct specific committees to report legislation to change current revenue law. Options for consideration of a measure under reconciliation in the House are similar to other major legislation. Reported legislation is typically considered once developed to satisfy the directive. The House treats reconciliation legislation differently by packaging the legislative language based on whether a single committee or multiple committees are directed to develop it. If a single committee is directed, it reports the language directly to the full chamber. If multiple committees are directed, they submit the language to the House Budget Committee for packaging into an omnibus measure. In the Senate, if a single committee is directed to develop reconciliation legislation, it will report the language directly to the full chamber. If multiple committees are directed, they will submit the language to the Senate Budget Committee for packaging into an omnibus measure. The Senate Budget Committee directs legislative changes to increase revenues, which are considered under reconciliation procedures outlined in the Budget Act. Reconciliation procedures expedite the consideration of legislation by limiting debate to 20 hours and prohibiting certain types of language in reconciliation measures. The Byrd rule in the Budget Act prohibits extraneous provisions in reconciliation bills, including those that increase the deficit or make changes to Social Security. Only one reconciliation bill dealing with revenue can be considered, with three types of reconciliation legislation possible: spending, revenue, and debt limit. The Budget Act allows committees to report on spending, revenue, and the debt limit, either individually or in combination to achieve deficit reductions. Committees may respond with separate recommendations if given multiple directives. However, current Senate practice limits reconciliation measures to one of each type - spending, revenue, and debt limit. This could result in up to three reconciliation bills being considered on the Senate floor under expedited procedures."
