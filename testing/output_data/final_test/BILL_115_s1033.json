    "content": "The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to include a new title VI on Stewardship Contracting. This involves redesignating sections and inserting new definitions. Title VI of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 introduces stewardship contracting, allowing the Chief of the Forest Service to enter into agreements with private individuals or public entities to achieve land management goals for the National Forest System. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allows for stewardship contracting to achieve land management goals in the National Forest System, which may include road and trail maintenance, prescribed fires, vegetation removal, watershed restoration, wildlife and fish habitat maintenance, and control of noxious weeds. \"SEC. 604. AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTS.\" \"Procurement for services under stewardship contracts is based on best value. Contracts under section 602 can be considered property sales. The maximum term for a stewardship contract is 10 years. The Chief can apply timber value as offsets.\" The Chief can apply the value of timber or forest products removed as an offset against the cost of services received under a stewardship contract. The value of timber or products used as an offset shall be determined using appropriate methods of appraisal. The Chief can enter into stewardship contracts under section 14 of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. The Secretary can designate the contracting officer for these contracts. Fire liability provisions must be issued within 90 days, similar to those in integrated resource timber contracts and timber sale contracts. \"SEC. 605. RECEIPTS.\" The Chief may collect amounts from a stewardship contract as a secondary objective to achieve the purposes of this title. The collected amounts can be retained by the Chief and used without further appropriation at the project site or another project site. The value of services received under a stewardship contract shall not be considered amounts received from the National Forest System. The Knutson-Vandenberg Act does not apply to stewardship contracts involving amounts received from the National Forest System. SEC. 606. COSTS OF REMOVAL. The Chief may collect deposits from a contractor to cover the costs of removal of timber or other forest products under the Act of August 11, 1916 and the Act of June 30, 1914. SEC. 607. PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT GUARANTEES. SEC. 607. PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT GUARANTEES. The Chief may require performance and payment bonds under the Federal Acquisition Regulation to protect the government's investment in receipts generated by the contractor from forest products. If the value of the products exceeds the cost of treatments, the Chief can collect residual receipts and use the excess for other stewardship projects. The Chief will establish a monitoring and evaluation process for stewardship contracting projects, involving governmental agencies and interested groups. Reporting requirements are also outlined. The Chief must report annually to specific Senate and House committees on the progress and outcomes of stewardship contracts, including the involvement of local communities. Amendments are made to the table of contents for the Healthy Forests Restoration Act to include a new title on stewardship contracting. Title VI of the legislation covers stewardship contracting, including definitions, projects, land management goals, agreements or contracts, receipts, costs of removal, performance and payment guarantees, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. Title VII includes provisions for a forest stands inventory and monitoring program, designation of treatment areas, and administrative review."
