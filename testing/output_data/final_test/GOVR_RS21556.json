    "content": "In May 2003, the US, Canada, and Argentina requested WTO consultations with the EU over its moratorium on approving new genetically engineered products. US argued that the policies hindered exports and raised safety concerns. Despite resuming approvals in 2004, some EU member states still block dissemination of approved biotech varieties. The EU restarted its approval process for GE crops in 2003, with the US leading global planting of GE crops in 2009. GE varieties were widely planted in the US for soybean, cotton, and corn, mainly for pest control. Market acceptance of GE crops has been easier in the US compared to overseas, particularly in the EU where consumers and governments are more cautious. The EU approved no GE products between 1998 and 2004. Between 1998 and 2004, the EU did not approve any GE products. In January 2004, there were 22 GE products awaiting approval. A bloc of EU states halted the release of new GE crops until stricter regulations for labeling and tracing GE-containing products were in place. This led to a significant decline in U.S. corn exports to the EU, dropping to less than one-tenth of the previous value annually. The EU's moratorium on approving new corn varieties already approved in the U.S. made it impractical for the U.S. to export corn to the EU. The EU's moratorium on approving new corn varieties, which made it impractical for the U.S. to export corn to the EU, violated WTO agreements according to the United States and co-complainants. They argued that there is no scientific evidence that genetically engineered food and feed crops are different or less safe than conventional varieties. EU officials defend their cautious approach to regulating biotechnology to build trust with consumers. The WTO dispute panel found that the EU had a moratorium on approving genetically engineered crops from 1999 to 2003, violating WTO agreements. Marketing or import bans on GE products in six EU countries were deemed to breach the WTO's SPS Agreement. The WTO dispute panel found that the EU violated the SPS Agreement by not ensuring timely approvals for genetically modified products. The panel dismissed other claims made by the US and co-complainants. The EU announced it would not appeal the ruling. The EU and US agreed on a deadline for lifting prohibitions on approved GE products, with the EU ending its moratorium on GE products in 2004. Various GE corn varieties have since been approved for human, animal, and commercial use, including the Amflora starch potato. The Amflora potato is the second GE variety approved for cultivation in 12 years, following the approval of MON810, a GE corn, in 1998. The US and EU are in technical discussions on market access for biotech products, while Canada and Argentina have settled their disputes with the EU through bilateral agreements. The United States and the EU are discussing biotechnology applications in agriculture and trade issues, including authorizations of genetically modified products, trade impacts, renewal of authorizations, and information exchanges on new legislation affecting biotechnological agriculture. The US follows the concept of substantial equivalence for GE products. The US follows the concept of substantial equivalence for GE products, while the EU takes a precautionary approach, regulating biotechnology products separately based on their unique features. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology guides federal regulations for GE products. The EU regulates GE products based on their unique features, using Council Directive 2001/18 for assessing risks before marketing. The EU regulates GE products using Council Directive 2001/18 for assessing risks before marketing. The amended directive now follows a \"one-door-one-key\" approach, with EFSA conducting risk assessments and the EU Council of Ministers deciding on product approval. The European Commission can approve applications by default if the Council fails to act within three months. The WTO case does not involve EU labeling and traceability regulations, which U.S. agricultural interests argue discriminate against U.S. exports. The EU has strict labeling and traceability regulations for genetically engineered (GE) products, requiring most foods, ingredients, and animal feeds from GE products to be labeled, even if they no longer contain detectable traces. A tolerance level of 0.9% is set for allowable \"adventitious presence\" of GE substances, with products containing more than 0.9% needing to be labeled. Meat, milk, and eggs from animals fed with GE materials are exempt from labeling. Traceability provisions require firms to track and keep records on GE products. The EU has strict regulations for genetically engineered (GE) products, requiring firms to track and keep records on them from farm to consumer. Compliance with labeling rules involves segregation of GE crops and foods throughout the processing and marketing chain, leading to challenges for U.S. shipments. Many U.S. manufacturers choose not to market GE products in the EU due to these stricter regulations. The European Commission is discussing new technical guidelines for GE products. The European Commission is discussing new technical guidelines for the allowable level of genetically engineered organisms in food and feed shipments for GE products approved in exporting countries but not the EU. US consumers are less fearful of GE foods than Europeans, with differing perspectives on food safety regulators. EU consumers have voiced disapproval of genetically modified foods, while US consumers have little objection. Europeans may be more wary of changes in food production due to past food safety crises. During the 1990s, food safety crises like Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and high dioxin levels in meat products in Belgium raised concerns among consumers in Europe. These crises, not caused by genetically engineered (GE) food, led to a general suspicion about food safety, impacting consumer faith in regulatory agencies. Environmental groups in the EU also expressed concerns about food safety. Environmental groups in the EU, like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, have raised concerns about the environmental impacts of EU regulations on GE corn and soybeans. European grain and feedstuffs traders are also worried about the strict limits on GMO presence, leading to feed shortages and high prices. COCERAL, the association of EU feedstuffs traders, highlighted the challenges in ensuring that corn and soybean shipments contain only EU-approved GMOs. Senator Grassley urged the US to take a strong stance on EU biotechnology regulations. Senator Grassley urged the US to take a strong stance on EU biotechnology regulations, expressing hope for compliance with WTO rulings. The Obama Administration faces the unresolved issue of how to proceed with the EU on biotechnology trade, with options to continue dialogue or pursue retaliation. The Bush Administration left this issue unresolved, and escalating tensions are a concern. The 111th Congress will likely continue monitoring the US-EU biotechnology dispute, with the possibility of requesting a panel to determine EU compliance with WTO rulings."
