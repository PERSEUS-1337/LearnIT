The Act \"SAVE Medicare Home Health Act of 2014\" repeals the Medicare home health rebasing reduction and codifies the CY 2014 payment adjustment by removing clause (iii) and implementing a 3.5 percentage point reduction effective for 2014. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will analyze the rebasing reduction in Medicare payments for home health services under the CY 2014 payment adjustment, considering various factors such as age, poverty level, gender, and rural areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will analyze the impact of the rebasing reduction in Medicare payments for home health services, including factors such as demographics of beneficiaries and caregivers, closure of agencies, job losses, and submit a report to Congress by February 1, 2015. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress containing findings from the analysis of the impact of Medicare payment reductions for home health services. Establishment of Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program. The Secretary of the Social Security Act will establish a post-hospital home health services readmission measure by January 1, 2016, and a resource use measure by January 1, 2017, for individuals receiving post-hospital home health services. The Secretary will develop measures based on input from stakeholders, provide quarterly feedback reports to home health agencies, and establish procedures for public reporting on performance. The Secretary will make public the performance of home health agencies on specified measures, allowing agencies to review and correct information before it is published. This information must be available by January 1, 2018. The Secretary will establish a home health agency value-based purchasing program (HHA VBP Program) starting in 2019, with incentive payments for home health services episodes. The Secretary may delay the application of a specified measure for the HHA VBP Program for up to 1 year if deemed impracticable, with notification to relevant committees. The Secretary can delay applying a measure for the HHA VBP Program for up to 1 year if deemed impracticable. Performance standards will be established for the measure, including levels of achievement and improvement. The HHA performance score will be based on the higher of achievement or improvement. The Secretary will establish performance standards for home health agencies, including levels of achievement and improvement. A methodology will be developed to assess total performance based on these standards, resulting in an HHA performance score. The Secretary will establish performance standards for home health agencies, including levels of achievement and improvement, resulting in an HHA performance score. The Secretary will rank the HHA performance scores from low to high for each year. Budget neutral withholding will be applied to payment rates for home health services to ensure no net change in payments. The Secretary will distribute withheld amounts to home health agencies based on their performance ranking to ensure appropriate value-based incentive payments. Agencies with higher rankings receive higher incentive payment amounts. Home health agencies are incentivized based on their performance rankings, with higher-ranked agencies receiving higher value-based incentive payments. Agencies in the lowest 40 percent of the ranking receive lower payment rates under this subsection. Under the HHA VBP program, home health agencies are informed of payment adjustments 60 days before the year, with adjustments only applying to that specific year. The total value-based incentive payments for all agencies must be between 50-70% of the total payments withheld by the Secretary. The Secretary will not consider adjustments in payments to home health agencies for subsequent years. Funding for program management includes a one-time transfer of $2,000,000 for subsection (f) and $10,000,000 for implementing the program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will submit a report on the progress of the home health value-based purchasing program by June 30, 2021. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will review the home health value-based purchasing program and make recommendations for improvements. They will consider unintended consequences and potential adjustments to the readmission measure to determine the impact of socio-economic status on a home health agency's performance score."
