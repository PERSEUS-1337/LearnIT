The Act, known as the \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act of 2015,\" defines key terms such as Administrator, Hydrologic condition, and Owner or operator of a water system. The Administrator refers to the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, while Hydrologic condition pertains to the quality, quantity, or reliability of water resources in a region. The Owner or operator of a water system includes various entities responsible for operating water systems, whether federally, tribally, or State-owned. The \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act of 2015\" defines a water system as a community water system, treatment works, or decentralized wastewater treatment system. It includes entities responsible for operating water systems, whether federally, tribally, or State-owned. The \"Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act of 2015\" defines a water system as a community water system, treatment works, or decentralized wastewater treatment system. It includes entities responsible for operating water systems, whether federally, tribally, or State-owned. Additionally, the Act outlines various components of a water system, such as domestic sewage, groundwater storage, water transport for irrigation, and floodwater management systems. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act of 2015 defines a water system as a community water system, treatment works, or decentralized wastewater treatment system. It includes entities responsible for operating water systems, whether federally, tribally, or State-owned. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program awards grants to water system owners for increasing system resiliency to changing hydrologic conditions. Grant funds must be used for water conservation or efficiency projects. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program awards grants for water system owners to enhance water management through various projects such as water conservation, infrastructure modifications, water quality preservation, groundwater remediation, and watershed protection. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program awards grants for projects that improve water management, including enhancing energy efficiency, supporting advanced water treatment technologies, and modifying existing systems for agricultural production to improve water supply. The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Program awards grants for projects that improve water management, including promoting conservation, efficiency, and water quality in agricultural production through practices like improved irrigation systems and groundwater recharge. Reducing flood damage and risk involves restoring floodplains, wetlands, and uplands, modifying levees and structures, acquiring flood-prone land, and promoting land use planning to prevent future floodplain development. Conducting studies or assessments is also essential. The curr_chunk discusses conducting studies to project impacts on water systems from changing hydrologic conditions and developing measures to increase resilience to rapid hydrologic change or natural disasters. To apply for a grant, the owner or operator of a water system must submit a proposal for program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement, along with research or data demonstrating the need. The curr_chunk outlines the need for research or data demonstrating risks to water resources and infrastructure from changing hydrologic conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of proposed programs, strategies, or infrastructure improvements in enhancing the resiliency of water systems to anticipated hydrologic conditions. The curr_chunk prioritizes water systems at greatest risk due to changing hydrologic conditions and emphasizes consistency with climate adaptation plans. The curr_chunk focuses on selecting applicants for funding based on innovative approaches to meet goals related to efficient water use, conservation, decentralized technologies, and reducing stormwater runoff. The curr_chunk discusses modifying existing water system infrastructure in response to changing conditions, improving water quality and quantity for agricultural and municipal uses, and providing multiple benefits such as water supply enhancement, flood protection, and ecosystem protection. The cost-sharing requirement for grants awarded by the Administrator is also mentioned. The cost-sharing requirement for grants awarded by the Administrator under this Act is that the non-Federal share of the cost of a water system program, strategy, or infrastructure improvement shall not exceed 50 percent. In calculating the non-Federal share, in-kind services can be included, but other amounts received from the Federal Government should not be counted. Davis-Bacon compliance is also required. Davis-Bacon Compliance requires that all laborers and mechanics on projects funded by the Act be paid prevailing wages. The Secretary of Labor determines these rates. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to enforce labor standards under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Administrator must report to Congress every 3 years on the progress of implementing the Act, including details on project applications received and funded annually. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 to carry out the Act. Up to 20% of the funds can be used for activities to reduce flood damage, risk, and vulnerability."
