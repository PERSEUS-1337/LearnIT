    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"California Compact Protection Act\". It includes findings related to the act. Congress provided a statutory basis for Indian gaming to promote tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments. Class III gaming can only be conducted in states with authorized gaming through Tribal-State compacts. California voters amended the State Constitution in 2000 to authorize class III gaming by federally recognized Indian tribes. Proposition 1A in California authorized class III gaming by federally recognized Indian tribes on Indian lands, allowing the Governor to negotiate gaming compacts subject to ratification by the State legislature. The State legislature's actions, including ratifying gaming compacts, are subject to California's referendum process, providing democratic oversight. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act respects States' authority to negotiate gaming compacts. The Tribal-State gaming compact process in California is undermined if Federal procedures are imposed without State ratification. Congress reaffirms the importance of the Act. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows federally recognized Indian tribes to acquire gaming lands outside of their reservation boundaries. Congress did not intend for tribal gaming facilities to be established on after-acquired lands against the State's objection. In California, off-reservation gaming proposals should be subject to the State's ratification and referendum process. LIMITATION ON ACTION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR ABSENT A VALID COMPACT: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows tribes to acquire gaming lands outside their reservations, but off-reservation proposals in California should be approved by the State. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act prohibits certain Class III gaming activities in California if the State Legislature or electorate rejects a proposed Tribal-State gaming compact. The Secretary of the Interior cannot prescribe gaming procedures, approve a compact, or consider it approved if not done within 45 days. The amendment to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires disapproval of a compact within 45 days of submission. It does not affect the Indian Reorganization Act or any other section of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The effective date of the amendment is April 27, 2016."
