    "content": "This report summarizes the issues surrounding the creation of a national land parcel database, or cadastre. It discusses the perceived needs, legislative and administrative options, challenges, and recommendations from a 2007 National Research Council report. The report emphasizes the necessity of a national approach for a rational and accountable property records system, highlighting the challenges and offering recommendations for a distributed system accessible through a web-based interface. The federal government plays a key role in coordinating and managing land parcel data on federal land. The Federal government has direct and indirect responsibilities for managing land parcel data on federal land. Legislative proposals have been introduced to create a national cadastre, with the most recent being the Federal Land Asset Inventory Reform Act of 2011 (H.R. 1620). The 112th Congress is facing issues with managing federal land parcel data. One option is to enact H.R. 1620 or further investigate the 2007 NRC report's recommendations. Consideration of potential costs is also advised. Private sectors are increasingly producing geospatial information. For more information, refer to CRS Report R40625 on Geospatial Information and Geographic Information Systems. The federal government's role in geospatial data production has shifted to coordinating efforts and managing information from private sector and non-federal government sources. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee highlights the need for fair data marketplace relationships. The Census Bureau had to duplicate street centerlines for the 2010 Census due to restrictions on using commercial data. The federal government's efforts to coordinate geospatial activities include a focus on land parcel data, with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) leading the coordination for federal lands. This is crucial for emergency preparedness and response, as well as monitoring foreclosure issues. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for performing cadastral surveys on federal and Indian lands, which are essential for land title records and land management. Despite BLM's role as a steward of federal land parcel data, a coordinated approach to federally managed parcel data is lacking. The National Integrated Land System (NILS) is a joint project between BLM and the U.S. Forest Service but is more of a set of technologies than a source of parcel data. Coordinating all land parcel data, especially produced for local and regional needs, remains a significant challenge. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) was established in 2008 to advise the FGDC on federal geospatial programs, noting the need for detailed property data during emergencies. This includes responding to natural disasters, home mortgage crises, wildfires, and managing energy resources on federal lands. Other considerations involve compensating local governments for tax revenue losses from federally owned land and monitoring climate change impacts. The need for a national land parcel database was highlighted by disasters like September 11, 2001, hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, emphasizing the importance of rapid access to land ownership data for emergency response. Land parcel data, along with building footprints and infrastructure locations, are crucial for managing disasters and assessing damage. Accessing cadastral data, which includes ownership information, may be challenging for emergency responders. The ownership of land parcels, or cadastral data, poses challenges in emergency management due to the decentralized distribution of data among local governments. A national partnership for assembling land parcel data could benefit federal assistance programs, such as those under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), by aiding in strategic goals like increasing home ownership opportunities and promoting affordable housing. The National Research Council (NRC) emphasized the importance of national land parcel data for effective management of grants and disaster response. Land parcel data is also valuable for monitoring anti-discriminatory practices in the housing market, complementing information collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) since 1975. Parcel data provide detailed information at the individual parcel level, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of mortgage and housing conditions. This data can help identify \"hot spots\" in potential foreclosure crises and potentially establish a national early warning system for financial events. The provision in P.L. 111-203 amended HMDA to include parcel data with other information, allowing for the identification and analysis of home foreclosures. This data could be used to apply for Community Development Block Grants to convert foreclosed properties into low-income housing, highlighting the need for a national land parcel database to track the effects of programs like CDBG. The FGDC Cadastral Subcommittee formed a Wildland Fire Project Team in response to the 2007 fire season, aiming to acquire parcel data to support wildfire analyses and responses. Coordination between the cadastral and wildland fire communities was emphasized to identify data needs for planning, response, and mitigation efforts. The Cadastral Subcommittee utilized GIS parcel data to map structures in the wildland-urban interface threatened by wildfires. After the 2007 fire season, they recommended increasing state-level participation, merging data resources, and expanding the use of parcel data for wildfire suppression strategies. The FGDC Cadastral Subcommittee utilized GIS parcel data to map structures in the wildland-urban interface threatened by wildfires. They recommended increasing state-level participation, merging data resources, and expanding the use of parcel data for wildfire suppression strategies. The subcommittee also identified the need for accurate survey boundaries and land ownership information for energy development management. The potential for making land parcel data available at various levels could benefit multiple stakeholders in emergency response efforts. The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is crucial for energy production on federal lands in western states. The Cadastral Subcommittee proposed an \"energy core\" set of information for efficient energy production activities. Consistent cadastral framework standards are essential for various applications, including wildfire support. Energy resources are commonly exploited on federally managed surface and subsurface lands in western states. The Cadastral Subcommittee emphasized the importance of seamless presentation of surface and subsurface ownership for managing energy resources on various types of lands. This includes federally managed lands, state, county, tribal, or privately owned lands, and split estates. The need for efficient management is highlighted in areas like Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia where shale gas exploration is taking place. Additionally, the potential implementation of a national or state-based system to limit greenhouse gas emissions could lead to the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. The transportation and underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial facilities may rapidly expand nationwide. Geospatial techniques and GIS could be used to manage CO2 reservoirs, land, and transportation routes efficiently. A national land parcel system could have benefits for mitigating climate change and impacting the U.S. energy and economic infrastructure. A national land parcel system could play a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness of emissions-reduction programs like cap-and-trade or carbon tax. It could help measure changes in ecosystems, agriculture, forests, coastlines, and other boundaries impacted by climate change. Additionally, land parcel data could be valuable for assessing the effectiveness of greenhouse gas reduction measures, such as forestry offsets. The Department of the Interior's Payments in Lieu of Taxes program compensates local governments for property tax losses due to federally owned land. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program compensates local governments for property tax losses due to federally owned land. One of the steps to calculate a payment under PILT involves tallying the number of eligible acres within a county, which can vary across different categories of federal lands. Inaccuracies in this tally could result in incorrect compensation amounts, especially since eligible lands are managed by multiple federal agencies, leading to inconsistencies in acreage calculations. Resolving issues raised by the NRC regarding a national land cadastre could help improve the accuracy of eligible acre calculations. The NRC suggests that a national land cadastre could refine acre calculations for the PILT program. Executive Order 12906 and OMB Circular A-16 established the FGDC and initiated efforts to create the NSDI, including cadastral data. BLM is designated as the steward for federal land parcel data and coordinates cadastral data, with the Cadastral Subcommittee making progress in setting standards. Some argue that data standards are no longer a barrier to a national land parcel database. Legislation like the E-Government Act of 2002 also addresses these issues. The E-Government Act of 2002 aimed to reduce data redundancy and promote collaboration for government geographic information. Despite efforts to coordinate geospatial information and land parcel data, the NRC found that federal land management agencies lack comprehensive parcel data sets. Many agencies recognize the need for parcel data but struggle to access it nationwide, leading them to create their own datasets. The E-Government Act of 2002 aimed to reduce data redundancy and promote collaboration for government geographic information. Federal agencies lack comprehensive parcel data sets and often create their own datasets without coordination. OMB revised Circular A-16 in 2002 to improve coordination, but some argue for stronger enforcement to ensure compliance. This could involve OMB taking a more active oversight role and enforcing compliance through budgetary measures. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee recommended the appointment of Geographic Information Officers in each department or agency under FGDC. They also suggested a geospatial leadership role in the Executive Office of the President to elevate the importance of geospatial activities in the federal government. The Obama Administration issued a memorandum in 2010 to provide additional guidance on implementing OMB Circular A-16, which could address issues raised in the NRC report on a national land parcel database. The supplemental guidance emphasizes the importance of managing geospatial data as a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) Portfolio to improve coordination, funding, and data sharing. It acknowledges past issues with federal investments in geospatial data, including lack of coordination, transparency, standardization, and interoperability. The supplemental guidance outlines a process for managing geospatial assets within the annual budget cycle, aiming to increase visibility and funding for acquiring and managing geospatial data. It addresses a disconnect between agency chief financial officers and managers responsible for geospatial assets, aiming to improve coordination and effectiveness within the geospatial community. The Federal agency budget formation process lacks expertise in geospatial management, leading to a disconnect in geospatial spending visibility. Representative Kind introduced a bill to develop a multipurpose cadastre of federal \"real property.\" The bill introduced by Representative Kind aims to develop a multipurpose cadastre of federal \"real property,\" coordinating with the FGDC and establishing standards for geospatial information interoperability. Similar legislation has been introduced in previous Congresses but has not yet been acted upon. The NRC recommends revising restrictive statutory language related to non-sensitive address data in Title 13 U.S. Code and geospatial data in the 2008 Farm Bill. Congress delegates Census responsibility to the Secretary of Commerce, with provisions for protecting private information. Any proposed amendments to make Census geospatial data more accessible could raise privacy concerns. The NRC suggests exploring policy options with Congress and the Census Bureau. The NRC recommended exploring policy options with Congress and the Census Bureau to allow digital data on building addresses and geographical coordinates to be publicly available while protecting privacy. The 2008 Farm Bill prohibits disclosure of geospatial information about agricultural land, but the NGAC suggests revising the statutory language to enhance the value of geospatial data without compromising privacy. The E-Government Act of 2002 calls for common protocols for geographic information to reduce redundancy among federal agencies. There are proposals to amend the act to include a national cadastre and enable broader sharing of address data for a national land parcel database. The NRC found a lack of coordination in a national land parcel database. They made nine recommendations, including establishing federal and national land parcel coordinators. BLM could coordinate federal data, but other agencies like DHS or GSA are also options. The NRC recommended establishing a panel to recommend agency leadership for a national land parcel database. FGDC should identify the role of parcel data in the geospatial infrastructure, and a systematic review of data themes should be conducted. The federal land parcel coordinator should develop a single database for federal land parcels. The government is urged to establish a national land parcel coordinator to oversee a single database for federal property. Additionally, an Indian Lands Parcel Coordinator should be created for Indian trust parcels to reduce redundancies in mapping efforts. Congress and the Bureau of the Census should explore policy options for sharing digital data on building addresses and geographic coordinates. The national land parcel coordinator should adopt the 50-States Initiative to establish state parcel data coordinators and develop a funding program for parcel data maintenance. The National Research Council (NRC) recommended that the plan for land parcel data should include financial incentives for local governments, require new funding, and mandate certain parcel data to be publicly available. Challenges to a national approach include confidentiality, cost, collaboration, and incentives for participation. NRC emphasized that organizational and political issues outweigh financial and technical concerns in implementing a national cadastre. The organizational and political challenges of creating a national approach to parcel data are complex. Overcoming boundaries between governmental entities and federal agencies is difficult. The lack of political will is a significant hurdle. Determining the benefits and costs of a national parcel data system is challenging. The National Research Council (NRC) highlighted the benefits of a nationally integrated system, including reduced fraud, fairer tax assessments, improved emergency management, and economic development. Local governments may be hesitant to participate due to concerns about data accuracy, releasing information, and unfunded mandates. The NRC reported concerns about private firms harvesting data from local governments without benefits in return. Local political leaders may struggle with approving budget requests for technical projects without clear benefits. Organizational issues are complex with over 3,000 potential producers of parcel data. The NSGIC also emphasizes the need for better coordination and national spatial data. NSGIC supports national spatial data infrastructure and the 50-States Initiative for land parcel data coordination. WGA also advocates for federal-state collaboration in GIS activities and data sharing. BLM is working with governments to develop standardized parcel data. The Western Governors Association (WGA) has called on Congress to provide funding for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to complete, enhance, and maintain the Cadastral National Spatial Data Infrastructure (Cadastral NSDI) in collaboration with state, tribal, and local governments. The estimated funding needed is $350 million over three years, with additional funding for maintenance and enhancements in the following years."
