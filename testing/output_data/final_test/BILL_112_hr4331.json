DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY AND SELECTION OF PILOT PROJECT NATIONAL FORESTS. Congress recognizes the urgent need to address deteriorating forest health, extreme fire hazard, and the risk of devastating wildfires in certain national forests due to various factors. The Secretary is required to designate at least one national forest in each affected state as experiencing emergency circumstances within 60 days of this Act's enactment. The text chunk highlights the urgent need to address emergency circumstances in national forests, such as pine beetle infestation, drought, disease, or storm damage, leading to the imminent risk of devastating wildfires. The designation for such conditions should not exceed 10 years. SEC. 5. Application of expedited procedures and activities of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to designated Forest Service pilot projects. Title I of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 applies to Forest Service projects in designated national forests during emergency circumstances. Section 322 of Public Law 102-381 does not apply to projects under this section. Modifications may be required when applying the Act to Forest Service projects. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 applies to Forest Service projects in designated national forests, with modifications including authorization for hazardous fuel reduction projects and addressing infestations of disease or insects. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allows the Secretary to proceed with projects in designated national forests despite the presence of disease or insect infestations if there is a risk of spread. Forest Service projects under the Act are not limited by acreage restrictions. Projects under 10,000 acres are categorically excluded from certain requirements. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allows the Secretary to proceed with projects in designated national forests despite restrictions on vegetation removal. Certain areas are excluded from this provision, such as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System and congressionally designated wilderness study areas. The Forests Restoration Act of 2003 allows the Secretary to proceed with projects in designated national forests despite restrictions on vegetation removal. No court in the United States can issue restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, or injunctions pending appeal regarding decisions on timber sales in designated national forests. Section 705 of title 5, United States Code, does not apply to challenges to these sales. SEC. 6. GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY. In this section, the Secretary of Agriculture may enter into agreements with State foresters to provide restoration and protection services on National Forest System land in eligible States. The State forester is defined as the head of a State agency overseeing forestry programs in such States. Authorized services under the agreement include treating insect-infected trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and restoring forest, rangeland, and watershed health. State foresters may act as agents for the Secretary in providing these services. Subcontracts can be made by State foresters following applicable procedures. State foresters can enter subcontracts for restoration and protection services under cooperative agreements. Timber sales regulations do not apply to services under these agreements. State foresters cannot delegate NEPA responsibilities for services on National Forest System land. The restoration and protection services provided under this section are carried out on a project-to-project basis by the Forest Service under existing authorities."
