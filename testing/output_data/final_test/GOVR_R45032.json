    "content": "The Unified Agenda, published by the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) for the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), helps agencies meet transparency requirements under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866. The Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to prepare an agenda of regulations under development or review to involve the public and resolve conflicts early. The Unified Agenda helps agencies meet transparency requirements under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Unified Agenda provides a list of upcoming regulatory actions by agency in categories such as active, completed, and long-term actions. It helps agencies meet transparency requirements and involves the public in the regulatory process. The Unified Agenda categorizes regulatory actions into active, completed, long-term, and inactive actions. These categories include searchable data elements such as the issuing agency, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), action abstract, timetable of past actions, and projected date for the next regulatory action. Priority levels are also indicated, such as whether the rule is economically significant or considered a major rule. The Unified Agenda categorizes regulatory actions into active, completed, long-term, and inactive actions. It includes data elements like the issuing agency, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), action abstract, timetable of past actions, and projected date for the next regulatory action. Priority levels are indicated, such as whether the rule is economically significant or considered a major rule. The forthcoming editions may have a different classification system to separate deregulatory actions from regulatory actions. Agencies may indicate which items are regulatory and which are deregulatory in future editions. Future editions of the Unified Agenda may include information on agencies' compliance with the Trump Administration's regulatory budget. The \"Update\" edition of the Unified Agenda in July 2017 focused on deregulation and revealed a list of regulations established during the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration seems to emphasize the importance of listing regulatory actions in the Agenda. President Trump signed EO 13771 on January 30, 2017, requiring all regulations approved during the budget process to be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda. OIRA issued guidance on implementing this order on April 5, 2017. OMB is requiring agencies to include cost offsets of new regulations in their submissions for the Unified Agenda, as stated in the guidance on implementing EO 13771. This requirement aims to ensure compliance with the one-in, two-out policy and facilitate regulatory budget planning for fiscal year 2018. In the fiscal year 2018 regulatory budget planning process, agencies are requested to provide a preliminary estimate of costs or savings for planned regulatory actions and deregulatory actions. Independent regulatory agencies are not required to follow Executive Order 13771 but are encouraged to identify regulations for cost savings. Future Unified Agenda editions may include information on the Trump Administration's actions. The Unified Agenda may now include details about the Trump Administration's regulatory budget. The Obama Administration had a hidden category of regulations called \"pending\" in the Unified Agenda, created around 2011. Agencies were informally asked to remove rules not actively considered, but if resumed later, a new RIN would be needed. Multiple RINs for one rule could cause confusion. The Trump Administration decided to make the list of \"pending\" rules public in the 2017 Update to the Unified Agenda, contrary to the Obama Administration's practice of keeping them hidden. This move was aimed at increasing transparency in the regulatory process. The 2017 Update to the Unified Agenda made the list of \"pending\" rules public, previously kept hidden by the Obama Administration. The list, now referred to as \"inactive,\" is posted on OIRA's website for transparency. ACUS commended this action on its website, providing an overview of the content and statistics of the Agenda. Examples of major rules with significant economic impact are categorized based on their effects on small businesses and other organizations. The 2017 Update to the Unified Agenda includes rulemaking actions that may affect small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, or nonprofits. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires agencies to assess impacts on entities with expenditures exceeding $100 million. Reclassified long-term actions are included in the update, with a total of 3,521 rulemaking actions - 1,731 active, 1,094 completed, and 696 long-term. Withdrawn actions make up 13% of the total. Table 1 provides summary-level data on rulemaking actions in the 2017 Update. In the 2017 Update, there are 62 major and/or economically significant active rulemaking actions, with 5 in the \"prerule\" stage, 26 in the \"proposed rule\" stage, and 31 in the \"final rule\" stage. HHS, DOE, and the EPA account for over half of these actions. Additionally, 5 actions are rescinding rules or proposing implementation delays. The 2017 Update includes 62 major rulemaking actions, with 6 expected to significantly impact small entities. These actions cover various areas such as transit worker protection, patent fees, tip regulations, Medicare programs, and care coordination models. The 2017 Update includes 469 rulemaking actions withdrawn since Fall 2016, totaling over $100 million in expenditures by state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector. Key examples include DOE's energy conservation standards, DOL/EBSA's Form 5500 Series revision, and EPA's renewable fuel volume standards. Ten agencies accounted for 91% of the withdrawn actions. Ten agencies accounted for 91% of the 429 withdrawn actions listed, with DOI withdrawing the most actions (114) followed by HHS (69) and USDA (62). The withdrawn actions were classified based on rule priority levels, with approximately 58% classified as \"Substantive, Nonsignificant.\" Actions classified as \"Routine and Frequent\" and \"Info./Admin./Other\" comprised a low percentage (5%) of the total withdrawn actions. In the 2017 Update, withdrawn actions were categorized based on rule priority levels, with economically significant actions comprising 4%. Examples of major withdrawn actions impacting small entities included HHS/FDA's \"Suspension of Food Facility Registration\" and HHS/CMS's \"Part B Drug Payment Model.\" The 2017 Update includes 696 long-term rulemaking actions across various government agencies. The FCC had the largest portion of long-term actions, with 109 listed, accounting for 16% of the total. The 2017 Update includes 696 long-term rulemaking actions across various government agencies. The FCC had the largest portion of long-term actions, with 109 listed, accounting for 16% of the total. Other agencies with significant long-term actions included DOT (85) and DHS (76). Seven agencies listed only one long-term action each. The majority of long-term actions were classified as \"Substantive, Nonsignificant,\" while a small portion fell into the categories of \"Routine and Frequent\" and \"Info./Admin./Other.\" Some major and/or economically significant long-term actions were reclassified in the 2017 Update, indicating a reduction in their significance by the Trump Administration. Six major and economically significant long-term actions may impact small entities and trigger RFA requirements: HHS/CMS changes for hospitals and critical access hospitals, revisions for discharge planning, program integrity enhancements, DOT/NHTSA retroreflective tape for trucks, DOT/FAA requirements for renewable energy projects, and STATE exchange visitors for camp counselors. Eight long-term actions are expected to exceed $100 million in expenditures by state and local governments. Eight long-term actions are expected to result in expenditures exceeding $100 million by state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector. These actions include energy conservation standards for manufactured housing, updated labeling standards for pet food, collection of alien biometric data upon exit from the United States, Ammonium Nitrate Security Program, Importer Security Filing requirements, General Aviation Security measures, National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for Radon, and Accidental Release Prevention Requirements under the Clean Air Act. The Trump Administration intends to tie agency progress on deregulation with the issuance of the Unified Agenda and regulatory plans. This includes actions such as the Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program, Fossil Fuel-Generated Energy Consumption Reduction, Passenger Car and Light Truck Fuel Economy Standards, Water Resources Reform Development Act Farm Amendments, Postmarketing Safety Reporting Requirements, and Assessment of Fees for Large Bank Holding Companies. The Trump Administration links agency deregulation progress to the Unified Agenda and regulatory plans. Regulatory budgets set cost caps for new regulations, with OMB determining caps for each agency annually. Executive Order 13771 established zero cost caps for FY2017, allowing incremental costs for new regulations in subsequent years. OIRA Administrator Neomi Rao directed agencies to propose net offsets for new regulations. OIRA Administrator Neomi Rao instructed covered agencies to propose a net reduction in total incremental regulatory costs for FY2018, with final cost allowances to be published in the Fall 2017 Unified Agenda. Future editions of the Unified Agenda may provide more details on the Trump Administration's regulatory budget implementation."
