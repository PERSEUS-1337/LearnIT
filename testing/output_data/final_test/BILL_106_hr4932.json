(a) Application of Presumptive Eligibility Under SCHIP and Reduction of State Match for Outreach if Elect Presumptive Eligibility. A State may elect to apply the provisions of section 1920A under this title in the same manner as the State may elect to apply such provisions under title XIX. Additionally, there is a reduction of state matching requirement under Section 2105 of the Social Security Act. The new subsection (g) provides a 90 percent federal match for additional outreach expenditures if a State elects to use presumptive eligibility for both Medicaid and SCHIP. The amendments made by this subsection take effect upon the enactment of the Act. The Act clarifies the use of SCHIP funds for enrolling centers to provide incentives for low-income children. Reasonable expenditures for enrollment incentives are treated as costs incurred by the State for plan administration.

The amendments apply to expenditures made after the Act's enactment date. The Act allows SCHIP funds to be used for enrollment incentives at enrolling centers for low-income children, treating these expenditures as costs incurred by the State for plan administration. Amendments apply to expenditures made after the Act's enactment date, including the availability of enrollment performance incentive bonuses from reallocation. Section 2105 of the Social Security Act allows for enrollment performance incentive bonus payments to bonus eligible States based on meeting or exceeding objectives. The bonus eligible States are determined for each fiscal year. The paragraph describes the criteria for a State to receive enrollment performance incentive bonus payments under Section 2105 of the Social Security Act. The State must not have had any previous allotment redistributed to another State, and must meet or exceed enrollment objectives for low-income children. The payment does not require a non-Federal contribution, can be used for permitted expenditures, and is not included in certain limitations. The curr_chunk states that certain payments may not be included in determining non-Federal contributions required under subsection (a). SEC. 7 amends Section 2102(c)(1) of the Act to include school-based programs for schools with high rates of uninsured children. The effective date is October 1, 2000. SEC. 8 extends authorization of graduate medical education funding for children's hospitals. Section 340E of the Public Health Service Act is amended to extend funding authorization for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. This includes provisions for the availability of funds for obligation through the end of the succeeding fiscal year. Optional coverage for low-income, uninsured pregnant women under a state child health plan is provided in Section 2112 of the Social Security Act. Optional coverage for pregnancy-related assistance for targeted low-income pregnant women can be provided by a State child health plan if the State has set an income eligibility level at 185 percent of the official poverty line. Pregnancy-related assistance includes services related to pregnancy, such as prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services. The term 'targeted low-income pregnant woman' refers to pregnant women who meet the income eligibility level set by the State child health plan for pregnancy-related assistance. This assistance includes prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services. Special rules apply to ensure coverage for these women under the plan. The Medicaid program extends coverage to targeted low-income pregnant women, with references to child health assistance deemed as pregnancy-related assistance. The income level for eligibility is based on the level established under section 1902(l)(2)(A). Additionally, certain limitations on health insurance coverage apply for services described in subsection (b)(1) under section 2103. Compliance with section 2105(a)(1) is not required in such cases. The Medicaid program covers targeted low-income pregnant women, with no exclusion of benefits for pre-existing conditions or waiting periods. The amount of initial allotment to a State remains unaffected. Funding for coverage is subject to restrictions, and children born to women receiving pregnancy-related assistance are automatically enrolled. Children born to targeted low-income pregnant women receiving pregnancy-related assistance are automatically deemed to have applied for child health assistance under the State plan until they reach 1 year of age, as long as they are part of the woman's household and she remains eligible for assistance. Children born to targeted low-income pregnant women are automatically deemed to have applied for child health assistance under the State plan until they turn 1 year old. The child's eligibility identification number is the same as the mother's, unless a separate number is issued by the State. States have the option to use enhanced FMAP for coverage of additional pregnant women under Medicaid. The text chunk discusses the conditions for a State plan regarding income levels for individuals under Medicaid. It mentions establishing an income level at 185 percent of the official poverty line for certain individuals. Additionally, it includes amendments to the Social Security Act related to medical assistance expenditures for women with incomes exceeding a specified level. The Social Security Act is amended to prohibit a waiting period for pregnant low-income children if the State covers pregnancy-related assistance. These amendments take effect upon the enactment of the Act and apply to all fiscal years."
