    "content": "The housing bubble burst in 2007, leading to a downturn in the housing and mortgage markets. Various housing finance reform plans have been proposed to prevent taxpayers from providing future assistance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were placed in conservatorship in 2008 and have received $187 billion in assistance. The Department of the Treasury purchased preferred stock from GSEs, with significant dividend payments made to compensate for assistance and risk. FHA received $1.7 billion from Treasury in FY2013 under the Federal Credit Reform Act to cover future mortgage costs. The FHA does not anticipate needing additional funds from Treasury in FY2014, but concerns persist about its financial stability. The federal government's increased role in the mortgage market since 2008 is evident through agencies like FHA, VA, USDA, and Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae and the GSEs have collectively funded 75% to 85% of annual mortgage originations since 2008. The goal is to ensure mortgage credit availability and affordability for creditworthy borrowers. Reform proposals aim to make mortgage credit and products like the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage available and affordable to creditworthy borrowers. Different plans have varying approaches due to differing views on market problems, such as the slow return of private capital and the government's role in crowding out the private sector. Shrinking the government's involvement and establishing clear guidelines are suggested solutions. The 113th Congress has seen developments in housing finance reform, with proposals to wind down GSEs and reform FHA. Some argue for reducing government involvement to encourage private sector participation, while others highlight the need for government guarantees to ensure credit availability. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs reported the Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act (S. 1217) with amendments. Senator Corker introduced S. 1217, also known as the \"Corker-Warner GSE bill.\" The committee later agreed to a substitute amendment by Chairman Tim Johnson, resulting in the \"Johnson-Crapo GSE bill.\" This report compares S. 1217 with the PATH Act and mentions the separate FHA reform bill, the FHA Solvency Act of 2013 (S. 1376; Johnson-Crapo FHA bill). This report discusses legislative proposals for housing finance reform, focusing on replacing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and reforming FHA. The housing finance system consists of a primary market where loans are originated and a secondary market where loans are bought and sold, with government involvement in both markets, particularly through FHA as the largest provider of government mortgage insurance. FHA, a part of HUD, provides mortgage insurance on loans meeting its requirements in exchange for fees. Ginnie Mae guarantees MBS composed of FHA-insured mortgages, transferring credit risk to the government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also operate in the secondary market. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are stockholder-controlled companies with special privileges and responsibilities to support affordable housing. They purchase conforming mortgages and pool them into MBS, guaranteeing timely payment to investors. They also hold mortgages and MBS in their portfolios. The GSEs hold mortgages and MBS as investments, with private capital absorbing credit risk instead of the government. The PATH Act and Johnson-Crapo GSE bill aim to attract private capital back into the market by winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The PATH Act also proposes reforms for FHA. The PATH Act aims to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over several years, replacing them with a National Mortgage Market Utility without a government guarantee. It also includes reforms for FHA to improve its finances and increase the role of private capital in the mortgage market. The phase-out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac involves two stages, with actions taken in the first five years before their charters are repealed. The PATH Act proposes steps to limit the GSEs' new business, including only allowing them to purchase mortgages that meet the Qualified Mortgage standard and setting guarantee fees comparable to private institutions. Additionally, the GSEs would be prohibited from purchasing mortgages in areas that used eminent domain in the previous 10 years. The PATH Act proposes significant changes for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including repealing affordable housing goals and contributions to housing funds, requiring risk-sharing transactions, and reducing mortgage portfolios annually. After five years, their charters would be repealed unless market conditions warrant an extension. The PATH Act proposes significant changes for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including repealing affordable housing goals and contributions to housing funds. After their charters are repealed, FHFA would establish a receivership entity to assume their assets and liabilities. The federal government would guarantee certain outstanding liabilities, and a National Mortgage Market Utility would be created to facilitate mortgage securitization. The National Mortgage Market Utility would oversee mortgage securitization through a common platform developed by FHFA and GSEs, setting market standards and guidelines. It would not provide a government guarantee on MBS or originate mortgages, aiming to streamline back-office functions and benefit from economies of scale. FHFA would regulate the Utility to ensure compliance with underwriting standards. The Utility would establish categories of Qualified Securities based on underlying credit risk of mortgages, allowing investors to choose MBS based on risk preference. Open-access platform with no size-based fees to facilitate use by small lenders. Federal Home Loan Banks could aggregate loans from small institutions for pooling on the platform. The Utility would set rules for securitization, create standard agreements, and operate a National Mortgage Data Repository. The PATH Act would regulate covered bonds as a method for institutions to raise funds from investors, secured by assets like mortgages. Covered bonds are a type of debt secured by assets like mortgages, providing additional protection to bondholders in case of bankruptcy. Legislation may be needed to support the growth of a domestic covered bond market. The PATH Act outlines a model for the organization of the market involving the Utility if implemented, facilitating the flow of funds from investors to households and the creation of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). The PATH Act includes provisions to address FHA's financial condition by limiting risk, increasing capital requirements, and tightening mortgage standards. FHA received $1.7 billion from Treasury at the end of FY2013 to cover expected losses due to increased default rates and falling house prices. The PATH Act aims to address FHA's financial condition by limiting risk, increasing capital requirements, and tightening mortgage standards. It would make major changes to FHA's single-family insurance program, targeting certain types of homebuyers. FHA would become an independent agency outside of HUD, with FHFA as the regulator. Eligible borrowers would be limited to first-time homebuyers and low- to moderate-income borrowers, with an increased downpayment requirement of 5%. FHA would also be allowed to guarantee more types of mortgages during market stress or disasters. Under the PATH Act, FHA would be permitted to guarantee more types of mortgages in market stress or disaster-affected areas. The dollar limit on the original principal balance of insured mortgages would decrease, with FHA insuring only 50% over five years. Premiums would have a minimum annual rate of 0.55% to cover administrative costs and insurance expenses. FHA's financial reports would need to meet capital requirements. Under the PATH Act, FHA would have to meet new capital requirements, including increasing the capital ratio to 4% for mortgages insured after a transition period. Lenders may need to reimburse FHA for defaulted mortgages that did not meet its standards in certain cases. FHA would also have the authority to reduce the maximum loan-to-value ratio for new mortgages during periods of low capital reserves. Under the PATH Act, FHA would need to meet new capital requirements, including increasing the capital ratio to 4% for mortgages insured after a transition period. Lenders may have to reimburse FHA for defaulted mortgages that did not meet its standards. FHA would be required to publish a consolidated handbook with all its requirements for lenders and servicers. Additionally, FHA would set affordability requirements for buildings with FHA-insured multifamily mortgages and establish capital ratios for its insurance funds. Limits and standards would be set for the Section 242 hospital insurance program, and the HECM reverse mortgage insurance program would be eliminated. The PATH Act would require FHA and USDA to share credit risk on mortgages, limit seller concessions to 3%, and restrict backing mortgages in areas that used eminent domain. It aims to modify financial reforms hindering private institutions from providing mortgage credit by delaying Basel III rules and exempting securitized mortgages from certain Dodd-Frank provisions. Effective dates for Dodd-Frank mortgage market rules would be delayed to allow institutions more time to comply. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill would wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing FHFA with the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC). FMIC would provide reinsurance on eligible MBS with a government guarantee and regulate aspects of the mortgage market. It also includes a new multifamily housing finance system and affordable housing funding. Key dates are set for required actions, including the agency transfer date six years after enactment. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill outlines key dates for the enactment, agency transfer, and system certification. FMIC would be established six months after enactment, with certification required within five years. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be wind down by FHFA in consultation with FMIC, with specific steps outlined for reducing their portfolios annually. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill outlines key dates for the enactment, agency transfer, and system certification. FMIC would be established six months after enactment, with certification required within five years. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be wind down by FHFA in consultation with FMIC, with specific steps outlined for reducing their portfolios annually. The support agreements with Treasury require a reduction in business activities, with the GSEs eventually ceasing new business on the system certification date. A holding corporation, trusts, and subsidiaries may be established to facilitate the winding down of debt obligations and assets. The federal government would guarantee repayment of the GSEs' obligations, managed by FHFA to maximize taxpayer return and ensure a functioning mortgage market. Once guarantees are extinguished, the GSEs' charters would be revoked, and affordable housing goals repealed. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill outlines key dates for enactment, agency transfer, and system certification. FMIC would support affordable housing through various funds funded by a fee on covered MBS. FHFA would transition to operate within FMIC, with staff and assets transferred. FMIC would be an independent agency with a board of directors appointed by the President. The FMIC would have a board of directors appointed by the President, serving five-year terms with staggered initial appointments. The board would consist of four additional members, with a limit of three members from the same political party. The FMIC would have various offices, including Underwriting, Securitization, Consumer and Market Access, Multifamily Housing, Federal Home Loan Bank Supervision, Taxpayer Protection, and Inspector General. The system certification date is when the FMIC certifies that the housing finance system meets certain benchmarks. The FMIC would provide an explicit guarantee on MBS that meet its standards, ensuring collateralized mortgages meet underwriting criteria, delivered by approved aggregators with private capital in a first-loss position. In unusual market conditions, MBS without private capital may receive a limited-time guarantee. The certification deadline is within five years of enactment, with possible extensions. The FMIC guarantee ensures that collateralized mortgages meet underwriting criteria, including conforming loan limits and Ability-to-Repay rules. Mortgage loans are securitized through the Securitization Platform owned by housing finance system participants. The Platform in the housing finance system would handle back-office functions of securitization, develop standard agreements, and allow noncovered securities to be securitized. Private capital in MBS would need a risk-sharing mechanism for FMIC guarantee, regulated by the FMIC. The FMIC's housing finance system categorizes execution into capital markets and guarantor options. Investors in capital markets agree to bear 10% losses before government guarantee, while guarantors pay investors until insolvent, triggering government guarantee. Guarantors must hold 10% capital. FMIC covers MBS losses exceeding private capital's share. The FMIC would establish a Mortgage Insurance Fund (MIF) to cover MBS losses exceeding private capital's share. The MIF would be financed by guarantee fees and regulated similar to the FDIC's oversight of banks. The FMIC would establish a Small Lender Mutual to help mortgage originators access the secondary market and FMIC guarantee. Membership would be open to certain institutions, including insured depository institutions and non-profit lenders. Affordable housing goals would be replaced with an annual fee on covered MBS directed to three different purposes. The FMIC would establish a Small Lender Mutual to assist mortgage originators in accessing the secondary market and FMIC guarantee. An annual fee on covered MBS would be implemented to incentivize focusing on underserved market segments, with 75% of the fees allocated to HUD's Housing Trust Fund, 15% to Treasury's Capital Magnet Fund, and 10% to a newly created Market Access Fund. The Capital Magnet Fund and Market Access Fund would provide formula grants for rental and homeownership housing activities benefiting low-income households. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill includes a set-aside for tribes under the Housing Trust Fund. The GSEs would transfer their multifamily businesses. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill involves transferring GSEs' multifamily businesses into subsidiaries, managed by FMIC. FMIC would oversee the disposition of these businesses and approve multifamily guarantors. Guarantors must maintain a 10% capital buffer and could issue multifamily MBS. FMIC's guarantee would require private capital in a first-loss position, with approved risk-sharing mechanisms. The bill also includes a set-aside for tribes under the Housing Trust Fund. The Johnson-Crapo GSE bill proposes organizing the single-family mortgage market with FMIC oversight. Figure 3 illustrates the allocation of credit risk, with a private market holder or approved guarantor handling the first-loss position and FMIC covering losses beyond that. S. 1217 does not include FHA provisions, but a separate bill (S. 1376) aims to strengthen FHA's financial position. The Johnson-Crapo FHA bill (S. 1376) aims to ensure FHA's financial soundness without limiting its market role or shifting risk to the private sector like the PATH Act. It does not restrict FHA insurance to specific homebuyers or reduce the mortgage percentage insured. The bill requires FHA to evaluate underwriting standards, study appropriate mortgage limits, and charge a minimum annual premium of 0.55%. The Johnson-Crapo FHA bill (S. 1376) aims to ensure FHA's financial soundness by increasing premiums and capital requirements. FHA would need to charge a minimum annual premium of 0.55% and raise the capital ratio to 3% within 10 years. Lenders could face oversight measures, and FHA would undergo stress-testing and report results to Congress. Congress would need to be notified if FHA used its authority for funding from Treasury. The Johnson-Crapo FHA bill includes provisions for lender oversight, changes to FHA programs like the reverse mortgage program, and allowing FHA to transfer mortgage servicing rights. FHA would also be required to publish a consolidated guide with all its requirements for lenders and servicers. Table 1 and Table 2 compare non-FHA related provisions and FHA reforms in the PATH Act and the Johnson-Crapo GSE bill respectively."
