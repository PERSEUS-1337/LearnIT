The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the worst environmental disaster in US history, with BP unable to stop the oil discharge. The fishing industry, supporting over 200,000 jobs and $5.5 billion in economic activity, is heavily impacted. As of May 25, 2010, fishing was banned in a 54,096 square-mile area of the Gulf Exclusive Economic Zone. The tourist industry in the Gulf region provided 620,000 jobs and over $9 billion in wages. The oil spill cleanup will require a dedicated workforce over an extended period. Contracts and agreements between Federal agencies and local governments are cost-effective tools for restoring public land affected by the BP oil spill. Collaborations between Federal agencies, private businesses, and service corps are beneficial for rehabilitating public land affected by the BP oil spill and conserving important land and water. This partnership provides opportunities for productive and educational public service while saving costs on human resources for land conservation.
