    "content": "Economic growth and increased global trade have led to a rise in goods movement, causing congestion in the transportation system. Federal support for freight infrastructure investment is a significant concern for Congress in the reauthorization of the surface transportation program. There is disagreement on how to improve freight system infrastructure. Disagreements exist on raising funds, required amounts, priorities, and federal role in improving freight system infrastructure. Diversity and complexity of the freight system contribute to these disagreements. The focus is on truck freight and intermodal rail industry in the reauthorization of MAP-21. Operational issues like hours of service and hazardous material transport safety are not addressed in this report. The freight transportation system is a complex network of different modes carrying various goods. Rail carries the largest share of domestic freight by ton-miles, while trucks carry more by value. Air transportation is a minor mode for domestic shipments. Environmental issues like carbon emissions and climate change are not discussed in this report. Trucks account for about 9% of vehicle miles traveled on the entire U.S. road system, but 15% of vehicle miles on Interstates and 24% on rural highways. The National Truck Network includes the Interstate Highway System, which extends approximately 47,000 miles, plus principal arterial highways designated by the states. The U.S. railroad network consists of approximately 140,000 miles of railroad, with Class I carriers dominating long-distance moves. Short line and regional railroads complement the Class I networks, connecting them and ports. Railroad infrastructure is mostly owned by carriers themselves, with freight trains sharing space with passenger trains in some areas. Railroads and trucks often compete for freight business but also collaborate on long-distance movements. Intermodal yards like those in Edgerton, KS and North Baltimore, OH facilitate easy transfer of containers between trucks and trains. Many truck lines now pick up freight from shippers, transfer it to a train at an intermodal terminal, and deliver it to the final destination. International containerized shipments often move by rail between ports and inland terminals, with a truck connection to and from the rail terminal. This collaboration is reflected in freight shipments moved by a combination of truck and rail. Over the last decade, intermodal traffic has increased by nearly 30%, with domestic intermodal shipments rising to match international shipments. Truck tonnage has increased by 14%, rail tonnage by 7%, and U.S. DOT forecasts a significant increase in tonnage by 2040. The volume of coal carried by railroads has been significant since 2011. The expansion of the Panama Canal in early 2016 will increase container ship capacity, potentially shifting trade patterns and impacting U.S. railroad rates. Larger ships at Gulf Coast and East Coast ports may worsen truck congestion at port terminals. Truck and rail congestion in major urban areas, including ports, airports, and rail yards, is a persistent issue exacerbated by growing freight and passenger transportation demand. The U.S. Department of Transportation identifies urban Interstate highway interchanges as the most congested segments for trucks, with Houston and Chicago having the highest congestion levels. A trucking industry study shows that 89% of congestion costs for trucks are concentrated on 12% of Interstate highway mileage. Without new capacity or operational improvements, highway system performance in the Southeast may deteriorate by 2040. Freight rail congestion is also a concern. Freight rail congestion has been episodic over the last couple of decades due to poor weather, demand surges, and railroad mergers. Currently, delays in rail service in the Upper Midwest are caused by a boom in movements of crude oil from North Dakota, a bumper harvest in 2014, and a backlog of shipments from the severe winter of 2013-2014. The railroad loading most of North Dakota's rail freight plans to spend $265 million in 2014 to add parallel track segments. Both Class I railroads serving the state blame railroad congestion in Chicago as an underlying cause of current service issues. Local bottlenecks can take months or years to resolve and may impact the entire rail network. Significant increases in train traffic have led to upgrades in warning devices at grade crossings and interest in grade separation projects. Railroads are seeking changes to expedite expansion projects. Congestion at land border crossings and seaports is more about staffing flexibility at customs booths and terminal gates. Truckers want Customs and Border Protection to adjust staffing for peak crossing times. Port terminal operators seek flexibility to extend truck gate hours without premium rates. Long lines of trucks at port terminals are also due to steamship operators bunching port calls and deploying larger container ships. Independent truckers frustrate coordinated information processing. U.S. port inefficiencies, particularly on the West Coast, are a concern for chilled meat exports to Asia. Alternative ports in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S. Atlantic Coast may see more calls from Asia-bound ships, affecting the time-sensitive nature of chilled meat exports. There is no federal freight transportation program, but various programs support passenger and freight mobility, including core programs of the federal-aid highway program. The federal-aid highway program consists of four core programs that make up 90% of highway spending authorized by MAP-21 and extension legislation. These programs include the National Highway Performance Program, Surface Transportation Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. The Transportation Alternatives Program primarily supports nonmotorized transportation. There are specific provisions within programs that cater to freight projects, although there is no discrete freight transportation program. Under current law, DOT can authorize a higher federal share of funding for projects that improve freight movement, with a maximum federal share of 95% for Interstate projects and 90% for non-Interstate projects. Various freight infrastructure improvements are eligible for federal highway funds, such as truck parking and port transportation improvements. MAP-21 also authorized programs like the Railway-Highway Crossings program to benefit freight movement. The Railway-Highway Crossings Program and the Projects of National and Regional Significance (PNRS) program aim to improve freight movement. The PNRS program, authorized in MAP-21 for $500 million in FY2013, funds high-cost projects with nonlocal benefits in transportation infrastructure. The PNRS program, authorized in MAP-21 for $500 million in FY2013, aims to fund high-cost transportation projects with nonlocal benefits. Appropriators have continued to fund the TIGER program, providing grants for various transportation projects with significant impacts, funded from the general U.S. Treasury, not the highway trust fund. The TIGER program was created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and has been funded in subsequent appropriations bills. Funding amounts varied from $1.5 billion in FY2009 to $500 million in FY2015. Notably, the program supported projects like the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) and the Crescent Corridor Intermodal Freight Rail Project. The federal government provides funding for surface transportation projects through grant-based programs like the core highway programs and the TIGER program. Financing initiatives rely on borrowing, with support for freight infrastructure financing arrangements through direct loans and tax preferences. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program offers loans for infrastructure projects. The TIFIA program provides loans for various transportation projects, including highways, rail facilities, and port terminals. As of February 23, 2015, TIFIA financing totaled $21.2 billion, supporting 50 projects with a total cost of $77.1 billion. The program was expanded under MAP-21, increasing funding to $1 billion annually. One project that received a $341 million TIFIA loan is the Port of Miami Tunnel, which opened in August 2014 to improve truck access to the port. The TIFIA program, expanded under MAP-21, provides loans for transportation projects. The program's funding covers subsidy costs and administrative expenses, allowing for a larger loan capacity than budget authority. With an average subsidy cost of 10%, $1 million in budget authority can provide $10 million in loan capacity. After administrative costs, DOT estimated around $1.6 billion available for credit subsidy. The Rail Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program provides loans and loan guarantees through the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) up to a total of $35 billion of unpaid principal, with $7 billion reserved for Class II and III railroads. Direct loans can be up to 100% of a project's cost and for a maximum term of 35 years. Eligible borrowers include state and local governments, government-sponsored authorities and corporations, railroads, joint ventures, freight rail shippers, and interstate compacts. Eligible projects include buying or improving rail facilities. The RRIF program provides loans and loan guarantees through the Federal Railroad Administration for rail projects. Eligible projects include buying or improving rail facilities, refinancing debt, and developing new facilities. FRA evaluates applications based on creditworthiness and collateral. Since 2002, there have been 33 loan agreements totaling $1.7 billion, mostly for Class II and III freight operators. Loans range from $234 million to $56,000. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) provide financing for surface transportation projects, including freight projects. By 2012, 32 states had established federally authorized SIBs. However, state infrastructure banks have not been significant participants in financing surface transportation projects. Between 1995 and 2012, federal and nonfederal State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) entered into about 1,100 agreements totaling $9 billion, with an average of $8 million per agreement. 71% of the projects supported by SIBs were highway projects, which made up 88% of the total project value. Other projects like water, port, rail, and pipeline accounted for a smaller percentage of loans and project value. The limited role of SIBs in transportation investment can be attributed to the availability of debt finance from other sources and federal funding for traditional projects. The federal government supports debt financing for public projects through various means, including allowing state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds. Private Activity Bonds can also be issued for projects with significant private benefits, with a limit of $15 billion allocated by the Secretary of Transportation. As of January 14, 2015, $11.9 billion had been allocated. Private Activity Bonds, along with TIFIA, have been crucial for creating public-private partnerships in infrastructure investment. Public-private partnerships in infrastructure investment have been supported by various means, including tax-credit bonds like Build America Bonds. These bonds, authorized by ARRA, offered a tax credit equal to 35% of the interest paid by the issuer. From April 2009 to December 2010, there were 2,275 BAB issues totaling $181 billion. The level of funding approved in MAP-21 reauthorization will be crucial for surface transportation infrastructure, including freight infrastructure. In 2010, capital spending on highways by all levels of government was about $100 billion, with the federal government providing about $44 billion (44%). To maintain the highway system's condition and performance from 2011 to 2030 would require an annual expenditure of $65.3 to $86.3 billion, which is 14% to 35% less than 2010 spending. To improve highway systems, annual spending of $123.7 to $145.9 billion is needed, with an intermediate scenario requiring $93.9 to $111.9 billion. A report on national freight network conditions is required by MAP-21, with the first one expected in spring 2015. Freight interest groups highlight a gap between infrastructure needs and current spending levels. The National Association of Manufacturers points to a gap between current infrastructure needs and spending levels, which they believe will impact economic competitiveness. They argue for increased investment from public and private sources to prevent decline in job creation and productivity. Some stakeholders express concern over federal funding uncertainty for freight projects. There is not unanimous agreement on the need for greater government spending, particularly at the federal level. The congressionally mandated commission on surface transportation issues debated the extent of underfunding, with dissenters arguing for market-based reforms, reduced federal role, and innovation at the state and local level. They emphasized the importance of aligning supply and demand in transportation infrastructure provision. Federal truck weight limits only apply to Interstate highways. The DOT study, expected to be issued in 2015, will evaluate heavier truck configurations, including increasing weight limits on five-axle trucks to 88,000 lbs. and adding a sixth axle. Large trucking firms support these changes, while smaller firms, railroads, and safety groups have concerns. The public sector faces challenges in prioritizing freight projects due to a preference for passenger travel improvements. Freight projects may lose out in funding decisions because their benefits spread nationally or regionally. Planners may be hesitant to advocate for projects with direct benefits to the private sector. Addressing major freight bottlenecks with federal grants could be politically difficult due to allocating large sums to specific geographic areas. Just 5% of U.S. roads carry 75% of truck traffic, and 85% of containerized imports/exports are handled by 10 ports. Local planners may not realize how infrastructure constraints outside their jurisdiction affect local competitiveness. A competitive discretionary program like the federal New Starts program could fund valuable projects efficiently. The TIGER program, criticized for its handling of project evaluations and funding, could be replaced by a formula-based program for distributing funds for freight projects. This alternative approach would allow Congress to prioritize factors they deem important and limit project selection by state departments. Eligibilities for federal surface transportation projects have historically been broad, allowing funds to be used at the discretion of states and localities. However, this approach has not been ideal for funding large projects with significant national and regional benefits. Multi-modal transportation in freight movement poses a challenge in setting spending priorities, as federal programs are typically focused on a single mode. This makes it difficult to support common multi-modal projects in freight infrastructure, such as intermodal connectors for freight facilities. The federal government can influence project prioritization for multi-modal freight programs by funding them with user fees instead of taxes paid only by highway users. MAP-21 made changes to federal planning requirements, including identifying a \"Primary Freight Network\" of critical highway segments for freight transport. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has issued a draft Primary Freight Network (PFN) for comment to assist states in prioritizing resources. Suggestions have been made to lift the arbitrary mileage restriction for the PFN. States are required to establish freight advisory committees and develop state freight plans. Each state must set performance targets in coordination with Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and evaluate progress in their statewide plans. Many of MAP-21's freight provisions are not fully implemented yet, making it uncertain if they will positively impact the freight transportation system. Greater federal funding for freight infrastructure would require either reducing funding for other programs or generating new revenues, such as raising the federal fuels tax. One option to fund infrastructure is to raise the federal fuels tax or implement other user fees. Advantages include generating large sums of money, low administrative costs, and positive economic effects. Interest groups like the American Trucking Associations support increasing the fuels tax for infrastructure investment. The FHWA study in 2000 found that federal fuel tax rates provide a subsidy for heavier freight trucks. Despite opposition to raising the fuel tax, tolling could be used to fund infrastructure improvements like road widening and bridge replacements. Trucking groups are concerned about potential cost shifts to trucks if highway construction is funded through tolls. Tolls on highways may divert trucks to toll-free roads, impacting safety. New revenue sources for freight infrastructure include container fees, customs revenue, and weight/distance tax. Some proposals suggest a truck registration fee or fuel tax increase for funding. Freight transportation trust funds are also considered. A freight transportation trust fund could dedicate revenues to improvement projects. Alternative approaches include a national infrastructure bank for low-cost loans and tax credits for railroads. The government has proposed credits to support private investment in freight railroads, aiming to avoid government involvement in investment decisions. Congress is considering raising truck-related taxes to encourage rail investment. Legislative proposals with freight provisions have been introduced in recent Congresses, including the MAP-21 Reauthorization Act which would have created a National Freight Program with $6 billion in funding over six years. The MAP-21 Reauthorization Act proposed a National Freight Program with $6 billion in funding over six years, starting at $400 million in FY2015 and increasing to $2 billion in FY2020. It required the designation of a national highway freight network (NHFN) and a primary highway freight network (PHFN), with funding to be used for projects on the NHFN. Additionally, the Obama Administration proposed the GROW America Act, introducing two new grant programs for freight infrastructure investments. The Multimodal Freight Incentive Program and the National Freight Infrastructure Program were proposed with a total authorization of $10 billion over four years, funded from the transportation trust fund. The President's FY2016 budget request includes a six-year GROW America Act similar to the earlier proposal but with two extra years. The new freight programs would be authorized at $4 billion in year four of H.R. 4834 and continue at that level in years five and six. The Multimodal Freight Incentive Program in H.R. 4834 aimed to improve freight movement through funding highways, rail, landside port infrastructure, airports, and intermodal projects, with funding increasing from $500 million in FY2015 to $2 billion in FY2018. The National Freight Infrastructure Program, proposed in H.R. 4834, aimed to fund projects improving freight movement on various transportation modes. Funding was proposed to increase from $500 million in FY2015 to $2 billion in FY2018. States receiving funding would need to establish freight advisory committees and plans, while DOT would develop a national freight strategic plan and tools for evaluating transportation projects. H.R. 935 proposes creating a national freight network trust fund funded by 5% of import duties, amounting to about $1.6 billion. The fund would finance the National Freight Network Grant Program for various freight infrastructure projects. Another proposal includes a 1% tax on truck or rail shipments (H.R. 1308) and H.R. 749 seeks to expedite permitting for freight rail projects."
