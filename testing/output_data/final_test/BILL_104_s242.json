It also states that if a deduction is allowed for qualified residence interest, it cannot be considered under another provision. Special rules include allowing the taxpayer to elect the provision for the deduction and limiting the taxable year for the deduction. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is allowed only for expenses related to attending an institution of higher education during the taxable year. Prepayments for education starting in the first 2 months of the following year are exempt. Additionally, scholarships and veterans benefits reduce the amount of qualified higher education expenses eligible for deduction. The deduction for qualified higher education expenses is reduced by amounts received for scholarships, veterans benefits, or payments for educational expenses exempt from income taxation. No deduction is allowed for married individuals filing separately. The deduction for higher education tuition and fees is allowed for individuals filing joint tax returns. The Secretary may create regulations for implementing this deduction. The deduction for higher education tuition and fees applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
