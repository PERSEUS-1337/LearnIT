    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Post-Abortion Support and Services Act\". The Congress finds that abortion can have severe and long-term effects on women's mental and emotional well-being, leading to issues such as sadness, guilt, difficulty bonding with new babies, and problems in relationships. Negative emotional reactions include depression, guilt, grief, numbness, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Women who have had an abortion may experience emotional distress, substance abuse, and difficulties in relationships. Research shows that coping mechanisms like avoidance and denial can lead to post-abortion distress and dissatisfaction. Lack of social support can also contribute to these negative effects. Women who experience lack of social support and ambivalence are more likely to suffer severe negative emotional reactions to abortion. Depression and other maladjustments can be prolonged by failure to recognize post-abortion reactions. Many women undergo abortion against their moral beliefs to satisfy others' demands. Social pressure-induced abortions can lead to psychological distress. Post-abortion depression is treatable with prompt diagnosis and personalized care. Research on the emotional aftermath of abortion is limited, with few studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Treatment options include personalized care with social support, therapy, medication, and hospitalization when necessary. Research on post-abortion depression and psychosis is being expanded and intensified by the National Institute of Mental Health. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is expanding research on post-abortion depression and psychosis, as well as physical side effects, through the National Institutes of Health. The Director of the Institute will coordinate research on post-abortion conditions with other national research institutes and agencies of the National Institutes of Health. This includes conducting basic research to understand the causes and find a cure for post-abortion conditions. The Director of the Institute will conduct basic research on post-abortion conditions, including epidemiological studies, improved diagnostic techniques, clinical research for new treatments, and information programs for healthcare professionals and the public. Additionally, a national longitudinal study will be conducted to determine the incidence and prevalence of post-abortion conditions. The Director of the Institute will conduct research on post-abortion conditions, including diagnostic techniques and reports to Congress. $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002-2006. Establishment of program of grants for delivery of services regarding post-abortion depression and psychosis.
