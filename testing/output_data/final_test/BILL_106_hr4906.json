    "content": "The \"Enterprise Integration Act of 2000\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Congress finds that the majority of US manufacturing companies are small to medium-sized businesses, producing goods for larger companies. The use of the World Wide Web and international product data exchange standards has accelerated the shift towards electronically integrated supply chains. Adoption of e-commerce-based supply chains could reduce business costs by 10 to 40 percent. European and Asian countries are heavily investing in electronic enterprise standards development. The shift towards electronically integrated supply chains is accelerating, with European efforts advanced in various industries. US manufacturers need to ensure that electronic business standards reflect their needs to remain competitive. Small and medium-sized manufacturers risk losing customers without adopting computer-aided design. US manufacturers must adopt computer-aided design, engineering, and manufacturing systems to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving electronic business landscape. Application protocols are complex standards that require industry-wide cooperation for development. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is uniquely positioned to assist manufacturers in responding to this challenge. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is urged to accelerate efforts in helping manufacturing industries develop standards and integration processes to increase efficiency and lower costs. They should also ensure that small to medium-sized manufacturers can upgrade their capabilities to join electronic supply chains. SEC. 3. ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION INITIATIVE. The Director will establish an initiative for advancing enterprise integration in the United States, involving various units of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This initiative will focus on product data management, involve government and industry consortia, and aim for enterprise integration in major manufacturing industries. The Director will assess enterprise integration standards and activities in major manufacturing industries in the US and abroad, working with industry representatives to identify steps needed for integration. A report to Congress on these matters is due within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Director will submit a plan for enterprise integration in major manufacturing industries to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Updates and progress reports will be provided annually until enterprise integration is achieved. The Director is authorized to work with companies and trade associations to carry out the plans. The Director will work with companies and trade associations in a major manufacturing industry to raise awareness of enterprise integration activities in the United States and abroad. This includes convening meetings, developing roadmaps, supporting standards development and adoption, promoting pilot projects for new standards, ensuring training for Manufacturing Extension Program employees, and creating tool kits and training materials. The Director will develop tool kits and training materials for small and medium-sized businesses to participate in integrated enterprises. Mechanisms will be set up for Manufacturing Extension Program centers to access expertise and materials from each other. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as \"automotive\" as land-based engine-powered vehicles, \"Director\" as the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and \"enterprise integration\" as the electronic linkage of manufacturers, assemblers, and suppliers for data exchange. It also includes the definition of \"major manufacturing industry\" which encompasses various industries like aerospace, automotive, electronics, and others. The term \"National Institute of Standards and Technology laboratories\" refers to institutes with expertise in electronic commerce, including the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory, and the Information Technology Laboratory. Authorization of appropriations for the Director under this Act: $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, and necessary sums for subsequent years."
