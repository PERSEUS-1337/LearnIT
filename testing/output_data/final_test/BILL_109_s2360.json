Since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Internet has seen robust growth with Americans transitioning from dial-up to broadband connections. 72 percent of Americans use the Internet, with 59 percent having high-speed connections. Over 17 percent have sold items online, 60 million use search engines daily, and 80 percent seek health information online. Americans are increasingly using the Internet for various activities like making phone calls and watching TV shows or movies. The growth of the Internet is attributed to the freedom on the content and applications layer, allowing innovation and competition. Consumers can shop from various retailers online, including small businesses from different locations. This freedom is also driving the development of new entertainment offerings like on-demand video and movies. Despite the growth of the Internet and increased access for Americans, there is limited choice in high-speed Internet providers. Only 2 percent of Americans receive high-speed Internet from providers other than their local phone company or cable provider. Approximately 20 percent of Americans have alternative options for Internet access. Approximately 20 percent of Americans lack high-speed Internet access options, highlighting the limited choice in providers. Congress must safeguard Internet freedom to ensure its ongoing success amid increasing access without much provider choice. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"application or service\" referring to data exchanges over communications, \"bits\" as the smallest unit of information on the Internet, \"Commission\" as the FCC, and \"communications\" encompassing voice, video, or data services. The curr_chunk defines a service as a transmission to subscribers using public rights-of-way, spectrum, numbering resources, or other inputs licensed by a local government or private entity. It must be offered to the public or classes of subscribers effectively available to the public. The curr_chunk defines a service as effectively available to the public, enabling users to transmit their own content. It includes interactive on-demand services but excludes cable service. The term \"content\" refers to information in various forms. The curr_chunk defines a network operator as a person who provides communications directly to a subscriber. The term \"person\" includes natural persons, partnerships, corporations, and other legal entities. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to communications, including \"subscriber\" and \"transmission component.\" A subscriber is an end user of a communication application or service, while a transmission component enables users to transmit their own content between specified points. The curr_chunk discusses the obligations of network operators. The obligations of network operators include not interfering with transmitted content, not discriminating in bandwidth allocation, not charging application providers for traffic delivery, and enabling access to unaffiliated content. The network operator must allow attachment of compliant devices, treat all data equally, offer fair rates, and provide non-discriminatory access to subscribers. The network operator must provide non-discriminatory access and transparent rates, terms, and conditions for communications. They are also allowed to take measures to protect subscribers from harmful applications. Subscribers must be informed and given the option to refuse or disable any preventative application or service that aims to prevent harmful applications like adware, spyware, malware, viruses, spam, and inappropriate content. Operators must protect their network's security and prioritize emergency communications. They should comply with law enforcement directives and prevent unlawful activities. SEC. 5. COMPLAINTS REGARDING VIOLATIONS. Any aggrieved party can file a written complaint with the Commission alleging a network operator's violation of section 4(a) requirements. The complaint must demonstrate that the violation is not a preserved authority under section 4(b)(1) and is harmful to the party. Within 7 days of submission, the Commission will decide on accepting or denying the prima facie case. If accepted, the Commission may issue a cease and desist order. If the Commission accepts a prima facie case of an aggrieved party, a network operator must cease the action in question until a ruling is made. The Commission can extend this order to others if necessary. The burden of proof then falls on the network operator to show no violation occurred. The burden of proof falls on the network operator to prove no violation occurred within 90 days of a complaint submission. Failure to issue a decision within this period results in a violation being deemed to have occurred. Nothing in this section prevents the Commission from delegation. The Commission can delegate authority to relevant offices or bureaus under the Communications Act of 1934. The rule established applies only if a final decision ripe for judicial review is not issued within 90 days. The rule allows for judicial review if a violation occurs under section 4(a). Parties can file a petition for reconsideration within 90 days under the Communications Act of 1934. The Commission must issue an order granting or denying a petition within 90 days. Failure to do so will result in the previous decision being considered final for judicial review. Appeals of Commission decisions must be made to the United States district court. Third parties can intervene in the process. Intervention by third parties is allowed in appeals of Commission decisions according to the Communications Act of 1934. SEC. 6. PENALTIES. If the Commission finds a network operator in violation of section 4(a), they will face penalties as outlined in the Communications Act of 1934. Each violation of section 4(a) will be considered a separate incident for penalty purposes."
