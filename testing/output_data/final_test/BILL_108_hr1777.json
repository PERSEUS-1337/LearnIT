    "content": "In this Act, definitions include terms like Advisory Committee, Department, fuel cell, infrastructure, light duty vehicle, and Secretary. The Act also includes a plan. The Secretary must submit a five-year plan to Congress within six months of this Act's enactment, outlining programs related to fuel cells and hydrogen. The plan should detail program agendas, entities involved, evaluation milestones, and strategies to overcome obstacles in achieving program goals. The Secretary must submit a five-year plan to Congress outlining programs related to fuel cells and hydrogen, including strategies to overcome hurdles and policy assumptions affecting hydrogen sources and marketability. The Secretary must submit a five-year plan to Congress outlining programs related to fuel cells and hydrogen, including strategies to overcome hurdles and policy assumptions affecting hydrogen sources and marketability. SEC. 3. PROGRAM. The Secretary, in partnership with the private sector, will conduct a program addressing production of hydrogen from various sources, safe delivery methods, and advanced vehicle technologies. The program will focus on advanced vehicle technologies such as engine systems, energy storage, and clean fuels, as well as the storage of hydrogen fuels in various forms. Additionally, research will be conducted on safe and efficient fuel cells for vehicles. The program aims to develop safe and affordable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for mass consumer market by 2015, with a range of at least 300 miles by 2020. This includes research on natural gas, fuel cell stack reliability, low temperature operation, cold start capability, and codes and standards for hydrogen production and distribution. The program aims to develop safe and affordable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for mass consumer market by 2015, with a range of at least 300 miles by 2020. The vehicles should have improved performance, safety, and fuel economy compared to light duty vehicles in model year 2003, with near zero emissions of air pollutants and crash integrity. The program aims to develop safe and affordable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for mass consumer market by 2015, with a range of at least 300 miles by 2020. Goals for hydrogen energy infrastructure include safe refueling, improved efficiency, and widespread availability of hydrogen from domestic sources through production, delivery, and storage. The program aims to develop safe and affordable hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for mass consumer market by 2015, with a range of at least 300 miles by 2020. Goals for hydrogen energy infrastructure include safe refueling, improved efficiency, and widespread availability of hydrogen from domestic sources through production, delivery, and storage. The Secretary shall fund a limited number of demonstration projects for transportation vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and other energy conversion devices. The Secretary will fund demonstration projects involving hydrogen use in existing facilities, reliable power from hydrogen, technology replication, integration of mobile and stationary applications, and addressing demand for hydrogen fuel cell applications and infrastructure interdependency. The Secretary will facilitate the deployment of hydrogen energy, fuel cells, advanced vehicle technologies, and clean fuels through a competitive funding process. Activities may involve nationally recognized research centers to avoid duplication. The Secretary will require cost sharing for projects, with non-Federal sources committing at least 20% or 50% of the project cost depending on the subsection. The Secretary has the discretion to reduce the non-Federal requirement based on technological risks or project type. The Secretary may consider the size of the non-Federal share in selecting projects, especially for those not expected to result in a marketable product. SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE. Establishment of an interagency task force chaired by the Secretary with representatives from various federal agencies to work towards safe, economical, and environmentally sound planning. The interagency task force aims to develop a fuel infrastructure for hydrogen and hydrogen-carrier fuels, promote fuel cells in various applications, support distributed power generation, establish hydrogen codes and safety protocols, and ensure vehicle hydrogen fuel system integrity. The task force may organize workshops, issue publications, and hold conferences. The interagency task force will foster the exchange of information and technology, develop an inventory of hydrogen technologies, integrate technical information, and promote the marketplace introduction of advanced technologies. The interagency task force aims to promote the marketplace introduction of infrastructure for hydrogen and other clean fuel vehicles, as well as conduct an education program for potential end-users. Agency heads are required to cooperate and provide information to the task force, Advisory Committee, and the Department. The Advisory Committee is established under Section 5. The Hydrogen Technical and Fuel Cell Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary on programs and activities. It consists of 12-25 members representing various sectors, with terms not exceeding 3 years. The Advisory Committee ensures continuity by having staggered member terms. The Chairperson is elected from the members. The Committee reviews and advises on program implementation, technology impacts, and the plan under the Act. The Secretary considers but is not obligated to adopt the Committee's recommendations. The Secretary shall transmit a biennial report to Congress detailing recommendations made by the Advisory Committee. The report will explain how recommendations have been or will be implemented, or provide reasons for non-implementation. The Secretary must provide necessary resources for the Committee to fulfill its responsibilities. SEC. 6. EXTERNAL REVIEW. The Secretary will arrange for a nongovernmental entity to review the plan and program, with recommendations to be implemented or explained if not. The review of the program will occur in the fourth year after the Act's enactment, evaluating research priorities and progress. The Secretary will arrange for a nongovernmental entity to review the plan and program, with recommendations to be implemented or explained if not. The review will evaluate research priorities and progress towards achieving them, to be completed within five years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will transmit the review to Congress within 45 days, along with a plan to implement recommendations or reasons for not doing so. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.\n\nThe Secretary may represent US interests in coordination with relevant agencies before governments, industry, and foreign entities. Nothing in this Act alters the Department's regulatory authority.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2004 to 2008: $273.5 million for 2004, $325 million for 2005, $375 million for 2006, $400 million for 2007, and $425 million for 2008."
