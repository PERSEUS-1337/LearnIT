Funding for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) has been a major issue. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) has been a major funding issue, providing seed financing for businesses and consortia for developing generic technologies. Opponents criticize it as \"corporate welfare,\" while the Administration defends it as crucial for industrial competitiveness. The Senate proposed a 15% funding increase for ATP in FY2000, but the House passed a bill with no appropriation for ATP.

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires agencies to develop strategic plans with goals, objectives, and performance measures. The Department of Commerce's 1997 strategic plan focused on promoting U.S. competitiveness, cutting-edge science and technology, and effective resource management. The Commerce Strategic Plan emphasizes effective management of resources and assets for sustainable economic opportunity. It aims to strengthen relationships among bureaus and external partners to support the core mission of the Department. Success in the changing technological world and global economy relies on alliances with businesses, universities, governments, and international parties. The Department of Commerce completed its first full cycle of GPRA mandated activities with the publication of the first Annual Program Performance Report in March 2000. A revised Commerce Strategic Plan (FY2000-FY2005) was set to replace the initial plan issued in September 1997. Legislative proposals were considered in Congress to abolish the Department of Commerce during the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. The Clinton Administration strongly opposed abolishing the Commerce Department, arguing that it would disrupt successful activities benefiting the American people, especially in areas promoting economic growth and advancing U.S. technology. Despite some congressional interest in reorganizing or downsizing the Department, a bill for its abolition introduced in the 104th Congress did not pass. A bill (H.R. 2667) to abolish the Department of Commerce was introduced in the House by Representatives Royce and Kasich in 1997. A similar bill (S. 1316) was introduced in the Senate by Senator Abraham. In the 106th Congress, Representative Royce introduced another bill (H.R. 2452) but no further action was taken. No similar legislation was introduced in the Senate. For FY2001, Congress approved $4.26 billion in total budget authority for the Judiciary, representing a 7.7% increase over FY2000 funding. The House-Senate conference agreement provided necessary funding for the federal court system's caseload, a cost-of-living pay increase for federal judges, and an increase in the hourly rate for court-appointed attorneys representing indigent defendants in federal criminal cases. The Congress-approved agreement for FY2001 included provisions for ten new district judgeships and brought Supreme Court police retirement benefits in line with other federal law enforcement agencies. It did not include a controversial Senate provision on honoraria for federal judges. Congress allocated $3.36 billion for the Judiciary's largest account. The Congress-approved $3.36 billion for the Judiciary's largest account for FY2001, funding new court support staff and addressing increased workload in judicial districts on the nation's southwestern border. Defender Services remained a sensitive part of the budget, supporting federal public defender and community defender organizations. For FY2001, Congress approved $435.0 million for Defender Services, which supports federal public defender and community defender organizations, as well as panel attorneys appointed to represent indigent individuals in federal crimes. This funding was higher than the amounts proposed by the House and Senate. The Judiciary had requested $440.4 million for Defender Services, citing concerns about the low pay rates for panel attorneys compared to other government agencies. In FY2001, Congress approved increased funding for Defender Services, raising hourly rates for panel attorneys. Congressional appropriators had expressed concerns about rising costs, particularly in federal death penalty cases. The Judiciary noted efforts to contain costs and implement recommendations to control expenses in the Defender Services program. The House Appropriations Committee commended the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for reducing costs in capital habeas corpus representations, with a 40% reduction in average annual cost per petitioner. However, the average cost per petitioner in California was still almost twice the national average. The Committee urged the Ninth Circuit to continue cost-cutting efforts and report results in the Optimal Utilization of Judicial Resources Report. The Judiciary requested funding for a cost-of-living increase in judges' and justices' salaries for FY2001, which was approved by Congress. This provision allowed for a 2.7% pay adjustment based on the Employment Cost Index, aligning with the General Schedule salary adjustment rate. The Judiciary requested a pay adjustment for FY2001, which was approved by Congress despite the House initially declining to include it in the CJS bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee's recommendation for the pay adjustment prevailed in conference, and a provision regarding honoraria received by justices and judges was dropped from the Judiciary's appropriations title. The Senate bill allowed justices and judges to receive honoraria, with the Judicial Conference having the option to set their own limits. This change excluded judicial honoraria from the statutory curb on outside earned income, which had been in place since 1989. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist supported this change to improve compensation for federal judges. The Senate bill proposed allowing justices and judges to receive honoraria, which was supported by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. However, the Senate committee faced controversy over lifting the ban on honoraria, with concerns raised about potential conflicts of interest and public confidence in judges. Ultimately, Senate negotiators removed the honoraria provision from the bill, and Congress approved $199.6 million for Court Security. The Judiciary sought $215.4 million for Court Security, approved at $199.6 million. The largest increase was requested for the United States Sentencing Commission, with a 24.7% rise to $10.6 million for FY2001. In FY2001, the United States Sentencing Commission requested $10.6 million, but Congress approved $9.9 million for the Commission, which was a slight increase from the previous year's funding level of $8.5 million. Congress also approved $37.6 million for the Supreme Court's Salaries and Expenses account, and $7.5 million for the Court's Building and Grounds account. The Architect of the Capitol estimated the funding required for FY2001. Congress approved the creation of ten new U.S. district judgeships. The Judicial Conference requested additional judgeships due to the growing workload. However, the budget bill did not authorize or fund these new judgeships. The decision to create the judgeships was made later in conference committee. The Government Performance and Results Act requires agencies to develop strategic plans, but the Judicial branch is exempt. The Administration's FY2001 budget request for the Department of State and international broadcasting totaled nearly $7 billion, 10% above the FY2000 enacted level. The House Appropriation Committee recommended $6.55 million for State and international broadcasting FY2001 budgets, while the Senate Appropriations Committee set a funding level of $6.56 billion.

The President's FY2001 budget allocated $946.1 million for CIO and $738.7 million for international peacekeeping, with a focus on activities in Kosovo, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. The House Appropriations Committee recommended lower funding levels: CIO-$880.5 million; international peacekeeping-$498.1 million. The Senate Committee suggested funding closer to the Administration's request for CIO and maintained the same level for international peacekeeping. Congress ultimately approved $870.8 million in funding. The FY2001 budget allocated $870.8 million for CIO and $846 million for peacekeeping, totaling $32 million more than the President's request.
