The Congress finds that autism spectrum disorders cause severe impairments in language and communication, typically appearing in young children. It is estimated that 1 in 500 children will be diagnosed with autism, with 400,000 Americans affected. Three quarters of those with infantile autism end up in institutions or group homes by age 13, leading to significant annual costs of $13.3 billion for care. The rapid advancements in biomedical science suggest that effective treatments and a cure for autism are attainable with appropriate coordination of federal agencies, increased understanding by the scientific community, and sufficient research funding. More knowledge is needed on the underlying causes and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. The curr_chunk discusses the need to treat the underlying abnormalities causing severe symptoms of autism, prevent future abnormalities, study the epidemiology and risk factors of autism spectrum disorders, develop methods for early diagnosis and functional assessment, and identify subtypes within the spectrum for better outcomes. In 1998, the National Institutes of Health announced a program of research on autism and autism spectrum disorders, emphasizing the importance of sufficient funding for carrying out the program. This includes disseminating relevant biomedical and diagnostic data to aid in early diagnosis and treatment, as well as addressing the costs of educating and caring for individuals with autism. The National Institutes of Health are expanding and intensifying their research activities on autism, with a focus on coordination and collaboration. The Director of NIH is expanding research activities on autism and collaborating with other agencies to coordinate efforts. The Director of NIH is establishing a committee to coordinate autism research activities among national research institutes and other officials. Grants and contracts will be awarded to support the planning and operation of centers of excellence for autism research. The Director of NIH is establishing a committee to coordinate autism research activities among national research institutes and other officials. Grants and contracts will be awarded to support the planning and operation of centers of excellence for research on autism, including conducting basic and clinical research, training programs, and providing services for patients. A center under paragraph (1) may use funds to raise awareness about research opportunities for individuals with autism, provide fees to participants, offer health care and referrals, and provide stipends for health professionals in training programs. The Director will coordinate centers and require reports. The Director will coordinate information among centers, ensure regular communication, and may require reports on center activities. Each center must use facilities of a single institution or consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director will establish centers based on available funding. The Director will establish not less than five centers for autism support, with funding for up to 5 years, extendable based on peer review. Information and education programs on autism will be provided to health professionals and the public. Research facilitation will be conducted through contracted programs for sample collection. The Director will establish centers for autism support with funding for up to 5 years, extendable based on peer review. Programs for sample collection will be conducted in accordance with scientific standards. Public input will be allowed for information on NIH programs related to autism. The term 'autism' includes autism spectrum disorders as determined appropriate by the Director. The Director will allocate $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and additional funds for 2000-2003 for autism support centers. Funding allocations include 75% for subsection (b), 6% for subsection (c), and 4% for subsection (d)."
