    "content": "This report summarizes key provisions of Medicaid and CHIP in H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed by the Senate on December 24, 2009. The bill resulted from the merger of two separate Senate health reform bills. The Congressional Budget Office updated their estimate of the direct spending and revenue effects of H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The revised projection assumes federal deficits would be reduced by $118 billion over a 10-year period and insure 94% of the non-elderly U.S. population by 2019. The gross 10-year cost of exchange subsidies, increased Medicaid and CHIP outlays, and tax credits for small employers would total $875 billion, partially offset by $251 billion. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would cost $624 billion over 10 years, partially offset by $251 billion from various sources. The Act covers topics such as health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, prevention, and drug programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes key provisions related to Medicaid and CHIP, grouped into six major issue areas. One significant reform is the coverage expansion for nonelderly, non-pregnant individuals with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act proposes expanding Medicaid coverage for low-income childless adults and increasing income eligibility levels to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. It also includes reforms to improve outreach, streamline enrollment, and coordinate with health benefit exchanges. Additionally, the bill mandates states to maintain current Medicaid and CHIP coverage levels and adds new mandatory and optional benefits. The bill proposes benefit additions such as premium assistance for employer-sponsored health insurance, coverage of free-standing birth clinics, and tobacco cessation services for pregnant women. It also authorizes states to offer new optional benefits like preventive services for adults and health homes. Financing reforms aim to reduce Medicaid expenditures and increase federal matching payments for eligibility expansion. Cost control reforms include reductions in Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, reduced expenditures for prescription drugs, and payment reforms to reduce inappropriate hospital expenditures. States and stakeholders would receive new program integrity enforcement tools. The bill proposes new program integrity enforcement tools for stakeholders, including data reporting requirements and oversight for states and providers. It also includes Medicaid and CHIP program integrity provisions, a nursing home accountability initiative, and various demonstrations, pilot programs, and grants to test models for improving healthcare delivery and payment services. The Senate bill proposes Medicaid and CHIP reforms to improve care coordination, including adding offices within CMS. The bill also includes a Medicare and Medicaid innovation center to allow states more control over expenditures for dual eligibles. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program operated by states within federal guidelines. Medicaid eligibility requires meeting categorical and financial requirements, with limits on assets and income. States determine specific limitations, leading to varying standards and expanding eligibility. Different pathways exist into Medicaid, some mandatory and others optional at the state level. Medicaid eligibility includes mandatory coverage for certain groups like pregnant women and children under age six with low income, and optional coverage for groups like pregnant women with slightly higher income. Nonelderly adults without disabilities or dependent children are generally not eligible for Medicaid. The proposed measure aims to expand Medicaid eligibility by adding new mandatory and optional eligibility groups, modifying existing groups, and facilitating outreach and enrollment. It would create a new mandatory category for non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals who are not eligible for Medicare, establishing 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the income threshold. The bill proposes to set 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the new mandatory minimum income eligibility level for Medicaid, extending coverage to most non-elderly citizens up to this threshold. States have the option to expand Medicaid to newly eligible individuals before 2014, with no additional federal financial assistance available during this phase-in period. Starting in 2014, states would be required to extend Medicaid to these individuals. The bill proposes to set 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the new mandatory minimum income eligibility level for Medicaid, extending coverage to most non-elderly citizens up to this threshold. States would be required to extend Medicaid to the \"newly eligible\" group starting in 2014, with additional federal financial assistance provided. States may also make a \"presumptive eligibility\" determination for these individuals before completed Medicaid applications are processed. The bill proposes setting 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the new mandatory minimum income eligibility level for Medicaid, extending coverage to most non-elderly citizens. States can make a \"presumptive eligibility\" determination for these individuals before completed Medicaid applications are processed. Certain income disregards and assets tests would no longer apply for Medicaid eligibility, with income eligibility based on Modified Gross Income (MGI) or household income. MGI and household income would also determine applicable premium and cost sharing amounts. The bill proposes setting 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the new mandatory minimum income eligibility level for Medicaid, extending coverage to most non-elderly citizens. Existing Medicaid income counting rules would continue to apply for certain groups, including individuals eligible for Medicaid through other assistance programs, the elderly, certain disabled individuals, the medically needy, and enrollees in a Medicare Savings Program. MGI would not affect eligibility determinations through Express Lane or for Medicare prescription drug low-income subsidies. The bill proposes setting 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the new mandatory minimum income eligibility level for Medicaid. Individuals enrolled in Medicaid on January 1, 2014, who would be ineligible due to new income counting rules would remain eligible until March 31, 2014. State use of income rules would not affect eligibility for Medicaid or other programs. The bill proposes setting 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the new mandatory minimum income eligibility level for Medicaid. Medicaid standard benefits include a wide range of medical care and services, with some benefits being mandatory and others optional at the state level. The provisions would be effective as of January 1, 2014, or earlier for states transitioning to MGI. States have the option to enroll certain state-specified groups in benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans under Section 1937 of the SSA. \"Newly eligible\" individuals would receive either benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, excluding those currently exempted populations. The bill includes a Medicaid eligibility maintenance of effort (MOE), with states not eligible for Medicaid payments until the Secretary determines an exchange is established. Between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, the Secretary determines that an exchange established by the state under Section 1311 of this bill is fully operational if the eligibility standards, methodologies, or procedures under its state Medicaid plan are more restrictive than those in effect as of the date of enactment. Medicaid income eligibility must use MGI, but this does not affect compliance with the MOE requirement, which continues through September 30, 2019 for children under age 19. States can expand Medicaid eligibility or move covered populations without affecting MOE requirements. Between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, states could be exempt from Medicaid eligibility MOE requirements for certain populations if experiencing a budget deficit. States had to establish income eligibility thresholds using MGI levels not less than those in effect at the time of H.R. 3590 enactment. During the transition to MGI and household income, states must establish an equivalent income test to protect Medicaid coverage for eligible individuals. The Secretary can waive provisions to ensure states establish systems that safeguard beneficiaries. Age is generally not a factor for Medicaid eligibility, with pathways available for youth aged 19 or 20, including those recently discharged from the child welfare system. The bill proposes adding a new mandatory Medicaid eligibility group for individuals under 26 years old who were in foster care at 18 years old and enrolled in Medicaid while in foster care. States can also make presumptive eligibility determinations for these individuals. The bill proposes adding a new mandatory Medicaid eligibility group for individuals under 26 years old who were in foster care at 18 years old and enrolled in Medicaid while in foster care. States can also make presumptive eligibility determinations for these individuals. The measure would expedite the processing of Medicaid applications for this group and exempt them from enrollment in Medicaid benchmark plans. Medicaid law includes spousal impoverishment protections for couples where one spouse applies for nursing home benefits under Medicaid. These protections allow the community spouse to retain higher amounts of income and assets, preventing their impoverishment. States must apply these protections for Medicaid nursing home care applicants and have the option to apply them for certain home and community-based services. The Medicaid law includes spousal impoverishment protections for couples applying for nursing home benefits under Medicaid. These protections allow the community spouse to retain higher amounts of income and assets. States have the option to apply these protections to applicants for certain home and community-based services. The spousal impoverishment rules do not apply when deciding which Medicaid-covered benefits would be offered to a particular beneficiary. The new state HCBS plan benefit is not an eligibility pathway into Medicaid and can only be accessed by individuals already enrolled in Medicaid. The bill proposes changes to Medicaid law, including applying spousal impoverishment rules to applicants for certain HCBS services and medically needy individuals. These changes would sunset after a five-year period. The bill proposes changes to Medicaid law, including creating a new optional Medicaid eligibility category for non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals with income exceeding 133% FPL. States can phase in Medicaid coverage for these individuals. States can phase in Medicaid coverage for non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals with income exceeding 133% FPL through a state plan amendment. Family planning services are a mandatory Medicaid benefit for beneficiaries of childbearing age, and states can provide these services to populations not eligible for traditional Medicaid through special waivers. The bill proposes adding a new optional eligibility group to Medicaid for non-pregnant individuals with income levels similar to pregnant women. This group would receive family planning services and supplies, with states having the option to determine presumptive eligibility. States would not be allowed to offer Medicaid coverage through alternative plans unless approved. The bill proposes adding a new optional eligibility group to Medicaid for non-pregnant individuals with income levels similar to pregnant women, who would receive family planning services and supplies. States can determine presumptive eligibility, but cannot offer Medicaid coverage through alternative plans without approval. Additionally, under the DRA, states have the option to extend HCBS to Medicaid beneficiaries without requiring a waiver, with eligibility limited to those with income below 150% of poverty and meeting state needs-based criteria. The bill aims to expand access to Medicaid HCBS waiver services for individuals with income below 300% of the SSI benefit rate and those who require an institutional level-of-care. It also establishes a new eligibility pathway for non-Medicaid beneficiaries who meet the criteria. States can cap enrollment numbers and define benefit eligibility under the current law. States have the flexibility to cap enrollment numbers, define benefit eligibility, and modify needs-based criteria for Medicaid HCBS waiver services without prior approval if certain conditions are met. The bill would eliminate states' ability to cap the number of persons eligible for Medicaid HCBS waiver services, allowing adjustments to needs-based criteria if actual enrollment exceeds projections. States would no longer be able to limit access to the benefit for 12 months based on new criteria, and individuals would remain eligible until they no longer meet the state's modified criteria. States could also target specific populations and vary the type, amount, duration, or scope of benefits. The bill allows for adjustments to needs-based criteria for Medicaid HCBS waiver services if actual enrollment exceeds projections. States can target specific populations and vary benefits, with elections for five-year periods. The Secretary must establish a system for enrolling eligible individuals in Medicaid or CHIP and distribute a standard application form for health subsidy programs. States can use their own forms as long as they align with the Secretary's guidelines. The bill allows states to use supplemental enrollment forms for health subsidy programs, with options for online, telephone, in-person, or mail submissions. States must develop a secure electronic interface for eligibility determinations and verify applicant data. The Secretary ensures notice of eligibility or ineligibility for state health subsidy programs. The bill requires states to establish procedures for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment through internet websites with electronic signatures. States must enroll individuals identified by the Exchange as eligible without further state determination. Ineligible applicants must be screened for qualified Exchange plans and premium assistance. Effective January 1, 2014. The bill requires states to establish procedures for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment through internet websites with electronic signatures. States must enroll individuals identified by the Exchange as eligible without further state determination. Ineligible applicants must be screened for qualified Exchange plans and premium assistance. States should ensure coordination between Medicaid, CHIP, and Exchange coverage, including services like EPSDT, and conduct outreach to vulnerable populations. The bill requires states to establish a website linking Medicaid to the state Exchange by January 1, 2014. This website allows Medicaid-eligible individuals to compare benefits, premiums, and cost-sharing for qualified health plans under the Exchange. Medicaid and CHIP agencies can determine eligibility for premium assistance, reducing administrative costs and coverage disruptions. Compliance with streamlined enrollment procedures is mandated. The bill mandates states to create a website linking Medicaid to the state Exchange by January 1, 2014. This site enables Medicaid-eligible individuals to compare benefits, premiums, and cost-sharing for health plans under the Exchange. It does not restrict states' ability to assess eligibility for home and community-based services. States can enroll certain groups temporarily based on a preliminary Medicaid provider determination before formal application. The bill allows hospitals participating in Medicaid to determine presumptive eligibility for Medicaid-eligible populations. This preliminary determination is based on likely Medicaid eligibility and follows guidance from the Secretary. Individuals must apply formally within a specific timeframe to continue Medicaid benefits. States can enroll individuals for a limited time based on likely Medicaid eligibility, following guidance from the Secretary. Claims during this period are not reviewed for improper payments. CHIPRA provided $100 million for outreach and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA allocated additional funds for outreach and enrollment grants, with 10% designated for a national campaign and 10% for American Indian and Alaska Native children. The remaining 80% will go to state and local governments and community-based organizations for outreach in rural areas and underserved populations, focusing on cultural and linguistic barriers. States must describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers for Medicaid and CHIP enrollment, with the Secretary working with stakeholders to address new barriers. The bill requires the Secretary to develop guidance for states on improving enrollment of vulnerable populations in Medicaid and CHIP, including children, homeless youth, pregnant women, minorities, and individuals with health disorders. States must implement these standards and report progress to Congress. The bill mandates states to report changes in Medicaid enrollment annually, starting January 2015. States must provide enrollment estimates for various categories of individuals and report on outreach and enrollment processes. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on total new Medicaid enrollment by state and make recommendations. Medicaid standard benefits are defined in federal regulations and include a wide range of services. The Deficit Reduction Act allows states to offer Medicaid through benchmark plans similar to CHIP. Benchmark plans include options like Blue Cross/Blue Shield and coverage for dually eligible individuals. The bill aims to establish benchmark-equivalent coverage for Medicaid, requiring plans to cover basic benefits and at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage under the selected benchmark plan for additional benefits. This coverage must include EPSDT services, access to rural health clinics, and federally qualified health centers. The bill aims to establish benchmark-equivalent coverage for Medicaid, requiring plans to cover essential health benefits including ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, laboratory services, preventive services, and pediatric services. Prescription drugs and mental health services would be added to the list of basic services that must be covered under the plan. States would be required to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. The bill requires states to offer benchmark-equivalent coverage for Medicaid, including essential health benefits like ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, and pediatric services. States must demonstrate coverage with an actuarial value of at least 75% for vision and hearing services. Plans must comply with mental health services parity requirements and offer premium assistance and wrap-around benefits. The bill requires states to offer premium assistance and wrap-around benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries when cost-effective. States must pay premiums and cost sharing exceeding current Medicaid program rules. Medicaid coverage of care in free-standing birthing centers is also mandated. The bill mandates Medicaid coverage for care in free-standing birthing centers, requiring states to separately pay providers for prenatal, labor, and postpartum care. It also includes counseling and pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation as a mandatory benefit under Medicaid, limited to FDA-approved cessation agents and services recommended for pregnant women. The bill mandates Medicaid coverage for care in free-standing birthing centers and includes counseling and pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation as a mandatory benefit under Medicaid. States can exclude coverage for smoking cessation for other Medicaid beneficiaries. Cost-sharing for pregnant women receiving counseling and pharmacotherapy would be prohibited. Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21 are entitled to EPSDT services, which would be expanded to include recommended clinical preventive services and adult immunizations. The bill mandates Medicaid coverage for care in free-standing birthing centers, counseling, and pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation as a mandatory benefit. States can exclude coverage for smoking cessation for other Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21 are entitled to expanded EPSDT services, including recommended clinical preventive services and adult immunizations. States that cover these services and vaccines without cost-sharing would receive increased FMAP and an additional one percentage point increase for new adult preventive services. The bill mandates Medicaid coverage for care in free-standing birthing centers, counseling, and pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation as a mandatory benefit. States can exclude coverage for smoking cessation for other Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid beneficiaries under age 21 are entitled to expanded EPSDT services, including recommended clinical preventive services and adult immunizations. States that cover these services and vaccines without cost-sharing would receive increased FMAP and an additional one percentage point increase for new adult preventive services. The bill also allows payment for hospice services for Medicaid children with terminal illnesses without affecting coverage for other related treatments. Personal care attendants assist individuals with daily living activities. The bill would allow states to offer Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) under another statutory authority and provide an increased match rate for five years. This would give states more flexibility in extending benefits to Medicaid beneficiaries for activities like preparing meals, managing money, and performing housework. Beginning October 1, 2010, states could offer home and community-based attendant services as an optional benefit to Medicaid beneficiaries whose income does not exceed 150% of poverty level. These services would include assistance with daily living tasks and health-related activities, delivered by qualified staff or family members, and managed by the individual or their representative. States can offer home and community-based attendant services as a Medicaid benefit to individuals with disabilities or elderly individuals. To obtain approval, states must collaborate with a state-established council, provide services statewide in an integrated setting, maintain or exceed previous Medicaid expenditures, and establish a quality assurance system. This option includes an enhanced federal match rate and would sunset after five years. The Secretary must submit a final evaluation report to Congress by December 31, 2015. A final report on the evaluation of community-based attendant services and supports is to be submitted to Congress by October 1, 2010. A health home, also known as a medical home, offers patients access to a primary care provider to improve health outcomes. This model aims to provide personalized care, reduce hospitalizations, unnecessary tests, and enhance patient safety. In practice, medical homes are physician offices that offer coordinated care for a fee. The bill establishes a new Medicaid state plan option for certain Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions to designate a health home, defined by the Secretary. Eligible individuals must have at least two chronic conditions, one chronic condition with risk of a second, or a serious mental health condition. Patients can choose providers to form their health home. The health home state option under the bill allows Medicaid enrollees with chronic conditions to designate a provider or health team to receive comprehensive care management, coordination, and support services. The designated provider must meet qualification standards set by the Secretary and the program would be funded through a federal/state matching program. The states would receive assistance based on the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for the first eight fiscal quarters. States must reimburse providers using various payment schedules and meet specific requirements for referrals, coordination, monitoring, and reporting. Starting January 1, 2011, planning grants may be awarded to states for developing health home programs, with a federal contribution matched by the state. Total payments to states would not exceed $25 million, and program evaluation by an independent entity is required to assess its impact on reducing hospitalizations. The evaluation of the program's impact on reducing hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and skilled nursing facility admissions must be presented to the Secretary and Congress by January 1, 2017. Before that, by January 1, 2014, the Secretary must survey states participating in the program and report to Congress on various topics including hospital admission rates, chronic disease management, care coordination, quality improvements, cost savings, and more. States have the option to extend Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) to Medicaid beneficiaries without requiring a waiver under the HCBS state plan option. The bill aims to expand the HCBS state plan option by allowing states to offer additional services approved by the Secretary, beyond those listed in statute. States can provide different service packages to various beneficiary groups based on needs-based criteria or eligibility for waiver services. \"Medical assistance\" refers to payment for care and services outlined in federal statute. The bill clarifies that \"medical assistance\" includes payment for services and the services themselves, effective upon enactment. Medicaid financing is shared by the federal government and states, with FMAP rates based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita income. FMAPs range from 50% to 83%, with some services receiving a higher federal match rate. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided temporary enhanced FMAP rates for states from FY2009 to FY2011. States receive federal financial assistance based on FMAP rates, with a .5 percentage point increase for certain states from 2014 to 2016. From January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2019, states meeting specific requirements would receive a 2.2 percentage point increase in their regular FMAP rate for medical assistance. Eligible states include expansion states, those not receiving additional federal funds for newly eligible individuals, and states with the highest percentage of insured population in 2008, like Massachusetts. The FMAP increase described in this provision would not apply to Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, payments under CHIP, and payments under Medicaid based on the CHIP enhanced FMAP rate. Territories would see a 0.075 percentage point increase in the FMAP rate, excluding certain payments like Disproportionate Share Hospital payments and payments under Title IV. The federal government would match the cost of providing coverage to newly eligible individuals under Medicaid at higher rates. States requiring political subdivisions to contribute the non-federal share of expenditures may not be eligible for an FMAP increase. Voluntary contributions are not considered required. Table 1 summarizes the additional federal financial assistance available under the bill for newly eligible individuals with family income below 133% FPL. Newly eligible individuals are defined as non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals not already eligible for full Medicaid benefits. Expansion states would be defined as states with health benefits coverage for parents and non-pregnant childless adults with income at least 100% FPL, not based on employer coverage. The bill requires coverage to be more than premium assistance, hospital-only benefits, high deductible health plans, or alternative benefits under a demonstration program. Non-expansion states offer minimal or no coverage to the newly-eligible population. CHIP provides health care coverage to low-income, uninsured children in families with income above Medicaid standards. States can extend CHIP to pregnant women under certain conditions. States have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs, including expanding eligibility to higher-income individuals. Federal CHIP funding is provided through FY2013, with a matching payment system between state and federal governments. The federal share of CHIP expenditures is higher than Medicaid, with the enhanced FMAP lowering the state's share by 30%. Different reimbursement rates apply for certain CHIP and Medicaid expenditures. Beneficiary cost-sharing varies based on program design and income level, with preventive services exempt and a 5% cap on aggregate cost-sharing. The bill proposes changes to CHIP, maintaining current structure and providing appropriations through FY2015. States would receive a 23 percentage point increase in the CHIP match rate, subject to a cap of 100% for FY2014 through FY2019. States would need to ensure coverage for eligible CHIP children through state-established Exchanges if federal allotments are insufficient. Certain expenditures would not be eligible for the increase in the match rate. The bill proposes maintaining current CHIP structure and providing appropriations through FY2015. States would be required to maintain income eligibility levels for CHIP through September 30, 2019. States could not implement more restrictive eligibility standards than those in place on the date of enactment, but could expand current income eligibility levels. States could expand income eligibility levels for CHIP, enroll eligible children in qualified health plans after September 30, 2015. The Secretary must certify that these plans are comparable to CHIP benefits. If CHIP funds are insufficient, states must screen children for Medicaid eligibility. Beginning January 1, 2014, states must use modified gross income (MGI) and household income to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility, premiums, and cost-sharing. Medicaid and CHIP enrollment bonuses from CHIPRA would not apply after FY2013. States must ensure children ineligible for Medicaid are enrolled in a qualified health plan certified by the Secretary and offered through an Exchange. The new provision eliminates income disregards based on expense or type of income for CHIP children ineligible for Medicaid. CHIP benefit package and cost-sharing rules remain unchanged. A new Medicaid section regarding coordination with state health insurance exchanges also applies to CHIP programs. Federal CHIP allotments for states are determined by a formula set in law, with three state-specific amounts considered for FY2009. The federal CHIP allotments for states in FY2009 were determined by a formula that considered three state-specific amounts. The largest amount was to be increased by 10% to serve as the state's allotment, with reductions if the national appropriation was insufficient. The growth factor for the allotment formula was based on projected per capita spending and changes in the child population. The growth factor for calculating the CHIP allotment uses updated projected per capita spending and changes in the child population. For FY2010, the allotment is calculated by multiplying applicable amounts by the growth factor. In FY2009, FY2011, and FY2013, state CHIP allotments will be \"rebased\" based on prior year spending. The allotment for FY2012 will be calculated based on FY2011 allotment and Contingency Fund spending. The proposal extends the current law CHIP allotment formula through FY2015. Rebasing for FY2013 and FY2014 will be done by multiplying the state's growth factor by the prior year's federal CHIP spending. The proposal extends the current law CHIP allotment formula through FY2015. Rebasing for FY2013 and FY2014 will be done by multiplying the state's growth factor by the prior year's federal CHIP spending. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was established under CHIPRA to prevent states from federal CHIP fund shortfalls. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund receives a separate appropriation from the national CHIP allotment amounts. The appropriation is 20% of the CHIP available national allotment for FY2009 and such sums as necessary for FY2010 through FY2015. Payments can be made to eligible states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level, with direct payments to shortfall states. The proposal extends the authority for the Fund through FY2015. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund receives a separate appropriation from the national CHIP allotment amounts for fiscal years 2009 to 2015. Direct payments can be made to states with CHIP children above a target enrollment level. The current CHIP statute allows qualifying states to use CHIP funds for Medicaid children above 150% of the poverty level, with a 20% limit on spending. CHIPRA extended this provision for Medicaid children above 133% of the poverty level through FY2013. The proposal would further extend this authority through FY2015. The Child Health Quality Measurement Initiative under the Social Security Act aims to improve pediatric quality measures for Medicaid and CHIP. The program will establish criteria for certifying health plans as qualified health plans, including expanding existing measures and developing new ones. The provision outlines criteria for certifying health plans, including using uniform enrollment forms and reporting pediatric quality measures annually to the Secretary. States can require Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in employer-sponsored health plans if it is deemed cost-effective. In CHIP, states may receive federal matching payments for family coverage under a group health plan if it is cost-effective compared to state CHIP expenditures. Medicaid may offer premium assistance subsidies for qualified individuals. The Senate bill proposes provisions related to premium assistance subsidies for Medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 and their parents who have access to employer-sponsored coverage. This includes applying cost-effectiveness definitions from CHIP to Medicaid coverage and requiring states to offer premium assistance subsidies for qualified employer-sponsored coverage. The Senate bill proposes provisions related to premium assistance subsidies for Medicaid beneficiaries under age 19 and their parents who have access to employer-sponsored coverage. The provision added by Title X of the bill would make the requirement null, void, and of no effect, allowing premium assistance subsidies for qualified employer-sponsored coverage to remain a state option. States may offer a subsidy for targeted low-income children in CHIP who have access to such coverage, but no subsidy can be provided unless the child or parent voluntarily elects to receive it. Premium assistance subsidies for qualified employer-sponsored coverage must meet cost-effectiveness requirements. The bill proposes allowing premium assistance subsidies for qualified employer-sponsored coverage for CHIP children if cost-effective. It would remove the provision deeming compliance with cost-effectiveness test. \"Targeted low-income child\" is defined for CHIP purposes in Section 2110(b) of the Social Security Act. The law defines eligibility criteria for CHIP, including income levels and exclusions for certain groups of children. Exceptions are made for children of state employees enrolled in a state health plan with dependent coverage. The law allows children of state employees to enroll in CHIP if their family's annual premiums and cost-sharing exceed 5% of their income. Federal statute provides yearly total allotments for CHIP, with specific annual amounts appropriated from FY1998 to FY2012. Additional semi-annual allotments are available for FY2013. For FY2013, $11.706 billion was added as a one-time appropriation to reduce allotments assumed by the CBO for future fiscal years. The provision replaced semi-annual allotments with a $17.406 billion appropriation for FY2013 and $19.147 billion for FY2014. FY2015 would have two semi-annual allotments of $2.85 billion each. The bill would provide a one-time appropriation of $15.361 billion for FY2015, with funds allocated for outreach and enrollment grants, including a national campaign and outreach for Native American children. Grant funds will target rural areas, underserved populations, and address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. The time period for the outreach and enrollment grants would be extended through FY2015. The provision extends outreach and enrollment grants through FY2015 with an appropriation level of $140 million for FY2009 through FY2015. The proposal corrects provisions in CHIPRA and ARRA, including adjustments to FY2010 CHIP allotments and clarifications on certain references. The text chunk discusses adjustments and clarifications made to Medicaid expansion programs, CHIP statute, and Current Population Survey for CHIP purposes. It also addresses premium and cost-sharing protections for American Indians under Medicaid and CHIP. These changes would be effective as if they were included in previous legislation. Under Medicaid, states offer a variety of institutional and home and community-based services to certain enrollees, with varying criteria and limitations on benefits. Institutional services include care in nursing facilities, ICFs/MR, inpatient hospital services, and nursing facility services for older individuals in mental disease institutions. Home and community-based services are long-term care services provided under Medicaid's home health state plan benefit and personal care state. The bill aims to establish a state balancing incentive payment program to increase federal matching funds for non-institutional long-term care services under Medicaid for fiscal years 2012 through 2015. States spending less than 50% on non-institutional care can apply for additional funds by expanding and diversifying their long-term services and supports. The bill establishes a state balancing incentive program to increase federal matching funds for non-institutional long-term care services under Medicaid. States can apply for additional funds by expanding services and meeting target spending percentages. The bill establishes a state balancing incentive program to increase federal matching funds for non-institutional long-term care services under Medicaid. States meeting the 25% target would see a 5 percentage point increase in their FMAP, while all other participating states would receive a 2 percentage point increase. The incentive period would run from October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2015. Medicaid statute requires states to pay disproportionate share (DSH) adjustments to hospitals serving uninsured individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries, with specific formulas for DSH allotments. States must define DSH hospitals and payment formulas in their Medicaid plans, with changes to state DSH allotments occurring over time. The bill establishes a state balancing incentive program to increase federal matching funds for non-institutional long-term care services under Medicaid. Special rules apply to \"low DSH states,\" with DSH allotments raised for FY2004 through FY2008. DSH allotments for all states will increase annually based on the consumer price index. States cannot receive federal matching payments for DSH exceeding their allotment. State DSH allotments will remain unchanged until a state level is reached based on uninsured rates. The uninsured rate, as measured by the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, decreases by at least 45% compared to FY2009. Reductions in DSH allotments depend on a state's status as a low DSH state and spending patterns over a base 5-year period. Low DSH states that have not spent more than 99.90% of their allotments would see a 25% decrease, while those that have spent more would see a 17.5% decrease. All other states would face a 50% decrease if they have not spent more than 99.90% of their allotments, and a 17.5% decrease if they have spent more. For states that have spent over 99.90% of their DSH allotments on average for the base 5-year period, a 35% decrease in DSH allotments would occur. Further reductions would be based on a state's uninsurance rate and spending patterns. Low DSH states not meeting the 99.90% threshold would see a 27.5% decrease, while those exceeding it would face a 20% decrease. For states not meeting the 99.90% threshold, DSH allotments would be decreased based on the reduction in uncovered individuals, with reductions of 55% for some states and 40% for others. DSH allotments would not fall below 50% of the state's FY2012 allotment, with adjustments for CPI-U changes. Hawaii is exempt from these provisions. Under the bill, reductions in DSH funds would not apply to certain state waivers for Medicaid coverage. Tennessee and Hawaii have special arrangements for their DSH allotments, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years. Hawaii's DSH allotment would be increased annually based on CPI-U changes. The provision prohibits the Secretary from imposing a limit on payments to hospitals under Hawaii's QUEST Section 1115 demonstration project, except to ensure payments do not exceed hospital specific caps or the federal share of DSH within the project's budget neutrality provision. Recent focus on state fiscal situations has been on Medicaid expenditure shares and changes in federal shares. For example, under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, states received a temporary increase in Medicaid FMAPs for specific quarters. During FY2003 and FY2004, Medicaid FMAPs were increased by 2.95 percentage points as part of a fiscal relief package. Congress also provided enhanced FMAP rates under ARRA in 2009 to help states during the recession, with a 6.2 percentage point increase across the board. States and the District of Columbia receive a 6.2 percentage point FMAP increase under ARRA, with qualifying states getting an additional unemployment-related increase. Territories had the choice of a 6.2 percentage point FMAP increase with a 15% spending cap increase or their regular FMAP with a 30% spending cap increase, all territories chose the latter. DRA included provisions to exclude certain Hurricane Katrina evacuees from FMAP calculations, prevent Alaska's FMAPs from dropping below FY2005 levels, and provide $2 billion for Katrina-related Medicaid and CHIP costs. Other provisions aimed to temporarily increase FMAPs for Katrina-affected states, limit FY2006 FMAP reductions, and disregard certain employer contributions. The final bill debated FY2006 FMAP reductions and disregarding certain employer contributions for Medicaid FMAPs. States recovering from a major disaster within the last seven years could receive a special FMAP adjustment percentage by meeting specific criteria. The special disaster recovery FMAP adjustment for states recovering from a major disaster within the last seven years would be based on a percentage difference between the state's normal FMAP rate and the previous fiscal year's rate, with adjustments made for ARRA's hold harmless provision. The special disaster recovery FMAP rate is determined by a percentage difference between a state's normal FMAP rate and the rate for the previous fiscal year, excluding the ARRA hold harmless adjustment. In FY2011, seven states qualified for this rate due to being declared a major disaster, with Louisiana having a three percentage point difference in FMAP rates. Other states may qualify in the future if they meet the criteria. This provision is effective from January 1, 2011. The provision effective from January 1, 2011, impacts five territories operating Medicaid programs with different rules compared to states. Territories have optional coverage for certain groups and face annual federal spending caps leading to assuming full Medicaid service costs once caps are reached. The bill increases spending caps for territories by 30% for certain quarters and sets the FMAP at 55%. Payments for \"newly eligible\" individuals won't count towards spending caps starting in 2014. Medicaid eligibility based on income levels, Medicare's prospective payment system for hospital reimbursement, and the implementation of a hospital-acquired condition program to align payment policies with quality of care. CMS implemented policies to align Medicaid inpatient hospital payment with Medicare's HAC payment policies, instructing states to deny payment for HACs and serious preventable medical errors. The bill aims to align Medicaid payment policies with Medicare's HAC initiative by prohibiting federal Medicaid matching payments for health care-acquired conditions. The Secretary would define these conditions, ensuring Medicaid beneficiaries still have access to services. Regulations would be issued by July 1, 2011, and would not be limited to conditions acquired in hospitals. The bill aligns Medicaid payment policies with Medicare's HAC initiative by prohibiting federal Medicaid matching payments for health care-acquired conditions. The Secretary must apply Medicare's regulations to Medicaid, report on hospital-acquired conditions measures, and require rebate agreements for prescription drugs sold to Medicaid agencies. In 2004, 550 pharmaceutical manufacturers participated in Medicaid's drug rebate program, where participating manufacturers must report average manufacturer prices and lowest transaction prices for each prescription drug purchased by Medicaid. These prices serve as reference points for determining manufacturers' rebate obligations. Medicaid requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report prices for prescription drugs purchased on behalf of beneficiaries. Rebates are determined based on two types of drugs: single source (under patent) and innovator multiple source drugs. The basic rebate is calculated using a drug's quarterly AMP compared to the best price or a flat percentage. An additional rebate is owed if unit prices increased faster than inflation. The Medicaid program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report prices for prescription drugs purchased for beneficiaries. Rebates are calculated based on different types of drugs, with additional rebates owed if unit prices increase faster than inflation. Manufacturers can sometimes avoid additional rebate obligations by making slight alterations to existing products and releasing them as new line-extension products, which have higher base period AMPs. This practice is allowed under existing Medicaid drug rebate rules. The Public Health Service Act requires drug manufacturers to discount outpatient drugs for certain public health facilities. The bill would increase the rebate percentage for Medicaid's basic rebate on certain drugs. The Secretary would recover additional funds states received from manufacturers due to the increases. The bill authorizes the Secretary to reduce Medicaid payments to states by the state share of additional prescription drug rebates resulting from increases in minimum rebate percentages. The Secretary would estimate and recover these additional rebate amounts from states based on utilization data. Overpayments would be disallowed against states' regular Medicaid draw, and adjustments would be made for any underestimations in rebate amounts. The bill requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states for drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid capitation rates would be adjusted to include these rebates, and Medicaid MCOs would have additional reporting requirements. Formularies could be used with an exception process, and drugs discounted under 340B would be excluded. Additional rebates for new drug formulations would be required. The Medicaid drug rebate program requires manufacturers to pay rebates for single source or innovator multiple source drugs. The rebate amount is based on the AMP of the new drug multiplied by the highest additional rebate for any strength of the original product. The total rebate liability for each drug is limited to 100% of the drug's AMP. Medicaid law excludes coverage of certain drug classes, but states have the option to cover them and receive federal funding. These changes took effect on January 1, 2010. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 requires Medicare prescription drug plans to include benzodiazepines and barbiturates in their formularies starting January 1, 2013. Barbiturates will also be required for specific indications in Medicare formularies from January 1, 2014. The provision would add smoking cessation drugs, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines to Medicaid's covered drug list. States covering prescription drugs must include these for most Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid law sets upper limits on federal payments for drugs to promote generic substitution. The new FUL formula, effective January 1, 2007, equals 250% of the AMP of the least costly therapeutic equivalent. AMP is the average price paid to manufacturers by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail pharmacies. The DRA reduced the number of multiple source products rated by the FDA as therapeutic and pharmaceutically equivalent from three to two. Manufacturers report AMP to CMS. National pharmacy associations challenged the legality of the DRA's FUL methodology, claiming it would result in FULs below drug acquisition costs for smaller community pharmacies. A court injunction in 2007 prohibited CMS from setting FULs for Medicaid covered generic drugs based on AMP. The court injunction in 2007 prohibited CMS from using AMP to calculate Medicaid FULs indefinitely. MIPPA Section 203 imposed a moratorium on using AMP to set FULs until October 1, 2009. FULs could be set based on pre-DRA methodology until September 30, 2009. CMS currently lacks authority to set FULs using either pre-DRA or DRA formulas. CMS issued a list of multiple source drug FULs on September 25, 2009 to establish the federal maximum that states may pay under Medicaid. Most states use Medicaid Acquisition Costs (MACs) to set their own ceiling prices, which are often lower than FULs. The bill proposes setting FULs at 175% or more of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs and restoring the pre-DRA definition of multiple source drugs. The FUL formula would include technical specifications such as a smoothing process for average prices and clarifying the definition of AMP. The bill aims to revise the definition of multiple source drugs and expand drug pricing disclosure requirements for manufacturers. It would exclude certain discounts and fees from the average manufacturer price (AMP) calculation and require reporting of unit sales for each covered outpatient drug. The provision would be effective six months after enactment. The bill revises the definition of multiple source drugs and expands drug pricing disclosure requirements for manufacturers. Pharmaceutical drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program must discount covered outpatient drugs for certain public health entities. Covered entities include hospitals serving a higher percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries, Federally Qualified Health Centers, family planning clinics, and others as identified in the PHSA. Discounts do not apply to inpatient drugs under the 340B program. The bill expands the list of covered entities eligible for 340B discounts to include certain hospitals and rural referral centers. It also extends 340B discounts to inpatient drugs for participating hospital entities. The Secretary would develop systems to improve compliance and program integrity, and the GAO would submit a report on the quality of healthcare services received by individuals through 340B covered entities. The bill expands 340B discounts to more entities for better healthcare services. Program integrity initiatives combat fraud and abuse in Medicaid spending. Federal government contributes to combat fraud with enhanced FMAP. Operation of required Medicaid Management Information. Congress provided new dedicated funding for program integrity initiatives in the Medicaid program, including the establishment of a Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) with an annual appropriation of $75 million for audits, overpayments identification, payment integrity, and quality of care education. Additional funding was allocated for Medicaid activities of the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) and the expansion of the Medicare-Medicaid data match project (Medi-Medi) to detect aberrant billing patterns. The bill aims to increase coordination between Medicare and Medicaid program integrity activities by introducing new requirements for provider screening and creating an integrated data repository. This includes aligning screening fees and rules for both programs to enhance uniformity and strengthen efforts to prevent fraud and abuse. The bill aims to increase coordination between Medicare and Medicaid program integrity activities by introducing new requirements for provider screening and creating an integrated data repository. This includes aligning screening fees and rules for both programs to enhance uniformity and strengthen efforts to prevent fraud and abuse. Additionally, a recovery audit contractor (RAC) requirement, similar to Medicare's RAC program, would be established for Medicaid to identify and collect improper payments. The CMS initiated a national rollout of the permanent RAC program in 19 states in March 2009, focusing on Medicare Parts A and B. States were required to establish contracts with RACs by December 31, 2010, to identify underpayments, overpayments, and recoup funds for services provided under state Medicaid plans. The state RAC program would operate on a contingency basis and include an appeal process for adverse determinations. States had to make assurances for their RAC programs, subject to exceptions and requirements set by the Secretary. The Secretary is required to exclude providers or individuals from Medicare or Medicaid if convicted of certain criminal offenses related to healthcare delivery or fraud. Exclusions may also apply for felony convictions involving neglect or abuse of patients, financial misconduct, or controlled substances. The Secretary can exclude providers or individuals from Medicare or Medicaid for prohibited activities like program-related convictions, license revocation, and default on obligations. States must terminate entities from Medicaid if they have unpaid overpayments or are affiliated with terminated entities. Effective January 1, 2011. The provision effective January 1, 2011, requires Medicaid agencies to exclude individuals or entities with unpaid overpayments or affiliations with terminated entities from participation in Medicaid. Effective January 1, 2011, Medicaid requires disclosing entities to provide information on individuals with ownership interests of 5% or more. This includes various healthcare providers and organizations. States must exclude individuals or entities with unpaid overpayments or affiliations with terminated entities from Medicaid participation. The provision requires states to exclude individuals or entities from Medicaid participation as directed by the Secretary and deny payment for any item or service provided. Agents submitting claims must register with the state and Secretary. States must operate a Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) approved by the Secretary, compatible with Medicare systems, and using uniform coding systems. The provision requires states to operate MMISs for claims processing and data interchange, meeting specified requirements for timely and accurate data transmission. MMISs capture Medicaid claims data for FFS care, but generally do not include managed care data. MCOs are paid fixed fees under managed care, with varying encounter data reporting requirements. States do not report managed care data to CMS through MMISs. The provision requires states to collect and submit managed care data through their MMISs for program integrity and oversight. States must submit data elements as determined necessary by the Secretary. The measure prohibits Medicaid payments to institutions or entities located outside the United States. The provision requires states to promptly repay federal Medicaid overpayments within 60 days of discovery. If overpayments are uncollectible, federal matching payments will not be adjusted. The bill extends the time for states to repay overpayments due to fraud to one year. The bill extends the time for states to repay overpayments due to fraud to one year. The Secretary would issue regulations for states to identify and correct recurring overpayments. CMS processes Part B Medicare claims for physician, laboratory, and radiology services. In 1996, CMS implemented the NCCI to ensure accurate payment for Medicare Part B claims by using pre-payment edits to detect incorrect information. States are required to add similar pre-payment edits to their Medicaid Management Information Systems to control improper coding. The Secretary would need to identify NCCI methodologies compatible with Medicaid payment claims and notify states on how to incorporate them. A report to Congress by March 1, 2011 would include the notice to states and an analysis supporting the identification of NCCI methodologies for Medicaid claims. States must implement waste, fraud, and abuse programs specified in the bill by January 1, 2011. The bill requires the Secretary to establish procedures for screening providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs, including screening processes, oversight measures, disclosure requirements, enrollment moratoriums, and compliance program development. States have additional time to comply with requirements if state legislation is needed to amend the state plan or child health plan. The Secretary must develop procedures for screening providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs within six months of enactment. Providers will undergo various levels of screening based on fraud risk, including licensure checks and potential additional measures like criminal background checks and site visits. Fees will be imposed on institutional providers and suppliers to cover screening costs, with exceptions for certain Medicaid providers. The bill proposes fees for institutional providers starting at $500, with adjustments for inflation. The Secretary can impose a moratorium on enrolling new providers if needed. Providers must establish compliance programs and adhere to standards set by the Secretary and OIG. The Secretary must enhance program integrity initiatives for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, including data matching efforts to consolidate information from multiple databases. The bill proposes consolidating information from multiple databases into an Integrated Data Repository (IDR) for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, VA, DOD, Social Security, and IHS programs. Inspectors General would have explicit access to Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payment and claims data for combating waste, fraud, and abuse. The bill proposes granting the OIG access to Medicaid, CHIP, and Medicare Part D data for law enforcement purposes. It also allows the OIG to obtain information from individuals providing medical services. Additionally, the provision imposes penalties on beneficiaries participating in health care fraud schemes. The NPI is a unique identifier for health care providers required by HIPAA for administrative simplification. The bill mandates the use of NPI for health care providers under HIPAA. The Secretary can withhold federal payments for Medicaid services if encounter data is not submitted timely. HHS OIG has the authority to exclude providers from federal health care programs. The bill allows for permissive exclusions by HHS OIG for false statements on enrollment applications in federal health care programs. It also authorizes Civil Monetary Penalties for improper conduct, with penalties of up to $10,000 for false claims and assessments of up to three times the amount claimed. The bill introduces additional actions subject to Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs), including individuals excluded from federal health care programs who order or prescribe items, make false statements, or fail to return overpayments. It also grants testimonial subpoena authority to issue subpoenas for witness testimony and evidence related to investigations. The Secretary can request evidence related to investigations and delegate authority to the OIG and CMS administrator. The Medicare and Medicaid Integrity Programs aim to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse through various activities. The Medicaid Integrity Program mirrors the Medicare program and provides resources to combat fraud. The provision aims to add 100 full-time equivalent MIP staff to ensure the integrity of Medicare and Medicaid programs. Contractors must provide performance statistics to the Secretary and OIG, including overpayments recovered and fraud referrals. Evaluations of eligible entities must be conducted every three years, with a report to Congress on MIP funds' use and effectiveness. Skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes must comply with safety and health regulations for residents' well-being. Facilities undergo regular inspections to ensure compliance with federal standards. Deficiencies can result in penalties or even closure of SNF or nursing homes. The proposed measure would enhance accountability requirements for Medicare and Medicaid certified facilities, including additional ownership information and staff training programs. The proposed changes would require SNFs and NFs to establish compliance and ethics programs, report wage and benefit expenditures for direct care staff, and redesign Medicare and Medicaid cost reports. The Secretary would also enhance information on the Nursing Home Compare website and develop a standardized complaint form for stakeholders and consumers. The bill proposes changes requiring SNFs and NFs to electronically report staffing information, conduct a study on the Five-Star rating system, establish civil money penalties for quality of care issues, and implement a national monitoring demonstration for SNF and NF chains. New requirements for administrators to inform stakeholders of facility plans would also be established. The bill proposes penalties for SNF and NF administrators who fail to comply with closure notice requirements, including fines up to $100,000 and exclusion from federal health programs. The Secretary would conduct demonstration projects on culture change and information technology best practices in SNFs and NFs, revise nurse aide training requirements to include dementia and abuse prevention, and update dementia management and abuse prevention training for ongoing nurse training. Effective dates for nursing home transparency provisions vary, mostly within two years of enactment. The Secretary would also implement the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration. The Money Follows the Person (MFP) Rebalancing Demonstration aims to increase the use of home and community-based long-term care services, eliminate barriers to Medicaid funds, assure quality assurance, and support individuals transitioning from institutions to community settings. Participants must meet specific residency and Medicaid benefit criteria. The bill extends the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration through September 30, 2016, with changes to eligibility rules requiring a 90-day stay in an inpatient facility. It excludes Medicare-covered short-term rehabilitative services from counting towards the 90-day period and establishes a Medicaid demonstration for bundled payments to hospitals and physicians. The demonstration project extends the MFP Rebalancing Demonstration through September 30, 2016, with changes to eligibility rules. It includes a Medicaid demonstration for bundled payments to hospitals and physicians for integrated care, based on severity of illness. States can target specific categories of beneficiaries and participating hospitals must have robust discharge planning programs. The project is limited to eight states and runs from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2016. The bill proposes the establishment of the Medicaid Global Payment System Demonstration Project in up to five states. This project would transition payments to safety net hospitals from a fee-for-service structure to a fixed-dollar, capitated payment model. The Secretary has the authority to modify or terminate the project during an initial testing period. The bill proposes a Medicaid Global Payment System Demonstration Project in up to five states, transitioning payments to safety net hospitals to a fixed-dollar, capitated payment model. The Secretary has the authority to modify or terminate the project during an initial testing period, with an evaluation due to the Innovation Center within 12 months. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are defined as groups of providers jointly responsible for the quality and cost of healthcare services for a population of beneficiaries. The bill includes a Medicare Shared Savings Program for providers meeting certain criteria to be recognized as ACOs and share in cost-savings achieved. The bill proposes the establishment of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for providers to share in cost-savings for the Medicare program. ACOs would consist of various healthcare practitioners in group practice arrangements, networks of practices, and partnerships between hospitals and practitioners. Additionally, the bill includes a Pediatric Care Organization demonstration project for pediatric medical providers to be recognized as ACOs and share in cost-savings. The bill proposes the establishment of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for providers to share in cost-savings for the Medicare program. ACOs could include pediatric physicians in group practice arrangements, networks of practices, and joint-venture arrangements with hospitals. Qualified ACOs would need to meet quality performance guidelines and a minimum annual savings level to receive incentive payments under the proposed program. The Secretary would determine the amount of the annual incentive payment, which would be a portion of savings with a possible annual cap on total payments. The bill proposes the establishment of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) for providers to share in cost-savings for the Medicare program. ACOs could include pediatric physicians in group practice arrangements, networks of practices, and joint-venture arrangements with hospitals. Qualified ACOs would need to meet quality performance guidelines and a minimum annual savings level to receive incentive payments under the proposed program. The bill would authorize an appropriation of funds for a demonstration project to finance this initiative. Medicaid does not reimburse for services provided to residents of institutions for mental disease (IMD), except for specific cases such as individuals under age 21 receiving inpatient psychiatric care and individuals age 65 and over. The bill proposes a Medicaid demonstration project to reimburse certain IMDs for stabilizing psychiatric emergency medical conditions in Medicaid eligibles aged 21-64. States must establish in-stay review mechanisms to determine stabilization before the third day of inpatient stay. Eligible states would be part of a three-year project. The bill proposes a Medicaid demonstration project to reimburse certain IMDs for stabilizing psychiatric emergency medical conditions in Medicaid eligibles aged 21-64. Eligible states would be selected based on geographic diversity. The provision would provide $75 million for FY2011, with funds available for five years. An evaluation would be conducted on access to inpatient mental health services under Medicaid. A grant program would support school-based health centers with $200 million appropriated from FY2010 through FY2013. The Secretary would establish criteria and procedures for awarding grants to school-based health centers serving children eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Grant funds can only be used for facilities, equipment, or similar costs, not for personnel or healthcare expenses. The Secretary could also award grants to states to incentivize Medicaid beneficiaries to participate in programs promoting healthy lifestyles. The initiative aims to promote healthy lifestyles among Medicaid eligible beneficiaries by addressing key health needs such as lowering cholesterol, managing weight, quitting smoking, and preventing diabetes. $100 million in funding would be allocated for grants over five years to test behavior modification approaches. Criteria for grants will be based on evidence-based research, with awards starting in 2011 or when program criteria are developed. The state initiatives under the program would last at least three years of the five-year program from January 1, 2011, through January 1, 2016. States can apply for funds to provide incentives to Medicaid enrollees who complete healthy lifestyle programs, collaborating with various organizations. States awarded grants must conduct outreach campaigns for Medicaid beneficiaries and providers, track participation, and validate health outcomes. The program aims to track beneficiary participation, validate health changes, set health targets, evaluate effectiveness, and report to the Secretary. States awarded grants must submit semi-annual reports on fund usage, program implementation, quality improvements, and cost savings. This provision exempts states from a requirement related to statewide accessibility for medical assistance programs. The Secretary must contract with an independent entity for oversight. The Secretary must contract with an independent entity to evaluate state initiatives on healthcare services utilization, participation of special populations, Medicaid beneficiary satisfaction, and administrative costs. Initial report due before January 1, 2014, with recommendations on funding continuation beyond January 1, 2016. Final report due before July 1, 2016, including independent contractor assessment. The report before July 1, 2016 would include the independent contractor assessment and recommendations for legislative and administrative actions. Incentives received by beneficiaries would not affect eligibility for federal programs like Medicaid. CHIPRA aimed to improve care quality under Medicaid and CHIP, including a $25 million initiative to reduce child obesity. The bill proposed $25 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 for the childhood obesity project. The Congress directed the Secretary to establish a Medicaid Improvement Fund (MIF) to improve the management of the Medicaid program, with funding totaling $100 million in FY2014 and $150 million in FYs 2015-2018. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 revised funding for Physician Assistance and Quality Initiative to be used for MIF activities. The bill would rescind unobligated MIF funds for FYs 2014 through 2018. The Secretary would be required to ensure that all states develop service systems designed to allocate resources. Established under the Older Americans Act (OAA), Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) provide information and assistance to elderly persons and individuals with disabilities. They serve as a single point of entry for enrollment in publicly-administered Long-Term Care services, including those funded by Medicaid and OAA, to improve coordination among providers and maximize independence. The bill appropriates $10 million annually for FY2010 through FY2014 to carry out ADRC initiatives, aiming to address long-term services and supports for elderly and disabled individuals. Dual eligibles qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid due to limited income and assets. The bill authorizes the Secretary to approve Medicaid waivers for up to five years, allowing for coordination of care for dual eligibles and non-dual eligible beneficiaries. Waivers can be renewed for additional five-year periods. The bill authorizes the Secretary to approve Medicaid waivers for up to five years, allowing for coordination of care for dual eligibles and non-dual eligible beneficiaries. The provision also allows for waiver extensions for additional five-year periods, with the condition that they meet certain criteria. Additionally, the bill mandates the establishment of a federal coordinated health care office (CHCO) within CMS to integrate benefits and improve care coordination for dual eligible individuals. The bill aims to provide dual eligible individuals with full access to benefits under Medicare and Medicaid, simplify access processes, improve healthcare quality, increase understanding and satisfaction, eliminate regulatory conflicts, improve care continuity, eliminate cost-shifting, and enhance provider performance. It also establishes a federal coordinated health care office (CHCO) within CMS. The bill establishes a federal coordinated health care office (CHCO) within CMS to provide specialized Medicare Advantage plans for special needs individuals, support state efforts in coordinating acute care and LTC services for dual eligible individuals, consult on enrollment and benefit policies, study drug coverage for new full-benefit dual eligibles, and monitor total annual expenditures and health outcomes for all dual eligible individuals. The bill's CHCO provision would require the Secretary to submit a report to Congress on total annual expenditures, health outcomes, and access to benefits for dual eligibles. It would also add a federal initiative to collect and report quality of care data for adults enrolled in Medicaid, including publishing a recommended core set of adult health quality measures by January 1, 2012. The Secretary, in consultation with states, must develop a standardized format for reporting information based on a core measurement set by January 1, 2013. States are encouraged to voluntarily report data using these measures. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress every three years starting before January 1, 2014, detailing efforts to improve coverage duration, care quality, state reporting, and recommendations for legislative changes for Medicaid adults. The bill requires the establishment of a Medicaid Quality Measurement Program (MQMP) to develop innovative evidence-based measures for Medicaid adults. The Secretary must publish recommended changes to the core set of adult health quality measures based on testing and validation results within two years. The bill does not limit Medicaid or CHIP coverage to only evidence-based services and includes state reporting requirements for adult health quality measures. The bill appropriates $60 million annually for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to collect and analyze information on managed care organizations. A federal commission called MACPAC will review program policies under Medicaid and CHIP to improve children's access to benefits. The bill establishes a federal commission called MACPAC to review Medicaid and CHIP payment policies, access to care, and other related policies. MACPAC will make recommendations to Congress and submit annual reports on these issues, including identifying provider shortage areas. The bill establishes MACPAC to review Medicaid and CHIP payment policies, access to care, and related policies. MACPAC's duties include assessing factors affecting expenditures, payment methodologies, provider supply, and serving vulnerable populations. It will also review eligibility, benefits, quality of care, and interactions between Medicaid and Medicare. MACPAC must report to Congress on regulations impacting access, quality, and efficiency of healthcare. MACPAC is authorized to obtain data from state agencies administering Medicaid or CHIP, coordinate with the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office, and appropriate $11 million for FY2010, with $9 million from the Treasury and $2 million from CHIP funds. MACPAC is responsible for changes to Medicaid policy for dual eligibles. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides health care for eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs and facilities. These programs can receive reimbursements from various sources. American Indians and Alaska Natives receiving services through IHS programs may not be charged premiums or cost-sharing in Medicaid. IHS is the payer of last resort for contract health services. The Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act allows states to facilitate Medicaid enrollment by relying on \"Express Lane\" agencies for eligibility. IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs are not included in these agencies. The bill aims to modify Medicaid and CHIP enrollment for IHS-eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives, designating IHS programs as the payer of last resort for services. The bill aims to designate IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs as the payer of last resort for services provided to eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives, including those covered by Medicaid and CHIP. It would also add these agencies to the list of \"Express Lane\" agencies and prohibit cost-sharing for American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in qualified health plans. Additionally, the bill would require the establishment of a Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Center within CMS by January 1, 2011, to test innovative payment and delivery models. The bill aims to establish a Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Center within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models aimed at reducing program expenditures while improving care quality. The Secretary would select models that enhance coordination, quality, and efficiency of healthcare services, focusing on populations with deficits in care leading to poor outcomes, including dual eligibles. The Secretary would have authority to limit testing to certain geographic areas. The bill authorizes the establishment of a Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Center to test payment and service delivery models. The Secretary can limit testing to specific geographic areas and must evaluate each model tested. Funding is allocated for model design, implementation, and evaluation. The Secretary must report to Congress on the Center regularly. The Government Accountability Office would conduct a study on guidelines implementation. The GAO would conduct a study on the implementation of guidelines under selected provisions in the bill, including Medicaid-related and non-Medicaid related provisions. The study would assess if new causes of action or claims would result. The Secretary would provide guidance on preventive and obesity-related services for Medicaid enrollees, with states required to design public awareness campaigns. The Secretary is required to report to Congress on efforts to improve availability and coverage of services, starting in 2011 and every three years until 2017. Funding is authorized for these activities. States can submit proposals for research and demonstration projects under Medicaid and CHIP, with waivers granted by the Secretary. CMS issued guidance in 1994 for the waiver approval process, including public involvement requirements. States must provide a description of their process to CMS. The bill imposes statutory requirements for transparency in Medicaid and CHIP Section 1115 demonstration programs. States must involve the public in the application and renewal process, including public forums, hearings, and a website for comments. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 180 days to ensure public notice and comment at the state level. The bill requires transparency in Medicaid and CHIP Section 1115 demonstration programs, including public input in the application and renewal process, cost projections, compliance plans, and periodic reporting to the Secretary. Annual reports to Congress on Secretary's actions are also mandated. Annual report to Congress required on Secretary's actions regarding demonstration projects under this section. Appendices include Effective Dates for Medicaid and CHIP provisions and Glossary of Terms."
