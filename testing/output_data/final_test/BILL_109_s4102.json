    "content": "The Act titled \"Election Jamming Prevention Act of 2006\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the right to vote is fundamental, efforts have historically been made to restrict voting access, and now deceptive practices are used to impede qualified voters and prevent informed decisions. In recent elections, there have been allegations of political campaigns using telephone jamming techniques to shut down communication operations of groups supporting their opponents. In November 2002, groups working for Republican candidates in New Hampshire conspired to disrupt Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts by placing hang-up calls to their phone lines. Several individuals have been convicted in connection with this incident. The Manchester Democratic Party and the Manchester Professional Firefighters Association were jammed on election day 2002, preventing qualified voters from accessing information to reach polling places. The use of communication devices to jam election-related communications should be prohibited to protect voters' right to vote. PROHIBITION ON PREVENTING OR OBSTRUCTING THE BROADCAST OR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION THROUGH TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICES. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to prohibit actions with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person, prevent or obstruct the broadcast or exchange of election-related information, or impair any telecommunications device from being used for election-related communications. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define \"election-related information\" as information related to endorsing, supporting, promoting, or opposing candidates for various political offices, election details, and transportation facilitation. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to allow for private legal action against violations related to facilitating transport to or from polling places during elections."
