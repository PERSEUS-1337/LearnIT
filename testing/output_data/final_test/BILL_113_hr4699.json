This aims to support tribal-owned enterprises and Indian-owned businesses for sustainable tribal economies. The Secretary of Commerce must report to Congress every 3 years on promoting economic growth for Indian tribes and lands, consulting with various federal agencies. The report, prepared by the Secretary of Commerce, the White House Council on Native American Affairs, and Indian tribes, includes data on Indian business development and employment over a 3-year period, with the first report covering a 10-year period.
