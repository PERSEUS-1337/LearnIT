    "content": "The 1866 statute \"R.S. 2477\" granted rights of way for highway construction across federal public lands, but was repealed in 1976 by the FLPMA. The validation of pre-1976 R.S. 2477 rights of way has been a controversial issue for over a decade, impacting states and communities with affected highway systems. These rights of way may cross undeveloped federal lands or private/federal reserves. Rights of way granted by the 1866 statute \"R.S. 2477\" for highway construction across federal public lands have been a controversial issue since the statute was repealed in 1976. The validation of these rights of way impacts states and communities with affected highway systems, potentially affecting federal and non-federal lands, private lands, and water quality. Motorized access to federal lands in Utah is seen as important for various economic activities. The 1866 statute \"R.S. 2477\" granted rights of way for highway construction across federal public lands, impacting states and communities. Motorized access in Utah is crucial for economic activities like ranching and mining. Senator Hatch emphasized the importance of these roads for rural communities, providing necessary access for farms, ranches, school buses, and emergency vehicles. The Department of the Interior published new regulations on \"disclaimers of interest\" on January 6, 2003. The United States issued a disclaimer to remove a cloud from land title, acknowledging certain highway rights of way in Utah. The disclaimer regulations were issued under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The amended disclaimer regulations under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 allow states and others to apply for disclaimers of interest by the United States, regardless of whether they are the property owner of record. Exceptions to the 12-year statute of limitations are provided, and concerns were raised about the potential confirmation of R.S. 2477 rights of way through disclaimers. The final regulations address concerns about the relationship between the proposed rule and R.S. 2477, stating that disclaimers are appropriate in the R.S. 2477 context to remove cloud on title. The rule does not provide standards for recognizing R.S. 2477 rights of way, avoiding violation of P.L. 104-208. Property disputes involving federal lands were traditionally resolved by Congress or courts, with disclaimers used when there is no dispute over U.S. ownership. The use of disclaimers under the Quiet Title Act spares parties time and expense by avoiding court disputes over U.S. ownership of properties. However, controversy may arise over the validity criteria for R.S. 2477 rights of way without clear guidance on evaluation and resolution. The Administration claims disclaimers will only be used for obvious R.S. 2477 claims or those meeting statutory construction and highway requirements. The terms of the Utah MOU, equating \"highway\" with \"road,\" could broaden rights of way, leading to potential controversy. The amended disclaimer rules may impact the validity of R.S. 2477 rights of way claims, as they are separate from determining the validity of claims. The MOU with Utah establishes an acknowledgment process for validating R.S. 2477 rights of way claims. The process validates R.S. 2477 rights of way claimed by states like Utah and California, with other states showing interest. Concerns arise over disparate approaches and lack of criteria for validating claims. The articulation of criteria and definitions for R.S. 2477 claims has been a controversial issue. State courts established their own standards for determining acceptance of grants for public maintenance. After the repeal of the 1866 Act in 1976, attention shifted to the elements of federal grants. After the repeal of the 1866 Act in 1976, Congress addressed the R.S. 2477 controversy multiple times, including passing a bill in 1991 and directing the Department of Interior to prepare a report on R.S. 2477 validity criteria in 1993. In 1993, a report recommended regulations for validating R.S. 2477 claims, which Secretary Babbitt proposed in 1994. However, these regulations were controversial and faced congressional prohibitions. Bills introduced in 1995 and 1996 aimed to shift the burden of proof to the United States and apply state law for determinations. In the 104th Congress, a compromise was reached regarding R.S. 2477 claims. Secretary Babbitt revoked a 1988 policy and implemented an interim policy to postpone determinations. Legislation based on a proposal sent in 1997 was not introduced, and administrative determinations have been limited since then. Disputed claims have been addressed in the courts. In the 108th Congress, new administrative acknowledgment processes could validate R.S. 2477 rights of way under amended disclaimer regulations. H.R.1639 proposes a legislated system for evaluating claims, and an amendment to the FY2004 DOI Appropriations bill aimed to prohibit implementation of the amendments in certain areas. The report discusses the disclaimer provision of FLPMA, recent amendments to the disclaimer regulations, the Utah MOU, background on the R.S. 2477 grant for highway construction, administrative and judicial interpretation, unsettled interpretation questions, and the relationship of amended disclaimer regulations to R.S. 2477. It also mentions H.R.1639 and other related actions. The report discusses the disclaimer provision of FLPMA, recent amendments to the regulations, the Utah MOU, background on R.S. 2477 grant for highway construction, administrative and judicial interpretation, and the relationship of amended disclaimer regulations to R.S. 2477. It also mentions H.R.1639 and other related actions in the current Congress. The federal disclaimer of interest helps clear title to real property by having an effect equivalent to a quitclaim deed. It does not convey title but can prevent the United States from later claiming ownership. The purpose is to avoid court action or private legislation when there is a cloud on the title attributable to the United States. The federal disclaimer regulations allow for the United States to disclaim ownership or record interest in lands with clouded titles. The regulations have been amended to remove limitations on who can apply and the time limit for filing an application. The amended regulations allow any entity to file an application for a disclaimer, removing time limitations for most applicants but not for states. The new regulations broaden the definition of \"state\" to include political subdivisions and other official local governmental entities. This change aligns the regulations with the Quiet Title Act, which is the exclusive vehicle for resolving title disputes with the United States. The amended regulations broaden the definition of \"state\" to include political subdivisions and local governmental entities, aligning with the Quiet Title Act. This allows more entities to seek an administrative disclaimer, exempting them from the statute of limitations. The disclaimer process is separate from the QTA but aims to clear up title issues where the US has no interest in the property. The legislative history of FLPMA does not provide clear criteria for disclaiming R.S. 2477 claims, which may be subject to challenge. FLPMA aims to consolidate and modernize statutes governing public domain lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The legislative history of FLPMA does not clearly outline criteria for disclaiming R.S. 2477 claims. FLPMA aims to modernize statutes governing public domain lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Section 212 of the Senate bill authorizes disclaimers only if the title of the United States had terminated \"by operation of law.\" The Secretary may issue a document showing that the United States has no interest in certain lands, saving time and money for both the Government and private parties. The House bill, H.R. 13777, included language on disclaimers resembling a quitclaim deed, with no explanation on its passage. The amendments broaden the use of disclaimers, potentially due to practical reasons like mistaken surveys. Unclear if there are implicit limits on disclaimer usage, leaving interpretation to courts. Historically, title problems involving the United States were difficult to correct. Special acts of Congress were typically used to clear up these issues. Lawsuits attempting to avoid sovereign immunity by suing an officer of the United States were eliminated by the Quiet Title Act in 1972, which is the exclusive means to challenge the United States' title to real property in court. The Quiet Title Act limits suits to clear up title problems involving the United States, with waivers of sovereign immunity construed narrowly in favor of the government. The Act bars suits not filed within 12 years of the claim's accrual date, with exceptions for states subject to limitations. Recent cases have interpreted the exception for states narrowly. The Quiet Title Act limits suits to clear up title problems involving the United States, with waivers of sovereign immunity construed narrowly in favor of the government. Recent cases have held that counties and subdivisions of a state may not use the exception to the QTA. The new disclaimer regulations have a broad definition of \"state\" that includes entities time-barred from contesting title under the QTA. The Ninth Circuit has set conditions for a district court to have jurisdiction under the QTA. The Quiet Title Act limits suits involving the United States, with waivers of sovereign immunity construed narrowly. Recent cases show that counties and state subdivisions cannot use the QTA exception. The Ninth Circuit has set conditions for district court jurisdiction under the QTA, including the requirement of a disputed title to real property. In R.S. 2477 context, even if the US concedes a right of way, it retains an interest in the property. Third parties can claim a title interest on behalf of the US, causing a cloud on the plaintiff's title. If the US disclaims the contested interest, it may end the suit under the QTA. The court's confirmation of a disclaimer in a Quiet Title Act suit is usually a formality, but there are cases where a court may refuse to confirm a disclaimer if it was not made in good faith. A disclaimer may not necessarily resolve other causes of action against the United States, even though it may end the QTA suit. The use of disclaimers in validating R.S. 2477 rights of way is unclear. The process of validating R.S. 2477 rights of way can be unpredictable, and the scrutiny of disclaimers issued under \u00a7315 is a complex issue. Many states had laws requiring counties to determine accepted roads, making the status of some roads clear before the 1976 repeal of R.S. 2477. However, the status of other roads may not be as clear, and actions like \"roadless\" reviews could affect the statute of limitations. Amendments to disclaimer regulations exempt states from the statute of limitations, which could have a significant impact. The amended regulations broaden the ability of counties and governmental entities to raise R.S. 2477 claims by establishing a new administrative forum for establishing rights, avoiding the 12-year limitation previously in place. The changes align FLPMA disclaimers with the QTA, allowing for claims to be pursued administratively in instances where it was not possible before. The new regulations establish an administrative forum for determining R.S. 2477 rights, which may be controversial due to unclear standards and significant consequences for federal lands and communities. Section 315 allows disclaimers of the United States' \"record title\" in the property, raising questions about what this title entails in the context of R.S. 2477 disclaimers. The regulations establish an administrative forum for determining R.S. 2477 rights, with Section 315 allowing disclaimers of the United States' property interests, including less than full fee title interests. Less than full fee title interests, including mineral reservations and easements, can be disclaimed by the United States under Section 315. This includes rights of way or easements granted across federal lands. The United States may disclaim these interests if they have terminated by law or are invalid. The United States can disclaim less than full fee title interests, such as easements, if they are invalid or terminated by law. In the context of R.S. 2477 rights of way, the United States may be disclaiming only a part of its record title, which would need validation. The United States may disclaim a part of its record title, such as an interest in R.S. 2477 rights of way, which would need validation and surveying for legal description. This could be seen as not the typical disclaimer situation, but rather a traditional view of property rights as a bundle of sticks, with the US granting a highway easement while retaining the underlying federal lands. The United States may disclaim an interest in R.S. 2477 rights of way, potentially relinquishing an easement interest previously granted. The Department of the Interior has not provided examples of such disclaimers. Section 315 allows disclaimers to clear title clouds when a record interest of the US has terminated. The acceptance and completion of the grant in the R.S. 2477 context may be unclear, raising questions about whether title ever left the United States. The question of whether title ever left the United States in the context of R.S. 2477 rights of way remains unclear due to disputed facts and unclear legal criteria. Some argue that the Quiet Title Act (QTA) may be more appropriate if criteria are not clarified. Certain policies of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) caution against the use of disclaimers in the R.S. 2477 context. Congress has highlighted FLPMA policy concerns, emphasizing the importance of validity determinations aligning with the intent of both R.S. 2477 and FLPMA. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) emphasizes the retention of federal lands unless disposal serves the national interest. Uniform procedures are required for any land disposal. There is debate over whether disclaimers affect R.S. 2477 rights of way, with some advocating for a conservative interpretation of FLPMA's rules and regulations. The Secretary has not established rules for reviewing R.S. 2477 claims as required by Congress. Regulations regarding R.S. 2477 rights-of-way must be approved by Congress before taking effect, as stated in the 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Additional statutory prohibitions have not been enacted. The Department has not established rules for reviewing R.S. 2477 claims as required by Congress. No further statutory prohibitions have been enacted since the 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act. The legislative history of \u00a7 108 indicates that Congress intended to define the terms and scope of grants for R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, preventing the Department from setting specific standards. The Department has not established rules for reviewing R.S. 2477 claims as required by Congress. The 1997 policy instructed the BLM to defer processing R.S. 2477 claims until Congress clarifies validation standards. The current Administration is changing the approach to validating R.S. 2477 claims without rulemaking, potentially increasing the number of claims validated. This will be done through changes to disclaimer issuance procedures, separate from the aim of preventing specific standards for R.S. 2477 rights of way. The Administration is making changes to the disclaimer issuance procedures for R.S. 2477 claims, potentially increasing validations without impacting specific standards for R.S. 2477 rights of way. The Department reports only 62 disclaimers issued since 1976, none involving easements or R.S. 2477 rights of way claims. The new disclaimer regulations broaden the definition of \"state,\" allowing more claimants to avoid the 12-year limitation for R.S. 2477 rights of way claims. Counties and other entities can now apply for disclaimers, leading to an increase in applications. Some counties are concerned about the costs of filing numerous applications. The Utah MOU acknowledges that additional agreements will be made with counties, potentially affecting the 1997 R.S. 2477 policy. The 1997 R.S. 2477 policy may be eliminated for some counties, with unclear validation criteria for future agreements. Other states plan to seek agreements, but it is unknown if the terms and criteria will differ. FLPMA policies aim for uniformity in managing federal lands, which may argue against varied validation criteria. Recent amendments to disclaimer regulations may make it easier for entities to claim R.S. 2477 rights of way. The Utah MOU suggests agreements will be negotiated directly with counties, with potentially hundreds of claims expected. The new disclaimer regulations aim to facilitate R.S. 2477 claims, requiring approval by Congress. The Department argues against prohibiting these regulations, stating it would partially repeal certain sections of FLPMA. However, it could be argued that Congress's approval requirement does not negate the general rulemaking authority. Amendments to the disclaimer regulations tailored to R.S. 2477 may require congressional approval to be effective. The new disclaimer regulations, focused on R.S. 2477 claims, may require congressional approval for effectiveness. The connection between the recent amendments and R.S. 2477 rights of way has been clarified through a Memorandum of Understanding between the Secretary of the Interior and the state of Utah. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Secretary of the Interior and Utah established an acknowledgment process for recognizing R.S. 2477 rights of way. The process involves issuing a recordable disclaimer of interest for eligible roads, excluding those within designated Wilderness Areas or Wilderness Study Areas. The MOU between the Secretary of the Interior and Utah established an acknowledgment process for recognizing R.S. 2477 rights of way, excluding roads within designated Wilderness Areas or Wilderness Study Areas. The MOU does not specify criteria for validating claimed rights of way, possibly aligning with Congress's intent to legislate standards for R.S.2477 claims. The MOU between the Secretary of the Interior and Utah established an acknowledgment process for recognizing R.S. 2477 rights of way, excluding roads within designated Wilderness Areas or Wilderness Study Areas. The MOU equates \"road\" and \"highway\" and outlines criteria for eligible roads under the grant. Paragraph 7 of the MOU states that the 1997 policy regarding R.S.2477 rights of way is not applicable to acknowledgment requests submitted under the MOU. It is unclear if the 1988 policy will now guide determinations in Utah. Other states and counties may propose MOUs consistent with the agreement. The agreement raises issues regarding the application of R.S. 2477 validity policies in different states and counties as they negotiate MOUs. Alaska has sought negotiations, and other states may follow. Concerns exist about the lack of public participation in the Utah MOU process. If new disclaimer processes vary, resulting agreements may not align with FLPMA policies for uniform land management. The Department responded that the June 25, 2003 memorandum from the Deputy Director of BLM to the State Director of BLM in Utah was the only additional information expected to be issued regarding processing applications for R.S. 2477 disclaimers. The guidance implements BLM's authority under the disclaimer regulations and the MOU, focusing on acknowledging R.S. 2477 rights-of-way that meet statutory requirements. The guidance outlines requirements for applications for R.S. 2477 rights-of-way, including demonstrating existence before October 21, 1976, and use by April 9, 2003. Details on improvements like bridges and culverts are also required. The relevant date for demonstrating improvements is April 9, 2003, not October 21, 1976. Examples of helpful information include a narrative on when the right of way was established. The guidance for R.S. 2477 rights-of-way applications includes providing supporting evidence of when the claimed right of way was constructed, its history and usage, and historic maps and photographs. The width of the road asserted and disclaimed should not exceed the ground disturbance width as of April 9. The criteria for evaluating construction adequacy is not specified in the guidance. The guidance for R.S. 2477 rights-of-way applications requires evidence of road construction history and usage. The width of the road claimed should not exceed the ground disturbance width as of April 9, 2003. The MOU states that substantial road alterations require BLM notification. Only the applicant can appeal decisions to the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The Utah MOU clarifies the process for reviewing comments on R.S. 2477 disclaimer applications, with only the applicant able to appeal decisions to the Interior Board of Land Appeals. The interpretation of R.S. 2477 grants and their history is crucial in evaluating the Utah MOU and future Department actions. The Utah MOU clarifies the process for reviewing comments on R.S. 2477 disclaimer applications. R.S. 2477 rights of way are protected if valid on October 22, 1976, the effective date of FLPMA, and not abandoned thereafter. The validity of R.S. 2477 highway rights of way protected under FLPMA is determined by whether they were accepted and maintained under state law. Some states have clear acceptance processes, while others like Utah and Alaska lack clarity. The controversy lies in identifying which roadbeds still qualify under the 1866 law. This is crucial as it affects the eligibility of areas for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System or their status as private or federal lands. The interpretation of terms like \"construction,\" \"highway,\" and \"not reserved\" in the federal grant is key in this matter. The historical context of the R.S. 2477 highway grant sheds light on the purpose and importance of the act in the settlement of the West, as Congress debated ways to encourage settlement of the new lands acquired by the United States. Rapid settlement was desired to secure the lands and convey them to state and private ownership. The westward movement outpaced Congressional legislation, leading to explorers, developers, and settlers already being on the western lands before national homesteading and land laws were enacted. Mineral development on federal lands in the 20th century saw private individuals and companies seeking mineral wealth before legislative authorization. The influx of miners, like during the California Gold Rush in 1849, led to the development of local rules for mining claims. Congress later legitimized existing occupations of federal lands and addressed future land use through legislation in the 1860s. The Homestead Act of 1862 and the Mining Act of 1866 provided systems for obtaining title to public lands for agricultural settlement and mining claims. R.S. 2477 highway grants, later codified as 43 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7932, played a crucial role in the development of the West, with many state and county roads originating from them. The validity of most R.S. 2477 roads was established by 1976, although they were not the only type of road or access allowed across federal lands. R.S. 2477 rights of way are not the only type of road or access allowed across federal lands. Denial of a R.S. 2477 right of way does not determine recognition or permission of other roads or access. The statute grants the right of way for the construction of highways over public lands not reserved for public uses. It is essential to interpret the statute based on its plain meaning. The term \"highways\" in R.S. 2477 refers to a specific type of road construction across public lands not reserved for public uses. There is a distinction between \"highway\" and other terms like \"road\" or \"trail,\" with \"highways\" being the term chosen by Congress. The term \"highway\" has multiple meanings, some of which have opposite connotations. The term \"highway\" has multiple meanings, including a generic one referring to any public avenue of travel, such as rivers and bridges. In English law, it can also mean any way open to the public, even footpaths, and in some American state laws. Additionally, \"King's (or Queen's) highways\" were better roads connecting towns or marketplaces, providing better protection for travelers. The term \"highway\" has multiple meanings, including a generic one referring to any public avenue of travel. In American dictionaries near the time of R.S. 2477, \"highway\" was commonly understood to mean principal public roads, distinct from local or branch roads. The 1865 Webster's Dictionary defines \"road\" as a trackway for riding or traveling, while \"highway\" signifies a more significant road for ground transportation. A highway is a public road open to all passengers, forming a communication between cities or towns. It is a significant type of road, distinct from local or branch roads. The term \"road\" is a general term for any ground appropriated for travel. The term \"highways\" is used by Congress in conjunction with a requirement for construction, while \"roads\" is a more general term. Not all roads are highways, as highways are public, significant, and built-up roads. The interpretation of R.S. 2477 hinges on how Congress defined \"highway\" in the legislation. The term \"highways\" has caused confusion and injustice due to its vague definition in legislation. Congress likely used the term in the 1866 Act to refer to significant or principal roads. The term \"highway\" in the Mining Act of 1866 likely refers to significant or principal roads that are open for public use and connected cities or towns. Congress included the highway grant in section 8 of the Act, but there is no clear explanation of their intent. The Mining Act of 1866 established a system for recognizing mining practices on public lands, including provisions for water use and rights of way. It legitimized mining claims and acknowledged rights to use water based on local customs, laws, and court decisions. Section 9 of the Act addressed the construction of rights of way for ditches. Section 9 of the 1866 Mining Act focused on the construction of rights of way for ditches for water transport. The intent of Congress in enacting R.S. 2477 can be understood by looking at the words used and the historical context. The creation of roads and access was a key issue in the surveying system used by the federal government to divide and dispose of public lands. The federal government used a surveying system to divide and dispose of public lands since the Land Ordinance of 1785. Townships were surveyed into sections containing 640 acres, which could be further divided into smaller subdivisions for settlement and disposal. Each surveyed subdivision abutted the next. The practice of surveying subdivisions for settlement and disposal resulted in \"checkerboard\" land patterns, creating access needs that were resolved by settlers creating roads as needed. Congress did not address the issue, leading to negotiation and purchase of access rights as areas developed. The establishment of roads in areas with intermingled landownership patterns facilitated resolution of access issues caused by the survey system. Territorial and state laws also played a role in resolving access and roads issues. A court highlighted the problem of surveying systems creating barriers on public lands, emphasizing the need for legal determination of rights and responsibilities. The Supreme Court upheld the right of access to public lands in a 1890 case, stating that the government's policy allows equal use of the public domain by all, regardless of private land ownership. The Court emphasized the long-standing custom of free access to public lands and the government's liberal approach to their use. The Supreme Court upheld the right of access to public lands in a 1890 case, emphasizing the long-standing custom of free access to public lands. Congress believed that development would occur in a parallel fashion on public and private lands, leading to rare litigation over access questions in the 117 years since railroad grants were made. An 1895 Solicitor's opinion found that miners were allowed to build access roads without permits or fees. The 1895 Solicitor's opinion upheld the long-standing custom of free access to public lands for mining activities, stating that miners could build access roads without permits or fees. Congress recognized the necessity of roads for mining activities on public lands outside of claim boundaries. The 1866 Act may have allowed individual access but was likely intended for public roads. It could be argued that the Act was unnecessary as the federal government already permitted such access without grants or permits. The term \"highways\" in the Act may refer to significant public roads, aligning with other Congressional measures. The Unlawful Inclosures of Public Lands Act of 1885 regulated fencing off public lands and prohibited obstruction of free passage over federal lands, reflecting Congress' tolerance of such passage during western settlement. If R.S. 2477 granted rights of way only for significant public roads, the 1885 Act would serve a necessary function in protecting all other free passage and transit. During the settlement of new national lands to the West, Congress provided land grants for the construction of transportation routes by canals, railroads, or wagon roads. These grants included lands for the transportation route and extra lands for sale to fund the construction. If construction did not occur, the lands would revert to the United States. Statutes before 1866 provided for well-constructed wagon roads adequate for movement. The construction of wagon roads was mandated by Congress for the movement of troops and mail. The roads had to be well-built and free from tolls for government use. An 1866 statute established a process for military roads in the District of Columbia to become public highways. The 1866 statute provided a process for allowing use of military roads by the public, resolving access issues on federal lands. Congress later enacted various rights of way provisions for crossing federal reservations. The 1866 Act allowed public use of military roads on federal lands and later rights of way acts addressed crossing federal reservations. The 1866 Act may refer to significant roads rather than generic ways of all types. R.S. 2477 may have granted rights of way for more significant roads that were open to the public and involved construction. In 1872, Congress revisited mining issues and modified provisions of the 1866 Act. The 1872 Act did not change section 8 of the 1866 Act on rights of way. In 1899, Congress enacted a provision allowing the Secretary of the Interior to approve surveys and plats of transportation corridors across forest reservations or reservoir sites. The legislative history of this provision is inconclusive. The legislative history of the provision regarding transportation corridors is inconclusive. In 1875, Congress granted a general right of way through public lands to railroad companies. Later statutes addressed the disposition of lands underlying railroad rights of way upon abandonment, exempting \"public highways\" within the corridors from disposal provisions. Section 603 of FLPMA in 1976 also plays a role in this context. Section 603 of FLPMA in 1976 directed the BLM to conduct a wilderness suitability review of roadless areas, defining them as areas without improved roads suitable for public travel by motorized vehicles. The regulations implementing the wilderness review reflected this definition. The Inventory Handbook defined key terms for evaluating roads in wilderness areas, reflecting Congress's awareness of access issues related to R.S. 2477. The federal government historically showed benign neglect towards R.S. 2477, likely due to settlement practices in the West before FLPMA. The federal government historically showed benign neglect towards R.S. 2477, likely due to settlement practices in the West before FLPMA. No government approval was needed to perfect an R.S. 2477 grant, and it did not have to be recorded. An 1898 decision determined that dedication of highways along section lines without construction did not complete a grant. A 1938 regulation stated that a highway grant became effective upon construction in accordance with state laws. This issue will be further discussed later. The federal government historically showed benign neglect towards R.S. 2477 before FLPMA. Before FLPMA, the federal government had less interest in rights of way across its lands. It may not have mattered whether a right of way qualified under R.S. 2477 or not. Federal policies increasingly stressed retention of public lands in national ownership. FLPMA in 1976 recognized a policy of retaining public lands and replaced old right of way statutes with a new process. The interpretation of R.S. 2477 raises questions of federal law, which may incorporate state law. State law also plays a role in determining acceptance of a right of way grant. After the repeal of R.S. 2477, the Bureau of Land Management issued a regulation allowing for the permitting of public highways constructed under its authority. The Bureau of Land Management issued a regulation in 1982 requiring State or local governments to file maps showing the locations of highways claimed under R.S. 2477. The regulation aimed to facilitate management of public lands, with no conclusive determination on the existence of highways. In 1980, a Deputy Solicitor of Interior provided standards for determining R.S. 2477 highways, noting inconsistent judicial decisions on the subject. The opinion addresses the legal establishment of highways under the 1866 grant, emphasizing that \"construction\" is necessary for compliance. R.S. 2477 claimants argue against retroactive standards set by the Interior for pre-1976 highway acceptance. The Ferguson opinion emphasized that \"construction\" is essential for the grant offered by Congress, stating that it involves actual building activities to prepare the highway for use. The BLM R.S. 2477 regulations suggest that states could impose additional requirements beyond mere construction to perfect the grant. The Department implemented regulations for FLPMA Title V rights of way, requiring submission of highway maps for federal planning. The concept of road improvement by mechanical means was incorporated, raising questions about the definition of a 'road'. A 1988 Departmental Policy differed from the Ferguson Opinion. The 1988 DOI policy in Alaska set loose criteria for R.S. 2477 claims on federal lands, allowing minimal construction requirements like removing rocks and vegetation by hand or vehicle passage. Construction involves preparing highways for public use by clearing vegetation, moving rocks, or filling low spots. The 1988 DOI policy in Alaska set loose criteria for R.S. 2477 claims on federal lands, allowing minimal construction requirements like removing rocks and vegetation by hand or vehicle passage. The 1994 proposed R.S. 2477 regulations defined \"construction\" as intentional physical acts that prepared durable land modifications for highway traffic use. The definition of \"highway\" and \"public lands not reserved for public uses\" were further clarified in State law, with limitations also applying. This included thoroughfares used by the public for vehicle passage without discrimination. On January 22, 1997, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt revoked the 1988 Policy on land use and established a new interim policy. The Secretary instructed BLM to defer processing R.S. 2477 assertions unless there was a compelling need. BLM could accept claims and evaluate if construction on alleged right-of-ways occurred before the repeal of R.S. 2477 in 1976. The agency was to determine if the alleged right-of-way constitutes a highway. The agency was tasked with evaluating whether the alleged right-of-way constitutes a highway, applying state law in effect on October 21, 1976. Claims not complying with state law requirements were not to be recommended for approval. A proposal for legislation sent to Congress in August 1997 established a procedure for determining the validity of claimed R.S. 2477 rights of way and included definitions for \"construction\" and \"highway.\" The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"highway\" and \"public lands not reserved for public uses\" in the context of a legal case involving the Bureau of Land Management. The court allowed the BLM to determine the validity of rights of way claimed by counties in Utah. The court allowed the Bureau of Land Management to determine the validity of highway rights of way claimed by Utah counties based on evidence of actual construction, not just the passage of vehicles. Valid construction evidence includes road records, aerial photography, physical evidence, testimony, and official maps. The court indicated that a claimed highway right-of-way must be public in nature and have served as a highway when the underlying public lands were available for R.S. 2477 purposes. A highway connects the public with identifiable destinations and must lead vehicles somewhere, such as allowing public access to scenic areas, trailheads, businesses, or other places open to the public. The Department's position is that a highway must be constructed across unreserved public lands to qualify as a claimed highway right-of-way. The Agency's interpretation of this requirement has evolved over the years, with the 1988 Policy broadly defining construction. However, there is no clear contemporaneous interpretation by the Department, except for a 1898 decision stating that mere declarations of highways without actual construction do not count. The Department's analysis has focused on post-FLPMA documents, questioning the meaning of the construction requirement for highway grants. Prior to the 1993 study, there was limited analysis on the definition of \"highway\" in the 1866 Act and its correlation with construction requirements. The agency interpretations of R.S.2477 must be based on their power to persuade, as they are not entitled to the same deference as contemporaneous rulemaking. Judicial interpretation does not provide conclusive precedent on important R.S. 2477 issues due to the federal nature of the statute. Many argue that state law may apply in the R.S.2477 context. Many claimants argue that state law controls the creation of public highways, but federal grants cannot be overridden. Cases predate FLPMA and were typically in state courts without federal involvement. Two levels of inquiry exist: state law requirements for public highways and determining property rights. The role of state law in validating R.S. 2477 rights of way is a fundamental and controversial issue. The extent of state law's role in establishing highway rights of way under the 1866 Act is unclear, with questions of federal law interpretation. Federal grants are typically construed in favor of the government. Federal grants are usually interpreted in favor of the government, but this strict interpretation can be rebutted for grants related to settling the country. State law can play a significant role in defining the acceptance and scope of highway grants, as well as other aspects. State law controls state concerns and can provide additional requirements unique to a particular state. The controversy surrounding R.S. 2477 revolves around whether state law can override federal grant terms. State law is often cited as controlling, especially regarding the acceptance of highways. However, state court decisions sometimes include non-binding discussions and broad rules not supported by the facts. The debate over R.S. 2477 revolves around whether state law can supersede federal grant terms. State court decisions often include broad rules not supported by facts, leading to ongoing legal disputes. The key issue is whether state law can contradict federal statutory elements in the grant. The debate over R.S. 2477 centers on whether state law can override federal grant terms. State court decisions may provide clarification on when a state has accepted the federal grant, but cannot go against its terms. The highway grant is for constructing highways across public lands that are not reserved at the time of acceptance. The Arizona case determines when a grant offer is accepted by highway construction, based on state law requirements. State law controls the acceptance of the grant as long as it aligns with construction and public lands criteria. The majority of R.S. 2477 cases are state cases, with the \"Burr Trail\" case cited for state law control, but its scope may be limited. The case discussed the scope of an R.S. 2477 right of way, focusing on the width and range of permissible uses and improvements. The specific issue was whether a proposed widening of the road was reasonable and necessary under Utah law. The court's decision in Hodel is sometimes cited as precedent on establishment issues, but it does not directly apply to establishment. The court rejected a reading of the 1980 Ferguson opinion letter. The court in Hodel considered the 1980 Ferguson opinion letter and rejected a reading that would eliminate the role of state law. The court emphasized that state law controls the scope of an R.S. 2477 right of way. The court in Hodel emphasized that state law controls the establishment of an R.S. 2477 right of way, despite federal regulations supporting a state law definition. The validity of an R.S. 2477 road was disputed in the lower court, with the district court holding that a right of way could be established through public use under state law terms. The court cited federal cases to support the proposition that a right of way under R.S. 2477 can be established through public use under state law terms. The Wilkenson case noted the lack of direct precedent for legal conclusions regarding R.S. 2477 highways. The court in the Wilkenson case agreed that the right of way statute should be applied according to state law to determine acceptance of the grant for the construction of highways. Under Colorado law, the term highways could include footpaths, and mere use of a road by a single person could suffice. The court implied that state law requirements could override federal requirements under R.S. 2477. Additionally, the court found that construction on the \"Serpent's Trail\" connecting two towns was completed before the lands were included in a federal. The court noted that the roads in question were surveyed, built, and used by people and livestock before being included in a federal national monument. The roads served as connectors between towns and the next state, satisfying the elements of the federal statute. The court's comments could be seen as dicta, as state law requirements could override federal requirements under R.S. 2477. The R.S. 2477 requirements were not met by the road in question, with varying state laws addressing the issue of roads. Some states clearly outlined how highways were established, leading to fewer disputes over which roads qualify under R.S. 2477. For example, early Arizona law declared all roads and highways established by the board of supervisors or recorded as public highways to be public highways. Other states have unclear laws, leading to current controversies over road qualifications. In some states, the status of roads and highways under R.S. 2477 is unclear due to lack of formal procedures for accepting highway grants. Federal case law on the issue is sparse and not definitive, leaving room for controversy over whether state law can override federal requirements. The issue of requirements for valid R.S. 2477 highways remains unresolved. State cases align with federal requirements, indicating few conflicts. The necessity of construction to comply with the grant offer is a key focus, with the plain meaning of the 1866 Act suggesting construction is required. The 1866 Act requires construction for compliance with the grant offer, as explained by the Supreme Court. The interpretation of \"construction\" in the Act is crucial, with the United States arguing for consistency in statutory terms, while counties point out differences in the subject matter that may affect the meaning. The construction issue arises in the context of section line rights of way. Some states, like South Dakota, have laws specifying the existence of public highways along section lines. These strips are considered dedicated for highway purposes, and subsequent patentees take title subject to these dedicated rights. The status of paper highways dedicated for highway purposes under the federal R.S. 2477 grant is questioned if they were not actually constructed before the grant was repealed. The issue is significant as some states may make claims based on these dedicated rights. The acceptance of the R.S. 2477 grant through section line right of way dedications is usually seen in pre-FLPMA cases between a state or state subdivision and a citizen, not between the federal government and a state. The state dedication of lands for highway construction is effective against subsequent titleholders, even if the highway was not yet built. However, the paper dedication may not be effective against the federal government if the highway grant offer is rescinded before construction is completed. The roads must comply fully with the terms of the federal grant for the dedication to be valid. The Department's consistent position is that section line dedications alone do not complete grants if construction has not begun before the grant offer is repealed. Establishing a highway under R.S. 2477 based solely on public use may be overstated, as evidenced by cases like Central Pacific Railway v. Alameda County. The Court noted that a public highway was established in 1859 and has been maintained since, serving as a main travel route. The origin of the road does not affect its qualification under R.S. 2477. The key issues in some cases include whether public use alone can establish a public highway and if further improvement is necessary for R.S. 2477 qualification. The first issue is determined by state law. The statutory and case law of the state involved determines the establishment of a public highway under R.S. 2477. Public use alone may result in the creation of a public highway under state law, equating to acceptance of the federal grant offer. The issue at hand is whether a road that was never improved or maintained, but served as a well-traveled transportation corridor between towns and was recognized as a public highway under state law, could qualify under R.S. 2477. Public use alone, without official action by a governmental entity, may result in the creation of a public highway under state law. In Hatch I, public use without official action by a governmental entity could constitute valid acceptance of an R.S. 2477 right of way in Wyoming. The court focused on whether official acceptance was necessary under Wyoming law at that time and concluded it was not. The Wyoming Supreme Court quoted principles from Hatch II, stating that state law controls the establishment of R.S. 2477 rights of way and that use alone suffices. However, a highway right of way did not exist in that case due to later Wyoming statutes requiring official acceptance. The Lindsay Land & Live Stock case in Utah also supports the idea that public use without construction is sufficient under R.S. 2477. The Lindsay case in Utah supports the notion that public use without construction is enough to establish a public highway under R.S. 2477. The court emphasized that improvements had been made to the road and that it connected points with significant public travel. Therefore, Lindsay does not suggest that no construction or improvement is required for a road to qualify as a public highway under R.S. 2477. The text discusses the criteria for a road to qualify as a public highway under R.S. 2477, emphasizing the importance of public use and potential improvements. It suggests that an analytic approach considering state and federal law may align with existing case law. The Department of the Interior has consistently maintained that some construction must have taken place for a road to qualify as a public highway under R.S. 2477. The recent SUWA v. BLM case focused on the interpretation of \"construction\" and \"highway,\" with the federal district court upholding BLM's interpretation as consistent with definitions and Congress's objectives for federal land use policy. The counties argued that under Utah law, \"construction\" could be achieved by \"continued use,\" but the court disagreed. The court examined the use of state cases in relation to the applicability of state law in federal court interpretations of federal statutes. Despite past interpretations not being binding, federal courts have looked to state interpretations for guidance. The Hodel decision in 1987 established a \"continued use\" standard for R.S. 2477 claims, which has been adopted by several federal district courts since then. The cases cited in the determination of R.S. 2477 claims adopted the \"continued use\" standard from the Hodel decision. However, recent cases simply cited back to Hodel without independent analysis. The court's decision on R.S. 2477 rights-of-way was based on previous cases, citing state law for establishment. The Wilkenson case referenced state law due to party agreement, while the 9,947.71 Acres case was miscited. The court indicated that physical work was necessary to perfect an R.S. 2477 right-of-way. The court mentioned that physical work was required to perfect an R.S. 2477 right-of-way, but the issue of interpreting the word \"construction\" in R.S. 2477 was not resolved. The 10th Circuit dismissed the appeal due to lack of jurisdiction, awaiting a ruling on injunctive relief and damages. The scope of R.S. 2477 rights of way is determined by state laws as of 1976, with the extent varying based on individual cases and state regulations. The Hodel case in the 10th Circuit established that state laws dictate the scope of a valid R.S. 2477 right of way. The Hodel case in the 10th Circuit affirmed that a valid R.S. 2477 right of way can be expanded to a \"reasonable and necessary\" width based on traditional uses, with state law controlling the scope and management duties of the BLM. The appeals court affirmed that a county's right of way under R.S. 2477 was not limited to its original use, allowing for expansion based on historic uses such as promoting economic development. The court upheld a decision directing the county to apply for a right of way permit for a road segment that needed relocation. The appeals court affirmed a county's right of way under R.S. 2477 could be expanded for economic development. They upheld a decision for a road segment relocation, stating BLM could specify the new location to minimize impact on the WSA. The court found BLM's interpretation of protecting valid existing highways reasonable. The court in the Hodel cases derived federal government authority over R.S. 2477 from BLM's duty to prevent land degradation. The federal government now has responsibilities for lands impacted by R.S. 2477 highways, as seen in the United States v. Garfield County case involving a bulldozed trail in Capitol Reef National Park. The court determined that the scope of the R.S. 2477 right of way is reasonable and necessary for safe travel, including improving the road to two lanes. The County's assertion that the width of the right of way included all \"disturbed area\" was rejected. The issue of road improvement led to a discussion of the authorities of the County and the National Park Service. The court ruled that Garfield County could perform maintenance work on the right of way without prior authorization from the National Park Service. However, any construction work required a permit, approval, or agreement from the NPS. The law emphasizes the need for reasonable accommodation between entities when exercising their rights and duties on federal lands. The court ruled that construction work on the right of way requires a permit from the National Park Service, emphasizing the need for reasonable accommodation between entities on federal lands. Future disputes may arise regarding the scope of R.S. 2477 rights of way and their regulation. The 1866 Act legitimized past trespasses and established priorities of occupancy rights related to land use, not just limited to addressing past trespasses. Judicial interpretation suggests the act also had prospective application, as seen in a 1982 case and subsequent litigation acknowledging R.S.2477 granting rights of way for highways constructed after its enactment. The 1866 Act confirmed preexisting rights of way and applied prospectively. The Ninth Circuit found that R.S. 2477 did not grant a right of way for purposes other than mining or homesteading, which did not include reaching a recreation area. The court interpreted the provision in the 1866 Act regarding rights of way as being of general import, not limited to mining or homesteading claims. The meaning of \"highway\" as a significant road supports this broader interpretation. Additionally, the provision was codified as part of general rights of way provisions, further indicating its general applicability. The 1866 Act provision on rights of way is seen as having general applicability, not just limited to mining or homesteading claims. The Department of the Interior also supports this interpretation, stating that roads are essential for mining activities. Most cases suggest that the highway right of way extends beyond mining and homesteading contexts. The 1866 Act provision on rights of way is not limited to mining or homesteading claims. Private entities are entitled to compensation for the taking of their mine access right of way. Public lands are those in the public domain, while reserved lands are withdrawn for a federal purpose. Public lands are withdrawn and dedicated to federal purposes. The Department's 1988 policy states that lands not available for R.S. 2477 rights of way are reserved or dedicated by Congress, Executive Order, or classification actions. It may not always be clear if a full reservation has occurred, especially with withdrawals and classifications like those under the Taylor Grazing Act. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 allows for the creation of grazing districts that can reserve lands to prevent the establishment of R.S. 2477 rights of way. The Act states that affected lands cannot be disposed of until classified and opened for entry. However, it also allows for the acquisition of rights-of-way within grazing districts under existing law. The 9th Circuit has ruled that withdrawals and creation of grazing districts can prevent the establishment of roads across these lands unless the entity seeking a right of way reopens the lands under specific provisions. This interpretation could have a significant impact on remaining R.S. 2477 claims. The controversy surrounding R.S. 2477 involves federal acquiescence to state interpretations, suggesting that valid existing rights preserved by FLPMA must align with state law. Estoppel by acquiescence raises questions about federal requirements contradicting state claims. The Court ruled in United States v. California that despite federal officials acquiescing to the State's jurisdiction over submerged lands, the United States ultimately prevailed. The Court noted that prior to the thirties, neither the states nor the Government had focused on ownership of the three-mile belt. The federal government's interests in ocean areas should not be forfeited due to lack of focus on R.S. 2477 rights of way until after the measure's repeal. Officers cannot compromise government property rights through inaction. The federal government's interests in R.S. 2477 rights of way were not compromised by federal agents' actions, as the Department's regulation incorporated relevant statute elements. In Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court held that laches or neglect of duty by government officers is not a defense in enforcing public rights. The court in City and County of Denver v. Bergland discussed the applicability of estoppel in cases involving right of way statutes. It was noted that estoppel can only be applied against agencies delegated the authority to dispose of lands held in trust for the public. The court did not decide on estoppel's application in the case due to the failure to establish a traditional case against the United States. Policy considerations suggest that estoppel should not be applied without compelling reasons when public lands' title is involved. Estoppel may not be suitable in the R.S. 2477 situation as the elements required by the 1866 Act are clear and consistently enforced by the Department. State law has a role but Congress may not have agreed with various state interpretations. Congress has addressed rights of way in legislation since 1866, indicating a grant for significant road construction. Reconsidering the 1988 Policy and its criteria is necessary. A reconsideration of the 1988 Policy and its criteria is needed to align with the requirements of the Act. Most qualifying roads were established by 1976, and a new interpretation would not disrupt the current status quo. The Quiet Title Act sets a 12-year statute of limitations for suits regarding property title disputes. The amended regulations now align with the QTA. The amended regulations align with the Quiet Title Act by providing a new exception for state claims and broadening the definition of \"state\" to include counties and other governmental entities. Court cases have analyzed statute of limitations issues in the disclaimer context, particularly regarding R.S. 2477 claims. After Congress repealed R.S. 2477 in 1976, new rights of way could not be established, potentially starting the 12-year period for administrative actions. After the repeal of R.S. 2477 in 1976, BLM informed states that new claims would fall under Title V of FLPMA. In 1980, BLM proposed regulations for Title V rights of way, requesting those who had built public highways under R.S. 2477 to submit maps, though this was optional. BLM also developed criteria for determining \"roadless\" lands as part of FLPMA implementation, with public input and meetings held to finalize the Wilderness Policy and Review Procedures. The BLM focused on defining \"road\" for inventory purposes and completed two levels of inventories by December 1980. Lists of roadless areas classified as Wilderness Study Areas were published, with BLM directors issuing press releases. Public comments were invited on the proposed wilderness inventory procedures, including the definition of \"road.\" The BLM's definition of \"road\" in the Wilderness Handbook may have put possible R.S. 2477 claimants on notice, potentially affecting the statute of limitations for contesting adverse determinations under the QTA. The interpretation of R.S. 2477 \"highways\" to include minor ways not considered roads under FLPMA could also impact the situation. The BLM's definition of \"road\" in the Wilderness Handbook may have put possible R.S. 2477 claimants on notice, potentially affecting the statute of limitations for contesting adverse determinations under the QTA. H.R. 1639 in the 108th Congress would establish a window of time to present R.S. 2477 claims and define \"construction\" and \"highway\" for validating such claims. The House approved an amendment to FY2004 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations (H.R. 2691) that would have prohibited implementation of the disclaimer regulation amendments in national monuments, wilderness areas, National Parks, and National Wildlife Refuges. The Senate bill did not contain a similar provision and it was eliminated in conference."
