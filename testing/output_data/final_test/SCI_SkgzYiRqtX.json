    "content": "Recently, progress has been made in improving relational reasoning in machine learning, with graph neural networks (GNNs) being an effective approach for multi-hop relational reasoning in natural language processing tasks like relation extraction. A new model, GP-GNNs, generates GNN parameters from natural language sentences to enable relational reasoning on unstructured text inputs. Experimental results show significant improvements in relation extraction compared to baselines, with the model demonstrating accurate relations through multi-hop reasoning. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown strong capabilities in relational reasoning across various machine learning tasks. Relational reasoning, essential for human intelligence, involves abstractly reasoning about entities and their relations. This is crucial not only in graphs but also in natural language processing tasks like question answering and relation extraction. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have proven effective in relational reasoning tasks, including natural language processing. However, existing GNNs struggle with multi-hop relational reasoning in natural language. To address this, this paper introduces graph neural networks with generated parameters (GP-GNNs) to enable multi-hop relational reasoning in natural language tasks. The proposed GP-GNNs construct a fully-connected graph with entities in the text sequence and utilize three modules for relational reasoning. The paper introduces graph neural networks with generated parameters (GP-GNNs) for multi-hop relational reasoning in natural language tasks. GP-GNNs consist of three modules: encoding, propagation, and classification, enabling rich information processing from natural languages and making predictions with node representations. In experiments, GP-GNNs are applied to relation extraction from text using Wikipedia corpus aligned with Wikidata knowledge base. The paper introduces a novel graph neural network model, GP-GNNs, for multi-hop relational reasoning in natural language tasks. The model outperforms state-of-the-art models in relation extraction by considering multihop relational reasoning and robust reasoning. It extends the model with generated parameters to enable relational message-passing with rich text information, demonstrating its ability in multi-hop relational reasoning compared to baseline models. The paper introduces GP-GNNs, a graph neural network model for multi-hop relational reasoning in natural language tasks. It outperforms state-of-the-art models in relation extraction by considering multihop relational reasoning and robust reasoning. Additionally, the paper presents three datasets for future model comparisons. GNNs were first proposed in BID21 and trained via the Almeida-Pineda algorithm BID1, later replaced with backpropagation in BID12. Various applications of GNNs are discussed, including molecular property prediction, image classification, quantum chemistry, and answering relational questions using message-passing on coreference links. Fewer papers focus on adapting GNNs to natural language tasks, with examples such as applying GNNs to semantic role labeling in BID14 and knowledge base in BID22. This paper focuses on extracting relations from real-world relation datasets, exploring relational reasoning in various fields such as reasoning the relationship of objects in a picture, building a scene graph from an image, and modeling the interaction of physical objects. The paper focuses on relational reasoning in the natural language domain, studying pair-wise relationships between entities in different situations. Various models like CNN, attention mechanisms, and Graph LSTMs are used for relation extraction tasks. The paper explores relational reasoning in natural language, analyzing entity relationships using models like Graph LSTMs for relation extraction tasks. It discusses the importance of relation paths and the limitations of existing approaches in capturing multi-hop inference patterns among entity pairs within a sentence. The goal is to predict labels of entities or entity pairs based on text and entities in the sequence. The GP-GNNs framework builds a fully connected graph with entities and edges extracted from text. It employs encoding, propagation, and classification modules for relational reasoning. The encoding module converts sequences into transition matrices, while the propagation module learns node representations layer by layer. The initial node embeddings are task-related. The GP-GNNs framework utilizes encoding, propagation, and classification modules for relational reasoning on a fully connected graph built from text entities and edges. Node representations are calculated layer by layer, with initial embeddings being task-related. The classification module uses node representations to make predictions, and parameters are trained using gradient descent methods. Relation extraction from text involves identifying relations between entities in a sentence. Relation extraction from text involves identifying pairwise relationships between entities in a sentence using GP-GNNs. The process includes encoding entity pairs with position and word embeddings, feeding them into an encoder containing a bi-directional LSTM and a multi-layer perceptron for representation, and reshaping the output for further analysis. Relation extraction involves identifying relationships between entities in a sentence using GP-GNNs. Word representations are mapped to embedding vectors using GloVe embeddings, and position markers are mapped to vectors using a position embedding matrix. The initial embeddings of nodes in relation extraction using GP-GNNs are specified for entity pairs, with special values for head and tail entities as \"flag\" messages. Annotators a subject and a object carry prior knowledge about subject and object entities, represented as [1; 0] and [0; 1] respectively. The output module of Gated Graph Neural Networks BID12 takes embeddings of entity pairs as input for classification using cross entropy loss. The number of layers K is a hyper-parameter for model expressiveness in densely connected graphs. The text chunk discusses the implementation of models using PyTorch BID17 for relation extraction. The experiments aim to show the improvement in performance under various settings, the impact of the number of layers on model performance, and a qualitative investigation comparing models. The focus is on enhancing instance-level relation extraction and bag-level performance. The text chunk discusses enhancing bag-level relation extraction performance by modifying a dataset with reversed edges and \"NA\" labels for entity pairs with no relations. The experiments use PyTorch BID17 models to extract relationships between entities in sentences. The text chunk describes the creation of human annotated and dense distantly labeled test sets for evaluating relation extraction models. The human annotated test set includes 350 sentences and 1,230 triples, while the dense test set contains 1,350 sentences, over 17,915 triples, and 7,906 relational facts. The test set contains 1,350 sentences with over 17,915 triples and 7,906 relational facts. Models for comparison include Context-Aware RE, Multi-Window CNN, PCNN, and LSTM or GP-GNN with K = 1 layer. The entity markers proposed in BID27 are used in models like Bi-directional LSTM BID23 and GP-GNN with 2 or 3 layers for 2-hop and 3-hop reasoning. Best hyper-parameter settings are selected for validation, including non-linear activation functions, dropout ratio, and hidden state size. Table 1 displays the hyper-parameter values used in experiments. Our models outperform baseline models significantly in bag-level relation extraction using a max-one setting. Results show successful reasoning on fully-connected graphs and improvement in relation extraction at both sentence and bag levels. Context-Aware RE also incorporates context information for relation prediction. Our study argues that Context-Aware RE only models the co-occurrence of relations, potentially introducing noise by increasing the probability of relations with similar topics. Our #layers=1 version outperforms CNN and PCNN in three datasets, possibly due to the complexity of sentences from the Wikipedia corpus. Additionally, our GP-GNN model shows improved performance compared to baseline models in bag-level relation extraction, demonstrating successful reasoning on fully-connected graphs. The models in the study use sentences and entity markers to create subgraphs in the Wikidata knowledge graph, showing entities and relations between them. The number of layers in the models represents their reasoning ability, with the 3-layer version performing the best. Increasing the number of layers improves precision, indicating better performance with more hops in reasoning. The 3-layer version of the model outperforms the 2-layer version in identifying relations, especially in sentences with more entities. Different variants can be selected for different types of sentences or predictions can be ensembled from multiple models for real applications. The model can identify facts not even in Wikidata through reasoning, and Context-Aware RE tends to predict relations with similarities. Our proposed model, GP-GNNs, addresses the problem of utilizing GNNs for relational reasoning with natural languages. It encodes natural language as parameters and performs propagation from layer to layer. The model can be applied to various graph generation problems with unstructured inputs like images, videos, and audios. In this work, the effectiveness of utilizing GNNs for relational reasoning in natural language is demonstrated. By considering more hops in reasoning, the performance of relation extraction can be significantly improved."
