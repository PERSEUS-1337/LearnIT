    "content": "Reporting requirements are categorized by purpose and frequency. Purposes include advance reporting, post facto reporting, and policy reporting. Frequency can be periodic, triggered, one-time, or indeterminate. Other categories may also exist. In practice, reporting requirements can be direct or OMB-reviewed, with terminologies varying by agency. Congress uses reporting to gather information for oversight and lawmaking, exercising its authority to compel disclosure from agencies and the President. Congress uses reporting requirements to influence agency decision-making and behavior, aiming to provide information to various audiences beyond itself, such as non-federal stakeholders, agency personnel, other federal agencies, and the public. This broader audience allows Congress to achieve objectives like enhancing agency capacity, promoting collaboration, and sharing information. Reporting requirements are used by Congress to influence agency decision-making and behavior, aiming to provide information to various audiences beyond itself. This includes non-federal stakeholders, agency personnel, other federal agencies, and the public. Congress may reexamine reporting requirements to determine if they should continue, change, or be eliminated, with several rationales considered for modifying or abolishing them. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight expressed concern about the burden and cost of outdated or unnecessary reporting requirements. The 104th Congress considered legislation in 1995 to eliminate and modify over 200 reporting requirements, with estimated annual savings of $2 million by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). CBO noted that some requirements were not being implemented, and periodic reports may require minimal personnel time for updating. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) stated that even if reporting requirements were eliminated, agencies would still collect much of the information for continued use, resulting in no cost reduction. Scrutiny from reporting may lead to side effects such as delays, increased time spent responding to scrutiny, and reduced creativity in addressing challenges. GPRAMA Section 11 establishes a process to reexamine reporting requirements annually, potentially leading to proposals to eliminate them. The GPRAMA process involves a presidential proposal to Congress to eliminate, consolidate, or modify certain plans and reports. Most executive branch agencies participate, but not all entities are required to, such as the President and Vice President. It is unclear if the Executive Office of the President or the Office of the Vice President would be considered an \"agency\" under GPRAMA. However, OMB or the President could choose to incorporate these reports into the process. The GPRAMA process involves the Director of OMB providing guidance to agencies on implementing congressional reporting requirements. The COO at each agency compiles a list of plans and reports for Congress, analyzes them for outdated or duplicative content. The agency's COO must submit a list of \"outdated\" or \"duplicative\" products to OMB, with a minimum percentage requirement set by GPRAMA. OMB can adjust this percentage annually. The COO must also consult with congressional committees on eliminating or consolidating unnecessary plans and reports. The GPRAMA requires agencies to submit a list of outdated or duplicative products to OMB, with a minimum percentage set. The President's budget proposal must include a list of plans and reports for elimination or consolidation, but ambiguity exists in the provision regarding agency identification for elimination or consolidation. The GPRAMA requires agencies to identify outdated or duplicative reports and plans, send a list to OMB, and consult with Congress on potential elimination or consolidation. This process may not be reflected in the President's list, creating a contrast with current authorities and previous efforts. Congress has established mechanisms to monitor reporting requirements, such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) monitoring recurring reporting requirements and reporting to Congress annually. The House of Representatives requires the Clerk to engage in reporting-related activities, including submitting a list of reports to be made to Congress at the start of each session. Other legislation authorizes actions by OMB, the President, and agencies, following recommendations from the William Clinton Administration's National Performance Review. Congress has acted on provisions related to reporting requirements based on recommendations from the William Clinton Administration's National Performance Review. One statutory provision authorizes OMB to include recommendations in the President's budget proposal to consolidate, eliminate, or adjust reporting requirements. Another law allows executive agencies, with OMB's approval, to consolidate or adjust certain statutorily required reports on financial management and government performance. Congress has revisited reporting requirements multiple times in the past century, modifying or eliminating groups of reporting requirements at least 11 times. In the past century, Congress has revisited reporting requirements multiple times, modifying or eliminating groups of reporting requirements at least 11 times. One significant effort was the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (FRESA), which included a catch-all sunset provision to terminate all legal requirements for certain periodic reports. The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (FRESA) included a sunset provision to terminate all legal requirements for certain periodic reports from Congress or any committee listed in the January 1993 version of Reports to Be Made to Congress. The law specified exceptions and did not affect non-periodic reporting requirements. Congress restored reporting requirements through provisions in at least 13 public laws between 1999 and 2008 in response to FRESA. The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (FRESA) included a sunset provision to terminate periodic reports, with uncertainties remaining about the terminated requirements and their restoration. Congress restored reporting requirements through provisions in multiple public laws between 1999 and 2008. The enactment of provisions to restore reporting requirements suggested that Congress values receiving information from federal agencies. GPRAMA's implementation and interpretation by OMB and the President remain uncertain, especially regarding reports produced for Congress. Implementation of GPRAMA may face uncertainty in consulting with Congress, especially regarding reports produced for Congress. It may be challenging for agencies to determine when and how to consult with congressional actors, leading to potential ambiguity in the process. OMB has encouraged agencies to consult with congressional committees before submitting outdated or duplicative reports. The implementation of GPRAMA may face uncertainty in consulting with Congress, especially regarding reports produced for Congress. The President's policy preferences play a significant role in agency budget requests and recommendations. The President's policy preferences influence final proposals, and GPRAMA lacks specific criteria for consolidating or eliminating reports. Section 11 of GPRAMA, effective since January 4, 2011, allows for reexamination of agency reporting requirements. OMB issued guidance on August 18, 2011, for agencies to follow the GPRAMA process. OMB issued guidance on August 18, 2011, for agencies to reexamine reporting requirements under GPRAMA. Agencies were instructed to compile lists of mandated products, identify outdated reports, and consult with appropriate committees. OMB would coordinate this process alongside the President's FY2013 budget proposal. Any changes to multi-agency reporting requirements would be proposed by OMB. Agencies should be prepared to provide data elements to OMB for each plan or report. The OMB guidance instructed agencies to identify outdated or duplicative reports and recommend them for elimination, consolidation, or a third category. Agencies must achieve a 10% reduction in plans and reports for Congress, even if they are not outdated or duplicative. Lists of identified products were due to OMB by September 12, 2011. The Obama Administration submitted a list of plans and reports for possible elimination or consolidation as part of the FY2013 budget proposal. The list was supposed to be posted on Performance.gov for public comment but was not available during the 112th Congress. Despite this omission, OMB issued guidance for the GPRAMA process on August 3, 2012. The guidance for the GPRAMA process on August 3, 2012, included new requirements for agencies to provide more extensive contextual information to OMB about their proposals. This was in preparation for the President's FY2014 budget proposal, which would be submitted after the 2012 presidential election. A presidential list of plans and reports was posted on Performance.gov on January 8, 2013, ahead of the budget proposal submission. The list of 376 potentially outdated, duplicative, or warranting modification plans and reports was posted on Performance.gov on January 8, 2013, in preparation for the President's FY2014 budget proposal. The Obama Administration characterized the proposals as \"potentially\" needing modification. Detailed analysis of the proposals is not included in this CRS report, but summary observations are provided. The list of 376 proposals for modification or elimination of reporting requirements was posted on Performance.gov in preparation for the President's FY2014 budget proposal. The Department of Defense (DOD) had the most proposals, with many items corresponding to the Executive Office of the President. However, the President's budget proposals for FY2014 did not include any reference to these GPRAMA-related proposals. The implications of the January 2013 posting of 376 proposals on Performance.gov for future events are unclear. It is uncertain if the Obama Administration considered these proposals as part of the President's FY2014 budget submission. It is also unclear if the Administration will continue the GPRAMA process for reexamining reporting requirements annually, despite the requirement to include this information with the budget proposal. OMB is expected to issue guidance for the President's FY2015 budget proposal in the summer of 2013. The upcoming version of Circular A-11 is expected to be issued in the summer of 2013, providing insight into the Administration's future plans. Congress historically relies on information from agencies for its constitutional responsibilities, with reporting requirements being a key aspect since the 1st Congress. In 1789, the Department of the Treasury was tasked with preparing revenue plans and estimates. The upcoming version of Circular A-11, expected in 2013, will provide insight into the Administration's plans. Reporting requirements have been key for Congress since the 1st Congress in 1789, with the Department of the Treasury tasked with preparing revenue estimates. Reporting objectives include transparency, accountability, public participation, efficiency, and effectiveness, which may sometimes conflict. Information may have multiple interested audiences, including Congress and non-federal stakeholders. Stakeholders and government agencies rely on access to information for oversight and lawmaking. Different audiences may prioritize values differently, with some having conflicting goals. Changes in technology impact the types of information needed. GPRAMA's process reexamines information requirements in a complex institutional and technological background. The reexamination of agency reporting requirements under GPRAMA raises potential issues for Congress. The President and OMB may propose changes to reporting requirements, and Congress can evaluate these proposals from various perspectives related to agency information management and mission alignment. Consultations with Congress and other stakeholders are crucial in reexamining reporting requirements under GPRAMA. Agencies need to ensure sufficient time and depth in consultations to gather input before proposing changes. It is important to consider Congress's expectations and potential differences in views between agencies, OMB, and the President. Non-federal stakeholders' opinions should also be taken into account for credibility in proposals for elimination or consolidation of reporting requirements. When evaluating a proposal for elimination or consolidation of a plan or report, credibility and usefulness are key factors to consider. It is important to assess if the proposal is based on quality analysis and justification, and if it adequately justifies any recommendations while acknowledging trade-offs. Additionally, the usefulness of the plan or report to various audiences, including Congress, federal agencies, non-federal stakeholders, and the public, should be taken into account. The impact of the plan or report on accountability and incentives of the relevant agencies, OMB, and the President should also be considered. When evaluating the elimination or consolidation of a plan or report, consider its impact on accountability, incentives, policy formulation, power relationships, and costs. Assess the workload, costs, and side effects of reporting requirements, and whether changes would affect agency priorities or data collection. Evaluate if reporting elimination would disrupt Congress or non-federal stakeholders. When considering the elimination or consolidation of a reporting requirement, it is important to assess the costs and disruptions it may cause for Congress and non-federal stakeholders. Evaluating the benefits of the requirement and exploring less costly or more effective options is crucial. Additionally, improving the design and implementation of reporting requirements through better systems or technology utilization should be considered. The implications of \"wiki\" websites and bulk-downloading capabilities for agency reporting requirements should also be examined. Input from non-federal stakeholders and congressional support agencies on the proposed eliminations and consolidations is essential for decision-making. The GPRAMA process covers agency plans and reports for Congress but not all reporting requirements. It does not explicitly cover agency reporting to Congress or the President through discretion. Congress may consider amending the law to improve the process if needed. The GPRAMA process involves agency discretion in reporting to Congress and the President. Advantages and disadvantages of broader reporting requirements are considered, including consulting with congressional committees. The consultation requirement does not specify consulting with both majority and minority committees or non-federal stakeholders. Plans and reports may be submitted to Congress as a whole. Some plans and reports may be submitted to Congress as a whole, rather than a specific committee. If agencies are not consulting adequately with Congress or non-federal stakeholders about proposals to eliminate or consolidate plans and reports, changes to GPRAMA may be needed. One suggestion is to require agencies to publish elimination and consolidation proposals in the Federal Register for public notice and comment. GPRAMA does not specify how agencies, OMB, and the President should analyze reporting requirements or justify proposals to Congress, such as identifying outdated or duplicative products. The presidential list of plans and reports does not address how proposals for elimination or consolidation should be justified, which could affect their credibility with Congress. It is suggested to establish criteria for designations of plans as \"outdated\" or \"duplicative\" and require agencies to address topics like context, consultations, usefulness, and costs in their analysis. Coordination between agencies, OMB, and the President in documenting their analyses and justifying proposals could be improved. Coordination within Congress is crucial for addressing agency proposals and presidential plans. Strategies for managing ad hoc proposals from agencies, OMB, and the President have included a single subcommittee coordinating consideration within Congress. With the annual implementation of GPRAMA's process, similar approaches may be used to handle modifications and eliminations of reporting requirements. For the FY2013 round of GPRAMA's process, OMB's guidance to agencies addressed the situation where an agency may not find at least 10% of its plans and reports for Congress to be outdated or duplicative. In such cases, OMB appeared to say agencies still must achieve the 10% figure by recommending products for elimination with lower net benefits, even if they are not outdated or duplicative. OMB may determine a minimum annual percentage of outdated or duplicative plans and reports that agencies must identify. Congress could consider oversight options for OMB's use of this authority, including analyzing the minimum percentage. Options to understand agency views on reporting requirements could involve hearings, GAO investigations, or amending GPRAMA. The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRAMA) establishes roles and responsibilities for agencies, OMB, and the President. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of this system and consider potential improvements. GPRAMA requires agencies to compile lists of plans and reports for Congress, but does not mandate a centralized database for access by all stakeholders. This could lead to duplication of efforts in managing this task. The Government Performance and Results Modernization Act (GPRAMA) may lead to duplication of effort in managing tasks related to compiling reports for Congress. Efforts to analyze reporting requirements across agencies may be challenging without a global view. Questions arise regarding the best agency to set policy, administer, and host a single database. The Obama Administration proposed a group in January 2013 to address these issues. In January 2013, the Obama Administration proposed modifications to plans and reports under GPRAMA. The proposal aimed to address outdated or duplicative items, with 376 items identified for potential modification across 28 entities. Each item included details such as entity name, plan/report title, type of modification, and rationale. The Obama Administration proposed modifications to plans and reports under GPRAMA in January 2013. A total of 376 items were identified for potential modification across 28 entities, with a majority of the proposals aimed at eliminating reporting requirements. The Department of Defense (DOD) had the most proposals, followed by the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The scope of the proposal may go beyond GPRAMA's specific requirements."
