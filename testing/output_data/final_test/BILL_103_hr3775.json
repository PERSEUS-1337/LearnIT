    "content": "The Act titled \"Agency for International Development Efficiency and Effectiveness Act of 1994\" aims to reduce spending for development assistance by the Agency for International Development. For fiscal years 1995 through 1999, development assistance budget authority and outlays must be reduced by specified amounts compared to the CBO baseline. This includes decreasing budget authority by $580 million in 1995, $600 million in 1996, $610 million in 1997, $630 million in 1998, and $40 million in 1995, $290 million in 1996, $430 million in 1997, $500 million in 1998. For fiscal year 1999, budget authority is reduced by at least $640 million and outlays by at least $560 million. SEC. 3. STEPS TO IMPLEMENT REDUCTIONS. The Agency for International Development will focus on funding fewer development projects with more attainable objectives in countries that are most likely to benefit from assistance, targeting lower income countries with pro-growth economic policies. The Agency for International Development will reduce the number of countries receiving development assistance to around 60, excluding middle income countries and lower income countries with ineffective aid. Development assistance will focus on poverty alleviation and economic development, with the termination of housing investment guaranty programs after September 30, 1994. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 will transfer responsibility for certain development assistance programs to agencies with missions closer to their objectives. This includes transferring private sector activities to the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and environmental protection activities to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 transfers certain development assistance programs to agencies with missions closer to their objectives. The head of each agency determines which programs will continue and the applicable policies. Programs transferred from the Agency for International Development will be carried out by the receiving agency with their own funds. The section supersedes prior laws for development assistance funds in budget function 150 (international affairs) to achieve budget savings. Effective as of October 1, 1994. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"CBO baseline\" refers to budget projections used by the Congressional Budget Office in 1993. \"Development assistance\" includes aid under specific chapters of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961."
