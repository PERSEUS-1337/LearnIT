    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act\". Congress finds that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation, affecting thousands of infants each year in the United States. The issue is particularly alarming among American Indian and Alaska Native communities with high rates of alcohol dependency. Newborns suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effects have costs that are 30 times greater than national averages, leading to significant financial burdens on the nation. Delivery and care costs are four times higher for infants exposed to illicit substances, with estimated lifetime healthcare costs for one child with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome at least $1,400,000. The risks of giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome increase with the amount and frequency of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. Stopping alcohol consumption at any point reduces the risks and consequences to the baby. There is no safe dose of alcohol during pregnancy, and the Federal Government should encourage all women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy. The purpose of this Act is to establish a program within the Department of Health and Human Services to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects nationwide through research, awareness, prevention, and coordination among federal agencies. Establishment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Program under Title III of the Public Health Service Act to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects nationwide through research, awareness, prevention, and coordination among federal agencies.
