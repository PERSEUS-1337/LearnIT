The \"A PLUS Act\" aims to provide flexibility to States and local communities to improve academic achievement, reduce administrative costs of Federal education programs, and ensure accountability for advancing student progress, particularly for disadvantaged children. The Act defines terms like \"accountability\" as schools being answerable to parents and taxpayers for the use of public funds, and \"declaration of intent\" as a State decision to take full management responsibility for education. The \"A PLUS Act\" allows States to manage Federal funds for eligible education programs to advance educational policy. The term \"State\" refers to the definition in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. State Authorizing Officials are State officials who authorize declarations of intent on behalf of the State, including the governor. The \"A PLUS Act\" allows States to manage Federal funds for education programs. The State Designated Officer is appointed by State Authorizing Officials to submit declarations of intent to the Secretary and act as the point of contact for the State. The \"A PLUS Act\" allows States to manage Federal funds for education programs through a State Designated Officer appointed by State Authorizing Officials. The \"A PLUS Act\" authorizes States to consolidate Federal funds for education programs under a declaration of intent submitted to the Secretary. States can include eligible programs for advancing educational policy but not those funded under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The \"A PLUS Act\" allows States to consolidate Federal funds for education programs through a declaration of intent, which must include a list of eligible programs, authorization by State officials, duration, fiscal control assurances, and compliance with civil rights laws. The declaration of intent under the \"A PLUS Act\" includes assurances to advance educational opportunities for the disadvantaged and a plan for maintaining direct accountability to parents and citizens. The duration of the declaration shall not exceed 5 years, and the Secretary will review and recognize it within 60 days unless it fails to meet requirements. The State Authorizing Officials may direct amendments to a declaration of intent under the \"A PLUS Act\" to expand or reduce its scope. If no action is taken within the specified time, the declaration of intent is deemed approved. The State Authorizing Officials have the authority to amend the declaration of intent under the \"A PLUS Act\" to make changes such as modifying the duration or making other appropriate modifications. The effective date of the amendment must allow for full compliance with Federal program requirements for any program removed from the declaration of intent. Once an amendment is executed, program requirements for any program removed from the declaration of intent will apply to the State's use of funds for that program. SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY FOR RESULTS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. Each State under this Act must inform the public about student assessment and proficiency, establish academic standards and assessments, and set student proficiency goals for accountability. The State must establish academic assessments and standards under the Secondary Education Act of 1965. An accountability system should be implemented to ensure compliance. States are required to report student progress annually, including performance data and the use of Federal funds to improve academic achievement. To improve academic achievement and reduce disparities between student groups, educational opportunities for the disadvantaged need to be enhanced. SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF FUNDING LEVELS SPENT BY STATES ON EDUCATION. The Act requires States to spend at least 90% of the funds on elementary and secondary education compared to the year of enactment. States can waive this requirement in case of uncontrollable circumstances like natural disasters or economic contractions. The Secretary may accept a State's waiver if evidence is provided to support it. The waiver must be reviewed within 60 days, and if no action is taken, it is deemed approved. SEC. 5 limits administrative expenses for States with a declaration of intent to 1% of Federal funds, or 3% if not including part A of Title I. SEC. 6 addresses equitable participation of private schools.
