    "content": "The CDC's list of \"Ten Great Public Health Achievements\" for the 20th century ranked vaccination as number one, leading to the eradication of smallpox and control of other diseases. Mandatory vaccination programs, like school immunization requirements, have been crucial in the US. State and local governments historically hold the responsibility for public health, with the authority to enact laws for protection. Measures such as quarantine and isolation may be implemented during communicable disease outbreaks. Mandatory vaccination laws, like the one enacted in Massachusetts in 1809, have been upheld by the Supreme Court as a valid exercise of a state's police powers to protect public health. In Jacobson v. Massachusetts, the Court ruled that mandatory vaccination programs are necessary for public health and safety. The Supreme Court upheld mandatory vaccination laws as necessary for public health and safety, stating that state laws must not violate the Constitution. The Court rejected arguments that compulsory vaccination laws infringe on personal rights. The Supreme Court upheld mandatory vaccination laws as necessary for public health and safety, stating that state laws must not violate the Constitution. The Court rejected the petitioner's constitutional challenge, noting limits to the state's power to protect public health and setting forth a reasonableness test for public health measures. In 1827, Boston was the first city to require vaccination against smallpox for public school students, leading to the adoption of similar policies in other cities and states. Modern school vaccination laws stem from measles outbreaks in the 1960s and 1970s, with states following the CDC's immunization schedule for diseases like diphtheria, measles, rubella, and polio. Some states also mandate vaccines for hepatitis B and meningococcal disease for college students, with additional requirements for female students in Virginia and the District of Columbia. Some states and cities now require young children in preschool or daycare to get influenza vaccinations, with exemptions available for medical, religious, or philosophical reasons. Medical exemptions are common for children with adverse reactions to vaccines, requiring documentation from a physician. Religious exemptions are granted in nearly all states for those who oppose immunizations. Some states grant exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons against immunizations. Requirements for religious exemptions vary, with some states needing a statement of dissent while others require specific religious denomination membership. HPV vaccination mandates offer opt-outs for parents informed of risks. Court cases have challenged compulsory vaccination laws for school enrollment. The Supreme Court upheld a local ordinance requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren in Zucht v. King, citing the principle that states can use their police power for public health. Lower courts generally defer to states' power to require immunizations. Some courts have invalidated limitations on religious exemptions for vaccinations. Some courts have upheld denial of exemptions for vaccinations based on personal objections rather than religious ones. States have laws requiring vaccination of healthcare employees, with opt-out provisions for medical contraindications or religious beliefs. Some states also have laws regarding influenza vaccination for healthcare workers, often including voluntary immunization programs and staff education measures. During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, less than half of health care workers were vaccinated against pandemic influenza. New York State Health Department mandated influenza vaccinations for health care workers, with only medical contraindications as exceptions. Lawsuits were filed challenging the regulation's validity, leading to a temporary restraining order suspending its application. On October 22, 2009, Governor David A. Paterson announced the suspension of the flu shot mandate for New York health care workers due to vaccine shortages. New York state requires unvaccinated health care workers to wear masks during flu season. Similar requirements exist in New Hampshire and in some private sector workplaces. Professional organizations support vaccination of health care workers against communicable diseases. Health care organizations endorse mandatory annual influenza vaccinations for workers to prevent the spread of infectious pathogens. Virginia Mason Hospital was the first to make vaccination a condition of employment, resulting in 98% staff coverage. Refusal requires wearing surgical masks. Other hospitals have adopted similar policies, some facing legal challenges. Some health care workers have been fired for refusing mandatory influenza vaccinations, leading to lawsuits. Legal challenges have been brought against hospitals for implementing vaccination policies without negotiation with unions. One case involved a nurse's union suing Virginia Mason Hospital for violating labor laws. Another case involved an employee alleging religious discrimination for being terminated for refusing vaccination based on vegan beliefs. The plaintiff, rooted in \"veganism,\" was denied a summary judgment motion by the judge. A hospital employee discharged for refusing an influenza vaccination filed a claim for unemployment benefits in South Carolina. The state court of appeals vacated a decision, stating that hospitals should make decisions on protecting patients from illnesses like influenza, not the Department of Employment or the court. In 2008, the Department of Defense issued a policy directive for civilian health care personnel providing direct patient care in DOD military. The Department of Defense requires all civilian health care personnel in military treatment facilities to be immunized against seasonal influenza each year, unless medically or religiously exempt. States may have laws mandating vaccinations during public health emergencies, typically decided by the governor or state health officer. During a public health emergency, a state health officer can order vaccination for communicable diseases with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Refusal may result in quarantine. Some states allow specified groups to administer vaccines if healthcare professionals are scarce. The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act serves as a guide for many states in such situations. The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act, drafted by The Center for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities, grants public health powers to state and local authorities for effective planning and response to public health emergencies. States can choose to adopt all or parts of the Model Act to tailor their emergency response plans. The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act provides guidelines for states during public health emergencies, including the authority to vaccinate individuals to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Vaccines must be administered by qualified personnel and should not pose serious harm. The Act also allows for quarantine of individuals who are unable or unwilling to be vaccinated for health, religious, or conscientious reasons. The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act allows for quarantine of individuals to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. State adoption of these provisions varies, with some states delegating power to require vaccinations during public health emergencies. Federal jurisdiction over public health is derived from the Commerce Clause, giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services authority to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Public Health Service Act primarily deals with quarantine and isolation measures for communicable diseases in interstate commerce. The Act allows the Secretary to restrict entry of aliens for public health reasons, including issuing vaccination requirements for immigrants entering the US. Certain vaccines are required for immigrants seeking permanent residence in the US. Vaccination requirements for immigrants seeking permanent residence in the US include vaccines for HPV and shingles. Waivers can be granted for medical reasons or religious beliefs. The military mandates immunization against diseases like tetanus and diphtheria for its personnel. American troops are required to be immunized against various diseases upon entry into military service, with additional vaccines based on their specialties or assignments. Courts have upheld the legality of mandatory military vaccinations, even when individuals refuse based on religious beliefs. Federal courts have upheld the military's authority to administer mandatory vaccinations, even in combat situations, to protect the health and safety of American military personnel. This includes using unapproved drugs without consent and discharging individuals who refuse anthrax vaccinations. The District Court upheld the denial of requests to correct disciplinary records by the Secretary of the Air Force. State and local governments have primary responsibility for public health, including mandatory vaccination laws for school children and healthcare workers. Any federal mandatory vaccination program would likely be limited to areas of federal jurisdiction, such as interstate commerce. The federal government's jurisdiction for a mandatory vaccination program would be limited to areas such as interstate commerce, recognizing that states have primary responsibility for public health. Federal intervention may be necessary under certain circumstances."
