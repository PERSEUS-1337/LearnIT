    "title": "AB 355",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1531.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows the Controller to send a separate notice to the apparent owner of a savings bond or military award found in a safe deposit box. The notice cannot include a photo of an elected official. Government agencies can provide the Controller with information to locate owners of unclaimed property upon request. Section 1563 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to allow the Controller to request confidential information for locating owners of unclaimed property, with the Controller required to pay any customary fees. Costs for administering this section are subject to annual appropriation in the Budget Act. The Controller may sell escheated property to the highest bidder at public sale or through electronic media, with a waiting period of 18 months after the final report filing. The Controller has the discretion to reject bids and reoffer the property for sale if the bid is deemed insufficient. Property may not be sold if the cost exceeds its value. The Controller may sell escheated property at public sale or through electronic media, with a waiting period of 18 months. Any sale must be preceded by a single publication of notice in a local newspaper at least one week in advance. Securities listed on an established stock exchange can be sold at prevailing prices on the exchange, while other securities may be sold over the counter or by other approved methods. The Controller must sell these securities no sooner than 18 months, but no later than 20 months, after the final report filing date. Claimants are entitled to receive the securities or net proceeds from their sale. United States government savings bonds and United States war bonds must be presented for payment to the United States. This does not apply to other types of property. All escheated military-related property delivered to the Controller may be held in trust at the California State Military Museum. Claimants can file a claim for the property as per Section 1540. The California State Military Museum is responsible for storing and maintaining escheated property delivered by the Controller. Purchasers at Controller sales receive title to purchased property free from any claims, with the Controller facilitating the transfer of title."
