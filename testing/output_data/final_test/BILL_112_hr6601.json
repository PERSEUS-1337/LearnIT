Congress finds that approximately 1.5 million Americans, including children, are diagnosed with cancer annually, with over 500,000 deaths from cancer each year. Less than 5 percent of cancers are caused by genetic factors, making cancer the top cause of disease-related death for American children and adolescents. Children are more vulnerable to environmental carcinogens, and reducing exposure to these substances can lower cancer risk. The average consumer lacks easy access to information on products free of carcinogens, highlighting the need for more transparency in product labeling. Consumers would benefit from knowing the potential health impact of the products they use when making purchasing decisions for their families. The 2008-2009 Annual Report of the President's Cancer Panel urges action to prevent environmental and occupational exposure to carcinogens. The purpose of this Act is to enable consumers to reduce their exposure to carcinogens by allowing manufacturers to affix a Carcinogen-Free label to products that do not contain known or probable carcinogens through a voluntary process that does not require public disclosure of trade secrets. The purpose of this Act is to enable consumers to reduce their exposure to carcinogens by allowing manufacturers to affix a Carcinogen-Free label to products that do not contain known or probable carcinogens through a voluntary process. The Act allows Federal departments to establish a program for labeling products as \"Carcinogen-Free\" if they do not contain any carcinogens. The label must be easily recognizable and include a notice stating that the product does not contain known or likely carcinogens. It is unlawful to introduce a product with this label into interstate commerce without premarket approval. The Act allows for products to be labeled as \"Carcinogen-Free\" if they meet certain criteria. Any person can submit an application for this label, which must include a list of all substances in the product and a sample. Federal departments must approve the application if it meets the criteria. The application for the \"Carcinogen-Free\" label must accurately list all product substances, not contain carcinogens or substances displaying carcinogenicity, and comply with guidance on manufacture, storage, and transportation. The information provided for the application must be kept confidential, treated as trade secrets, and used only for approval purposes. It cannot be disclosed without the applicant's consent. The applicant's information in the application must be kept confidential as trade secrets and used only for approval purposes. Agencies must conduct random testing and audits to ensure accuracy and compliance with guidance. The head of each Federal department or agency may charge a reasonable fee for application submission and approval under subsection (e). A civil penalty of up to $100,000 is imposed for knowingly violating certain subsections. Guidance is provided to prevent the indirect introduction of carcinogens. The head of each Federal department or agency may charge a fee for application submission and approval. A civil penalty of up to $100,000 is imposed for violations. Guidance is provided to prevent the introduction of carcinogens into covered products. A national list of approved \"Carcinogen-Free\" products is to be posted on department websites. Definitions for carcinogens are provided. The term \"covered product\" refers to any product regulated by certain agencies and intended for individual or residential use. It includes substances identified as carcinogenic by the Environmental Protection Agency."
