    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Providing Resources and Education for Kids Act (Pre-K)\". Congress finds that 1 in 3 children enter kindergarten unprepared, emphasizing the importance of high-quality language and literacy environments for preschoolers. The first 5 years are crucial for a child's brain development, highlighting the need for strong language and cognitive skills before entering first grade. High-quality prekindergarten programs can significantly impact a child's long-term success, including school achievement, higher earnings, and reduced involvement in the criminal justice system. Studies show that early education benefits children at risk of school failure with improved math and reading skills, creativity, attendance, health, and parental involvement. Currently, only Georgia offers a universally available prekindergarten initiative. The Act aims to improve school readiness for children under 5 by providing grants to States for early childhood education programs. The Act authorizes a program to improve school readiness for children under 5 through grants for early childhood education programs. The Secretary can provide grants to State educational agencies to establish prekindergarten early learning programs. States must submit an application with program details to be eligible for the grant. The State educational agency must outline how funds will be administered to local educational agencies, methods to promote the program equitably, goals for the prekindergarten program, collaboration between public schools and community partnerships, and information sharing with other agencies. The Federal share of funding for prekindergarten early learning programs funded under this Act decreases over the years, starting at 50% for the first year and decreasing to 25% for subsequent years. Funds received under this Act must only supplement, not replace, non-Federal funds for education programs. SEC. 3. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. The Secretary reserves 1 percent of funds for outlying areas based on need. The remaining amount is distributed among State educational agencies based on child population and allocations under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 allows State educational agencies to use up to 5 percent of funds for administrative purposes. SEC. 4. LOCAL ACTIVITIES. To be eligible for a grant award under this Act, a local educational agency must submit an application to the State educational agency detailing their proposed prekindergarten early learning program, goals, standards, collaboration with child care providers, and any other required information. The funds received must be used to establish or expand a prekindergarten early learning program for children ages 5 and under, following specified requirements. Each local educational agency receiving funds for a prekindergarten early learning program must provide transportation for children and maintain a ratio of 18 children to 2 staff members. The funds can be used for professional development, health care services, and collaboration with child care providers. The funds are allocated for community-based prekindergarten early learning programs, increasing salaries for child care providers, and supporting community partnerships. SEC. 5. ACCOUNTABILITY. Local educational agencies receiving grant awards must submit reports every 2 years to the State educational agency detailing their activities, the number of children served by prekindergarten programs, improvements in student achievement, and how they have met their goals for providing early learning programs. State educational agencies must then submit a detailed summary of this information to the Secretary every 2 years. The State educational agency must submit a report every 2 years to the Secretary, detailing how funds were administered to local educational agencies, efforts to promote the program equitably, sharing successful programs with other agencies, and developing long-term financing strategies for pre-K early learning programs.
