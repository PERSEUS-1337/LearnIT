The program will be administered by the Administrator through the Associate Administrator, and applications can be submitted for consideration. The program allows incorporated bodies, LLCs, limited partnerships, and small business investment companies to apply for equity investment financing. Requirements include a business plan, venture capital qualifications of management, and details on investing in early-stage small businesses. The Administrator will establish an abbreviated application process for small business investment companies with a license under section 301 applying to participate in the program. This process will presume that these companies meet the selection criteria under section 399D. The Administrator will establish an abbreviated application process for small business investment companies with a license under section 301 applying to participate in the program, presuming that these companies meet the selection criteria under section 399D. The Administrator will make a final determination on approving or disapproving an applicant for the program within 90 days of receiving their application. Selection criteria include the likelihood of meeting business plan goals, job creation, management character and fitness, and management experience. The selection criteria for approving applicants for the program include management experience, focus on early-stage small businesses, likelihood of profitability, and establishing a profitable investment track record. \"SEC. 399E. GRANTS.\" The Administrator may grant funds to a participating investment company, with limits on the amount based on non-federal capital and an aggregate cap of $100,000,000. The grant process involves committing a specific amount to the company. The Administrator commits a grant amount to a participating investment company, available for new investments over 5 years and follow-on investments over 10 years with possible extensions. \"Participating investment companies receiving grants must invest at least 50% in early-stage small businesses in targeted industries. The Administrator evaluates compliance when 50% of the grant amount is drawn. Pro rata investment shares are also required.\" \"Each investment made by a participating investment company under the program is treated based on the ratio of capital from grants to all available capital. Grant interest is also a requirement.\" As a condition of receiving a grant under the program, a participating investment company must convey a grant interest to the Administrator. This grant interest entitles the Administrator to a pro rata portion of any distributions made by the company, based on the percentage of capital the grant comprises. The Administrator does not have control or voting rights. The Administrator shall receive distributions from the investment company like any other investor. The company will allocate income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit to the Administrator as if they were an investor. Manager profits interest under the program cannot exceed 20% of profits, excluding profits from managers' capital contributions. Excess profits will be returned to investors and the Administrator based on capital contributions and grants. Distribution requirements for participating investment companies under the program include making cash distributions to investors promptly after exiting investments, such as through a public offering or market sale. No manager profits interest can be paid before repaying investors and the Administrator their capital contributions and grants. The Administrator has a separate fund for grants available subject to annual appropriations. All amounts received will be deposited in the fund, and expenses will be paid from it. The Administrator can apply certain sections to activities under this part. \"SEC. 399K.
