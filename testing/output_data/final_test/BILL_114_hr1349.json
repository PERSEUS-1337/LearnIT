    "content": "The Act is titled the \"United States-Israel Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act\". Congress finds that designated Palestinian terrorist organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have killed hundreds of Israelis and dozens of Americans through rocket attacks and suicide bombings. Hamas has utilized underground tunnels to smuggle weapons, money, and supplies into Gaza, train members, manufacture rockets, and build tunnels. These tunnels have also served as rocket launching sites, weapons caches, bunkers, transportation networks, and command and control centers. In 2006, Hamas kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit through a tunnel and held him captive for five years. Hamas uses tunnels in densely populated areas, causing civilian casualties through explosions. UN Secretary-General shocked by terrorists' infiltration tunnels. Hamas rebuilding tunnels in Gaza despite high unemployment and high costs. The Palestinian terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are all involved in building and using underground tunnels for various purposes, including moving fighters and launching attacks. Israel is working with the United States to develop technologies to detect and destroy these tunnels. Israel is receiving assistance to establish an anti-tunneling defense system. The President is authorized to work with Israel on a joint anti-tunneling defense system to detect and destroy underground tunnels from Gaza. No funds can be used until a formal agreement on sharing research and development costs is finalized. The agreement between the United States and Israel requires sharing project costs, including claims, on an equitable basis. It also involves payment for non-recurring engineering costs and negotiating intellectual property rights for cooperative research projects. The Department of Defense must be involved in the process. The Department of Defense must receive quarterly reports on funds expenditure by the Government of Israel, including details on fund usage, timing of expenditure, and entities involved. The President can provide assistance to Israel for anti-tunneling systems upon request. The President must submit an initial report to Congress containing the agreement between the US and Israel. Quarterly reports on Israel's funds expenditure must be provided to Congress. $200,000,000 is authorized for the President to carry out this Act."
