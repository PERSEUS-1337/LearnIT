    "content": "The effective tax rate formula for business depreciable investments involves the relationship between pre-tax return (r) and after-tax discount rate (R), taking into account factors like statutory tax rate, economic depreciation rate, present value of depreciation deductions, investment tax credit, and basis adjustment. The formula in (1) is used to calculate firm-level tax rates, including corporate and non-corporate rates. R is a weighted average of after-tax real interest rate, with debt weighted one-third. For total corporate tax rates, the pre-tax return R is compared with the return after personal taxes, including after-tax real return on debt and after-tax return on corporate equity. The firm-level corporate tax rate in Table 1's second column uses R as the discount rate for the corporate firm. The tax rate for owner-occupied housing is calculated using a formula that considers debt share, share of investments with itemizers, property tax rate, and after-tax discount rate. Mortgage interest deductions can result in a zero tax rate, with slight variations due to deduction limitations. Mathematical formulas and assumptions for tax rate calculations from 1953-1989 can be found in a specific publication. The book \"The Economic Effects of Taxing Capital Income\" by [author name scrubbed] provides data on tax rates, interest, and inflation rates from 1953-2005. Changes in tax laws include adjustments to capital gains tax rates, bonus depreciation, and reductions in tax rates for capital gains and dividends. Statutory tax rates for individuals and corporations, as well as inflation and interest rates, are detailed in the book. The simulation model for tax rates, inflation rates, and interest rates can be found at http://www.nber.org/~taxsim/mrates/mrates3.html. Tax rates are assumed to continue at the current year's rate, with potential adjustments for 2001 and 2002. Inflation rates are weighted from the prior year and the current year, while the interest rate is based on the Baa Bond rate."
