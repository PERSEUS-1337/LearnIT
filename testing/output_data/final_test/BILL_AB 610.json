    "title": "AB 610",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4007.5 of the Family Code is repealed and replaced with a new provision stating that child support payments shall be suspended if the paying parent is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized for more than 90 consecutive days, unless certain conditions are met. The child support obligation resumes after release, with the amount presumed appropriate. A person owing support can seek modification based on changed circumstances. The local child support agency can administratively adjust account balances for suspended child support orders under Title IV-D. The agency can verify violations of arrears and interest, conditions for adjustment, and objections from support obligor or obligee within 30 days. If objections are raised, the agency must seek court approval for arrears adjustment. For child support orders, the agency can adjust arrears without considering enforcement status. The section allows court petitions for support determination. Definitions include being incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized. The section defines \"suspend\" as setting child support payments to zero during incarceration or involuntary institutionalization. It applies to all child support orders issued or modified after enactment, and forms will be developed by the Department of Child Support Services by January 1, 2016. On or before January 1, 2019, an evaluation of the administrative adjustment process must be conducted and reported to the Assembly Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The evaluation will review the ease of the process for both the obligor and obligee, as well as the number of cases adjusted. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. SEC. 3. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety under the Constitution, taking effect immediately to limit the interruption in protections provided by former Section 4007.5 of the Family Code."
