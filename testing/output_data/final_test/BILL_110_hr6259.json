    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2008\". Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration over 12 to 15 years. It affects 30,000 patients in the US, with 200,000 at genetic risk. Symptoms include motor abnormalities, dementia, mood disorders, and emotional changes like irritability and depression. The disease is incapacitating even in early stages. Many individuals with Huntington's Disease struggle to maintain employment and rely on Social Security Disability Income. Despite medical advancements, the Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985. Families often lose health insurance benefits due to unemployment, leading to inadequate treatment for those with Huntington's Disease. In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived the waiting period for these individuals. The Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived the 24-month waiting period requirement for individuals disabled by ALS, a degenerative neurological condition similar to Huntington's Disease. SEC. 3. REVISION OF THE MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING DISABILITY CAUSED BY ADULT-ONSET HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE. The Commissioner of Social Security will revise the regulations in the Blue Book to include criteria for evaluating disability caused by adult-onset Huntington's Disease, a progressive neuropsychiatric disorder with no recovery or remission. The usual age of onset is between 30 and 50, leading to early incapacitation. Individuals with Huntington's Disease experience early progression to total disability and dependency for daily activities. Key clinical features include loss of bodily movement control, cognitive impairments, apathy, personality changes, and poor social judgment. Work inability stems from cognitive, behavioral, and motor coordination issues, with decision-making and multitasking difficulties even in early stages. Individuals with Huntington's Disease may struggle with decision-making, multi-tasking, and performing under time pressure or stress. The course of the disease varies among individuals and families, with cognitive and behavioral problems potentially becoming debilitating before motor dysfunction. The Commissioner has made changes related to evaluating Huntington's Disease in disability claims. SEC. 4. REVISION OF THE MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING DISABILITY CAUSED BY JUVENILE HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE. The Commissioner of Social Security will update regulations regarding juvenile Huntington's Disease, specifying symptoms for diagnosis including motor dysfunction, seizures, cognitive decline, and behavioral issues. Early onset is more likely if the father is affected. The Commissioner will update regulations for juvenile Huntington's Disease, adding a new section for evaluation criteria based on motor dysfunction or behavioral/psychiatric problems. Elimination of 24-month Medicare disability waiting period for individuals with Huntington's Disease. Amendment to Social Security Act allows immediate benefits under title XVIII for Huntington's Disease patients. Effective date starts after enactment of the Act."
