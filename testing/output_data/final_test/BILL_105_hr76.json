    "content": "The \"Health Care Commitment Act\" includes Medicare-eligible beneficiaries in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The \"Health Care Commitment Act\" allows Medicare-eligible beneficiaries to enroll in a health benefits plan offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program in addition to receiving care through military treatment facilities or other programs. The agreement allows limitations on enrollment of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries in the Federal Employee Health Benefits program if deemed necessary for adequate planning. A Medicare-eligible beneficiary is someone entitled to hospital insurance benefits under Medicare and can enroll in a health benefits plan without meeting additional eligibility criteria. A Medicare-eligible covered beneficiary enrolled in a health benefits plan through the Federal Employee Health Benefits program can still receive health care services through uniformed services facilities or the TRICARE program. Section 1095 applies to costs incurred by the United States for these services. Contributions may be required for Medicare-eligible individuals. The administering Secretary is responsible for Government contributions for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries enrolled in a health benefits plan. The beneficiary's contribution is based on what a Federal employee would pay. If the beneficiary is a member of the uniformed services, the authority managing their pay must approve participation. The Office of Personnel Management manages the participation of enrolled members or former members in a health benefits plan offered through the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. Separate risk pools are maintained for enrolled beneficiaries until complete inclusion under chapter 89 of title 5 is determined not to have adverse effects. The cancellation of coverage under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program by a Medicare-eligible beneficiary is permanent. Annually, a report must be submitted to Congress detailing the healthcare services provided to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries under this section. The report to Congress must include details on the Employee Health Benefits program, such as the total number and percentage of Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, out-of-pocket costs, government costs, and a comparison of costs with alternative healthcare options. The Secretary of Defense must offer the health benefits option by January 1, 1998, under alternative health care options available to the administering Secretaries. The impact of this section on the cost, access, and utilization rates of other health care options in the uniformed services system will be assessed. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program is amended to allow medicare-eligible beneficiaries to enroll in a health benefits plan under Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.
