    "content": "This report discusses congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations under Title 36 of the United States Code, which includes 92 chartered corporations promoting patriotic, charitable, and educational activities. The term \"Title 36 corporation\" is used to refer to these organizations. Congress has the authority to establish organizations in both the governmental and private sectors, citing the United States Constitution as the basis for passing necessary laws. This includes creating for-profit and nonprofit organizations, such as the Communications Satellite Corporation (ComSat). The Communications Satellite Corporation (ComSat) was established as a fully private, stockholder-owned organization in 1962 by Congress. There has been controversy over Congressional authority regarding organizations operating under state law, particularly concerning issues of managerial accountability and fiduciary responsibility. Title 36 corporations are one category of corporate organizations chartered by Congress, but a moratorium has been in place since 1989 on chartering additional nonprofit corporate organizations. The Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law reaffirmed the moratorium on granting new federal charters to private, not-for-profit organizations. This policy has been in place since the 101st Congress in 1989-1990, as the Subcommittee believes charters are unnecessary and could be better spent on other policy matters. At the federal level, there is no general law of incorporation like in states and the District of Columbia. Congress establishes corporations through specific legislation, outlining their mission, authorities, and restrictions. States and the District of Columbia have jurisdiction over incorporating for profit and nonprofit organizations within their boundaries, stemming from their common law authority to create artificial bodies for various enterprises. State legislatures historically chartered organizations seeking corporate status on a case-by-case basis, similar to the federal government's current practice. States and the District of Columbia have general incorporation laws for creating corporations, with separate laws for profit and nonprofit entities. These laws stipulate procedures, information, and standards for obtaining a charter. Corporations in the District of Columbia are subject to constitutional authority delegated by Congress. In the early years, Congress granted franchises to District of Columbia corporations on a case-by-case basis. In 1901, Congress enacted a general statutory procedure for incorporating in the District of Columbia. This procedure, similar to state laws, is found in Title 29 of the District of Columbia Code. Congress grants charters to corporations with powers such as suing, contracting, owning property, enacting by-laws, appointing officers, and borrowing money. In most instances, federal charters require periodic financial statements to Congress. State charters may permit actions not allowed for federally chartered corporations, such as lending money to employees. Title 36 corporations can operate under both federal and state charters, often starting with state charters before receiving federal ones. The chartering of organizations with patriotic, charitable, historical, educational, or eleemosynary purposes by Congress is a 20th-century practice. Title 36 of the U.S. Code was revised in 1998 to list nonprofit corporate organizations with their charters, including various commissions for patriotic and national observances and ceremonies. Title 36 of the U.S. Code lists nonprofit organizations chartered by Congress for patriotic, charitable, historical, educational, or eleemosynary purposes. It includes organizations like the American National Red Cross charged with fulfilling U.S. treaty obligations and aiding in disaster response. The federal chartering process under Title 36 provides an official status to national organizations, offering prestige and indirect financial benefits. However, these organizations are not considered agencies of the United States, do not receive direct appropriations, and do not have governmental powers or benefits. The honorific nature of the federal chartering process may be misleading to the public. When organizations claim to be \"chartered by Congress,\" it implies a direct relationship to the federal government that does not actually exist. While most congressionally chartered nonprofits are not government agencies, there are exceptions like the U.S. Olympic Committee which receives congressional attention. The boundary between private and governmental sectors can be blurred in these cases. The boundary between private and governmental sectors can be blurred, especially in cases where Congress chartered nonprofits. The Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety was created by Congress, raising questions about the limits of Congress's authority to assign a \"private\" label to governmental functions. The National Recording Preservation Foundation, established by the 106th Congress, is considered a private corporation separate from the U.S. Government, despite its governmental attributes. It oversees the National Recording Registry housed in the Library of Congress. The National Recording Preservation Board, consisting of 17 members appointed by the Librarian, oversees the National Recording Registry. The Board's personnel are employees of the United States, while the National Recording Preservation Foundation, a separate nonprofit corporation, accepts and administers private gifts for the Board. The Foundation's board, appointed by the Librarian, operates independently with its own by-laws. The Librarian appoints a Secretary of the Board as the executive director. The Foundation, appointed and removed by the board of directors, has the powers of a corporation in D.C. It can receive funds but the U.S. government is not liable for its actions. Questions arise about its private nature and departure from the usual nonprofit model. Another nonprofit, the National Help America Vote Foundation, is not a government entity. The National Help America Vote Foundation, a private nonprofit organization, operates independently from the U.S. Government. It receives funding through direct appropriations and must comply with federal laws. Questions arise about its private nature and potential liabilities, including the ability to declare bankruptcy. In 1997, Congress amended the Federal Advisory Committee Act to include two Title 36 corporations, subjecting them to specific provisions involving appointment, activities, and reports for executive agencies. This is the first instance of Title 36 corporations being subject to a general management law, potentially diminishing their private character. The process of granting corporate charters by Congress involves the introduction of a bill, referral to judiciary committees, approval by both houses, and signature by the President. Prior to 1965, requests for congressional charters were considered on a case-by-case basis without standards. President Lyndon Johnson vetoed a bill in 1965 that would have granted a corporate charter to the Youth Councils on Civil Affairs. President Johnson vetoed a bill in 1965 that would have granted a corporate charter to the Youth Councils on Civil Affairs, citing concerns about the lack of clearly established criteria for eligibility. He emphasized the need for Federal charters to be granted selectively based on national interest standards and requested a comprehensive study by the judiciary committees. In 1969, judiciary committees proposed \"Standards for Granting of Federal Charters\" for nonprofit organizations seeking federal charters from Congress. The statement outlined five minimum standards for organizations to meet, including operating under a state charter for a sufficient period of time. The 1969 \"Standards for Granting of Federal Charters\" outlined five minimum requirements for nonprofit organizations seeking federal charters from Congress. Organizations must demonstrate permanence, public interest, unique character, charitable purposes, nonpartisan and nonprofit operation, and national scope and need. This status is similar to organizations incorporated under state law. In 1969, organizations seeking a federal charter must show proper functioning under a state charter and public interest. Federal charters may designate corporations as citizens of the United States for legal purposes, unlike state-chartered corporations. This distinction was upheld in a case involving the American Legion. Federal charters are laws of the United States and can only be amended by another federal law. Organizations must go through the full legislative process if they want to change any provision in their charter. While federal supervision of congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations is limited, they are required to have independent audits annually. The Subcommittee on Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law oversees the audit reports of Title 36 corporations, ensuring they are submitted to Congress annually. The House Judiciary Committee refers these audits to the Government Accountability Office for review, with a focus on desk reviews unless issues arise. The GAO's role is to assess if the reports meet reporting standards. The Subcommittee on Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law oversees audit reports of Title 36 corporations for annual submission to Congress. Major issues include late submissions, lack of explanations, non-compliant financial statements, audits by non-independent CPAs, and deviations from auditing standards. Public access to these reports varies, with some like the National Ski Patrol System's report being submitted to Congress but not publicly printed. The Senate Judiciary Committee typically defers to the House committee on these matters. The Judiciary committees of Congress and the Government Accountability Office do not conduct audits on chartered organizations but aim to protect the public interest. There have been controversies involving chartered organizations, like the Boy Scouts of America, but no Title 36 corporation charter has been revoked so far. The Supreme Court ruled in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale that the organization had the right to exclude a leader who disagreed with its values, specifically in the case of a homosexual assistant scout master. The court upheld the organization's decision to remove him from his position based on his lifestyle, despite his good performance in his role. The Supreme Court ruled in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale that the organization's decision to exclude a leader based on his homosexuality was upheld. Dale's attorneys argued that this denial violated his rights under New Jersey's public accommodations law. Legislation was introduced to repeal the Boy Scouts' federal charter, but a motion to suspend the rules failed, supporting the Supreme Court decision. In a related incident in 2005, American Gold Star Mothers reportedly refused membership to a woman. Gold Star Mothers (36 U.S.C. 211) faced criticism for denying membership to a woman whose son died in Iraq in 2004 because she was not a U.S. citizen. Congressional concern grew over exclusionary practices in Title 36 organizations that limit membership to U.S. citizens. The National Education Association of the United States (36 U.S.C. 1511) was also criticized for using member dues for political contributions. Title 36 corporations, including organizations like the Grand Army of the Republic and the Veterans of World War I, have ceased to exist due to dwindling membership. Congressional hearings in the 1970s revealed dissatisfaction with the practice of chartering private, nonprofit organizations. Requests for charters were increasing, leading to concerns about exclusionary practices and political contributions by organizations like the National Education Association. In 1989, Congress considered a moratorium on federal charters for organizations, with concerns raised by Barney Frank and Craig James about the lack of oversight. Chairman Frank criticized charters as meaningless, stating that Congress had no way of verifying the legitimacy of organizations seeking charters. The subcommittee decided to end the practice of chartering new federal charters for organizations in the 104th Congress. This decision was made to avoid being drawn into public disputes and to level the playing field among worthy organizations. The Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law reaffirmed a moratorium on chartering organizations with congressional \"seal of approval.\" The moratorium may not be renewed in the 112th Congress, but other committees or the full Congress can still charter nonprofit organizations. In recent years, Congress has chartered corporate bodies like the Corporation for Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety and the National Recording Preservation Foundation. Despite a moratorium, two nonprofit organizations were chartered in the 105th Congress without review by the judiciary committees. In the 105th Congress, the American GI Forum received its charter after jurisdictional issues were settled in conference. The judiciary committees reaffirmed their authority over charter approvals, but made an exception for the American GI Forum due to exceptional circumstances. An exemption from the moratorium led to the chartering of the Korean War Veterans Association in 2008. H.R. 2852 and S. 1692 were introduced in Congress, with S. 1692 eventually passing and being signed into law by President George W. Bush. The congressional practice of chartering private, nonprofit organizations was a 20th-century phenomenon. Despite the assumption of government approval, charters do not grant any official status or supervision. The House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee concluded that the chartering process served no public purpose and issued a moratorium on new charters in 1989. The House Judiciary Committee issued a moratorium on new charters in 1989, but other committees or Congress can still initiate the approval process for chartering nonprofit organizations. This bypass strategy has been successful in recent years, despite the subcommittee's reaffirmation of the moratorium. The effectiveness of this moratorium remains uncertain against the continued attraction of chartering practices."
