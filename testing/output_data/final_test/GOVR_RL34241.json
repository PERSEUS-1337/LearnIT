Motivations vary, with some seeking to enhance their public image or prepare for future mandatory emission reductions. Buyers offset their greenhouse gas emissions to reduce their carbon footprint, while sellers receive income for activities that would not occur without the voluntary market. This report provides an overview of carbon offsets in the voluntary market, focusing on the concept of purchasing offsets to reduce carbon footprint. Offsets involve avoidance, reduction, or sequestration of CO2 or other GHG emissions in categories like biological sequestration, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and non-CO2 emission reduction. Carbon offsets involve specific projects or activities that reduce, avoid, or sequester emissions. They are quantified in metric tons of carbon-equivalents or CO2-equivalents. To be credible, offset projects must result in additional emissions reductions beyond business-as-usual. In a mandatory GHG emission reduction regime, offsets can only come from sources not covered by the reduction program. Emission reductions from regulated sources are not considered additional. The integrity of voluntary carbon offsets is a primary concern, with additionality being a key factor in determining their quality. Additionality refers to whether the offset project would have happened anyway without financial support. As more nations establish emission caps, the availability of carbon offsets may decrease. The additionality criterion is crucial for the integrity of voluntary carbon offsets. It can be challenging to assess in practice, with varying standards used to analyze it. A more stringent additionality analysis by offset sellers leads to higher quality offsets. Measuring emission reductions from a direct source is simpler than from an offset project. Project managers must establish an emissions baseline to determine the amount of emissions avoided by the project. When selling carbon offsets, accurately estimating the baseline is crucial to ensure that the offsets match the actual reductions achieved. An overestimated baseline can lead to artificially high offsets, creating opportunities for double-counting. To maintain credibility, offsets should be retired after being sold to prevent them from being counted multiple times. The development of a wind farm in a region with GHG emissions targets can lead to offsets being counted by a U.S. buyer. The wind farm can contribute to emissions reduction in the area, potentially replacing other reduction activities. Double-counting may be a concern without a tracking system in place, especially if the region eventually joins a federal emissions reduction program. When carbon offsets are generated from a project, there should be confidence that the emission offsets are permanent. This is crucial for biological sequestration projects, like forestry activities, where buyers need assurance that the land set aside for forests will not be used for conflicting purposes in the future. Legal documents like land easements can help control human activity, and offsets could come with a guarantee of replacement if the initial reduction is temporary. In the voluntary market, carbon offsets can be generated from various economic sectors. This report discusses carbon offsets grouped into four categories, each containing examples. Specific integrity issues may be associated with certain offset categories, but addressing these obstacles can make the offsets credible. It may be challenging for buyers to verify if these issues were resolved. Biological sequestration projects involve activities that increase carbon sequestration or preserve areas to reduce carbon in the atmosphere. Biological sequestration projects aim to increase carbon sequestration or preserve existing sequestration abilities threatened by activities like logging or development. These projects include activities related to agriculture and forests, such as afforestation, reforestation, and limiting deforestation. They offer the most potential in terms of volume compared to other offset categories. Biological sequestration projects, particularly forestry projects, offer high volume potential but are controversial due to integrity issues. Concerns about additionality arise in agricultural sequestration offsets, where the activity may have occurred regardless of offset payments. For example, farmers receiving compensation for no-till operations that were already part of normal practice would fail the additionality test. Biological sequestration offset projects, especially forestry-related ones, face challenges in proving additionality. The complexity of the carbon cycle in trees and soils, including variations in species, ages, and locations, complicates measurement. This issue is particularly relevant in forestry offsets. The measurement challenge in forestry projects is complicated by various variables, including the net cooling influence of global deforestation on Earth's climate. Afforestation in the tropics is beneficial for mitigating global warming, but counterproductive at high latitudes. Questions of permanence arise in biological sequestration projects. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. This difference allows for the sale of avoided emissions as carbon offsets. Despite historically higher costs, sales of renewable energy offsets could make renewable energy more economically competitive with fossil fuels. Potential projects include constructing wind farms. Renewable energy offset projects may involve constructing wind farms, installing solar panels, or retrofitting boilers for biomass fuels. Renewable energy certificates (RECs) are offered as carbon offsets, representing the creation of electricity from renewable sources. However, RECs do not guarantee additional CO2 emission reductions and lack a standard to ensure their credibility as offsets. Renewable energy projects are driven by factors beyond CO2 emission reductions, such as higher fossil fuel prices and tax incentives. Many states have Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requiring a percentage of electricity from renewable sources. Determining additionality for renewable energy offset projects, especially those based on RECs, is complicated by these factors. Energy efficiency improvements require a financial investment but can lead to long-term benefits. Possible projects include upgrading appliances, supporting energy-efficient construction, and replacing light bulbs. These improvements are often seen as a \"no regrets\" policy due to their cost-saving benefits. However, the issue of additionality may be a concern, as it can be challenging to determine if the improvements would have been made regardless. Offset ownership and potential challenges arise with energy efficiency offsets, as improvements may occur in a different location than emission reductions. This can lead to double-counting situations, especially when states and local governments have enacted emission reduction limits. Multiple GHG emissions sources are not generally regulated by law, creating complexities in tracking and accounting for reductions. Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from various sources like agricultural, industrial, and waste management facilities are not regulated by law. These emissions have higher global warming potentials than carbon dioxide. Offset projects can fund emission control technologies to capture gases like methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons. Offset projects in the industrial sector involve reducing emissions from specific activities like HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production and SF6 from semiconductor manufacturing. Methane capture from landfills or coal mines is considered a high-quality offset. The size of the voluntary offset market is unknown, but estimates have been provided by organizations like the World Bank and Ecosystem Marketplace. The voluntary offset market has seen rapid growth since 2004, with estimates projecting further increase in the coming years. One optimistic projection suggests a volume of 400 MtCO2-e by 2010. The market consists of retail offsets and those from the Chicago Climate Exchange, along with voluntary reporting and registry programs. Retail offsets are easily accessible for purchase online. The retail offset market offers offsets for purchase online, with over 200 organizations providing varying quality offsets. Some meet stringent standards like CDM or Gold Standard, while others have self-established guidelines. The Chicago Climate Exchange allows buyers to make legally binding commitments to reduce GHG emissions. The Chicago Climate Exchange allows for legally binding commitments to reduce GHG emissions through purchasing CCX Carbon Financial Instrument (CFI) contracts from sellers. Recent studies have criticized the quality of offsets generated by CCX, as there are no commonly accepted standards in the voluntary carbon market. Some offset sellers adhere to stringent standards like the Clean Development Mechanism or Gold Standard for higher quality offsets. Offsets meeting robust additionality standards incur higher transaction costs, raising the cost per ton of carbon. Some sellers offer offsets based on self-established guidelines, leading to integrity questions. Assessing standards can be challenging for consumers, with some company protocols kept private. Studies on 30 companies in the voluntary market found offset prices ranging from $5 to $25 per ton of carbon. The prices for carbon offsets range between $5 and $25 per ton of carbon, showing a correlation with offset quality. The tax status of a seller does not indicate offset quality. The most significant finding is the correlation between offset price and quality, with purchases intended to generate emission reductions. Emission reduction, avoidance, or sequestration is beneficial for global climate change mitigation regardless of where it occurs. The credibility of voluntary carbon offsets is uncertain, leading to a lack of common standards in the market. Consumers must assess the quality of offsets, as not all projects are equal. This variability has led to the market being referred to as the \"wild west,\" requiring a buyer-beware mentality. The voluntary carbon offset market raises concerns about quality and credibility, impacting future climate policy decisions. Some worry about the variability in offset quality damaging overall credibility, potentially affecting the inclusion of offsets in mandatory reduction programs. However, credible offsets could offer compliance alternatives and lower GHG emissions program costs. Congress faces important policy questions regarding the viability of the offset market and its influence on climate change policy debates. The voluntary carbon offset market raises concerns about quality and credibility, impacting future climate policy decisions. If Congress enacts a federal GHG emissions control program with offsets, integrity concerns like additionality and accounting must be addressed. Experiences from the voluntary market could help develop standards for assessing offset project integrity."
