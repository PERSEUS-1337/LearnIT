    "title": "SB 421",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7873 of the Labor Code is amended to define \"trade secret\" and includes details about turnarounds in petroleum refineries. The scheduling and duration of a turnaround are no longer considered trade secrets after completion. Wages, hours, benefits, job classifications, and training standards for employees in petroleum refineries are not considered trade secrets. If a petroleum refinery employer believes information submitted may involve a trade secret, they must still provide it to the division. The employer can designate information as a trade secret, which will not be released to the public by the division. Upon receiving a request for the release of information marked as a trade secret by a petroleum refinery employer, the division must notify the employer and release the information to the public unless the employer files a court action within 30 days to protect it as a trade secret. Within 120 days of receiving a request for information marked as a trade secret, a petroleum refinery employer must obtain a court order to prohibit public disclosure and notify the division. The employer cannot refuse to disclose the information to the division, except in specific circumstances. Any information designated as a trade secret shall not be released to the public but may be disclosed to division officers or employees when relevant. The employer must notify the requester when filing a court action to protect the information. A person requesting trade secret information can intervene in a court action by a petroleum refinery employer. The public agency is not responsible for court costs in such litigation. Trade secrets can be shared between public agencies and officials if relevant to their authority. If a person requests trade secret information from a petroleum refinery employer and files a court action for disclosure, the employer must be notified and allowed to intervene in the case. An officer or employee of the division who discloses trade secret information to unauthorized individuals is guilty of a misdemeanor. Contractors and their employees who receive authorized information are also subject to this law."
