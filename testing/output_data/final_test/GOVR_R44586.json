It also includes provisions related to the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) for eligible reservists and Guard members. The program was a response to increased calls to active duty due to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2016 NDAA ends the REAP program for reservists and Guard members, providing benefits until November 25, 2019. Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX) supports former military personnel in job searches. The FY2016 NDAA ends the REAP program for reservists and Guard members, providing benefits until November 25, 2019. Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX) supports former military personnel in job searches. Section 560 of P.L. 114-92 prohibits individuals receiving a Post-9/11 GI Bill allowance from receiving UCX, unless certain conditions are met. The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-228) extends provisions related to health care, homeless veterans, and GI Bill benefits. While UCX law prohibits concurrent receipt of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and UCX, there is no federal law prohibiting the concurrent receipt of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and regular state unemployment compensation (UC) benefits. States can set their own provisions for UC and other benefits. The VA Advisory Committee on Education (VACOE) was extended until December 31, 2017 by P.L. 114-228. Educational institutions receive a reporting fee based on the number of GI Bill participants enrolled, intended to offset administration costs. The fee was increased from $7 to $12 per participant for education programs and from $11 to $15 for advanced payments, effective October 1, 2011. The fee for GI Bill participants was reduced to $9 and $13 for a three-year period starting on September 26, 2014, saving $3 million in FY2017. Eligible individuals must be pursuing an approved program of education, with different approval criteria based on accreditation. ED withdrew recognition of the Accrediting Council for. On December 22, 2016, the Department of Education (ED) withdrew recognition of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS), which accredits around 900 educational institutions offering GI Bill approved programs. Despite VA authorization to continue approving programs accredited by ED-recognized agencies for 18 months after withdrawal, programs must still meet approval criteria. VA is required to inform GI Bill participants of program approval status. The provision ensures that GI Bill participants at ACICS-accredited institutions do not immediately lose benefits and have similar protections as students receiving federal student aid under Title IV of the HEA. If a program is disapproved, affected GI Bill participants will cease receiving benefits and may need to return them. The Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-315) provides options for educational institutions to maintain approval of their programs for GI Bill purposes. Institutions can apply for approval as if offered by a nonaccredited institution, seek accreditation by another recognized entity, or await an appeal by ACICS to federal courts. There are no provisions for individuals to regain GI Bill entitlement used at a disapproved institution. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-146) includes provisions to enhance veterans' disability compensation, burial benefits, health care administration, benefits for homeless veterans, and GI Bill benefits. The GI Bill provisions focus on benefit enhancements, educational institution requirements, program approval processes, and information dissemination to maximize benefits. The act also expanded eligibility for the Fry Scholarship program. The Accountability Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-146) expanded the Fry Scholarship program to include spouses of individuals who died in the line of duty after September 11, 2001. Spouses are eligible for the scholarship until 15 years after the servicemember's death or remarriage. They must choose between the Fry Scholarship or the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance program. Special considerations are provided in Section 401 of P.L. 114-315 for spouses of individuals who died in the line of duty. The Fry Scholarship program was expanded to include spouses of individuals who died in the line of duty between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2005. Spouses are entitled to the scholarship for 15 years after January 1, 2006, or until remarriage. They can now change their previous irrevocable election for either the Fry Scholarship or DEA. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $16 million cost over five years for this provision. Section 405 of P.L. 114-315 codifies the original provisions of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Section 405 of P.L. 114-315 codifies provisions from the original legislation and allows the VA to make election decisions on behalf of individuals if needed. Individuals have 30 days to change the election if necessary. GI Bill entitlement is not charged if active duty service interrupts a course. Section 416 of P.L. 114-315 expands the MGIB-SR to include 10 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a712304a and 12304b as qualifying authorities for extended entitlement. The Army has seen an increase in mobilizations under \u00a712304b, with Section 12304a allowing the Secretary of Defense to order reserves to active duty for up to 120 days in response to a major disaster. Section 416 of P.L. 114-315 expands the MGIB-SR to include 10 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a712304a and 12304b as qualifying authorities for extended entitlement. This provision would increase spending by less than $500,000 over 10 years and affects the MGIB-SR, not other GI Bills. The VA is required to disapprove courses at public institutions charging above in-state rates for covered Post-9/11 GI Bill or MGIB-AD participants living in the state. Section 417 expands the definition of covered individuals to include Post-9/11 GI Bill and MGIB-AD participants who were discharged from active military service within three years before enrollment, Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship recipients, and individuals using transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. This provision does not cover dependents of active duty servicemembers. The provision, effective after July 1, 2017, requires reporting on academic progress and outcomes of GI Bill participants. Prior to this, reporting was voluntary and limited, leading to concerns about data availability. This provision aims to save $9 million over 10 years and reduce administrative reporting fees for educational institutions. The federal GI Bill investment raised concerns about limited educational and employment outcomes. Congress and stakeholders aim to ensure effective use of taxpayer dollars and successful education and workforce integration for GI Bill participants. Section 404 of P.L. 114-315 authorizes the Secretary to disapprove courses lacking academic progress data for Post-9/11 GI Bill participants. Annual reports to Congress now include academic progress information to enhance accountability. The report required information on participation, expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Educational institutions had to certify enrollment for various GI Bill programs. Section 407 of P.L. 114-315 allows a group of institutions to certify GI Bill participants collectively. The provision in Section 407 of P.L. 114-315 allows a group of educational institutions in the same state to collectively certify the enrollment of GI Bill participants, simplifying administration for institutions like community college districts. The VA is authorized to pay a reporting fee based on the number of GI Bill participants. The reporting fee for institutions and training establishments based on the number of GI Bill and VR&E participants enrolled or pursuing training was reduced to $6 and $12 respectively, from the date of enactment to September 25, 2017. The fees are adjusted to $7 and $12 for September 26, 2017, through September 25, 2026, and then increase to $12 and $15. The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs noted that the Department of Education charges a fee of $5 per Pell Grant recipient. The provision in P.L. 114-315 reduces spending by $56 million over 10 years with a fee of $5 per Pell Grant recipient. It aims to make the approval processes for GI Bill education programs more rigorous, shifting approval responsibilities from state approving agencies to accredited institutions. The change in P.L. 114-315 shifts approval responsibilities for GI Bill education programs from state approving agencies to accredited institutions, aiming to increase compliance and oversight while reducing duplicative approval efforts. The change did not specify approval standards for non-college degree programs at accredited institutions, automatically approving degree programs without review. The National Association of State Approving Agencies expressed concern about the proliferation of transition and training programs at accredited institutions. The VA issued guidance to ensure all NCD and degree programs of education undergo an approval process by the SAAs or VA, as required by Section 408 of P.L. 114-315. This process aims to reduce duplicative approval efforts and establish approval standards for accredited programs not deemed approved for GI Bill purposes. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 limited eligible programs of education under the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve and Reserves Educational Assistance Program to Title IV-participating institutions, state-approved licensure/certification programs, and state-approved programs leading to licensure/certification. Amendments in P.L. 114-315 aim to ensure GI Bill approved programs meet standards. Section 409 of P.L. 114-315 requires GI Bill approved programs to meet state licensure, certification, or employment standards. Courses must meet state requirements for licensure or certification, be accredited by an ED-recognized agency for law practice preparation, and meet state board standards for occupational employment preparation. VA can waive these requirements. Provisions under Section 409 allow the VA to waive additional requirements for education programs preparing individuals for state licensure, certification, or employment. The institution must not be accredited by an ED-recognized agency, the program must not have met requirements in the past two years, the waiver must benefit GI Bill participants, and the institution must not offer incentives for enrollment or financial aid. VA or SAA must disapprove unaccredited courses leading to licensure or certification. The VA can waive requirements for unaccredited courses leading to state licensure or certification. Educational institutions must disclose any additional conditions needed for licensure. GI Bill participants can remain enrolled if a program is disapproved. This provision is not expected to impact spending or revenues. Some educational institutions raised concerns about the application of state criteria to different types of educational institutions. SAAs can now add state-defined approval criteria to accredited and nonaccredited courses as needed, in line with VA regulations and treating all institutions equally. This change took effect for criteria developed after January 1, 2013. Prior to P.L. 114-315, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs conducted annual compliance surveys at educational institutions with at least 300 GI Bill or VR&E participants. Now, under Section 411 of P.L. 114-315, surveys are required at institutions with at least 20 participants. The Secretary can revise survey areas annually in consultation with SAAs. The compliance survey is conducted annually at educational institutions with at least 20 GI Bill or VR&E participants. The Veterans' Advisory Committee on Education (VACOE) advises the VA on GI Bill administration, with members from various fields and now includes individuals who have or may use GI Bill benefits. The Obama Administration recommended changes in the President's Budget, FY2017 to increase flexibility in VA reporting on Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA utilization. Provisions enacted through Section 414 of P.L. 114-315 require the VA to conduct a survey of GI Bill participants to collect information on educational attainment, employment status, military service, and opinions on transition assistance programs. The VA is required to provide information to GI Bill participants on school credit transfer policies, accreditation, and more. Eligible individuals can request educational and vocational counseling from the VA, which may include assistance with program selection and academic difficulties. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs has emphasized the importance of informed decision-making regarding GI Bill benefits. The survey on GI Bill participation is estimated to cost $1 million in FY2017. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs highlights the importance of school credit transfer policies for GI Bill participants. Section 415 of P.L. 114-315 requires VA certificate of eligibility to include information on education counseling services and articulation agreements. Individuals receiving VA counseling services must be informed about articulation agreements at interested institutions. This provision goes into effect 90 days after enactment. The provision on articulation agreements goes into effect 90 days after enactment, with estimated costs of less than $500,000 over five years."
