    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 146e of the Penal Code is amended to prohibit the malicious disclosure of personal information of peace officers or public safety officials without authorization, punishable by imprisonment. Section 148 of the Penal Code is amended to make it a felony to violate subdivision (a) with regard to peace officers, city police department or county sheriff's office employees, or public safety officials, resulting in bodily injury. Section 148 of the Penal Code is amended to include penalties for willfully resisting, delaying, or obstructing public officers, peace officers, or emergency medical technicians in the discharge of their duties. This includes fines up to $1,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Additionally, maliciously interfering with public safety radio frequencies can result in similar penalties. During the commission of certain offenses, removing a weapon from a public officer results in imprisonment. Removing a firearm from an officer during an offense is a felony punishable by imprisonment in state prison. Removing or attempting to take a firearm from an officer while they are on duty also leads to imprisonment. Removing a firearm from an officer during an offense is a felony punishable by imprisonment in state prison for up to one year. To prove this violation, the prosecution must show specific intent through various acts such as unfastening the officer's holster strap or touching the firearm. The defendant's fingerprint was found on the firearm or holster, and physical evidence confirmed their contact with the firearm. If the resistance, delay, or obstruction involves the same public officer, multiple convictions under this section are not allowed. However, if the officer is disarmed during a criminal act, this section does not apply. Section 243 of the Penal Code is amended to state that battery is punishable by a fine up to $2,000, imprisonment up to six months, or both. When a battery is committed against specified individuals such as peace officers, firefighters, or medical personnel engaged in their duties, the offender faces penalties of up to $2,000 in fines, six months imprisonment, or both. When a battery is committed against certain individuals like peace officers, firefighters, or medical personnel on duty, the offender may face a fine of up to $2,000, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. When a battery is committed against specified individuals like peace officers, firefighters, or medical personnel on duty, the offender may face imprisonment according to subdivision (h). The battery committed against specified individuals may result in imprisonment for 16 months, two, or three years. When a battery is committed against a peace officer in the performance of their duties, the offender can be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for 16 months to three years. When a battery is committed against any person and serious bodily injury is inflicted, the offender can be imprisoned for up to four years. When a battery is committed against a spouse, cohabiting partner, parent of the defendant's child, former spouse, fianc\u00e9, fianc\u00e9e, or someone in a dating or engagement relationship, the punishment can include a fine up to $2,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. Probation or suspended sentence requires participation in a batterer's treatment program for at least one year. The curr_chunk states the requirement for a city, county, or city and county to provide a new program or higher level of service as mandated by the California Constitution. Upon conviction of a violation, probation conditions may include payments to a battered women's shelter or reimbursing the victim for counseling and other expenses related to the offense. The court must assess the defendant's ability to pay fines, restitution, or payments to a battered women's shelter as part of probation conditions. Community property cannot be used to fulfill the offending spouse's restitution obligations to the injured spouse or shelter until the offending spouse's separate property is exhausted. Upon conviction of a violation of this subdivision, the person shall be imprisoned for not less than 48 hours if previously convicted of the same offense. The court may choose not to impose the mandatory minimum imprisonment under certain circumstances. The Legislature recognizes the seriousness of these crimes of violence against victims with close relationships. In this section, a peace officer arresting someone for a specific violation is not required to inform the victim about their right to make a citizen's arrest. Definitions for \"peace officer,\" \"emergency medical technician,\" and \"nurse\" are provided. The curr_chunk defines terms related to injuries and law enforcement roles, including \"serious bodily injury,\" \"injury,\" \"custodial officer,\" \"lifeguard,\" and \"traffic officer.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to law enforcement roles, including \"animal control officer,\" \"dating relationship,\" and \"code enforcement officer.\" The curr_chunk further defines terms related to law enforcement roles, including \"custody assistant\" and expands on the responsibilities of a \"code enforcement officer.\" The curr_chunk provides definitions for \"search and rescue member\" and \"security officer,\" and discusses legislative intent to clarify criminal sanctions for battery on peace officers employed as private security guards. The curr_chunk amends Penal Code sections 243.1 and 244.5 regarding battery on custodial officers and the definition of a stun gun. The curr_chunk specifies the punishment for assaulting another person or a peace officer with a stun gun or less lethal weapon, with different sentencing based on the victim. The curr_chunk outlines the sentencing guidelines for assaulting someone with a stun gun or less lethal weapon, with imprisonment ranging from two to four years. It also clarifies that this section does not limit the applicability of Section 245 in criminal prosecutions. Additionally, it states that no reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to the creation of a new crime or changes in penalties."
