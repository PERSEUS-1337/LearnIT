    "content": "The \"Elementary Mathematics and Science Equipment Act\" aims to enhance math and science education in elementary schools by providing equipment and materials for hands-on instruction. The Secretary is authorized to allocate grants to State educational agencies for distribution to local educational agencies to improve education in these subjects. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for subsequent years. SEC. 4. ALLOTMENTS OF FUNDS. From the amount appropriated under section 3(b) for any fiscal year, the Secretary reserves a small percentage for specific territories and programs for Indian students. The Secretary then makes allotments among State educational agencies based on specific criteria.

State educational agencies receive allotments based on criteria like the number of children aged 5 to 11 and allocations under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Unused funds can be reallotted to other States in proportion to their original allotments. Definitions for terms like \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" are provided in the Act. The term \"State\" refers to each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The term \"State educational agency\" has the same meaning as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary determines the number of children aged 5 to 11 in each State based on the most recent available data. The State application process is outlined in Section 5. Each State educational agency must submit a 5-year application to the Secretary to receive funding under this Act. The application must include assurances that the funds will be used to award grants to local educational agencies and that proper fiscal control will be maintained. The State educational agency must ensure fiscal control and funds accounting as required by the Secretary. Public elementary schools are eligible for a grant once over a 5-year period. Funds provided should supplement, not supplant, State and local funds. The agency will evaluate teacher preparation and professional development for math and science. The Act aims to address the needs for greater access and participation in math and science for underrepresented groups, including females, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. It also considers the needs of teachers and students in low-income and sparsely populated areas when awarding grants. Funds will be coordinated with State and local resources for professional development and training programs. The Act focuses on providing professional development and training for elementary school teachers in science and mathematics. It outlines procedures for submitting applications, distributing grant payments, and approving applications by the State educational agency. Additionally, it states that no more than 5 percent of funds allotted to each State agency can be used for administrative costs. SEC. 6. LOCAL APPLICATION. Local educational agencies must submit an application to the State educational agency to receive a grant under this part. The application must assure that each school served by the agency is eligible for only one grant under this Act. The application should outline how the grant will be used to award grants to schools, prioritize fund distribution, and ensure compliance with the purposes of the Act. The application for grants under this Act must include efforts to match funds, coordination with other resources, and a process for determining grant amounts based on school needs. Priority will be given to local applications that meet certain criteria. The educational agency prioritizes local applications that focus on assisting under-equipped schools, addressing the needs of underrepresented groups in science and math, integrating equipment into curriculum planning, prioritizing grades 1-6, and ensuring equitable access to materials for all students. SEC. 7. PARTICIPATION OF PRIVATE NONPROFIT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. Private schools must be included in services and arrangements to ensure equitable participation in the benefits of the Act. If a local educational agency is unable to provide this participation, the Secretary may waive the requirement. The Secretary may waive requirements to provide services to children or teachers in private schools for equitable participation in the benefits of the Act, subject to consultation and judicial review. SEC. 8. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. State educational agencies must disseminate information, evaluate applications, award grants, and evaluate end-of-the-year summaries. Grant funds can only be used for science and math materials, not for computers, software, textbooks, or staff development. Grant funds under this Act may not be used for capital improvements. Up to 50% of matching funds from the local educational agency can be used for classroom science facilities, like electrical outlets, plumbing, lab tables, or ventilation. The Secretary will provide technical assistance and develop evaluation procedures for State and local programs under this Act. A yearly report on the program will be submitted to Congress."
