    "content": "The Agricultural Export Facilitation Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Agricultural Export Facilitation Act.\" The export sector of United States agriculture contributes positively to the country's trade balance. Since 2000, Cuba has purchased approximately $2.5 billion worth of agricultural products from the United States. Cuba is a significant source of revenue for United States agriculture, purchasing $2.5 billion worth of agricultural products since 2000. To be competitive in sales to Cuban purchasers, US exporters must have reliable physical access to Cuba, which is currently uncertain due to the need for special licenses to travel there for sales-related activities. The current bureaucratic impediment to agricultural product sales to Cuba by US exporters can be resolved by a blanket statutory authorization for sales and transport-related travel. Visas for Cuban purchasers authorized under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 have been delayed or denied, denying access to potential buyers. A simple solution is to issue visas promptly. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 requires visas for Cuban nationals meeting with US exporters and phytosanitary inspectors for on-premise inspections. Some Federal agencies interpret \"cash in advance\" payment for US agricultural exports to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 requires visas for Cuban nationals meeting with US exporters and phytosanitary inspectors for on-premise inspections. Some Federal agencies interpret \"cash in advance\" payment for US agricultural exports to Cuba as requiring payment before shipment, causing commercial uncertainty and hindering sales. Congress did not intend for payment to be made in advance according to the legislative history of the Act. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for payment only before a Cuban purchaser takes possession of the product. Currently, direct payments between Cuban and US financial institutions are prohibited, leading Cuban purchasers to use third-country banks for transactions. Allowing direct payments would benefit US exporters by speeding up payment processing. The purpose of this Act is to facilitate sales of US agricultural products to Cuba by allowing direct payments and eliminating transactional fees. Travel to Cuba for authorized sales activities under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is permitted. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows travel to Cuba for commercial sales of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices. Regulations will be promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize these transactions. Authorized travel-related transactions under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 include transportation to and within Cuba, importation of Cuba-origin information materials, remittances to Cuban nationals, and processing of financial instruments in Cuba. Sales and marketing activities in Cuba, as defined by the Act, include exploring the market for agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices. This encompasses exhibiting, negotiating, marketing, surveying the market, and delivering these products. The term 'United States person' in the Act includes the Federal Government, State or local governments, private entities, employees, executives, sales agents, consultants, producers, manufacturers, distributors, shippers, carriers of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices authorized for sale under the Act, as well as exhibitors, representatives, and members of trade organizations promoting interests. The term 'United States person' in the Act includes organizations promoting the interests of producers, manufacturers, or distributors of products. SEC. 4. VISAS FOR ACTIVITIES UNDER TRADE SANCTIONS REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000. Visas may be issued to Cuban nationals for purchasing US agricultural goods under certain conditions. The Secretary of State must submit periodic reports to specific committees. The Secretary of State must submit reports to specific committees on the issuance of visas to Cuban nationals for purchasing US agricultural goods. Each report must detail the applications received and their disposition. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF PAYMENT TERMS UNDER THE TRADE SANCTIONS REFORM AND EXPORT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000. Section 908(b)(4) of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to define the term 'payment of cash in advance' for agricultural commodities or products. SEC. 6. Authorization of direct transfers between Cuban and United States financial institutions under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for direct transfers from Cuban to U.S. financial institutions for authorized product sales."
