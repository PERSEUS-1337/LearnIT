    "title": "SB 200",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48204 of the Education Code is amended to specify residency requirements for school attendance, including pupils placed in licensed institutions or foster homes, and foster children remaining in their school of origin. A pupil may attend school in a district if they have been approved for interdistrict attendance, are emancipated, live with a caregiving adult in the district, or reside in a state hospital within the district boundaries. A pupil can attend school in a district if they meet residency requirements, such as residing in a state hospital within the district boundaries or having a parent employed within the district for a minimum of 10 hours during the school week. The school district does not have to admit a pupil if a parent is employed there, but cannot refuse based on race, ethnicity, or other arbitrary factors. The district can also deny transfer if it would impact desegregation plans. The school district may prohibit pupil transfers if the cost of educating the pupil exceeds additional state aid received. The governing board is encouraged to communicate reasons for denial and record them in meeting minutes. Average daily attendance for transferred pupils is calculated according to Section 46607. The subdivision limits the net transfer of pupils out of a school district based on the district's average daily attendance. The limits are set at 5% for districts with less than 501 students, 3% or 25 pupils for districts with 501 to 2,500 students, and 1% or 75 pupils for districts with 2,501 or more students. Once a pupil meets residency requirements and is enrolled in a school district where a parent or guardian is employed, they can attend school through grade 12 without reapplying in the next school year, as long as the parent or guardian remains employed within the district boundaries. Section 48204 of the Education Code allows a pupil to comply with residency requirements for school through emancipation. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2018, unless a later statute extends the dates. Section 48204 of the Education Code allows pupils to meet residency requirements for school through various means, including living with a caregiving adult in the school district, residing in a state hospital within the district, or living with a parent or legal guardian who works within the district for at least three days a week. This section will be effective starting July 1, 2017. Effective July 1, 2017, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
