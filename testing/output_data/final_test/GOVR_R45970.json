    "content": "The FBI administers the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to determine firearm eligibility. Federally licensed gun dealers must check NICS before transferring firearms. Dealers who repeatedly buy and sell firearms for profit must be federally licensed. Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) can engage in interstate and intrastate firearms commerce with restrictions. Unlicensed individuals can buy and sell firearms for personal use without a federal license but are generally prohibited from interstate transactions without a licensed dealer. Background checks are not required for intrastate private-party transactions, but may be needed under state laws. It is illegal for anyone to transfer a firearm to a person they have reasonable cause to suspect. In the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives passed three bills to expand federal firearms background check requirements and prohibitions on firearm transfers related to domestic violence. The bills include the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 8), Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 1112), and Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 1585). The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 1585) expands firearms transfer prohibitions to include dating partners with histories of domestic violence and stalking misdemeanors. The report provides an overview of federal firearms statutes, NICS background check procedures, recent legislative action, and possible issues for Congress. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act regulate firearms commerce and possession in the United States. The NFA specifically targets certain dangerous firearms like machine guns, short-barreled rifles, and destructive devices to reduce violent crimes. The purpose of the GCA is to assist law enforcement in reducing crime and violence. The Gun Control Act of 1968 aims to reduce crime and violence without imposing unnecessary restrictions on lawful gun ownership. It was influenced by historical events like the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the University of Texas tower mass shooting. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces these laws, along with provisions of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. The ATF enforces the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, regulating firearms importation and background checks. The GCA prohibits certain individuals from receiving firearms, and ATF investigates false statements on federal firearms transaction forms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibits federally licensed gun dealers from transferring firearms to individuals under 18 years old for long guns and under 21 years old for handguns. Exceptions include transfers for employment, target practice, hunting, self-defense, and household defense with parental consent. Juveniles are also prohibited from possessing handguns, with 10 categories of persons prohibited from receiving firearms under the GCA. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7922(g), nine categories of persons are prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition, including felons, fugitives, drug users, individuals with mental health issues, unauthorized immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, former citizens, and those under court-order. Persons prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition include felons, fugitives, drug users, individuals with mental health issues, unauthorized immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, former citizens, and those under court-order restraints related to harassment, stalking, or domestic violence. Additionally, persons under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for over a year are also prohibited. It is illegal to sell or dispose of firearms or ammunition to these prohibited individuals if there is reasonable cause to believe they are ineligible. In 1986, Congress amended the Gun Control Act (GCA) to define the term \"engaged in the business\" for firearms dealers. A person engaged in the business of dealing firearms must be federally licensed and have the principal objective of livelihood and profit through repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. ATF issues federal firearms licenses to various entities including firearms importers, manufacturers, dealers, pawnbrokers, and collectors. The ATF defines a person engaged in the business of dealing in firearms as someone who devotes time, attention, and labor to the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms with the principal objective of livelihood and profit. Federal law exempts individuals who make occasional sales for personal collection enhancement or hobby. Only Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) can commercially transfer firearms across state lines. According to the Gun Control Act (GCA), only Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) can transfer firearms commercially across state lines. Any person engaged in firearms business, whether interstate or intrastate, must be federally licensed. FFLs can transfer long guns to unlicensed individuals from another state if legal, but cannot transfer handguns to unlicensed residents of another state. There are no restrictions on the interstate transfer of ammunition since 1986. Since 1986, there have been no restrictions on the interstate transfer of ammunition. A federal firearms license is not required to sell ammunition, but is needed for manufacturing or importing. Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) must keep records of firearms transactions and are subject to inspections by ATF. Statutory prohibitions prevent the maintenance of a registry of firearms or owners by any federal agency. ATF can trace the origins of firearms through recordkeeping. ATF agents trace firearm origins from manufacturer to first retail sale. They assist federal, state, and local law enforcement in investigations and make technical judgments on firearms. FFLs must conduct background checks for all firearms purchasers since 1998. FBI facilitates nationwide background checks through NICS, with some states using POCs for checks. The Gun Control Act (GCA) does not regulate private-party, intrastate firearms transfers between two unlicensed persons in the same state, as long as they are not \"engaged in the business\" of dealing in firearms and meet certain criteria. This means that private firearms transactions between individuals not required to be federally licensed are not covered by recordkeeping or background check provisions of the GCA if they reside in the same state. The Gun Control Act (GCA) does not regulate private-party, intrastate firearms transfers between two unlicensed persons in the same state. The term \"state of residence\" is defined by ATF as the State in which an individual resides with the intention of making a home. State laws or local ordinances may cover intrastate, private firearms transactions, possession, registration, and licensing. The Gun Control Act (GCA) prohibits unlicensed persons from engaging in interstate firearms commerce as a business. They can transfer firearms to out-of-state FFLs who can then transfer them to other unlicensed persons in the same state. The Gun Control Act allows unlicensed persons to transfer firearms to out-of-state FFLs who can then transfer them to other unlicensed persons in the same state. The facilitating FFL must treat the firearm as part of their inventory, conducting recordkeeping and background checks. Fees may be charged for these transactions, with about 22% of firearms transfers being conducted privately between unlicensed persons. A survey of prisoners found that 56% obtained their firearm through theft, finding it at the crime scene, or other means. According to a survey of prisoners, 56% obtained firearms through theft, finding them at crime scenes, or other methods. Private firearms sales at gun shows were not a significant source, while transfers among family and friends were common. The ATF Form 4473 is crucial for recordkeeping in firearm transactions. Prospective purchasers must fill out an ATF Form 4473, confirming they are not prohibited persons, are who they say they are, and are the actual buyers. Straw purchases, where someone buys a firearm for another person, are illegal and punishable by fines and imprisonment. FFLs must verify purchaser information with government-issued ID. Making false statements on the Form 4473 can result in penalties. FFLs must file completed Form 4473s in their records for firearm purchases. ATF can trace firearms recovered at crime scenes back to the original seller and buyer. The Brady Act amended the GCA to require electronic background checks for firearm transfers from FFLs to unlicensed individuals. The Brady Act required FFLs to contact CLEOs for handgun eligibility checks before the NICS system was activated in 1998. Over 12.7 million background checks were completed from 1994 to 1998, resulting in 312,000 denials. After NICS activation, FFLs must initiate background checks on unlicensed customers seeking firearms. The Brady Act prohibits the establishment of a firearms registration system and requires the FBI to destroy background check records within 24 hours for eligible individuals. FFLs are required to conduct NICS checks for firearms transfers, with penalties for failure to do so. The FBI NICS Section facilitated nearly 305 million firearms-related background check transactions from 1998 to 2018. The FBI NICS Section processed nearly 305 million firearms-related background check transactions from 1998 to 2018. FFLs submit prospective transferee information to the FBI through NICS, including name, sex, race, date of birth, and state of residence. Optional numeric identifiers can help expedite the background check process. The NICS Section provides an NTN and one of four outcomes to FFLs or POC state officials. The NICS Section provides a NICS Transaction Number (NTN) and one of four outcomes to FFLs or POC state officials: \"proceed,\" \"denied,\" \"delayed proceed,\" or \"canceled.\" A \"proceed\" means no prohibiting record was found, a \"denied\" means a prohibiting record was found, and a \"delayed proceed\" allows up to three business days for further investigation. The FBI NICS Section contacts state and local authorities for firearms eligibility determinations. After a three-business-day delay, FFLs can proceed with transfers at their discretion if no response is received. Background checks are purged from NICS after 88 days if unresolved. Two-thirds of checks are completed quickly, while one-fifth are delayed but resolved within three days. If the person is not prohibited, the FBI confirms within 88 days. If a person is found to be prohibited after a firearms transfer, the FBI contacts the FFL and ATF for further action. This situation is known as a \"delayed denial\" or \"lying and buying.\" Standard denials are referred to as \"lying and trying.\" ATF investigates standard denials based on FBI NICS Section referrals, and making false statements during a firearms transfer is punishable under GCA provisions. Making false statements during a firearms transfer is punishable under GCA provisions. Denied persons can challenge the accuracy of the records that led to their denial within five business days. If inaccuracies are found and corrected within 30 days, the transfer can proceed. Otherwise, a new background check through NICS is required. The feasibility of establishing NICS was based on sharing criminal history record information electronically through FBI systems. NICS queries four national data systems for disqualifying records on prospective firearm purchasers. The FBI's N-DEx system could have helped prevent a shooting in Charleston by revealing the shooter's arrest record. N-DEx is a repository of criminal justice files that can be shared across jurisdictions. It complements other databases like NICS Indices and Immigration-related databases. In some states, FFLs can conduct firearms-related background checks through state or local agencies as POCs or through the FBI's NICS Section. Thirteen states have full POC systems for both long gun and handgun transfers, while four states have partial POC systems for handguns and NICS for long guns. Three states have partial POC systems for all transfers. In 36 jurisdictions, FFLs initiate firearms-related background checks through the NICS Section for all firearms transfers. These states include IA, NC, and NE. Additionally, 30 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories allow FFLs to contact the NICS Section for background checks. Twenty-five states are \"Brady exempt,\" allowing valid state-issued permits to substitute for background checks. The NICS Section and state/local agencies handle firearms background checks in various states. From 1998 to 2018, there were 304.6 million NICS transactions, with the NICS Section conducting 42.2% and POCs initiating 57.8% of the transactions. The 128.6 million FBI transactions resulted in 1.6 million denials (1.24%). Some state background checks involved multiple transactions, such as permitting processes that could take weeks. Periodic NICS queries are run on concealed carry permit holders. The FBI conducts periodic rechecks on concealed carry permit holders, which are not individual background checks. The Bureau of Justice Statistics collects data on firearms-related background checks and denials under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. In June 2017, BJS reported that state and local POCs conducted 81.7 million firearms-related background checks from 1998 through 2015, corresponding with 123.3 million NICS transactions. About 54.9% of state transactions involved background checks. From 2006 to 2018, total NICS transactions doubled from 10 million to 26 million, peaking in 2016 at 27.5 million. The transactions handled by the FBI NICS Section increased from 5.3 million to 9.4 million from 2006 to 2016, then dropped to 8.6 million in 2017, and further to 8.2 million in 2018. State-issued concealed-carry permits exempt holders from additional background checks for non-NFA firearms, serving as an imperfect proxy for firearms sales. See Appendix C for a list of state permits certified by ATF as Brady exempt. The total NICS transactions doubled from 10 million in 2006 to 26 million in 2018. Transactions by state and local agencies increased from 4.8 million to 18.2 million from 2006 to 2016, then dropped to 16.6 million in 2017, but rose again to 17.9 million in 2018. FBI CJIS Division's NICS Section conducted 128.7 million background checks over 20 years, resulting in nearly 1.6 million denials. The FBI CJIS Division's NICS Section conducted 128.7 million background checks over 20 years, resulting in nearly 1.6 million denials, with an initial denial rate of 1.2%. State and local POC agencies conducted nearly 81.7 million background checks from 1998 to 2015, resulting in 1.46 million denials, with an overall denial rate of 1.8%. The FBI NICS Section processed 102.4 million background checks during the same period, resulting in 1.27 million denials, with an overall denial rate of 1.2%. The FBI implemented measures to reduce false positives in POC denials by establishing the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) in 2004. This allows individuals with similar names or birth dates to prohibited persons to authorize the FBI to keep their information in the VAF to prevent future delays in firearm transfers. The NICS Section denials data from 1998 to 2018 shows that about 20% of denials were appealed, with 10% of those appeals overturned, mainly due to misidentifications. This highlights the balance between false positives and false negatives in screening systems like NICS. Under the Gun Control Act (GCA), prohibited individuals can petition for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore their firearms eligibility. However, a limitation on ATF appropriations has prevented processing these petitions since FY1993. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 requires federal agencies to provide a pathway for mentally incompetent individuals to regain their firearms rights if their conditions improve. States must provide disability relief for individuals to restore their firearms rights. NICS denials and firearm retrieval actions have increased over the years, leading to a significant strain on ATF resources. In FY2017, ATF processed 3,933 delayed denials, with only 38 cases referred for prosecution. FFLs sometimes proceed with firearms transfers without a final NICS determination, leading to potential risks. The FBI's NICS Section, responsible for background checks on firearms purchases, has faced increased volume leading to strain. Funding and staff increases have been requested and approved by Congress, with budget allocations rising from $81 million in FY2016 to $115 million in FY2020. The Obama Administration requested $121.1 million for the NICS program in FY2017, including $35 million for additional funding. This included $15 million to sustain 75 professional support positions, $20 million to hire 160 contractors for firearms background checks, and $5.1 million for operational costs. Both Senate and House appropriations bills indicated support for the $35 million request. The FY2018 NICS budget allocation was $111.3 million with 679 positions. The FY2019 budget remained at $103 million with 679 positions. The FY2020 budget request includes a $4.23 million increase and 40 positions, bringing the total budget to $115 million and 719 positions. The FY2020 budget request for NICS includes a $4.23 million increase and 40 positions, bringing the total budget to $115 million and 719 positions. Congress has authorized grant programs to incentivize state and local governments to maintain criminal history record information and make them accessible to NICS. The National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) was established under the Brady Act to enhance electronic access to firearms-related disqualifying records. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act (NIAA) of 2007 further encouraged states to provide records related to individuals disqualified from acquiring firearms, including domestic violence convictions and mental health adjudications. The Attorney General was given authority to grant incentives and waivers to promote compliance. The Attorney General was authorized to provide grants, waive requirements, or reduce assistance based on states' compliance with bringing firearms-related disqualifying records online. Annual reports to Congress on compliance were required, with grant-making and reporting responsibilities delegated to the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics. The grant program was named the \"NICS Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP)\" and received appropriations totaling $1.06 billion over a 25-year period. The NCHIP and NARIP grant programs received a total of $1.06 billion in appropriations. NCHIP grants were used for various purposes, including improving background check accuracy. Congress authorized $1.3 billion for NARIP from FY2009 to FY2013, but actual appropriations were only $63.6 million. The funding was not designated as a grant program by the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations. The appropriations statute provided funding for NCHIP and NARIP grant-making activities authorized under P.L. 110-180. Congress continued to appropriate funding for NCHIP and NARIP under the \"NICS Initiative\" from FY2014 to FY2019, totaling $429.5 million, with $137 million allocated for NIAA purposes. BJS awarded $142 million in NARIP grants to 30 states and one Native American tribe from FY2009 to FY2018 under the NICS Initiative. The NICS Initiative grants have helped increase the availability of mental health and domestic violence records in NICS Indices. The number of mental health records increased significantly from 518,499 to 5,419,894, and misdemeanor domestic violence records nearly tripled from 46,286 to 175,376. However, there are methodological difficulties in flagging criminal records in the III for firearms eligibility determination purposes. The Fix NICS Act of 2018 addressed issues with inadequately flagged records in the III for firearms eligibility determination. It also reauthorized NARIP and NCHIP, with appropriations of $125 million annually for FY2018 through FY2022. Domestic violence protection orders are increasingly being placed in the NICS Indices, raising concerns about proper record placement. The Fix NICS Act of 2018 reauthorized NARIP and NCHIP with $125 million annually for FY2018 through FY2022. Congress appropriated $75 million for the \"NICS Initiative\" in FY2018 and FY2019. The Administration requested $65 million for NCHIP and $10 million for NARIP in FY2020. The House-reported bill would provide $80 million for grant programs under the \"NICS Initiative\" in FY2020. In the 116th Congress, the House has passed three bills expanding federal firearms background check requirements. Representative Mike Thompson introduced the Bipartisan Background Checks Bill of 2019 (H.R. 8) for universal background checks. Representative James Clyburn introduced the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 1112) to extend the time for firearms eligibility determination. The House Judiciary Committee amended and reported bills H.R. 8, H.R. 1112, and H.R. 1585, expanding firearms transfer prohibitions. The House passed these bills in February and April 2019. Additionally, there was a hearing on gun violence prevention by the House Appropriations Subcommittee in March 2019. On March 18, 2019, the FBI requested a $4.2 million increase for the NICS program in their FY2020 budget. The OJP also requested $75 million for upgrading criminal and mental incompetency records for firearms eligibility. The House Committee on Appropriations supported the FBI's funding request and allocated $80 million for NICS improvement grants under NCHIP and NARIP in the FY2020 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported an FY2020 CJS Appropriations bill allocating $131 million for NICS capacity and efficacy, $16.3 million above the Trump Administration's request. Additionally, $78.3 million is provided for NICS improvement grants under NCHIP and NARIP, with $25 million designated for the latter program. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have passed \"Red Flag\" laws allowing concerned individuals to petition for extreme risk protection orders against individuals regarding firearms. The House Committee on the Judiciary ordered reported bills such as the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act (H.R. 1236) and the Disarm Hate Act (H.R. 2708) to make individuals ineligible to possess firearms under certain circumstances. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 8) aims to expand federal firearms background checks. H.R. 8 expands background check requirements for firearms transfers, prohibiting unlicensed persons from transferring firearms without a licensed dealer facilitating the transaction. Exceptions include transfers between family members, law enforcement, and for certain activities like target shooting and hunting. H.R. 8 prohibits FFLs from facilitating private firearms transactions, maintaining records for background checks, or capping fees. It also extends the provision prohibiting fees for NICS background checks and requires FFLs to treat transferred firearms as part of their inventory, complying with recordkeeping and background check requirements. The proposed legislation, H.R. 8, aims to close the \"Gun Show loophole\" by requiring FFLs to conduct background checks on all firearm transfers. This would involve entering the firearms into a bound log, completing ATF Form 4473, and initiating a background check through NICS to determine eligibility. Gun control advocates have long criticized the lack of regulation for intrastate firearm transfers. Gun control advocates argue that closing the \"Gun Show loophole\" by expanding background checks to cover intrastate, private-party firearms sales would help prevent gun trafficking and reduce firearms-related homicides and suicides. They believe that prohibited persons could easily obtain firearms through private sales, gun shows, or online sellers. Studies suggest that expanded background checks could have a positive impact on reducing gun violence. Gun control advocates emphasize the importance of expanding background checks to cover intrastate, private-party firearms sales to prevent gun trafficking and reduce firearms-related violence. Gun rights advocates argue that most criminals would not submit to background checks and question the effectiveness of such measures. They believe that making private-party transfers subject to recordkeeping and background checks could potentially criminalize firearms transfers. Gun rights advocates argue that H.R. 8 could criminalize legitimate firearms transfers, such as sharing a firearm for target shooting or loaning a firearm for hunting trips or self-defense purposes. They believe the exceptions for \"temporary transfers\" are too narrow and could restrict lawful gun ownership. Gun rights advocates are concerned that H.R. 8 could lead to a national registry of firearms and owners, as it would require recordkeeping for all transfers. Legislation for expanded background checks on private firearms transfers has been proposed in several Congresses following mass shootings. Since the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando in June 2016, legislative proposals for expanded background checks on private firearms transfers have been introduced in Congress. These proposals fall into two categories: \"Universal\" and \"Comprehensive\" background check bills, with the former covering a wider range of private transfers under various circumstances. Gun rights advocates are concerned about potential national firearm registries under these proposals. In the Senate, key sponsors of \"universal\" background check bills include Senators Charles Schumer, Christopher Murphy, and Richard Blumenthal. Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey have been principal sponsors of \"comprehensive\" background check amendments. In the House, Representatives Peter King and Mike Thompson have introduced similar proposals to the Manchin-Toomey bill in the past, but now support a \"universal\" background check proposal (H.R. 8) in the 116th Congress. The House-passed Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 1112) aims to extend the delayed sale period for background checks under the Gun Control Act. Under H.R. 1112, background checks that do not result in a \"proceed with transfer\" or \"transfer denied\" would have a 10-day hold period for firearms-related transactions. If the FFL does not receive a final determination within 10 days of petitioning the Attorney General, the transfer can proceed. This change was prompted by concerns over the timeliness and accuracy of FBI-administered firearms background checks following a mass shooting in Charleston, SC in 2015. According to press accounts, the NICS check on the assailant in SC was initiated on April 11, 2015. The FBI found an arrest record for him, but it was ambiguous. The NICS response was to delay the transfer for three business days. The transfer was made on April 16, 2015. The NICS check would have remained active for 30 days and in the NICS system for 88 days. The FBI contacted the Lexington County court, sheriff's department, and prosecutor's office regarding the assailant's arrest record. The NICS examiner failed to contact the correct police department in Richland County, where the assailant's arrest record was held, leading to a delay in the transfer of the firearm. Gun control advocates have criticized the \"Charleston loophole\" where a prohibited person could acquire a firearm due to delayed background checks. Extending the background check period could prevent this loophole. Extending the background check period could prevent prohibited persons from acquiring firearms due to delayed background checks. Gun control advocates argue that the current three-business-day window allows for potential loopholes, as shown by data indicating unresolved background checks and delayed denial cases referred to the ATF in 2017. Gun rights advocates argue that improving the timeliness and accuracy of FBI background checks would reduce inconveniences for eligible individuals and prevent firearms from being transferred to prohibited persons. The GAO reported that ATF processed 3,933 delayed denials in FY2017, with 38 cases identified. The House-passed Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 1585) aims to reduce firearms-related intimate partner violence by prohibiting persons convicted of misdemeanor stalking crimes from possessing firearms or ammunition. It also includes provisions to enhance federal investigations and prosecutions of firearms-related offenses related to domestic violence and stalking. The House-passed Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 (H.R. 1585) aims to reduce firearms-related intimate partner violence by prohibiting persons convicted of misdemeanor stalking crimes from possessing firearms or ammunition. Provisions also enhance federal investigations and prosecutions of firearms-related offenses related to domestic violence and stalking. Prohibited persons under current law include convicted felons, fugitives from justice, unlawfully present aliens, and those under felony indictment. It is unlawful to transfer firearms or ammunition to individuals prohibited under these categories, including those under court-order restraints related to domestic violence and persons convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence. The curr_chunk discusses the elements of a qualifying Domestic Violence Protective Order (DVPO), including the requirement for the defendant to receive notice and participate in a hearing before a judge. The order must be issued by a criminal or civil court and the plaintiff must be an \"intimate partner\" of the defendant. An intimate partner includes spouses, cohabitants, or individuals with a child in common. The order must also restrain the subject from harassing. A qualifying misdemeanor conviction of domestic violence (MCDV) requires a court order restraining the subject from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child. The offense must involve physical force or the threatened use of a deadly weapon against a current or former spouse, parent, guardian, or cohabitant. H.R. 1585 proposes expanding the definition of \"intimate partner\" to include dating partners and individuals similarly situated to a spouse under domestic violence laws. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72266(a)(10), a \"dating partner\" is defined as someone in a romantic or intimate relationship with the abuser, based on the length, type, and frequency of interaction. H.R. 1585 aims to prohibit individuals convicted of misdemeanor stalking from possessing firearms, expanding the definition of intimate partner to include dating partners. The proposed definition of misdemeanor stalking includes causing emotional distress to family members, household members, or intimate partners. Certain mitigating factors apply, such as being represented by counsel or waiving the right to counsel. H.R. 1585 also expands the scope of protection orders and court-order restraints. H.R. 1585 expands the scope of protection orders under current law to prohibit individuals subject to court orders from possessing firearms if they pose a credible threat to the safety of an intimate partner or child. H.R. 1585 would amend domestic violence protection orders to include restraining orders issued after an \"ex parte\" hearing and related to witness intimidation. It aims to provide notice and opportunity to be heard within a reasonable time after the order is issued. The proposed amendment to domestic violence protection orders under H.R. 1585 includes adding restraining orders issued after an \"ex parte\" hearing and related to witness intimidation. This amendment aims to ensure due process rights are protected while balancing public safety concerns. Gun control advocates have also pushed for an expanded definition of \"intimate partner.\" Gun control advocates argue for expanding the definition of \"intimate partner\" in domestic violence protection orders to include current and former dating partners and individuals convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses. This could help address intimate partner gun violence, but may also strain efforts to ensure accurate reporting of prohibiting records for background checks. In 2018, the FBI NICS Section conducted 128.7 million background checks, resulting in 1.6 million denials. Over half of denials were based on prior felony convictions. In 2018, 45.1% of denials were based on felony convictions, a decrease from previous years. This decrease may be due to fewer individuals with felony convictions risking background checks. Additionally, state and local government submissions of prohibiting records, particularly related to mental incompetency, have increased. In 2018, state and local government submissions of prohibiting records, especially related to mental incompetency, increased. Congress passed the Fix NICS Act of 2017 to strengthen provisions under the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 after the VA Tech mass shooting. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that state and local agencies conducted millions of background checks for firearms transfers and permits, resulting in denials. The denial rates were 1.8% for state and local POC agencies and 1.2% for the FBI NICS Section. BJS also provided data on the reasons for denials by state and local POC agencies in certain years. BJS reported data on denials by state and local POC agencies for firearms background checks in 2014 and 2015. The reasons for denials varied, with some categories showing no denials or incomplete data. The percentages of felony conviction denials were lower compared to federal denials by the FBI NICS Section, possibly due to incomplete data. The NICS background check process involves crosschecking transferee information against various computerized databases like III, NCIC, and NICS Indices. Non-U.S. citizens are also checked against DHS and ICE databases. The FBI's criminal history records exchange system, known as III, shares information on persons arrested and convicted of felonies and serious misdemeanors at the federal or state level nationally. This includes arrest and disposition details for felony and certain misdemeanor charges. III also includes records on individuals under felony indictment, fugitives, persons found not guilty by reason of insanity, those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors, and individuals with domestic violence protection orders. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) is a database of criminal justice information available to law enforcement agencies for apprehending fugitives, finding missing persons, and protecting the public. It includes 21 files, with 10 queried by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), such as Wanted Persons, Protection Orders, and Known/Appropriately Suspected Terrorists. NICS does not currently conduct fingerprint-based background checks. The NICS Indices contain records of persons prohibited from possessing firearms under various laws, including felony arrests, fugitives, drug users, mental health commitments, illegal aliens, domestic violence offenders, and more. Additionally, there are ATF-certified Brady permits and state relief statutes for individuals with disabilities."
