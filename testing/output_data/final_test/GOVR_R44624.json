    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE). The IDEA's predecessor, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, was passed in 1975 in response to the need to educate children with disabilities. The IDEA authorizes federal funding for special education and related services, setting out principles for their provision by states that accept these funds. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has undergone multiple reauthorizations over the decades to expand services for children with disabilities. The most recent reauthorization was in 2004. Funding for IDEA Part B is permanently authorized, while funding for Part C and Part D was authorized through FY2011. The IDEA consists of four parts, each addressing different aspects of education for children with disabilities. Part D of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) focuses on national activities to improve education for children with disabilities. It includes funding structure details and definitions crucial for interpreting the act's requirements. Part A covers congressional findings, purposes, and key definitions, while Part B provides federal funding to states for educating children with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires school districts to provide a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) to children with disabilities aged 3 to 21. Children must be identified, evaluated, and provided with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) outlining special education services. Section 619 authorizes grants for preschool programs serving children aged three to five. Part C of the law focuses on state and substate funding formulas for preschool program grants and state-level activities. It aims to create a system providing early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. Services are detailed in an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) and are to be provided in natural environments. States must identify a state lead agency for implementation. Part D of the law focuses on competitive grants to improve education for children with disabilities through state personnel development, personnel preparation, technical assistance, and support to improve results for children. Grants are provided to state educational agencies for personnel development in early intervention, educational, and transitions services for various personnel. Part D of the law provides competitive grants to improve education for children with disabilities through personnel development, technical assistance, and support. Grants are given to entities like SEAs, LEAs, IHEs, and nonprofit organizations for personnel training, dissemination of research-based material, and parent training centers. Part B of the IDEA received the majority of funding in FY2018, totaling $12.7 billion. Section 611 covers special education for children aged 3-21 in public schools, receiving $12.3 billion, while Section 619 provides preschool grants for children aged 3-5, receiving $381.1 million. In comparison, Part C received $470 million, and Part D received less than 2% of total funding. In FY2018, Part B of the IDEA received $12.3 billion, accounting for 3.5% of total funding. Funding for Part B grants-to-states program had been increasing rapidly until about a decade ago, with appropriations reaching their highest levels in FY2005 and FY2009. However, funding trends changed after the 2004 reauthorization, leading to fluctuations in appropriations in recent years. In FY2018, Part B of the IDEA received $12.3 billion, accounting for 3.5% of total funding. Funding for Part B grants-to-states program increased steadily for most of its first four decades, with fluctuations in recent years. The Part B, Section 619 preschool grants program experienced rapid escalation in funding between FY1987 and FY1995, reaching its highest annual appropriation level in FY2000 at $390 million. The Section 619 preschool grants program received its highest level of funding in constant FY2017 dollars in FY1995 ($578 million) and was appropriated $381 million in FY2018. The Part C, infants and families program saw funding growth from $50 million in FY1987 to over $444 million in FY2004, but has since received relatively level appropriations in actual dollars and declining funding in constant 2017 dollars. Funding for the Part C program remained relatively stable between FY2004 and FY2012. Funding for the Part C program has fluctuated over the past five years, with appropriations in FY2018 at $470 million. Federal laws for children with disabilities date back to the early 19th century, but it wasn't until the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1966 that general federal assistance was provided for their education. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1966 established a new Title VI to provide assistance for educating children with disabilities. This program aimed to address the needs of children with disabilities under the ESEA Title I program by authorizing project grants to states for special education services. The Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA) was created in 1970 to consolidate federal educational assistance for children with disabilities into one statute. It established a grant program to support projects providing services for students with disabilities. Members of Congress argued for greater emphasis on EHA assistance to states due to the number of unserved school-aged children with disabilities. The House Committee on Education and Labor report on the bill that would become P.L. 91-230 highlighted that 60% of school-aged children with disabilities in the US were not receiving special education services. The committee urged full funding for the federal program of project grants to states to address this issue. Congress, in 1974, reauthorized the EHA state grant program in P.L. 93-380 as it was believed to be inadequate in meeting the educational needs of children with disabilities. The Education of All Handicapped Children Act (P.L. 94-142) was enacted in 1975 to address the educational needs of children with disabilities. Prior to this, P.L. 93-380 provided emergency assistance to states struggling to meet educational requirements for children with disabilities. In 1972, similar bills were proposed in Congress to authorize federal assistance for implementing these programs. Senator Williams introduced a bill (S. 3614) to increase federal assistance for children with disabilities, highlighting the need for a commitment to provide appropriate educational services. The bill aimed to provide federal payments to states for up to 75% of the excess costs incurred by school districts for educating children with disabilities. The Federal Government needs to change its traditional methods of investing money to provide full educational opportunities for all handicapped children. Senator Williams and Representative Brademas reintroduced the Education for All Handicapped Children Act as S. 6 and H.R. 70 at the beginning of the 93rd Congress, emphasizing the need for a real commitment to appropriate services. The Education Amendments of 1974 (P.L. 93-380) included a significant change in the EHA state grant program. Senator Charles Mathias introduced the \"Mathias amendment\" which authorized federal assistance to states based on their population of children ages 3 through 21. This represented a threefold increase in funding compared to previous authorizations. States were required to adopt certain program policies and due process procedures to receive assistance. The Mathias amendment, an interim emergency measure pending the enactment of S. 6, was included in the Education Amendments of 1974 (P.L. 93-380). It provided $100 million in appropriations for FY1975, representing a significant increase in funding. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act was reintroduced in the 94th Congress for further consideration. In the 94th Congress, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was reintroduced with bills in the Senate and House, each with over 20 cosponsors. Hearings were held to discuss the distribution of funds and enforcement of education rights for children with disabilities. A conference committee was appointed to reconcile differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill, reaching a compromise in October 1975. The conference committee in October 1975 agreed on a compromise version of the bill, focusing on funding issues such as the funding formula, within-state distribution of funds, excess costs provisions, preschool incentive grants, and administrative costs. The formula established a maximum grant for each state based on the count of children with disabilities served multiplied by a percentage of the national average per pupil expenditure, starting at 5% in FY1978 and increasing to 40% in FY1982 and beyond. This \"full funding\" amount would be the maximum allowable grant per special education student from FY1982 onwards. The \"full funding\" amount for the Education of All Handicapped Children Act, later for the IDEA, was set at 40% of the APPE from FY1982 onward. States received funding based on their special education child count in 1975 to target funding on the population of handicapped children receiving services. The formula aimed to incentivize states to serve all handicapped children and ensure funding was based on the number of children receiving special education services. The Education of All Handicapped Children Act, later known as IDEA, distributes Federal funds to States based on the number of handicapped children receiving education services. President Gerald Ford signed the bill into law in 1975, expressing concerns about unrealistic funding levels. The funding levels proposed in the bill for handicapped children may not be possible due to the need for budget control. Since 1975, appropriations for the Part B grants-to-states program have never reached the authorized \"full-funding\" level of 40% of the national APPE. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has been reauthorized five times, with significant changes in funding provisions, especially in the 1997 reauthorization. Congress designed P.L. 94-142's funding formula to encourage states to identify and serve all children in need of special education services. Congress designed P.L. 94-142's funding formula to reward states for identifying and providing special education services to students with disabilities. By the mid-1990s, Congress found success in ensuring schools served children with disabilities, but there was a concern about the overrepresentation of minority children in certain disability categories. The 1997 IDEA amendments highlighted Congress's worry about this disproportionate representation. The 1997 IDEA amendments addressed Congress's concern about the overrepresentation of minorities in special education. A new state allocation formula was proposed to distribute federal funds for special education services, encouraging states to serve eligible children. Currently, 5.5 million children with disabilities are being served, showing progress since the Act was first passed in 1975. The current challenge in special education is the overidentification of children as disabled, leading to a need for appropriate educational services to improve outcomes. States are exploring ways to serve more children with learning problems in regular classrooms, but face potential funding reductions tied to child counts. The financial incentive for identifying children for additional funding reduces proactive scrutiny, especially for minority children, leading to overidentification in special education, particularly in urban schools with high proportions of minority students. This problem also contributes to referring minority special education students to more restrictive environments. The committee acknowledges the issue of overidentification of minority children in special education. They have shifted to a new formula for allocating funds based on the total population of children and poverty statistics. This change aims to eliminate financial incentives for manipulating student counts. The Committee introduced a new formula for allocating funds in special education to address concerns about over-identification of children as disabled and financial incentives for manipulating student counts. This change aims to enable States to provide better access to special education without risking the loss of Federal funds. The 1997 IDEA amendments introduced a new funding formula for distributing State aid in special education to eliminate inappropriate financial incentives for referring children. The formula guaranteed states a minimum base-year amount based on their FY1999 funding level, with additional funding allocated based on the total population of children ages 3 through 21 and the percentage of those children living in poverty. The 1997 IDEA amendments introduced a new funding formula for distributing State aid in special education. 85% of the funding was based on the population of children ages 3 through 21 in the state, while 15% was based on the state's share of children living in poverty. The full funding amount of 40% of the APPE was maintained in the formula. The basic framework of the formula adopted through the 1997 amendments remains in place today. Grant allocation procedures authorized under current law involve the Secretary of Education allocating funds after reserving funds for technical assistance and other payments. The Secretary allocates IDEA Part B funds among states based on a formula. The allocation process depends on whether funding increases, remains the same, or decreases from the previous year. The report will further explore how allocations are calculated in different funding scenarios. The formula for calculating IDEA Part B appropriations when they are the same or greater than the previous year is more complex than when they are less. This scenario is more common, occurring in 36 out of 40 years between FY1977 and FY2017. Initially designed to target funds towards states with higher proportions of children with disabilities, the formula was changed by Congress due to concerns about incentivizing special education placement and the disproportionate number of minority students receiving services. The IDEA Part B formula for allocating funds targets states with larger populations of children ages 3 through 21, with a focus on children living in poverty. 85% of funds over the base-year appropriation are distributed based on the state's share of the total child population, while the remaining 15% is based on the state's share of children in poverty. The initial Part B grant for each state is determined by three factors: the state's FY1999 base-year grant, the state's share of new money based on population, and the state's share of new money based on poverty. These factors are calculated using the state's population of children ages 3 through 21 and children living in poverty. The state's Part B grant is determined based on its population of children ages 3 through 21 and children living in poverty. The grant is calculated by allocating new money based on the state's share of the U.S. child population and children living in poverty. Each state's initial grant is the sum of the FY1999 base-year grant, initial state grant based on population, and initial state grant based on poverty. Adjustments may be made based on minimum and maximum grant levels. The state's IDEA grant is determined based on population and poverty levels. The grant is calculated using four amounts to determine the minimum grant allocation. The largest of these amounts is set as the state's allocation floor. The first amount is the preceding-year allocation, with the other three calculated using specific formulas outlined in the IDEA. The IDEA grant allocation for states is determined based on population and poverty levels. Three state minimum grant award amounts are calculated using specific formulas outlined in the IDEA. The first amount is based on the highest minimum grant award for states with small populations, the second on the prior-year award level and any percentage increase in appropriations, and the third on the prior-year award and 90% of the percentage increase in appropriations. The Part B formula for IDEA grant allocation calculates minimum and maximum grant amounts for each state based on specific criteria. The minimum grant ensures that states receive at least the same amount as the previous year, while the maximum grant sets a ceiling on the allocation. This unique calculation method ensures fair distribution of funds. The Part B formula for IDEA grant allocation sets both minimum and maximum grant levels for each state. The maximum grant level ensures that some funds may be unallocated in years of increased IDEA funding. In FY2015, 85% of states received their minimum award amount, with only two states receiving the \"small state minimum\" allocation. In FY2015, most states received their minimum IDEA grant allocation, with only two states receiving a different calculation. One state received a grant amount between its minimum and maximum, while the remaining seven states received their maximum allocations. The final grant amount for each state is determined by the lesser amount between the minimum and maximum grant levels. In FY2015, states received IDEA grant allocations based on minimum and maximum grant levels. If a state's maximum grant is lower than its highest calculated minimum grant, the maximum grant amount is allocated. Each state's grant amount is adjusted to fit within the range of its floor and ceiling grant levels. Ratable reduction is used if funds are insufficient, ensuring no state's grant amount is reduced below its prior-year allocation. The final state grant amounts are calculated by adding each state's adjusted and ratably reduced new money grant to the state's FY1999 base-year grant. Each state is allocated the sum of its FY1999 base-year grant and an amount of the current fiscal year's Part B new money proportional to the share of new money the state received the prior fiscal year. In FY2018, the IDEA grants-to-states program received $12.3 billion, $8 billion more than in FY1999. States must allocate the majority of their IDEA funding to local educational agencies (LEAs) and public charter schools. States may reserve a portion of their federal IDEA funding for statewide activities. States allocate IDEA funds to LEAs based on a formula using population and poverty data. Each LEA receives a base-year allocation, with the remaining funds distributed based on the population of children in public and private schools (85%) and the LEA's share of children in poverty (15%). If an LEA is adequately providing education with state and local funds, unused federal IDEA funds can be reallocated to other LEAs. Section 619 of IDEA Part B provides grants to states for preschool programs. Section 619 of IDEA Part B authorizes grants to states for preschool programs serving children with disabilities ages three to five, providing supplementary funding for services to preschool children with disabilities. The provisions, requirements, and guarantees under the grants-to-states program that apply to school-aged children with disabilities also apply to children in this age group. Part B, Section 619 preschool grants follow calculations for determining grants to states for children ages 3 through 21, with adjustments for reservation amounts. The FY1999 grant amount is replaced by the FY1997 grant in Part B, Section 619 calculations. IDEA Part C grants are allocated among states based on the ratio of infants and toddlers in each state. Minimum allotment for each state is $500,000 or one-half of 1% of total Part C funds. The minimum allotment for each state under Part C is $500,000 or one-half of 1% of total funds. If funding is insufficient, payments are reduced proportionately. \"Full funding\" of IDEA aims to ensure FAPE for eligible children without burdening states financially. The federal government provides funding for special education services under IDEA, with the goal of covering up to 40% of the excess cost of educating children with disabilities. However, funding has consistently fallen short of this full funding amount, with only 15% of the national average per-pupil expenditure being appropriated in FY2018. In FY2009, Part B appropriations approached closer to the full funding amount than they had before or have since, when, with the addition of federal stimulus dollars, IDEA funding rose to almost 35% of the APPE. P.L. 108-446 changed the method of calculating the maximum amount of states' grants under the Part B grants-to-states program. The maximum grant level calculation differs from the maximum grant amount for purposes of calculating \"full funding.\" The calculation for determining the maximum amount of state grants under full funding was set by P.L. 108-446 in FY2007. It is calculated as 40% of APPE multiplied by the number of children with disabilities served in school year 2004-2005, adjusted by the annual rates of change in the state's population. The IDEA authorized \"such sums as may be necessary\" for the Part B grants-to-states program before P.L. 108-446 amended it to include specific authorization levels leading to full funding by FY2011. The maximum grant amount is calculated as 40% of APPE multiplied by the number of children with disabilities served, adjusted for annual changes in child population and poverty rate. The IDEA's Part B grants-to-states program did not receive full funding in FY2011 as authorized by P.L. 108-446. The grants are meant to supplement, not supplant, state and local funding for special education services. The IDEA also includes maintenance of effort requirements to ensure states do not reduce their own funding levels for special education. The IDEA MOE provisions require states to maintain support for special education at the same level as the previous fiscal year. Failure to meet this requirement results in a reduction of subsequent year grants. States must ensure that funding for special education remains consistent each year. The MOE provision for special education requires states and LEAs to maintain their level of financial support for special education and related services each year. States must ensure consistent funding for special education, while LEAs are responsible for maintaining their level of expenditures for children with disabilities. The MOE provision for special education requires states and LEAs to maintain their level of financial support for special education and related services each year. States may count contributions to SEAs and other state agencies to meet this requirement, while LEAs must maintain their level of expenditures on special education themselves. Failure to meet the MOE requirement results in funding allocation reductions in the following fiscal year. Waivers for one fiscal year may be granted in rare instances. The Secretary may grant a waiver of the MOE requirement for exceptional circumstances like natural disasters or financial declines. States must provide evidence that FAPE is available for all children with disabilities to qualify for a waiver. If a state fails to meet the MOE requirement, future financial support is not reduced. Waivers have never been granted since the MOE provisions were included in the IDEA in 1997. In the absence of meeting MOE requirements, a waiver can reduce a state's financial support for the current year but not subsequent years. Penalties may be imposed on states for failing to meet special education funding after reducing it. LEAs vary in size, from large urban districts to individual charter schools, leading to varying special education budgets due to staffing or student changes. IDEA allows LEAs to reduce educational expenditures if related to voluntary or justified departures. The reduction in Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for special education funding can be due to various reasons such as voluntary departure of personnel, decrease in enrollment of students with disabilities, termination of costly obligations, assumption of costs by high-cost funds, or increase in IDEA funds allocation. The reduction should be based on one of these reasons according to ED policy letters. The Minnesota Department of Education sought clarification from the ED on whether increased efficiency and cost savings could justify a reduction in Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for special education funding. ED stated that increased efficiency alone is not sufficient, but if the efficiency was due to specific circumstances outlined in the statute, it could potentially justify the reduction. Congress initially assumed that educating children with disabilities was twice as costly, but this estimate did not consider the exceptional expenses of special education. The APPE for children with high-cost special needs can be significantly higher than for general education students. States may provide extra funding through risk pools or high-cost funds to help LEAs cover the extraordinary costs of special education services for high-need children with disabilities. The definition of a high-need child with a disability varies among states, with some using specific dollar amounts or expenditure ratios to determine eligibility. States have different ways of providing additional funding to LEAs for high-need children with disabilities, such as through spending caps or percentage coverage of expenses. Amendments in the 2004 IDEA reauthorization allow states to use 10% of Part B funds for high-cost funds to help cover extraordinary special education costs. States can use 10% of Part B funds for high-cost funds to support LEAs with high-need children with disabilities. States must follow IDEA provisions for risk pools, including defining a \"high-need child with a disability\" and establishing eligibility criteria for LEAs to participate in the risk pool system. States can establish eligibility criteria for LEAs to participate in a risk pool system for high-need children with disabilities. LEAs can use disbursements from the risk pool to provide services outlined in IEPs. States may operate a risk pool or high-cost fund as long as no Part B funds are used to support it."
