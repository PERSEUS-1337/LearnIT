The Department of Veterans Affairs buildings are aging, with facilities experiencing increased usage and deteriorating conditions. The Department manages over 5,600 buildings and 34,000 acres of land, with significant infrastructure gaps requiring billions of dollars to address. The Veterans Health Administration has numerous construction projects that are only partially funded. The Department of Veterans Affairs needs $23.2 billion over the next 10 years to complete existing projects and address infrastructure gaps. Current funding levels will take over 67 years to finish the 10-year capital investment plan. The Department of Veterans Affairs requires $23.2 billion for ongoing projects and infrastructure needs. Current funding levels will take over 67 years to complete the 10-year capital investment plan. Additionally, there is a program for non-federal entities to construct major medical facilities under partnership agreements. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs partners with non-Federal entities for major construction projects, specifically major medical facility projects that have received funding and completed design phase but have not started construction. Each partnership agreement requires the non-Federal entity to obtain necessary permits. To participate in the program, a non-Federal entity must obtain required permits for construction and may request technical assistance from the Secretary. The entity must submit an application detailing project managers, non-Federal contributions, and future funding sources. The non-Federal entity participating in the program must provide a project management plan, metrics for monitoring change orders, expected project costs, construction timelines, milestones, and any other information required by the Secretary. The Department of Veterans Affairs will provide matching funds to entities that enter into partnership agreements with the Secretary. The Secretary will provide matching funds up to 50% of the non-Federal entity's expenses under the program. There is no limit on the amount a non-Federal entity can spend on a construction project covered by a partnership agreement. The Comptroller General will report biennially to Congress on the partnership agreements. The program must be implemented within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
