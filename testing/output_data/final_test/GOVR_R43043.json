    "content": "On January 17, 2014, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547/P.L. 113-76), providing full-year funding for FY2014, including the foreign affairs budget. A comparison of FY2014 appropriations with previous funding levels is shown in updated tables. After a government shutdown in October 2013, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 2775/P.L. 113-46) was passed to continue FY2013 funding levels until January 15, 2014. (Appendix C details the impact of the shutdown on the Department of State and Foreign Aid.) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2014, extended funding through January 18, with a total of $49.16 billion for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, a 7% reduction from FY2013 estimates. This amount was 5.2% less than the President's FY2014 request of $51.84 billion. The President's FY2014 request included $42.64 billion in core funds and $6.52 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funds. The State Department's request of $16.88 billion represented a 5.5% decline from the FY2013 funding level. Congress enacted $15.86 billion for the State Department, a decrease of 11.2% from FY2013. Within State-Foreign Operations, $34.95 billion was requested for foreign operations accounts, a 0.2% decrease from FY2013. The FY2014 foreign operations budget totaled $33.72 billion, 3.7% below FY2013 funding. Congress did not approve funding for Food for Peace programs within the State-Foreign Operations appropriations. The Administration's international affairs budget distinguishes between \"core\" funding and funding for \"overseas contingency operations.\" In FY2014, Congress appropriated more Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding than requested by the Obama Administration for State-Foreign Operations, totaling $6.5 billion. This trend of exceeding OCO funding requests has been consistent in recent years. The House and Senate passed a spending bill for FY2014, with the House bill at $40.78 billion and the Senate bill at $49.49 billion. After negotiations, a Consolidated Appropriations Act was introduced and approved, totaling $49.16 billion for State Department and Foreign Operations. The enacted funding level for State Department and Foreign Operations in FY2014 is $49.16 billion, which is slightly below the Senate-proposed level but significantly higher than the House-proposed total. The funding breakdown includes $15.86 billion for State Department operations and related programs, and $33.72 billion for foreign operations. Congress allocated $6.9 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds, with $1.8 billion for State operations and $5.1 billion for foreign operations. The House bill proposed steep cuts to foreign operations and State Department accounts, while the Senate bill suggested minimal reductions to foreign operations but larger cuts to the State Department. Both bills allocated $6.5 billion as OCO funding, significantly more than the $3.8 billion requested for FY2014. The Department of State and Related Agency accounts cover funding for State Department operations, international organizations, and commissions. The curr_chunk discusses funding for embassy construction, leasing, and security activities within international organizations and U.S. government agencies. It highlights the key subaccounts for embassy security funding within the State Department operations. The curr_chunk discusses funding for embassy security, construction, and maintenance activities. It mentions that WSP funds salaries, maintenance, and software for embassy protection, while WSU funds construction of secure compounds. The FY2014 request sought $16.88 billion for State Department accounts, with a decrease in OCO Iraq operations funds due to reduced U.S. presence in Iraq. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 aligns with the request by boosting non-emergency operating accounts while reducing emergency funding for frontline states like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The funding for embassy security and protection of U.S. diplomats abroad has been reduced in the Diplomatic and Consular Programs budget. Recent attacks on U.S. facilities and personnel highlight the need for increased scrutiny on funding for security measures. The State Department's Accountability Review Board recommended increasing resources for diplomatic security after the Benghazi attack. In December 2012, a proposal to transfer $1.3 billion towards diplomatic security needs was presented to Congress, including funds for additional Marine security guards, new diplomatic security personnel, and improved security at overseas facilities. Although the transfer authority was not granted by Congress, additional funding of $918 million was provided for diplomatic security in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided additional funding for diplomatic security, including $918 million for WSP and $1.3 billion for ESCM. The FY2014 request aimed to sustain initiatives from FY2013, such as expanding the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and increasing Marine Security Guard detachments. The request also included $2.2 billion for new secure diplomatic facilities and $2.65 billion for ESCM, a 6% decrease from FY2013 but a 60.6% increase from FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 exceeds the Administration's request for ESCM of $2.4 billion by $25 million in OCO funds, to be used to harden high-risk posts. Of the total enacted ESCM funding of $2.67 billion, $1.6 billion is for WSU. P.L. 113-76 also provides a total of $2.77 billion for Worldwide Security Protection, with $900.3 million in OCO funds, specifying that the $585 million above the requested amount should be applied to the normalization of Iraq operations. Compared to FY2013 levels, the ESCM account shows a reduction of 5.1%, while WSP funds would grow by $517 million or 23% over FY2013 levels. The State Department faces personnel shortages, especially among mid-level Foreign Service officers. Hiring under the Diplomacy 3.0 initiative increased the Foreign Service by 18%, but slowed in FY2011-FY2012 due to budget constraints. The FY2014 request aimed to grow the Human Resources account to $2.60 billion, with plans for 186 new positions, mostly funded by consular fees. The State Department requested funding for 186 new positions in FY2014, with 151 positions funded by consular fees to meet visa demand. The remaining 35 positions were focused on the \"re-balance\" to Asia and staffing the Secretary's Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues. Additionally, the department sought $81.4 million for an overseas comparability pay adjustment to address workforce needs. Advocates argue that the funding discrepancy affects morale and retention of FSOs, acting as a financial disincentive for overseas service and impacting retirement pay. The requested funding would have completed the OCP adjustment, with prior year funding addressing two-thirds of the gap. The 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $2.36 billion for the Human Resources account, 9.2% less than requested, and does not fund new positions, directing the Secretary to reassign vacant positions instead. The act also prohibits the third phase of OCP but allows previous adjustments to continue. The Administration's FY2014 budget request included reduced resources for State Operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The State Department's presence in Iraq has been decreasing since 2011, with plans to further reduce its footprint. The budget requested $1.18 billion for activities in Iraq, $2.4 billion less than FY2012. The U.S. presence in Afghanistan is evolving as the combat mission is ending in 2014. The President's budget request for Afghanistan in 2014 was $3.1 billion, with $2.2 billion in assistance and $900 million for civilian personnel. Ongoing operations funding would decrease by $710 million from FY2012 levels. Pakistan received $1.3 billion in funding, with a 61% decrease in OCO funding compared to FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 provided $491 million for ongoing operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, with a total of nearly $910 million to meet operational costs. This represents a 43% decrease in total operational funding. The Obama Administration announced plans to expand its role in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on Southeast and South Asia. This includes new military deployments and partnerships with Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines, as well as negotiations with other nations to form a Trans-Pacific partnership. The Administration aims to tap into the region's economic growth and influence the development of norms and rules, especially as China's influence grows. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 reduced operational funding by 43% and rescinded unobligated balances from frontline states' accounts. The Obama Administration announced plans to expand its role in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on Southeast and South Asia. This includes new military deployments and partnerships with Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines, as well as negotiations with other nations to form a Trans-Pacific partnership. The FY2014 request emphasized the State Department's role in resourcing the re-balancing to Asia, seeking a 7% increase in foreign assistance to the region and 29 new positions for Economic and Political/Military officers. The 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act did not fund the new positions requested for the Asia rebalance. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act redirected funds from the Administration's budget for the Asia rebalance. It instructed the Secretary to reassign vacant positions to meet higher priorities and submit a multi-year planning and budget strategy for the rebalancing of U.S. policy in Asia. The Foreign Operations budget funds traditional foreign aid programs, excluding food aid, and includes funding for USAID operations. The FY2014 request for these programs was $34.95 billion, almost the same as FY2013. The FY2014 request for foreign assistance programs was $34.95 billion, almost the same as FY2013. Congress did not accept proposed food aid changes and enacted a 3.7% cut in foreign operations funding. Bilateral Economic Assistance made up 64.5% of the request, with a proposed 3% increase over FY2013 estimates. The FY2014 foreign aid budget proposed a 3% increase over FY2013 estimates, with a focus on security assistance and a new $580 million Middle East North Africa Incentive Fund. Security assistance accounted for 24% of the budget, with enduring security assistance funds increasing by 11% from FY2013. Total security assistance funds amounted to $8.51 billion in the FY2014-enacted appropriation. The FY2014 foreign aid budget provided $8.51 billion for security assistance, slightly less than the request. Multilateral aid made up 9% of the budget, with top recipients being strategic allies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, as well as global health program recipients in Africa. Israel remained the top recipient at $3.1 billion, followed by Afghanistan. Egypt and Pakistan also received aid. The FY2014 foreign aid budget allocated $8.51 billion for security assistance, with top recipients including strategic allies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Egypt and Pakistan are expected to remain key recipients, although aid disbursements may be affected by current events. The top 10 recipients would receive about 37% of total bilateral economic and security assistance funds. Political transitions in the Middle East and North Africa could impact U.S. national security goals. The Administration requested $770 million for a new Middle East North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in FY2013, but Congress did not approve it. The House and Senate had differing views on funding for MENA IF, with the Senate proposing $1 billion while the House did not allocate any funds for it. The Administration requested $580 million for a Middle East North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) in FY2014, with $105 million allocated for existing initiatives. The fund would support interventions such as assistance to Syrian opposition and humanitarian aid. The Administration argued that the MENA IF would provide increased flexibility and transparency in funding allocation. The FY2014 House bill did not provide funds for a MENA IF account, but OCO funds could be used for stabilization and response efforts in the MENA region, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The Senate recommended $575 billion for a Complex Foreign Crisis Fund, incorporating some MENA IF authorities. However, P.L. 113-76 did not include funding for a MENA IF account or additional Complex Crisis Fund funding for MENA response. OCO funds could still be used for stabilization and response efforts. The bill allows OCO funds to be used for stabilization and response efforts in the Middle East and North Africa, including Somalia, Yemen, and Kenya. OCO funding for foreign operations in FY2013 was allocated for activities outside of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The Administration's international affairs budget distinguishes between \"core\" funding and OCO funding for extraordinary costs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In FY2014, the Administration requested $2.31 billion in foreign operations OCO funds, mainly for Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, a 68% decline from FY2013. Congress designated $5.13 billion in FY2014 foreign operations funds as OCO, allowing for use in contingency operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, as well as stabilization efforts in the Middle East and North Africa. In FY2014, OCO funding will likely support humanitarian and security assistance activities in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. The International Affairs budget has long funded international food assistance programs like Food for Peace and Food for Education. Development professionals have concerns about the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs. Development professionals have raised concerns about the efficiency of U.S. food assistance, which has restrictions such as buying from U.S. producers and shipping on U.S. vessels. The U.S. Department of Agriculture piloted local and regional procurement of food aid, while USAID provided cash-based food security assistance. Some food aid commodities are sold on local markets by U.S. NGOs to fund development programs. Critics argue that U.S. procurement and shipping requirements, along with monetization, hinder the effectiveness of food aid programs. Critics argue that U.S. food aid is inefficient due to procurement and shipping requirements. In FY2014, the Administration proposed shifting funds to emergency food response, with $600 million still used for U.S. commodities. Additionally, $300 million was allocated for cash-based food security programs. The budget also included $250 million for a Community Development and Resilience Fund. The Community Development and Resilience Fund (CDRF) was set to receive $80 million in Feed the Future funding, increasing its total to $330 million. The CDRF aimed to replace the $400 million \"safe box\" for nonemergency development food aid. The Administration proposed cost-saving measures like removing monetization to reach more people. Congress rejected the proposed reforms in the FY2014 budget. Congress rejected proposed reforms to food aid funding and implementation practices. P.L. 113-76 continues to fund food aid through traditional accounts, providing $1.466 billion for the Food for Peace, Title II program and $185.13 million for the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program. Humanitarian assistance aims to save lives and meet basic human needs in the aftermath of disasters and conflicts. Funding for humanitarian assistance in foreign operations accounts totaled $4.56 billion in FY2012. The FY2013 continuing resolution increased funding for key humanitarian assistance accounts, with International Disaster & Famine Assistance increasing to an estimated $1.55 billion and Migration and Refugee Assistance increasing as well. The Administration's FY2014 foreign operations budget included $4.13 billion for humanitarian assistance accounts, with allocations for MRA, IDA, Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance, and a new Emergency Food Assistance Contingency Fund. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance received $629 million from the IDA funds to respond to various crises. The FY2014 foreign operations budget included $4.91 billion for humanitarian assistance, with allocations for MRA, IDA, and ERMA. The legislation did not adopt proposed reforms to food aid programs and continued to appropriate food assistance through agriculture accounts. This represented a nearly 15% increase over FY2013 funding and almost 19% more than the Administration requested. The FY2014 budget included an increase in foreign assistance to address humanitarian needs for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon. The Global Health Initiative received $8.439 billion, a 4.7% increase over FY2013 funding. Priorities included HIV/AIDS, malaria, maternal and child health, with notable increases for tuberculosis. The Administration's food security initiative, Feed the Future, received a 9% increase in funding for FY2014, totaling $1.191 billion. The funding would support long-term agricultural growth and nutrition plans, with a focus on economic resilience in regions of Africa facing chronic food insecurity. Additionally, the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) would have decreased by 2% from FY2012 funding levels. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) funding would have decreased by 2% from FY2012 levels under the Administration's FY2014 request of $837 million. Bilateral clean energy funding would increase by 7%, adaptation programs by 1%, and sustainable landscapes funding would be reduced by 10%. Total U.S. contributions to World Bank climate accounts would decrease by 6% with a $100 million transfer from ESF. Funding for GCCI programs in FY2014 is uncertain due to lack of clarity in funding directives. The FY2014 government shutdown in October 2013 affected the Department of State and foreign aid operations. Despite the partial shutdown, State operations and foreign assistance programs continued due to two-year funding for key accounts. Other sources like trust funds and fees also helped sustain operations. The American Sections of the International Joint Commission and International Boundary Commission shut down during the FY2014 government shutdown, affecting foreign aid programs. Most foreign aid programs continued with multi-year funding, but activities were limited by restrictions on new grants, travel, and training. Some programs operated on FY2013 money, while U.S. security assistance programs were mostly unaffected. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) were funded only through FY2013, with potential impacts on recipients like Israel and U.S. support for peacekeeping missions. Multilateral assistance through the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account, including contributions to entities like UNICEF and UNDP, could have been delayed without FY2014 funding. Shutdowns could have halted programs funded by single-year appropriations until new funding was enacted. If another shutdown had occurred in FY2014, the Department of State and USAID might have ceased operations other than essential functions for national security. This would have included a hiring freeze, suspension of new security investigations, closure of the Foreign Service Institute, and restrictions on allowances. The Department of State and USAID could have faced a hiring freeze, suspension of security investigations, closure of the Foreign Service Institute, and restrictions on allowances, including representation and education allowances, unpaid allowances for non-excepted positions, post differentials, and danger pay."
