    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Court Interpreter Grant Program Act of 2012\". Congress recognizes the importance of providing qualified court interpreters for individuals with limited English proficiency in judicial proceedings. This is crucial for ensuring equal access to justice, as a significant portion of the US population speaks a language other than English at home. The skills required for court interpretation differ from other settings, and the Federal Government is committed to upholding fair administration of justice for all. Regulations under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require recipients of Federal financial assistance, including State courts, to provide meaningful access to proceedings for individuals with limited English proficiency. 43 States have established or are developing qualified court interpreter programs that actively recruit and train individuals for interpreting court proceedings. Federal funding is necessary to encourage and assist State courts in developing, implementing, and enhancing court interpreter programs. This funding ensures that qualified and certified interpreters are available for court proceedings, leading to cost savings and efficient use of resources. To improve State court interpreter programs and share successful cost-saving initiatives with other States, federal funding is essential. The State court interpreter program is addressed in Section 3. The Administrator of the Office of Justice Programs shall make grants to State courts to assist individuals with limited English proficiency in accessing and understanding court proceedings. Grants can be used for developing interpreter programs, language certification exams, and training court interpreters. State courts can receive grants to recruit, train, and certify court interpreters, pay for necessary expenses like salaries and technology, provide remote interpretation services, and engage in other related activities as prescribed by the Attorney General. The highest State court of each State seeking a grant must submit an application to the Administrator with required information. State courts seeking grants must provide necessary information to the Administrator, including a demonstration of need, identification of recipient courts, allocation of funds, and distribution procedures. State courts seeking grants must provide necessary information to the Administrator, including a demonstration of need, identification of recipient courts, allocation of funds, and distribution procedures. The Administrator allocates $100,000 to the highest court of each State with an approved application, and an additional $5,000,000 to State courts in need of assistance. The Administrator determines the need for a State court interpreter program based on data from the Bureau of the Census, considering the ratio of non-English speakers in the state and across all states receiving funding. The Administrator gives priority to states without a qualified court interpreter program when allocating funds. The District of Columbia is treated as a state, with its Court of Appeals acting as the highest state court. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the first grant under section 3, detailing how each highest State court utilized funds in line with section 3(a)(2). $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017 for this Act."
