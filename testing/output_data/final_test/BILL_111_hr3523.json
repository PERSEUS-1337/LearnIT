    "content": "The \"Biofuel Engineering Training Act\" defines biofuel engineering as the discipline of using harvested plant material to produce fuels. The Secretary of Energy is referred to as the \"Secretary\" in this Act. The Act focuses on the study and development of standards for biofuel engineering. The Secretary will grant funding for a study on accreditation standards for biofuel engineering programs at higher education institutions. The study will determine subspecialty requirements for engineers creating products beyond fuel, consider feedstock interactions, carbon footprint, genetic challenges, and propose additional courses of study. The study will focus on accreditation standards for biofuel engineering programs, including subspecialty requirements for engineers and supplemental courses for experienced engineers transitioning into the new discipline. SEC. 4. CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE FOR BIOFUELS RESEARCH AND TRAINING. The Secretary will establish Centers of Excellence for Biofuels Research and Training at higher education institutions or consortia nationwide. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process based on selection criteria that focus on integrating biofuels research, training, and interdisciplinary collaboration with industry partners. The Secretary will establish Centers of Excellence for Biofuels Research and Training at higher education institutions or consortia nationwide. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process based on selection criteria that focus on integrating biofuels research, training, and interdisciplinary collaboration with industry partners. Additionally, the Secretary will work with companies commercializing biofuels technology and assist local communities with economic development and job creation in the biofuels sector. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014 for carrying out this section. The Biofuel Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program is established under Section 5. The Biofuel Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program is established for eligible students pursuing a doctoral degree in biofuel engineering. Fellowships are awarded through a competitive merit review process with specific selection criteria. The Biofuel Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program requires eligible students to demonstrate technical understanding, imagination, creativity, leadership skills, verbal communication abilities, and knowledge of disciplines relevant to biofuel engineering. The Biofuel Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program awards a fellowship to eligible students, providing an annual living stipend, covering graduate tuition, and incidental expenses for up to 3 years of study within a 5-year period. Applicants must demonstrate technical understanding, creativity, leadership skills, and knowledge of disciplines relevant to biofuel engineering. Applicants must also be a citizen or legal permanent resident of the United States. The Biofuel Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program awards a fellowship to eligible students for up to 3 years of study within a 5-year period. The fellowship is portable with the student, administered by the Secretary through the Office of Science, and may involve a nonprofit entity. $3,500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year. Federal agencies, including national laboratories, must provide research facilities to accredited biofuel engineering programs for faculty and student education and training."
