    "content": "The \"Rural Veterans Services Outreach and Training Act\" defines outreach as providing information and benefits counseling to veterans and their families. Additionally, it establishes a grant program for rural county veteran service officers within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The \"Rural Veterans Services Outreach and Training Act\" establishes a grant program to assist rural counties in employing veteran service officers to improve outreach and assistance to veterans and their families. Grants of up to $1,000,000 will be provided to State departments of veteran affairs for this purpose. The Secretary will determine grant amounts, capped at $1,000,000. States qualify for grants if they lack full-time county veterans service officers or have officers working part-time with demonstrated need for more services. Additionally, counties with over 1,000 veterans and a full-time officer can apply if there is a proven need for additional services. The eligible State seeking a grant under this section must submit an application to the Secretary, who will approve the most promising applications. Each approved State will receive funds determined by the Secretary, taking into account the total appropriation and the State's size. The State department of veterans' affairs will receive funds for the grant program to improve training and outreach of county veteran service officers in rural counties. States receiving grants must ensure funds assist counties with at least 1,000 veterans residing in non-urban areas. The State agency must match 20% of Federal funds for the grant program and use the funds to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal sources. A county veteran service officer provides advice and casework services to veterans. Grants are given annually under this section. Grants under this section shall be made on an annual basis. Grants are provided to rural counties to employ county veteran service officers with professional qualifications."
