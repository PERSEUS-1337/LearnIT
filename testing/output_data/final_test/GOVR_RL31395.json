    "content": "A permanent cease-fire agreement was signed between the Angolan government and UNITA on April 4, 2002, leading to the demobilization and integration of UNITA forces. Over 9,000 out of 55,000 troops had reported to demobilization areas by mid-April. Some logistical delays were reported in supplying food and medicine to the cantonment. The agreement followed the death of UNITA's founder, Jonas Savimbi, in February 2002. The former Savimbi-led faction, now led by General Paulo \"Gato\" Lukamba, appointed an interim management commission before cease-fire talks. Angola, a country with vast resources, has been plagued by a 25-year civil conflict that claimed over 1 million lives. A tripartite agreement among major liberation movements collapsed in 1975, just after independence from Portugal. The civil war in Angola began after the collapse of a tripartite agreement among major liberation movements in 1975. The MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA, each drawing support from different ethnic groups, fought for control of the government in Luanda. The conflict was influenced by the Cold War, with support from the Soviet Union and Cuba. In the 1970s and 1980s, the civil war in Angola was shaped by the Cold War, with the Soviet Union and Cuba supporting the MPLA, while the United States and South Africa aided UNITA and the FNLA. Eduardo dos Santos, Angola's current president, succeeded Agostino Neto in 1979 and oversaw a gradual liberalization of the MPLA's socialist political ideology. Dos Santos oversaw a shift towards liberal, free-market policies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He has been criticized for authoritarian practices, including harsh repression of political opponents and curtailing public expression. The country's first national election in 1992 ended in civil war, with Dos Santos taking closer control of the conflict in recent years. In 1991, a peace pact known as the Bicesse Accords was signed between UNITA and the dos Santos government in Angola. This agreement aimed for disarmament, a unified national army, and multi-party elections. The first multi-party elections in September 1992 saw 18 parties participating, with the MPLA winning a parliamentary majority but requiring a run-off election for the presidential race. The voting process had a high turnout of over 75% despite tensions from recent conflicts and calls for boycotts. After the 1992 multi-party elections in Angola, a run-off election was needed as neither dos Santos nor Savimbi won a majority. UNITA accused the MPLA government of election fraud and rejected the run-off, leading to increased conflict. UNITA rearmed, took control of areas, while the MPLA mobilized armed civilians and police to counter UNITA attacks and build its military capacity. After investing in military capacity, Angola launched an offensive against UNITA. International pressure led to UN sanctions on UNITA in 1993. Peace talks resulted in the 1994 Lusaka Protocol for ceasefire, disarmament, and UNITA's participation in a unity government. Despite a UN peacekeeping operation, delays occurred in implementing the Protocols. A Government of Unity was formed in 1997, but Savimbi refused to join due to safety concerns, leading to continued conflict. In 1997, the Republic of Congo and the Lissouba government in Congo-Brazzaville cut off UNITA's supply bases and imposed sanctions. Despite the Lusaka Protocol, full-scale war resumed in December 1998 when the MPLA government attacked UNITA strongholds. UNITA managed to stall the offensive and make territorial gains by mid-1999. In mid-1999, UNITA made significant territorial gains, including seizing diamond-rich eastern Angola. The U.N. imposed sanctions on UNITA in April 2000, blaming them for not implementing the Lusaka Protocol. The MPLA claimed military successes in 1999-2000, capturing key UNITA strongholds. By July 2000, the government claimed control of over 90% of the country and launched operations along the Namibian border. In late 2001 and early 2002, the Angolan government conducted extensive military operations against UNITA in eastern Moxico Province near Zambia, claiming to be routing Savimbi's forces. Despite reported losses of UNITA's military capability, the group continued to carry out guerrilla-style attacks across Angola, including near the capital Luanda. In 2001 and early 2002, UNITA conducted guerrilla-style raids seizing provisions, destroying property, and taking civilian captives. Despite military pressure, UNITA maintained a formidable guerrilla force funded by selling diamonds and obtaining arms. The group was capable of waging a bush war but struggled to occupy territory. In addition to conflict with UNITA, the Angolan government faces sporadic armed attacks by FLEC in Cabinda, advocating self-government for the enclave rich in oil. FLEC accused the government of launching offensives and increasing military presence, leading to civilian casualties. The Angolan government postponed elections multiple times, with President dos Santos announcing they would likely take place in late 2002 or 2003. He stated that elections could only happen once people could move freely and war-displaced persons were resettled. General elections were expected to be held under U.N. supervision by 2003 at the latest, with dos Santos announcing he would not run in the next presidential election. Dos Santos announced he would not run in the next presidential election, leaving the selection of the MPLA candidate to the party. His decision raised skepticism among opposition members and observers due to his strong control over politics and military affairs. Some believe he may be persuaded to run again, while others think he will step down but continue to wield influence as a power-broker. Rumors of his ill-health have circulated, but his future role in national affairs remains uncertain. In January 2001, Angolan President dos Santos dismissed the Chief of Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces, General Jo\u00e3o de Matos, who had led successful military operations against UNITA. De Matos had expressed doubts about a military solution to the war, hinting at policy differences with dos Santos. His business interests in security and mining may have also caused tension with the president. De Matos was seen as a potential challenger to dos Santos in the MPLA. Matos is viewed as a potential MPLA challenger to dos Santos in the upcoming presidential elections, supported by key MPLA members advocating for internal reform. Other possible presidential candidates include Roberto de Almeida, Kundi Paihama, Fernando da Piedade Dias \"Nando\" dos Santos, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, Marcolino Moco, and Lopo do Nascimento. The death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in February 2002 shifted Angola's political landscape, raising the possibility of stability and elections. The death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in February 2002 radically altered Angola's political landscape, leading to the possibility of an end to the conflict. Savimbi was killed in a government ambush in Moxico Province, resulting in the capture of some UNITA officials and followers. Government forces had intensified operations against UNITA, leading to the capture or death of several key members. The death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in February 2002, in a government ambush in Moxico Province, led to the possibility of ending the conflict. Government forces tracked Savimbi through satellite phone calls, drones, and tracking dogs. UNITA called for an international investigation into his death, while the Angolan government blamed Savimbi for the conflict. His death raised the prospect of leadership changes in UNITA and potential negotiations for peace. After the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in 2002, the Angolan government urged UNITA forces to surrender and promised to take decisive steps for a cease-fire. International support for peace efforts was strong, with calls for a cease-fire from the U.S., Portugal, the European Union, and the U.N. No details of the cease-fire plan were initially provided. After the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in 2002, UNITA parliamentarians and spokesmen welcomed the prospect of a cease-fire and further dialogue, but insisted that the cease-fire offer must come from the government. UNITA indicated they were not willing to surrender militarily and believed the Angolan government was not genuinely interested in peace negotiations. Initial assessments suggested UNITA would continue pursuing military objectives in the short term. Peace negotiations began in mid-March 2002. After the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in 2002, peace negotiations started in mid-March 2002, showing progress despite a leadership vacuum and internal struggles within UNITA. The UNITA constitution dictates the automatic succession of the vice-president, Ant\u00f3nio, as the interim leader until a new leader is elected. The interim accession to the top leadership position by UNITA vice-president Ant\u00f3nio Sebasti\u00e3o Dembo was announced in late February, but complications arose after reports of his death. General Paulo \"Gato\" Lukamba, the current de facto political leader of UNITA, has stated that the armed struggle is over and they will now focus on political ideas. He appointed an interim management commission to lead UNITA until the next congress. Lukamba, in his mid-40s, had close contact with Savimbi. The interim leadership of UNITA, led by General Paulo \"Gato\" Lukamba, has been recognized by both the External Mission and UNITA legislators in Luanda. The government has ordered a halt to offensive actions against UNITA to pave the way for talks and a ceasefire. Plans are in place to reintegrate UNITA units across Angola. The government of Angola has announced plans to reintegrate UNITA soldiers into civilian life, seek amnesty for surrendering rebel fighters, and prepare for general elections. Efforts to end the conflict include a broad amnesty for UNITA fighters, establishment of a Fund for Peace and Reconciliation, and creation of a parliamentary commission on prospects for peace. In April 2001, a parliamentary commission on peace prospects was established. In October 2001, the government met with the troika (US, Russia, Portugal) to resume peace efforts. In December 2001, the UN initiated contact with UNITA. In March 2002, Angolan and UNITA military delegations held ceasefire talks in Moxico Province. They agreed to work towards ending hostilities under the Lusaka Protocol. In late March, talks between FAA and UNITA commanders led to decreased hostilities. UNITA's External Mission initially doubted the talks, claiming some delegates were captured. However, they later accepted the talks as legitimate after communication with Gato. The government denied allegations of detainment or duress. The Angolan government informed the U.N. that talks with UNITA were part of a military exercise. UNITA negotiated from a position of weakness, with the government shaping the agenda. The FAA was in charge of logistics for the talks, which focused on military issues. On April 4, 2002, a formal cease-fire agreement was signed by the Angolan government and UNITA, following the approval of a general amnesty for former UNITA soldiers. The agreement included discussions on assembly points for disarming UNITA forces and protocols for their demobilization and integration into a unified national army. Present at the ceremony were top UNITA leadership, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, U.N. Undersecretary-General Ibrahim Gambari, and regional leaders. The full terms of the cease-fire have not been published, but it reportedly includes a pledge to abide by the terms of the Lusaka Protocol. The cease-fire agreement signed between the Angolan government and UNITA includes provisions for demobilization of 50,000 UNITA soldiers and their families, reintegration into society, and integration of former fighters into the Angolan army and police. Demobilization has begun at 27 regional centers monitored by the U.N., with over 9,000 troops reporting by mid-April 2002. Delivery of supplies to demobilization areas has been delayed. Key contenders to lead UNITA include Alcides Sakala, UNITA Foreign Secretary and close confidant of Savimbi, Isias Samakuva, UNITA's former top negotiator, and Geraldo Ukwachitembo Abreu, UNITA military Chief of Staff. Sakala has lost influence due to travel sanctions, Samakuva represents UNITA in France, and Abreu lacks political support within UNITA. Key contenders to lead UNITA include Alcides Sakala, Isias Samakuva, and Geraldo Ukwachitembo Abreu. Kamorteiro, Celestino Mutuyakevela Kapapelo, and Abel Chivukuvuku are also key figures within UNITA, with roles in succession interpretation and faction leadership. Observers and UNITA members have raised the possibility of reunification among UNITA factions following Savimbi's death. Following Savimbi's death, UNITA faces the potential reunification of the Gato-led wing with other splinter factions, which could strengthen its electoral position against the ruling MPLA. UNITA-Renovada (UNITA-R), a dissident branch formed in September 1998, is recognized by the government as a key player in implementing the Lusaka Protocol. The formation of UNITA-R was influenced by leadership rivalries within UNITA and the government's efforts to sideline Savimbi. Savimbi's UNITA rejected the splinter group, and rival UNITA parliamentarian Abel Chivukuvuku was elected chairman of UNITA. Abel Chivukuvuku was elected chairman of the UNITA parliamentary group in Luanda in October 1998, leading a splinter group independent of both UNITA-Renovada and UNITA's armed wing. Despite efforts for reunification, disagreements between factions persisted, with Gato and Manuvakola holding discussions but failing to reach a consensus. The United Nations supported peace initiatives in Angola through verification and observer missions. UNAVEM I verified the withdrawal of Cuban troops, while UNAVEM II monitored a cease-fire and observed elections. Despite efforts for reunification, disagreements between UNITA factions persisted. The United Nations supported peace initiatives in Angola through verification and observer missions. UNAVEM II was tasked with verifying the first stages of the peace agreement after the signing of the Lusaka Protocol in November 1994. It was succeeded by UNAVEM III in February 1995 to monitor and verify the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. In June 1997, UNAVEM III was replaced by the U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) with an expanded mandate to monitor the implementation of the Lusaka agreements, state administration normalization, UNITA's integration, and conflict mediation. The U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) monitored political normalization, police neutrality, security, human rights abuses, disarmament, and UNITA integration. The mission supported demobilization, social reintegration of ex-combatants, and humanitarian assistance coordination. However, the security situation deteriorated in 1998, leading to a resumption of full-scale war and the termination of the mission in February 1999. The U.N. Office in Angola (UNOA) was established to liaise with authorities and promote peace, human rights, and humanitarian assistance. Sanctions on UNITA were strengthened in 1998 to enforce compliance with peace accords, including asset freezing and bans on diamond exports. In 1998, sanctions on UNITA were strengthened to enforce peace accords, including asset freezing and bans on diamond exports. In May 1999, the U.N. Security Council created a panel to trace violations of sanctions on arms trafficking, oil supplies, and the diamond trade. Resolution 1295 (2000) tightened existing sanctions and established a monitoring mechanism. In late 2001, the U.N. initiated efforts to establish contacts with UNITA for peace negotiations. In late March 2002, the U.N. dispatched Ibrahim Gambari to Angola to monitor cease-fire negotiations with UNITA. Despite progress towards peace after Savimbi's death, the Security Council extended sanctions monitoring with Resolution 1404 due to ongoing threats to regional peace and security. The U.N. extended the mandate of the UNITA sanctions monitoring mechanism by six months and expressed concerns about humanitarian conditions in Angola. U.N. humanitarian agencies are conducting a survey in previously inaccessible areas to prioritize emergency relief delivery and determine roles in responding to humanitarian needs. Participating agencies include WFP, UNICEF, FAO, UNHCR, and UNDP. Human rights abuses in Angola are frequent, with government security forces and UNITA being responsible. Issues include social violence, gender inequality, forced labor, and restrictions on freedoms of expression and assembly. Labor unions and worker rights are constrained by the government. Moderate improvements in Angola's political environment have been noted by organizations like the U.S. State Department and the Committee to Protect Journalists. Pressure from various groups, including churches, opposition parliamentarians, and civil society organizations, is pushing the government towards increased transparency, peace negotiations, and public accountability. A petition advocating for these changes was circulated after a peace and reform conference in March 2001. The Inter-Ecclesiastical Committee for Peace in Angola (COIEPA) has actively sought civil society-based solutions to the conflict, with citizens marching for peace in Luanda and religious leaders calling for a cease-fire. Estimates of Angola's GDP vary widely, with figures ranging from $4 billion to $10.1 billion in 2000. Angola's GDP was estimated at $10.1 billion in 2000 using the purchasing power parity method. The country faced severe humanitarian conditions with 3.1 million displaced since 1998. High levels of insecurity prevented rural people from tending to food crops, leading to widespread hunger and destitution. Inflation was at 268% in December 2000, decreasing to 80.23% in the first ten months of 2001. Land mines were a significant issue, and while some areas showed improvement in socio-economic conditions, displacements continued elsewhere. The Angolan government's budget evaluations are challenging due to recent changes in the national accounts system and off-the-books spending. The World Bank authorized a $33 million credit in July 2000 for social programs and poverty reduction. Oil production, accounting for over 40% of Angola's GDP and 85% of state revenues, is crucial but not well integrated with other sectors. Exxon holds rights to a significant oil field in Block 15. Angola has large oil reserves, but extraction costs are high due to deep-water locations. In Angola, major oil companies like Chevron, TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, and BP are key investors in the country's oil fields. There are concerns about corruption in the state oil revenues, with organizations like Global Witness pushing for transparency. BP faced backlash from the Angolan government for disclosing financial terms of their agreements. Diamonds are also a significant export for Angola, although less valuable than oil. Diamonds are a key export for Angola, playing a crucial role in financing UNITA's military operations. They are primarily gem-quality and abundant in the northeast provinces. Total diamond production in 2000 was estimated at over $740 million, with significant smuggling taking place. The Angolan government has implemented a diamond marketing system to comply with U.N. Resolution 1173, aiming to prevent UNITA diamonds from entering legal export channels, cut off funding for UNITA, deter smuggling, and increase tax revenues. Most diamonds are sold through the Angola Selling Corporation, a joint venture involving the Angolan government and private investors. Despite these efforts, the U.N. Monitoring Mechanism reports that $1-1.2 million worth of diamonds are illegally exported daily, totaling $350-420 million annually. The Angolan government signed a monitoring program with the IMF to increase transparency in oil revenue and improve financial management. The program aimed to monitor the state budget, central bank, and state oil firm Sonangol, with a special focus on oil revenue through an \"Oil Diagnostic\" audit. The IMF monitoring program in Angola aimed to implement economic reforms before considering a formal loan agreement. Despite increased oil and diamond income, Angola still faced economic and social challenges, leading to the IMF withholding support for an economic program. In 2002, the Angolan government depleted its central bank deposits and lost half of its foreign exchange reserves. The IMF raised concerns about transparency in government operations, including the need to account for all expenditures, transfer all revenues to the treasury, channel foreign currency receipts through the central bank, eliminate subsidy and tax arrears, publish data on revenues and expenditures, and conduct financial audits. President Dos Santos criticized the IMF for its oversight of the Angolan economy, rejecting allegations of corruption and questioning the IMF's focus on loans backed by future oil production. He cancelled meetings with the IMF and World Bank, signaling strained relations. In 2000, a significant portion of the national budget was allocated to defense spending. Angola's national budget allocated 11% to defense, with 68% funded by oil revenues. The government aims to transition to peace, with education and health receiving 36% and 28% respectively. Control of oil and diamond wealth is concentrated within the presidency and a small elite, while the majority live in poverty. The concentration of wealth and power in Angola has led to a culture of corruption within the national leadership and society. Leaders derive wealth from oil reserves, diamonds, weapons deals, and control of state corporations. This creates a network of political clients who depend on the top leadership for jobs, income, and contracts. The presidency in Angola operates a tiered system of patronage through the Futungo de Belas, exerting political influence via the Eduardo dos Santos Foundation. Large portions of oil revenues are allegedly misappropriated by well-connected officials through off-budget transactions. Critics argue that Angola's oil economy, controlled by foreign firms and MPLA institutions, lacks transparency and accountability due to national security concerns from the war. This has led to corruption and limited local participation in the sector. The Angolan government has used oil revenue for debt repayment, military expenses, and patron-client relationships. Some funds go towards economic development and social services, with increased allocations in recent budgets. Despite accusations of corruption, the government denies wrongdoing and criticizes NGOs like Global Witness for highlighting alleged state corruption in the oil sector. The Angolan government denies allegations of corruption in oil deals with foreign firms, labeling reports by Global Witness as \"bogus research\" aimed at tarnishing its reputation. It refutes claims of corrupt weapons deals and asserts transparency measures to counter accusations. The Angolan government denies corruption allegations and emphasizes transparency measures, including external audits of key institutions and the establishment of an Audit Court. These actions demonstrate a commitment to good governance and political accountability. President Bush urged President dos Santos to achieve a cease-fire in Angola and develop the country's wealth for the benefit of its people. Dos Santos has the power to end 26 years of fighting by reaching out to all Angolans willing to lay down their arms. The United States has actively supported efforts to implement the Lusaka Protocol in Angola and provided significant humanitarian assistance. U.S. policy towards Angola has supported the government, condemned UNITA's war effort, and backed political and economic reform. The new U.S. Ambassador vowed to work with government, churches, and civil organizations to build a strong democracy. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary William Bellamy met with Angolan officials and civil society to strengthen bilateral relations and assess political and economic reforms. In late April 2001, President Bush urged Angola to implement transparent governance. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Walter Kansteiner emphasized the need for increased transparency in Angola's economic policies. Kansteiner highlighted the importance of putting all revenue on budget to avoid losing a significant portion of income. Congressional attention has focused on monitoring developments in Angola. Congressional attention has long focused on conflict resolution and humanitarian conditions in Angola. In recent years, the issue of conflict diamonds has drawn particular attention, with legislative proposals aimed at ending the trade in diamonds that fund conflict. Rep. Alcee Hastings introduced a resolution condemning the assassination of Congolese President Laurent Kabila and urging Angola to support peace and stability in the region. In the 106th Congress, Rep. Maxine Waters introduced H.Res. 390 calling for efforts to end the Angolan conflict and provide humanitarian assistance. The State Department supports a structured relationship with Angola involving U.S. investment in the oil industry, access to oil exports, and conflict resolution. Angola supplies 3.5% to 5% of U.S. oil, with Ex-Im Bank exposure totaling over $141 million in FY 2001. The Ex-Im Bank provided over $141 million in FY 2001, supporting projects in Angola. The U.S. also backed projects through OPIC and the World Bank. U.S. officials endorse U.S.-Africa business forums like the Corporate Council on Africa and the U.S.-Angolan Chamber of Commerce, which promotes bilateral trade and investment. The Chamber, established in 1990, organizes trade missions, represents private sector interests, and fosters economic development in Angola. President dos Santos highlighted the role of U.S. private sector investment in Angola's economic growth during his U.S. visit in February 2002. He commended U.S. government efforts to end the Angolan war and emphasized Angola's position as a significant oil supplier to the United States. He also mentioned U.S. investment in Angola's non-oil industries and predicted increased investment opportunities post-war. The U.S. Angola policy has focused on maintaining strong bilateral business ties, which some critics argue has hindered advocacy for governmental and economic reforms and equitable distribution of national resources. However, U.S. policymakers argue that they have pushed for reform through initiatives like the IMF Oil Diagnostic and have provided emergency assistance to Angola. USAID assistance in Angola includes support for health, agriculture, and education sectors. USAID supports health, agriculture, and education sectors in Angola, including immunization, malaria and HIV/AIDS prevention, maternal and child health, clean water access, civil society strengthening, private sector growth, smallholder agriculture, land tenure reform, land mine removal, and military education and training. Totaling $9.34 million from FY 1997 through FY 2001."
