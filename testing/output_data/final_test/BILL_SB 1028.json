    "title": "SB 1028",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Chapter 6 of Division 4.1 of the Public Utilities Code introduces wildfire mitigation measures for electrical cooperatives. The commission will oversee compliance with these requirements, ensuring that electrical corporations minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfires from their equipment and lines. Each electrical corporation must submit an annual wildfire mitigation plan to the commission, detailing responsibilities, objectives, preventive strategies, performance metrics, and monitoring procedures. The commission oversees the implementation of wildfire mitigation plans, identifies and corrects deficiencies, monitors electrical line inspections, and may request additional information. They review and comment on the plans before the compliance period, allow for plan amendments, and conduct audits to ensure compliance. The commission may contract with a third party to evaluate wildfire mitigation plans and conduct audits. Electrical corporations may be required to reimburse related expenses. Local publicly owned electric utilities and electrical cooperatives must minimize wildfire risk posed by their lines and equipment. The governing board of local electric utilities must assess wildfire risk in consultation with fire departments based on historical data and local conditions. The local publicly owned electric utility or electrical cooperative must present wildfire mitigation measures to the governing board for approval to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfires caused by their electrical lines and equipment. A fire prevention plan approved by a federal agency may meet the requirements for areas covered by the plan. No reimbursement is required by this act as local agencies or school districts have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated programs or services. This act may incur costs for local agencies due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
