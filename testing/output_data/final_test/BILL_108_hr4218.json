Title I of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to focus on high-performance computing research and development, updating definitions and program components. The President shall implement a High-Performance Computing Research and Development Program to conduct basic and applied research, advance computing technologies, and provide access to advanced computing systems for the research community in the United States. The High-Performance Computing Research and Development Program aims to provide technical support for users, increase software capabilities, enable high-performance networks for advanced applications, conduct computational science research, and support high-performance computing systems for addressing Grand Challenges. The High-Performance Computing Research and Development Program aims to support software capabilities, educate students in various fields, and enhance the security of computing and networking systems, including Federal systems. The High-Performance Computing Research and Development Program aims to establish goals, priorities, Program Component Areas, and Grand Challenges for Federal high-performance computing research, development, networking, and other activities. The Program aims to address Grand Challenges by coordinating Federal high-performance computing research, development, and networking activities. It also involves developing a roadmap for high-performance computing systems. The Program aims to address Grand Challenges by coordinating Federal high-performance computing research, development, and networking activities. It involves developing a roadmap for high-performance computing systems. The current chunk discusses providing a detailed description of Program Component Areas, including any changes and reasons for such changes, as well as describing Grand Challenges supported under the Program. The current chunk revises subparagraphs in the Program, including adding details for each Program Component Area and incorporating advisory recommendations. The advisory committee recommendations for the Program are incorporated into the revisions of the Program Component Areas. The advisory committee is tasked with evaluating the funding, management, coordination, implementation, and activities of the Program, reporting to specific committees every two fiscal years. The first report is due within one year of enactment. The advisory committee evaluates the Program's funding, management, and activities, reporting every two fiscal years. Changes include modifying subsections and removing sections 102 and 103. SEC. 4. AGENCY ACTIVITIES. Title II of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 is amended to specify the responsibilities of the National Science Foundation in supporting research and development for high-performance computing and networking systems in the United States. This includes providing infrastructure support, advanced computing systems, software, and applications to the research community. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is responsible for conducting basic and applied research in high-performance computing and networking. This includes emphasis on computational fluid dynamics, scientific data dissemination, remote exploration, and experimentation. The Secretary of Energy is responsible for conducting basic and applied research in high-performance computing and networking to support energy applications. This includes providing advanced computing systems for solving scientific and engineering problems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for conducting research in high-performance computing and networking to support energy applications. This includes developing benchmark tests and standards for computing systems and software. The National Institute of Standards and Technology conducts research on high-performance computing and networking systems, develops standards for interoperability, and collaborates with industry to implement high-performance computing applications. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration focuses on research in high-performance computing applications, with an emphasis on science and engineering problems relevant to industry. The Environmental Protection Agency conducts research on high-performance computing systems to improve weather forecasting, climate prediction, and environmental information collection. They also focus on developing accurate models of the ocean-atmosphere system and decision support tools for pollutant transport and its effects on humans and ecosystems. The Environmental Protection Agency conducts research to improve weather forecasting, climate prediction, and environmental information collection. They focus on developing accurate models of the ocean-atmosphere system, decision support tools for pollutant transport, and understanding atmospheric dynamics and chemistry. The National Science Foundation supports research on the societal implications of information technology, including computers mimicking human abilities. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include the Department of Energy in addition to NASA. Changes include adjusting numerical values in subsections and adding the Secretary of Energy in subsection (b)(3). The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include the Department of Energy, with changes in numerical values and the addition of the Secretary of Energy in subsection (b)(3). The amendments made by subsection (a) will take effect on March 15, 2005. SEC. 7. Removal of sunset provision from Savings in Construction Act of 1996. Section 14(e) of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 is repealed. Passed the House of Representatives on July 7, 2004."
