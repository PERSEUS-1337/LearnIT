    "content": "On September 5, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the rescission of DACA, an Obama Administration initiative providing temporary relief for individuals brought to the US as children without lawful immigration status. The Department of Homeland Security released a memorandum stating a wind-down of DACA, with certain requests accepted until September 5, 2017. The DACA initiative, announced in 2012, allows for initial and renewal requests accepted by DHS by specific dates. DHS will not terminate previously issued grants of deferred action or employment authorization solely based on the new memorandum. Eligibility criteria include being under age 16 at the time of entry. The DACA initiative, announced in 2012, allows for initial and renewal requests accepted by DHS by specific dates. Eligibility criteria include being under age 16 at the time of entry into the United States; under age 31 on June 15, 2012; continuous residence in the United States for at least five years before June 15, 2012; physical presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making the request for consideration of deferred action; not in lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012; not convicted of certain crimes; and meeting educational or military requirements. To apply for DACA, individuals must submit Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS to USCIS along with evidence of meeting eligibility requirements. The total fees were $495, with limited exemptions available. Biographic and biometric information is checked against federal databases. The DACA policy allows for information provided in a request to not be shared with other law enforcement agencies unless there is a national security risk. USCIS stopped accepting initial DACA requests in September 2017, but will still process those accepted by that date. Deferred action recipients may receive work authorization. USCIS no longer approves advance parole requests for DACA recipients, but will generally honor previously approved applications. DACA recipients are not granted lawful immigration status and are ineligible for federal public benefits. During deferred action, DACA recipients are authorized to stay in the US by DHS. DHS can terminate or deny deferred action at any time. To be eligible, recipients must not have left the US without advance parole since August 15, 2012, have continuously resided in the US, and have no felony convictions or significant misdemeanors. To renew deferred action under DACA, eligible recipients must submit three forms to DHS/USCIS by October 5, 2017. No need to resubmit previous documents, but new documents related to removal proceedings or criminal history are required. USCIS may request additional documentation if necessary. The total fee is $495, including a $410 filing fee for Form I-765. The decision on renewing DACA is discretionary, with a total fee of $495. An individual granted deferred action does not receive lawful immigration status. As of March 31, 2017, over 787,580 initial DACA requests and 799,077 renewal requests were approved. Approximately 92% of initial DACA requests were approved. During the 113th Congress, the House of Representatives passed a bill (H.R. 5272) to prohibit federal funds for processing DACA applications. No legislation on DACA has been enacted, but several bills in the 115th Congress aim to provide different forms of immigration protection. Several bills in the 115th Congress aim to provide immigration protection for unauthorized childhood arrivals, including temporary protection from removal and pathways to lawful permanent residency. Legislation known as the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act was introduced in past Congresses to establish a process for unauthorized individuals who entered the US as children to obtain LPR status. DREAM Act provisions were part of larger immigration reform bills and some measures have seen legislative action, such as in the 111th Congress and the 113th Congress."
