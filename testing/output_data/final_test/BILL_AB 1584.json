    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12201 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to adjust payment schedules annually based on changes in the cost of living, effective January 1 of each year. The cost-of-living adjustment is based on the California Necessities Index, which includes food, clothing, fuel, utilities, rent, and transportation for low-income consumers. The annual adjustments are computed using base period expenditure amounts. Based on the California Necessities Index, the cost-of-living adjustment for low-income consumers includes food, clothing, fuel, utilities, rent, and transportation. The total monthly expenses amount to $10,602, with breakdowns as follows: Food $3,027, Clothing $406, Fuel and utilities $529, Rent $4,883, and Transportation $1,757. Based on the appropriate components of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, the percentage change is determined for the 12-month period ending 12 months prior to the January cost-of-living adjustment. Geographic areas considered include Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and other areas within the state with valid statistical information. The Department of Industrial Relations calculates weighted percentage changes for expenditure categories using CCPI factors. Category adjustment factors are determined by adding 100 to the weighted percentage change and dividing by 100. Expenditure amounts for the current year are calculated by multiplying prior year amounts by the category adjustment factor. The overall adjustment factor is determined by dividing current year expenditure sums by prior year sums. The overall adjustment factor calculated from prior year expenditure amounts is multiplied by payment schedules from Section 12200 for the new year. The resulting amounts become the new schedules for various categories under Section 12200 and are filed with the Secretary of State. Annual adjustments are made for specific subdivisions based on the new payment schedules. The department adjusts aid amounts to meet minimum levels required by the Social Security Act for Title XIX eligibility. No adjustments for cost of living in specified calendar years. Cost-of-living adjustments do not include years with suspensions. Adjustment for 2003 calendar year effective June 1, 2003. For the 2005 calendar year, the adjustment required by this section will be effective on April 1, 2005. From 2011 to 2017, no adjustments will be made unless specified by statute. Federal benefits pass along under Section 12201.05 will be effective on January 1 of each calendar year."
