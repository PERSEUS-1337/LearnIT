    "title": "SB 676",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 502.01 of the Penal Code is amended to define terms used in the section. \"Property subject to forfeiture includes illegal telecommunications equipment or computers used in committing specified violations under the Penal Code.\" Forfeiture is not applicable to property used solely in an infraction. If the defendant is a minor, it also includes property of the parent or guardian. The sentencing court conducts a hearing to determine property forfeiture upon petition by the prosecuting attorney. The burden of proof lies with the prosecuting attorney to establish property subject to forfeiture. The prosecuting attorney may retain seized property subject to forfeiture until the sentencing hearing. Prior to a forfeiture proceeding, the seizing law enforcement agency must investigate any other person with an interest in the property. Notice of the hearing to determine forfeiture must be sent to those with an interest in the property. Any person claiming an interest must file a motion for redemption at least 10 days before the hearing. If a motion to redeem an interest has been filed, the sentencing court will hold a hearing to identify valid interests in the property. No valid interest will be recognized if the prosecuting agency proves that the person knew the property was being used unlawfully and did not take steps to prevent it. If a security interest is involved, the person must have known or should have known at the time it was created that the property would be used for a violation. If a person holds a valid interest in the property, the court will determine the value of the property and each valid interest. If the property's value exceeds the interest's value, the interest holder can own the property by paying the court the difference. If the holder of the interest refuses to pay the determined amount, the court can order the property to be sold by a designated agency. The agency will seize and sell the property, paying the owner of the interest the proceeds. If the property's value is less than the interest's value, the agency will still sell the property and pay the owner. If the defendant was a minor, this applies to property owned by the parent or guardian. The prosecuting agency must notify the parent or guardian of a forfeiture hearing at least 30 days in advance. If the parent or guardian files a statement with the court 10 days before the hearing, stating that the minor will not have access to any computer or telecommunications device owned by them for two years after the minor is sentenced, then the device will not be subject to forfeiture. If a minor is convicted of certain offenses involving a computer or telecommunications device owned by their parent or guardian within two years of sentencing, the property can be subject to forfeiture. If a minor's parent or guardian makes full restitution to the victim of a crime, forfeiture provisions may not apply to the property in the family's primary residence. The court has discretion to deny forfeiture if the convicted defendant is not likely to use the property for future illegal acts. Distribution of forfeited property is determined based on the defendant's valid interest. The court may distribute forfeited property to the victim for restitution or to various agencies or entities, including the prosecuting agency, public entities involved in the investigation, and nonprofit organizations. The victim is not penalized for choosing not to accept the forfeited property as restitution. The court may distribute forfeited property to various agencies, including nonprofit organizations. If the property is sold, the proceeds will be distributed to the purchaser or encumbrancer first, with the balance retained by the court. Additionally, matter obtained in violation of the law can be subject to forfeiture. An action to forfeit property obtained unlawfully can be initiated by the Attorney General, district attorney, county counsel, or city attorney through a petition filed in the superior court of the county where the property is located. The prosecuting agency must serve a notice on individuals with a property interest in alleged proceeds, allowing them to file a claim in court within a specified time frame. If personal delivery is not possible, the notice must be published in a local newspaper for three weeks. Any person with an interest in the seized property or proceeds has 30 days to file a claim in court. Failure to do so will result in forfeiture upon proof of compliance. The burden of proof lies with the petitioner to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the property is subject to forfeiture. It is not necessary to obtain a criminal conviction before ordering the destruction of matter described in subdivision (a). Any matter in possession of city, county, or state officials, including found or disposed property, may be destroyed. A court order for destruction can be carried out by police, sheriff's department, or the Department of Justice as specified in the order. Prior to granting an order for destruction of matter, the court may require the petitioner to show that the petition covers only necessary property. It is a defense in forfeiture proceedings that seized matter was lawfully possessed for scientific or educational purposes."
