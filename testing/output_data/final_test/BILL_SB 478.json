    "title": "SB 478",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 11166.02 of the Penal Code allows county welfare agencies to create a pilot program for Internet-based reporting of child abuse and neglect by mandated reporters, under certain conditions. The agency provides an Internet form with standardized safety assessment questions for mandated reporters to submit reports. The system ensures confidentiality and can only be accessed by mandated reporters. The system for reporting abuse or neglect can only be used by mandated reporters, including peace officers, probation officers, school personnel, healthcare professionals, and coroners. Current statutory requirements for timely review and response to reports remain unchanged. In counties with the pilot program, mandated reporters can use an Internet-based reporting tool instead of making a required initial telephone report. They must cooperate with the agency for additional information if needed. Mandated reporters using the online tool do not have to submit a written follow-up report. Section 10612.5 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code to establish a pilot program in up to 10 counties. The department will consult with relevant agencies and oversee the program through written directives exempt from the rulemaking provisions. A county participating in the pilot program must hire an evaluator to monitor implementation as directed by the department. The county, in collaboration with relevant associations, must develop outcome measures to assess program effectiveness, including tracking telephone and internet-based reports and changes in emergency and nonemergency reports. The pilot program requires counties to track changes in emergency and nonemergency reports and provide data to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Human Services by January 1, 2020. The program may be terminated before January 1, 2021, if it compromises child safety. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2021, unless extended by a later statute."
