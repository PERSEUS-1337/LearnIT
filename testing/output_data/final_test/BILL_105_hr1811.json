    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Columbia River Habitat Protection and Recreational Access Act of 1997\". The Congress finds that the Hanford Reach on the Columbia River is vital for fall Chinook salmon, wildlife habitat, waterfowl sanctuary, and recreational opportunities. Activities along the Hanford Reach are prohibited to preserve its environmental benefits. Proper management of the surrounding lands is necessary to protect resources and maintain public access. The Vernita Bar Agreement has enhanced salmon habitat along the Hanford Reach, preserving its riparian character. Efforts are being made to better integrate management laws and regulations for more efficient use of resources and improved habitat and recreation management. The Wahluke Slope area near the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River has been deemed environmentally sound for conveyance. Federal, State, and local partnerships are proposed for habitat and wildlife management, recreational opportunities, and land use planning in Benton, Franklin, Grant, and Adams Counties. A cooperative partnership is recommended between the State of Washington, the United States, and local entities to protect the natural resources surrounding the Hanford Reach. A commission should be formed to ensure public input and long-term protection of the river for the citizens of Benton, Franklin, Grant, and Adams Counties. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, \"Hanford Works\" is the property represented as \"Department of Energy\" on a map of Priest Rapids, Washington, and \"Commission\" refers to the Hanford Reach Protection and Management Commission. SEC. 4. GENERAL AUTHORITY; PROPERTY DESCRIPTIONS. The Secretary will convey properties to governmental entities in Washington, including the Hanford Works along the Columbia River.

The Hanford Reach Protection and Management Commission will develop a plan to manage lands for resource protection and enhancement. The Commission will hold meetings to establish rules and provisions governing its administration and finances. The first meeting must be held within a year of the Commission's establishment.

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service provides technical and financial assistance to county governments for managing lands transferred under the Act. Adams County, Grant County, and Franklin County must submit a report including a risk analysis of debris slides and a land use plan for the Wahluke Slope before properties are conveyed."
