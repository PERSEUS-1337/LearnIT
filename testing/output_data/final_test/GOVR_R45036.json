    "content": "The concept of \"Too big to fail\" (TBTF) refers to financial firms whose disorderly failure could cause widespread disruptions in financial markets, leading to devastating economic and societal outcomes. These firms pose systemic risk to the financial system. The near-collapse of several large financial firms in 2008 highlighted the TBTF issue. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) intervened to prevent the failures of Wachovia and Washington Mutual by arranging acquisitions without government financial assistance. Citigroup and Bank of America received additional support through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) offered preferred shares and government guarantees to firms deemed \"systemically important\" during the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, aimed to end \"too big to fail\" and promote financial stability. This report focuses on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's role in addressing the TBTF problem. The report focuses on the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential regulation for banks with over $50 billion in assets. Proposed legislation in the 115th Congress includes the Financial CHOICE Act offering an \"off ramp\" from regulation with a 10% leverage ratio, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act replacing the threshold with a case-by-case process, and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act automatically subjecting banks to regulation. The Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act would subject banks with over $250 billion in assets and G-SIBs to enhanced regulation. Banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets would still undergo stress tests, with the Fed having discretion for additional regulations. Banks with $50 billion to $100 billion in assets would no longer be subject to enhanced regulation, except for the risk committee requirement. The report discusses the advantages and disadvantages of enhanced prudential regulation and considers whether banks with over $50 billion in assets are systemically important. The report focuses on proposals to modify the current regime, particularly the $50 billion threshold for enhanced regulation of banks. It discusses the Dodd-Frank Act's Title I, which applies enhanced prudential regulatory standards to bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets and nonbank financial firms designated as systemically important by the FSOC. The report does not analyze alternative policies to address the \"Too Big to Fail\" issue. The Federal Reserve can customize prudential standards based on risk factors. Regulation applies to US bank holding companies with over $50 billion in assets. Bank holding companies can operate subsidiaries in various financial sectors. All parts of a bank holding company are subject to the regime's requirements. Some large investment banks became bank holding companies in 2008. Under Title I's \"Hotel California\" provision, investment banks or other BHCs with more than $50 billion in assets cannot escape enhanced regulation by debanking. The enhanced prudential regime also applies to foreign banking organizations with more than $50 billion in global assets operating in the United States, with lower requirements for those with less than $50 billion in U.S. nonbranch assets. Foreign banks with more than $50 billion in U.S. nonbranch assets must form intermediate holding companies for their U.S. operations. Intermediate holding companies for foreign banks with more than $50 billion in U.S. assets are subject to the same capital requirements as U.S. banks. They must comply with specific regulations such as the emergency debt-to-equity ratio and risk committee requirements. The report refers to these banks as those with more than $50 billion in assets. There is no official list of banks subject to enhanced regulation. In 2017, 27 BHCs and 12 intermediate holding companies of foreign banks were subject to Title I Federal Reserve stress tests due to having over $50 billion in U.S. assets. Around 130 banks submitted resolution plans under Title I as they have more than $50 billion in worldwide assets and operate in the U.S. There are other large financial firms in the U.S. not automatically subject to enhanced regulation, including thrift holding companies (THCs). Thrift holding companies (THCs) with over $50 billion in assets are not currently subject to enhanced prudential regulatory requirements, but the Fed may apply additional standards in the future. Official data shows six THCs in this category, mainly insurance or investment firms. Other nonbank financial entities with over $50 billion are also not automatically regulated. Nonbank financial firms with assets over $50 billion are not automatically subject to enhanced regulation, but the FSOC can designate them as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Designated SIFIs are subject to the Fed's enhanced prudential regulation. FSOC has designated insurers like AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial, as well as GE Capital, as SIFIs, but some designations have been invalidated or rescinded. Rules for nonbank SIFIs have not been fully implemented, so this report focuses on banks rather than nonbank SIFIs. The Dodd-Frank Act created specific prudential requirements for large banks, while nonbank financial firms with assets over $50 billion may be designated as SIFIs by the FSOC. These firms include broker-dealers, insurance underwriters, specialty lenders, asset managers, investment companies, and financial technology companies. Only one credit union, Navy Federal Credit Union, has assets over $50 billion. Bank holding companies are subject to long-standing prudential regulation by the Fed. Many investment companies manage over $50 billion in assets on behalf of customers. The Dodd-Frank Act established enhanced prudential requirements for large banks with over $50 billion in assets. These regulations, overseen by the Fed, aim to ensure the safety and soundness of these institutions. The Fed finances the administration of these regulations through assessments on the firms subject to the regime. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes requirements on banks with over $50 billion in assets, including stress tests and capital planning. Stress tests project potential losses in a crisis to determine solvency. These regulations aim to ensure the safety of large financial institutions. The stress tests under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act focus on specific adverse scenarios to ensure banks remain solvent during a crisis. Capital requirements are designed to back assets and prevent insolvency, with enhanced requirements for banks over $50 billion in assets. Basel III revamped overall capital requirements post-financial crisis, with stricter rules for the largest banks. Enhanced capital requirements for banks with over $50 billion in assets were implemented through capital planning tied to stress test results. Banks must submit annual capital plans to the Fed under CCAR, detailing expected capital uses and sources, compliance with stress test requirements, and potential capital distributions. Rejection of a bank's capital plan by the Fed results in a prohibition on capital distributions. The Fed requires banks with over $50 billion in assets to submit annual capital plans under CCAR. If a bank's plan is rejected, they cannot make capital distributions until a revised plan is approved. The Fed removed qualitative requirements for smaller banks in 2017. Title I mandates banks to submit resolution plans to explain how they can be safely wound down in case of failure. The final rule implemented in 2011 requires banks to submit resolution plans explaining how they can be safely wound down in case of failure, including details on ownership, structure, assets, and obligations. Regulators highlighted that these plans help understand firms' complexity and resolution strategies, including cross-border issues for international banks. The plans must also explain how the firm could be resolved without disrupting financial stability under the bankruptcy code. The resolution plans required by the final rule implemented in 2011 must explain how a firm can be safely wound down in case of failure without disrupting financial stability under the bankruptcy code. Plans include details on core business lines, funding, critical operations, legal entities, and jurisdictions. The plans are divided into public and private parts, with some being tens of thousands of pages long. Regulators require banks with over $100 billion in assets to submit detailed resolution plans. Foreign banks with less than $50 billion in U.S. assets have reduced requirements. Incomplete or deficient plans may lead to regulatory actions such as increased capital requirements or restrictions on growth. Wells Fargo was the first bank sanctioned for failing to submit an adequate plan. Bank liquidity is crucial for meeting cash flow needs. Bank liquidity is essential for meeting cash flow needs and involves a bank's ability to convert assets into cash. There is a liquidity mismatch between illiquid loans and deposits that can be withdrawn on demand, making banks vulnerable to liquidity crises. Title I imposes stricter liquidity requirements on banks with over $50 billion in assets, enforced through firm-run liquidity stress tests, Fed-run liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), and proposed net stable funding ratio (NSFR) rules. These rules apply to banks with varying asset sizes, with more stringent versions for those with at least $250 billion in assets. The final rule implementing firm-run liquidity stress tests for banks with over $50 billion in assets was issued in 2014, with requirements for monthly internal liquidity stress tests and maintaining a buffer of high-quality liquid assets. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) rule was also issued in 2014, coming into effect in 2015 and fully phased in later. Regulators plan to extend the LCR and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) rules to large foreign banks operating in the United States. The LCR, implemented in 2015 and fully phased in by 2017, requires banks to hold high-quality liquid assets to match cash outflows in a market stress scenario. Assets must be low risk, liquid during a crisis, actively traded, stable in price, easily valued, and accepted by the Fed as collateral. Different assets have varying liquidity levels, with eligible assets categorized into three groups based on liquidity. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is set to be implemented in 2018, requiring banks to have stable funding backing their assets over a one-year horizon. Different types of funding and assets receive varying weights based on their stability and liquidity under stressed scenarios. Assets not meeting High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) criteria under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) require the most stable funding backing under the NSFR. Long-term equity receives the highest credit, insured retail deposits receive medium credit, while other deposits and long-term borrowing receive less credit. Title I requires banks with more than $50 billion in assets to limit their exposure to unaffiliated counterparties on an individual counterparty basis and to periodically report on their credit exposures to counterparties. The Federal Reserve proposed rules in 2011 and 2016 to implement a single counterparty credit limit (SCCL), but the counterparty exposure reporting requirements have not been reproposed. Systemic risk associated with Too Big to Fail (TBTF) firms includes \"spillover effects\" where a large firm's failure can cause losses to its counterparties, potentially threatening financial stability. Borrowing from certain sources like other financial institutions and derivatives cannot be used to meet the rule. The SCCL was proposed in 2011 and 2016 to limit counterparty exposure for banks with assets over $50 billion. The 2016 proposal tailored the SCCL to be more stringent as asset size increases. Banks with assets between $50 billion and $250 billion would have a 25% limit on net counterparty credit exposure. Larger banks would have even stricter limits based on systemic importance. The 2011 proposal required banks to report on their credit exposures to significant counterparties to help regulators understand spillover effects. The proposed SCCL rule aims to limit counterparty exposure for banks with assets over $50 billion. It requires banks to report on credit exposures to significant counterparties to help regulators understand spillover effects. Title I mandates publicly traded banks with at least $10 billion in assets to form risk committees on their boards of directors, overseen by a risk management expert. The Fed issued a final rule in 2014, effective in 2015 for domestic banks and 2016 for foreign banks, requiring banks with over $10 billion in assets to form a risk committee led by an independent director. Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates banks with assets over $10 billion to establish a risk committee led by an independent director. Banks with assets over $50 billion must appoint a chief risk officer for risk management. The Act grants powers to FSOC, the Fed, or the FDIC to address financial stability threats from banks with assets over $50 billion. These powers do not require ongoing compliance but are activated when a threat arises. The powers extend regulatory authority over nonbank SIFIs, expanding oversight over banks with assets over $50 billion. FSOC may require certified reports from banks with over $50 billion in assets to assess financial stability threats. If a firm is deemed a grave threat, the Fed can impose restrictions on mergers, products, and activities, or require divestment of assets. So far, no bank has been identified as posing a grave threat. Title I of the FSOC requires banks with over $50 billion in assets to notify the Fed of nonbank acquisitions exceeding $10 billion in assets and 5% of voting shares. It also sets a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio limit for these banks, implemented in 2014 for domestic banks and 2016 for foreign banks. This ratio is enforced if a bank is warned by FSOC of posing a \"grave threat\" to the financial system. The FSOC requires banks with over $50 billion in assets to notify the Fed of nonbank acquisitions exceeding $10 billion in assets and 5% of voting shares. It also enforces a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio limit for these banks if they are warned of posing a \"grave threat\" to the financial system. Early remediation requirements aim to address financial problems at banks early to prevent more serious issues. This provision has not been triggered yet, and no bank has been identified as posing a grave threat by FSOC. The FDIC's examination and enforcement powers are expanded under Title I, allowing them to examine banks with over $50 billion in assets and enforce regulations on those posing a risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. U.S. regulators have described the current bank regulatory regime as tiered, with increasingly stringent requirements applied based on a bank's metrics. The Fed issued a proposed rule in 2011 to implement stricter measures under early remediation as a firm's financial condition deteriorates, but it has not been finalized yet. The bank regulatory regime is tiered, with stricter requirements applied as a bank's size increases. Different thresholds, such as $1 billion, $10 billion, \"advanced approaches\" banks, and \"global systemically important banks\" (G-SIBs), trigger enhanced regulations. Basel III reformed bank regulation post-financial crisis, with one tier applying to banks with $250 billion or more in assets. The Basel III \"advanced approaches\" rule applies to banks with $250 billion or more in assets or $10 billion or more in foreign exposure. The Financial Stability Board designates G-SIBs based on cross-jurisdictional activity, size, interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity. Currently, 30 banks are designated as G-SIBs, with 8 headquartered in the United States. U.S. bank regulators have incorporated these definitions into U.S. regulation for applying regulations like the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR). The Basel III rule requires G-SIBs to hold more capital, with a 5% SLR at the holding company level and a 6% SLR at the depository subsidiary level by 2018. G-SIBs also face a capital surcharge of at least 1% to reflect their higher risk to the financial system, phased in starting in 2016. The Federal Reserve may designate more firms as G-SIBs and increase the capital surcharge to 4.5%. Most G-SIBs would face a higher capital surcharge than required by Basel III. A final rule was issued for a countercyclical capital buffer under Basel III, requiring advanced approaches banks to hold more capital during high-risk financial conditions. The buffer is currently at zero but can be adjusted over the business cycle. The likelihood of raising it above zero and the circumstances triggering an increase are uncertain. The Fed implemented a TLAC requirement for G-SIBs to prevent taxpayer bailouts, effective from 2019. G-SIBs must hold capital and long-term debt at the holding company level for loss absorption. Title I requirements were tailored for banks with over $50 billion in assets, with more stringent regulations for advanced approaches banks or G-SIBs. Advanced approaches banks face stricter versions of LCR, NSFR, and SCCL compared to banks with over $50 billion in assets. The SCCL proposed includes a stringent requirement for G-SIBs only, determining how largest banks fund their activities daily. These requirements have a significant ongoing impact on banks' cost of providing credit and services compared to fixed compliance costs of Title I provisions. Size thresholds are used in various regulations, such as Dodd-Frank Act requirements applied to banks with over $10 billion in assets instead of $50 billion. The Durbin Amendment and CFPB supervision apply to banks with over $10 billion in assets. The Volcker Rule has compliance standards for firms with over $10 billion and $50 billion in assets. Executive compensation rules under the Dodd-Frank Act apply to firms with over $1 billion in assets, with stricter requirements for those with over $50 billion and $250 billion. Government assistance prevented the failure of large firms like Bear Stearns and AIG during the financial crisis due to the belief that they were \"too big to fail.\" According to theory, expectations that a firm will not fail create moral hazard, as creditors and counterparties of TBTF firms believe the government will protect them from losses, leading to less monitoring of riskiness. This could give TBTF firms a funding advantage, seen as an implicit subsidy. Enhanced regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act aims to prevent risks to financial stability from large financial institutions, focusing on macroprudential aspects. Enhanced regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act aims to address systemic risk posed by large institutions, as breaking up or eliminating TBTF firms is deemed infeasible. The rationale for enhanced prudential regulation is based on the economic incentives for firms to grow larger, leading to dominance in certain financial segments. This approach is not mutually exclusive with other policy measures to eliminate TBTF, but combining approaches may reduce effectiveness. Enhanced regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act aims to address systemic risk posed by large institutions by preventing them from taking excessive risks. Breaking up or eliminating TBTF firms is considered impractical, so enhanced regulation is seen as the most viable option. This approach acknowledges that failures in the financial system are inevitable, but aims to prevent large failures and market disruptions by reducing moral hazard among large banks. Critics are skeptical of enhanced prudential regulation's ability to increase systemic stability and eliminate the TBTF problem. They argue that large banks have not decreased in size since the Dodd-Frank Act, indicating TBTF has not been solved. Some critics believe more regulation may hinder market discipline, but enhanced regulation only slightly increases oversight of large banks. Critics question the effectiveness of regulating large banks, suggesting that current regulations may inadvertently increase systemic risk. They argue that regulators have not been able to prevent excessive risk-taking by large banks in the past, and fear that the enhanced regulatory regime may be vulnerable to future financial crises. Some critics fear that the enhanced regulatory regime for large banks is vulnerable to \"regulatory capture,\" where regulated entities influence regulators to undermine regulation goals. Large banks are seen as \"too complex to regulate,\" with over 1,000 subsidiaries each for the six largest BHCs in 2012. Enhanced regulation aims to help regulators better understand risks through tools like living wills. Enhanced regulation aims to help regulators understand risks posed by institutions and characteristics that could make certain banks systemically important. If systemic risk is caused mainly by activities, not large firms, then prudential regulation could be applied to all firms operating in a given activity or area. Arguments for and against these policy options do not apply only to their application to large banks. Enhanced regulation aims to mitigate systemic risk by targeting specific components such as stress tests, living wills, counterparty credit limits, and liquidity requirements. The effectiveness of these measures and their cost-benefit analysis are contentious issues. Quantifying the benefits of systemic risk provisions is challenging due to the complexity of the financial system. The benefits of systemic risk provisions are difficult to quantify due to the low probability of another financial crisis and the interdependence of various policies. Enhanced prudential requirements from Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III impose costs on large banks, but the extent to which these costs are passed on to customers depends on economic factors like market competition. The overall effects are more relevant than the costs to large banks. From an economic perspective, the cost to large banks is less relevant than the overall effects on credit costs and availability. Enhanced regulation may lead to higher credit costs for some banks, but lower capital costs for other firms. This could result in financial intermediation shifting from large banks to unregulated firms, potentially reducing overall systemic risk. The possibility of Too Big To Fail banks creating market distortions adds complexity, as regulatory costs may actually increase efficiency by addressing moral hazard. Enhanced regulation may reduce the Too Big To Fail subsidy by mitigating large banks' lack of prudence, potentially increasing efficiency from a societal perspective. There are concerns about the costs and benefits of enhanced regulation, as well as potential overlaps in provisions that could raise costs. For example, capital planning requirements and multiple liquidity requirements for banks with over $50 billion in assets could add unnecessary costs. Banks with over $50 billion in assets must prepare living wills, credit exposure reports, and undergo stress tests. Enhanced prudential regulation is primarily based on systemic importance. Critics question if all regulated banks are truly systemically important, distinguishing between regional and Wall Street banks. Identifying systemically important banks is challenging. Systemically important banks are difficult to definitively identify due to various potential causes and mechanisms that could disrupt the financial system. Size plays a significant role, as larger banks with more liabilities could cause greater losses in the event of default. Forced deleveraging by a large bank could lead to decreased asset prices and trigger fire sales, spreading systemic risk throughout the financial system. Variations in bank characteristics make it challenging to clearly determine systemically important banks. There is substantial variation in bank characteristics above the $50 billion threshold, with no clear cutoff point for systemic importance. Size is a key factor, but there are no natural breaking points that distinguish one group of banks from another. Regulators use methodologies to measure systemic importance, beyond just size. The \"method 1 systemic score\" is used to designate G-SIBs based on 12 indicators across five categories: interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity. Interconnectedness is measured by intra-financial system assets and liabilities, substitutability by assets under custody, payments activity, and underwriting. Complexity considers the diversity of banks' business models. Complexity in banks' business models can affect their risk levels and potential impact on the financial system. Large bank organizations engage in various activities like securities trading, insurance, and custodial services, which may not be systemically risky but warrant regulatory scrutiny. The \"method 1 systemic score\" assesses complexity through indicators like OTC derivatives. The \"method 1 systemic score\" measures complexity in banks' business models using indicators like OTC derivatives and cross-jurisdictional activity. A score above 130 indicates global systemic importance, but may not align with domestic systemic importance for banks. Examining U.S. banks with over $50 billion in assets shows a wide range of systemic scores. Eight banks exceed the 130 threshold, while half have scores below 15, including those with less than $100 billion in assets. Size alone may not correlate well with systemic importance, suggesting the $50 billion threshold may be too low. Some banks with low aggregate scores have individual indicators that are significantly higher than the median value for their group. 18 banks have multiple indicators three times higher than the median, and 4 banks have one indicator three times higher. Two of these banks have less than $100 billion in total assets. If G-SIB indicators accurately reflect systemic risk, it is unlikely that the 12 banks with values below three are significant. The 12 banks with values below three times the median for all indicators are unlikely to be systemically important. There is debate over whether a higher threshold should be used to identify banks with outsized roles in certain activities, with calls for alternative methods or eliminating enhanced regulation. The Treasury Department's June 2017 report recommends amending the $50 billion threshold under Section 165 of Dodd Frank. The Treasury Department's June 2017 report recommends amending the $50 billion threshold under Section 165 of Dodd Frank for enhanced prudential standards, without a specific proposal. If Congress does not act, the Fed has discretion to maintain or raise the threshold, but only for certain regulatory provisions. The Fed has the authority to adjust thresholds for resolution plans, credit exposure reports, and concentration limits. They can also tailor enhanced regulations based on risk factors for individual banks. The Fed has already tailored prudential requirements for certain banks. The Fed can adjust regulations based on risk factors for individual banks, such as size. Congress has considered repealing certain Dodd-Frank Act requirements, allowing for more uniform regulation across all banks. Systemic risk can be addressed by specific regulatory provisions for all banks or a subset based on unique risks. Proposals to modify enhanced regulation include changing the threshold's asset value or using a different measure. Concerns exist that some banks over $50 billion do not pose systemic risk. Enhanced regulation for banks over $50 billion may not be beneficial if they do not pose systemic risk or are not perceived as \"too big to fail.\" This could result in unnecessary costs without offsetting benefits, although there are potential advantages such as reducing taxpayer exposure to FDIC insurance losses or bailouts. Some argue that enhanced prudential requirements like risk committees and stress tests are good risk management practices for all firms. Concerns exist about the disproportionate compliance costs on banks near the $50 billion threshold due to fixed costs associated with certain regulatory elements. The Fed has tailored some elements of the regime to reduce costs for smaller banks. Setting the threshold at firms with assets of at least $50 billion may avoid moral hazard. Proposals to decrease the number of firms subject to enhanced regulation risk creating a perception of a list of TBTF firms. Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo suggested raising the threshold to $100 billion, while former Representative Barney Frank proposed $125 billion. Raising the threshold to $125 billion and potentially to $200 billion or higher has been suggested. Congress could raise the threshold in various sections of the Dodd-Frank Act or give the Fed discretion to adjust it for different requirements. If bank size is seen as a key factor in systemic risk, a numerical threshold is considered the best approach. The debate over the appropriate numerical threshold for determining systemic riskiness is hindered by the lack of a natural breakpoint in the data. While size is not the only factor, it is a simpler and more transparent metric compared to other alternatives. The total assets of banks fluctuate over time, making it challenging to set a consensus threshold. Critics of size-based thresholds are skeptical of using size as a proxy for systemic importance. Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika argues that size thresholds can hinder growth for midsize institutions. Many economists believe that the problem of \"too big to fail\" is more about complexity and interdependence rather than just size. Size correlates with complexity and interdependence, but not perfectly. The size threshold for determining systemic importance may not accurately capture all relevant firms. Congress could consider using a different numerical measure that is better correlated with systemic risk. This alternative could be automatic or defer to regulators' judgment, potentially being simple or complex. The threshold for determining systemic importance could be simple or complex, involving technical decision-making delegated to the Fed or FSOC. An example is a formula based on 12 metrics to identify G-SIBs, not necessarily the largest banks. The current eight U.S. banks designated as G-SIBs could potentially be increased. If no quantitative measure aligns with systemic importance, a legislative option could replace the numerical threshold with a designation process. One legislative option is to designate banks as \"systemically important\" on a case-by-case basis, potentially including restrictions like a minimum size requirement. The Fed currently supervises 12 banks, focusing on risks to the financial system rather than just size. Size is not the sole factor in determining which banks belong in the LISCC portfolio. The Fed classifies banks as \"large and complex\" in addition to the LISCC portfolio. Congress may need to decide on a designation process for banks, potentially involving only the Fed, all banking regulators, or all of FSOC. Arguments exist for and against each option, with considerations for expertise and subsidiaries in nonbank activities. A case-by-case designation process could help limit enhanced regulations. The FSOC consists of experts and aims to limit enhanced regulation to firms posing systemic risk. However, identifying systemically important firms is subjective and can change with leadership. The designation process is resource-intensive and time-consuming, with only four nonbank SIFIs designated in the first three years, and three out of four de-designated. MetLife's de-designation resulted from a legal challenge. Designation of firms as systemically important can lead to potential legal challenges, lack transparency, and reinforce perceptions of \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) for large firms. Critics argue that the existing designation process is not transparent enough and does not give designated firms enough opportunity to address the reasons for their systemic importance. Designating a bank as systemically important could signal to market participants that it is TBTF, increasing moral hazard. Congress could consider a hybrid option where some banks are clearly identified as systemically important while others' systemic importance is less clear. A hybrid option for designating systemically important banks is proposed to address drawbacks of the current process. This approach would automatically designate some banks based on simple standards, while others would undergo a case-by-case evaluation. The hybrid option aims to balance the benefits of limiting enhanced regulation to only systemically important firms with reducing the costliness and slowness of the designation process. The bill H.R. 3312 / S. 1893 would subject designated G-SIB banks to enhanced regulation, with the Fed able to designate other banks posing a threat to financial stability. The bill would increase federal direct spending by $53 million over ten years due to potential bank failures using FDIC resources, but raise federal revenues by $10 million through higher deposit insurance assessments. Section 401 of S. 2155 would also subject G-SIB banks and those with over $250 billion in assets to enhanced regulation. The bill H.R. 3312 / S. 1893 would subject designated G-SIB banks and those with over $250 billion in assets to enhanced regulation. Banks with assets between $50 billion and $100 billion would no longer be subject to enhanced regulation, except for the risk committee requirement. The bill aims to make tailoring of the regime mandatory and includes other modifications to individual provisions of the enhanced prudential regime. The eight U.S. G-SIBs are the largest banks with over $500 billion in assets, while the other two are custody banks ranking lower. Concerns have been raised about the FSB designation process superseding the FSOC process in U.S. law. G-SIBs are designated based on global importance, but regulation focuses on U.S. financial system importance. Banks need capital to absorb losses and meet minimum ratios like the leverage ratio. H.R. 10 aims to provide depositories of all types with certain provisions. H.R. 10 would provide depositories with a 10% leverage ratio \"off ramp,\" exempting them from various banking regulations. Banks with over $50 billion in assets would no longer be subject to enhanced regulation and Basel III provisions. Traditional banks must meet a 10% leverage ratio, while nontraditional banks must meet a 10% supplementary leverage ratio. Some critics argue that postcrisis reforms have made the regulatory regime more complex, which could backfire. Off-ramp proponents criticize the needless complexity of regulations, benefiting larger banks and reducing competition. They suggest that banks should have sufficient capital in place without excessive regulatory micromanagement. The off-ramp proposal focuses on an institution's ability to absorb losses through capital requirements, rather than systemic riskiness. Predicting which banks would opt for the 10% leverage ratio involves uncertainty, with CBO estimating that half of eligible banks may not elect to do so. CBO estimated that about five banks with more than $50 billion in assets and none of the eight U.S. G-SIBs would make the election to raise enough capital to meet the 10% leverage ratio threshold. Discussions about raising the $50 billion threshold typically focus on the enhanced prudential standards in the Dodd-Frank Act. Legislative proposals may include changes to this threshold in various sections of the act. Some sections reference banks covered by Section 165 or with over $50 billion in assets. Changing the threshold in Section 165 would affect these sections. H.R. 10 proposes repealing various provisions, including the Hotel California provision and FDIC examination authority. Section 165 mandates stress tests and risk committee requirements for banks over $10 billion in assets. Congress could raise these thresholds or keep them unchanged. Congress could consider raising thresholds for stress tests from $10 billion to $50 billion and enshrining other thresholds for capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements in statute. They may also evaluate a tiered regulatory approach versus a \"one size fits all\" approach and consider aligning financial stability provisions with the Section 165 size threshold. This includes provisions in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act related to orderly liquidation authority. The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is created to wind down firms posing financial stability risks. Placement in OLA is not based on size but on potential adverse effects on financial stability. The $50 billion threshold does not adjust over time, leading more banks to face enhanced regulation or restrict growth to avoid reaching the threshold. Congress could consider raising thresholds for stress tests and enshrining other requirements in statute to address this issue. To avoid banks facing enhanced regulation or restricting growth to stay below the $50 billion threshold, Congress could index the threshold to an economic indicator like inflation or financial-sector assets. Proposed bills in the 114th Congress aimed to raise the threshold and tie it to gross domestic product. Regulators could consider including or excluding metrics like off-balance-sheet exposures or global assets of foreign banks in the threshold definition, which would impact the number of firms exceeding the threshold. Bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets may be subject to enhanced regulation under Section 165. Currently, there is one bank without a holding company and six thrift holding companies with assets exceeding $50 billion. None of these companies have been designated as nonbank SIFIs by FSOC. Some large holding companies with over $50 billion in assets, including leading firms in securities or insurance sectors, may not be subject to enhanced prudential regulations. Congress may need to assess if these companies, like AIG and Lehman Brothers, pose systemic risks similar to banks. During the financial crisis, AIG, Lehman Brothers, and Washington Mutual were central to systemic risk concerns. The Dodd-Frank Act's Section 117, known as the \"Hotel California\" provision, prevents BHCs that received TARP funds from selling their bank subsidiaries to avoid enhanced regulation. H.R. 10 aims to repeal this provision. H.R. 10 aims to repeal the Hotel California provision, which prevents BHCs that received TARP funds from selling their bank subsidiaries to avoid enhanced regulation. The Fed requires foreign banks with over $50 billion in nonbranch U.S. assets to form intermediate holding companies for their U.S. operations, subject to enhanced regulation. Concerns arise regarding redundancy with home country regulations for the parent company, depending on whether similar provisions are in place and enforced by home country regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act emphasizes the need for enhanced regulation of foreign banks to consider national treatment, equality of competitive opportunity, and comparability to U.S. standards. The Treasury report recommends expanding the threshold for foreign banks to include U.S. branch and agency assets, as some foreign banks with over $50 billion in assets are not subject to the same enhanced prudential requirements as U.S. banks or intermediate holding companies. This could help address potential systemic risks and ensure consistency in regulatory standards for foreign banks operating in the U.S. The Treasury report suggests adjusting the threshold for foreign banks' intermediate holding company requirements, exempting them from enhanced regulation if there is regulatory equivalency in their home country, and applying the asset threshold to U.S. assets instead of global assets. Enhanced regulation aims to mitigate systemic risk, but imposing it on banks that do not pose systemic risk may result in costs without the primary benefit. Regulatory burden is lower for banks near the threshold in absolute terms but may be higher in relative terms. Enhanced regulation is seen as a necessary option to manage risks posed by large banks, despite concerns about increased costs and potential ineffectiveness. Critics worry about the impact on market discipline and the possibility of exacerbating systemic risk if certain activities migrate to less regulated institutions. Some economists believe systemic risk is caused by interconnected and complex banks, not just by size. An asset threshold is suggested for enhanced regulation, but data shows size does not always correlate with risk. Some large banks have low risk scores, while smaller banks engage in risky activities. Finding the right asset threshold is challenging, as setting it too high could exclude risky banks. An asset threshold value that is crucial for regulation is discussed, with the challenge of finding the right balance to avoid excluding systemically important banks. A case-by-case designation process is proposed as an alternative, but it is subjective and may lead to a perception of \"too big to fail\" status. The current designation process for non-banks is slow and subject to legal challenges. A hybrid regime combining an automatic threshold with a case-by-case process is suggested to address drawbacks. Congress could consider extending the regime to capture similar depositories. The Dodd-Frank Act lists sections that apply only to banks with over $50 billion in assets, including regulatory requirements. Enhanced regulation targets issues from the financial crisis, but overlaps in provisions may lead to excessive regulatory burden. Mitigating systemic risk is a key rationale for enhanced regulation. Enhanced regulation aims to mitigate systemic risk by targeting very large banks, which are seen as necessary in financial markets. While higher costs may result from enhanced regulation, it could potentially increase economic efficiency by addressing moral hazard issues. Opponents fear that regulation may be ineffective and increase moral hazard by reducing market discipline. Enhanced prudential regulation may have a marginal effect on market discipline, as large banks were already under rigorous regulation. Systemic risk may be caused by specific activities rather than institutions, and regulation could potentially worsen the risk if activities move to less regulated \"shadow banks.\" Some economists believe systemic risk is due to interconnectedness and complexity rather than size alone. Data shows that size does not always correlate with interconnectedness or complexity, as some globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are relatively small in terms of assets. Some G-SIBs are small by asset size, with no bank under $200 billion receiving a high systemic risk indicator score. Finding the right asset threshold is challenging, as setting it too high excludes important banks, while setting it too low includes non-systemically important ones. A case-by-case designation process, rather than a size threshold, is an alternative but is subjective and risks a perception of TBTF status. Designating non-banks as systemically important has been slow, reversible, and legally challenged. The current regime for designating systemically important firms has drawbacks, with one firm currently designated. A hybrid regime combining automatic thresholds with case-by-case designations could address some issues. Congress could consider extending the regime to include similar depositories like thrift holding companies. Examples of firms with $50 billion in assets exist, including those engaged in nonbank activities. AIG, Lehman Brothers, and Washington Mutual were all designated as systemically important during the financial crisis."
