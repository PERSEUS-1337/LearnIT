The \"Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments Act\" defines an \"accountable consultation process\" as a government-to-government dialogue between agencies and Indian tribes to ensure tribal input on policies with tribal implications. Tribal officials must have ample opportunity to provide recommendations, which must be fully considered by the agency. The \"Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments Act\" requires agencies to notify tribal officials of policies with tribal implications and provide them with a copy. These policies must not take effect until at least 60 days after notification. The Act defines agencies as the Department of the Interior, the Indian Health Service, and the National Indian Gaming Commission. The term \"Indian tribe\" refers to a recognized Native American community by the Secretary of the Interior. \"Policies that have tribal implications\" are measures by agencies that directly affect Indian tribes or the relationship between them and the Federal Government. The term \"tribal officials\" refers to elected or appointed officials of Indian tribal governments or their designees. SEC. 3. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. When formulating policies with tribal implications, agencies must adhere to fundamental principles recognizing the unique legal and political relationship with Indian tribal governments. The United States has established a trust relationship with Indian tribes and recognizes their right to self-government and inherent sovereign powers. The United States works with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis to address issues related to tribal self-government, trust resources, and treaty rights. The US recognizes and supports tribal sovereignty and self-determination. SEC. 4. POLICYMAKING CRITERIA. When formulating policies with tribal implications, agencies must respect tribal self-government, sovereignty, and treaty rights. They should also give Indian tribal governments maximum administrative discretion and encourage tribes to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives. When formulating policies with tribal implications, agencies must respect tribal self-government, sovereignty, and treaty rights. They should defer to Indian tribes to establish standards and consult with tribal officials on the need for Federal standards, considering alternatives that preserve tribal authority. Each agency must establish an accountable consultation process within 30 days of the Act's enactment. An official responsible for implementation must be designated within 60 days, submitting the process description to specific committees. No agency can create policies with significant costs for Indian tribal governments without federal funding or early consultation with tribal officials. The House of Representative and Senate Committees require agencies to provide a tribal impact statement, detailing consultation with tribal officials, concerns, and how they have been addressed. SEC. 7. Agencies must consider consensual mechanisms for developing policies on tribal self-government, tribal trust resources, and Indian tribal treaty rights. SEC. 8. Preemption of tribal law. No agency can establish a policy that preempts tribal law without consulting tribal officials and providing a tribal summary impact statement to relevant committees and tribes. The agency must consult tribal officials and provide a tribal summary impact statement to relevant committees and tribes, including a statement on the extent to which tribal concerns have been addressed. Increasing flexibility for Indian tribal waivers. Each agency must review and streamline the waiver process for Indian tribes. They should consider waiver applications with a focus on flexible policy approaches that align with federal policy objectives. Agencies are required to make a decision on waiver applications within 120 days. The agency must decide on waiver applications within 120 days of receipt, or as specified by Federal law. If the waiver is denied, the applicant must be given written notice. This section applies to discretionary statutory or regulatory requirements subject to agency waiver."
