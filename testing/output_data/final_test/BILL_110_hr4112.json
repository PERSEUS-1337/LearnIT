The taxpayer can make an irrevocable election for a building without a housing credit allocation under section 42(h). This election must be made as prescribed by the Secretary. No low-income housing credit is allowed for designated low-income buildings. During the recapture period, a designated low-income building that no longer qualifies as such will be subject to recapture of accelerated depreciation. The assessment of any deficiency must be made within one year of notifying the Secretary of the change in status.
