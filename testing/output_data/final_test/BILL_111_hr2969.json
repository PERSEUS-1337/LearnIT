The \"Water System Adaptation Partnerships Act of 2009\" authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to provide grants to water systems for various purposes such as water conservation, water quality preservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy generation in water management. The \"Water System Adaptation Partnerships Act of 2009\" authorizes grants for water systems to support advanced water treatment technologies, climate change impact studies, and projects enhancing water system resiliency to climate change. The \"Water System Adaptation Partnerships Act of 2009\" authorizes grants for water systems to support programs, strategies, or infrastructure improvements that address risks to water resources or infrastructure from global climate change. Eligible water system owners or operators must submit an application citing research on climate change impacts and how their proposed projects would perform under anticipated climate conditions. The \"Water System Adaptation Partnerships Act of 2009\" authorizes grants for water systems to address risks from global climate change. Applications must demonstrate how proposed projects increase resiliency to climate risks or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administrator conducts a competitive process each year, giving priority to water systems at the greatest risk. The \"Water System Adaptation Partnerships Act of 2009\" authorizes grants for water systems to address climate-related risks. Applications from water systems across the US facing varying risks will be considered, with priority given to those at the greatest risk. Public input will be solicited in developing evaluation criteria. Federal cost-sharing is required for grant-funded programs, strategies, or infrastructure improvements. The grant awarded to a water system cannot exceed 50% of the cost in a calendar year. The non-Federal share includes in-kind services but not other amounts from a Federal agency. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will promulgate regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. Every three years, a progress report on implementing the section will be submitted to Congress, detailing project applications received and funded annually. Definitions include the Administrator as the head of the EPA and a water system as defined in the Safe Drinking Water Act. Authorization of Appropriations is granted for the implementation of this section, with necessary funds to be appropriated as needed."
