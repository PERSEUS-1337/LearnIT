    "content": "The Act titled \"Wounded Warrior Transition Assistance Act of 2009\" allows for the continuation of military compensation for reserve component members during the physical evaluation board process and for certain other reserve component members. Section 1218 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to give reserve component members the option to remain on active duty to receive pay and allowances during the physical evaluation board process for disability evaluation until cleared to return to duty or separated. Members can change this election at any point during the process. The Wounded Warrior Transition Assistance Act of 2009 allows reserve component members to stay on active duty to receive pay and allowances during the physical evaluation board process for disability evaluation until retirement or placement on the temporary disability retired list. The Wounded Warrior Transition Assistance Act of 2009 allows reserve component members to stay on active duty for up to five years after enactment to receive care and benefits for injuries or illnesses. Members can elect to be discharged from active duty at any time. Consultation with a judge advocate general is required before making any decisions. SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE OF HUMAN RESOURCES COMMANDS WITH REQUESTS FOR RETENTION OF RESERVE COMPONENT MEMBERS ON ACTIVE DUTY. The applicable human resources command must return to active duty in the Armed Forces any reserve component member who wants to return to active duty, is unable to work due to a service-connected illness or injury, and is not retired or receiving certain benefits. The purposes for which a reserve component member of the Armed Forces may be returned to active duty include medical evaluation, treatment for illness or injury, and eligibility determination for the temporary disability retired list. The applicable human resources command varies by branch of the military. The Coast Guard, under Homeland Security, is responsible for human resources functions for Armed Forces members. The requirements in subsection (a) will expire five years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. ENCOURAGEMENT OF USE OF LOCAL RESIDENCES FOR CERTAIN RESERVE COMPONENT MEMBERS. Section 1222 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to allow reserve component members to reside at their permanent place of residence if medically feasible, as determined by a licensed health care provider. This applies to members remaining on active duty or returned to active duty under specific sections. The Wounded Warrior Transition Assistance Act of 2009 allows members on active duty to receive transportation, lodging, and meal expenses for medical facility visits. The commander retains the authority to assign duties based on the member's fitness for duty. Authorization for the use of Defense Health Program funds for support programs for certain members of the Reserve Components is granted. Funds in the Defense Health Program are available for support programs for reserve component members who become ill or injured while on active duty and separate from active duty as a result. Support programs include non-clinical case management, TRICARE program advisors, psychological health programs, and connection of military health system electronic medical records. The Office of the Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs will coordinate with reserve components to determine budget requirements for these programs. SEC. 6. MAINTENANCE AND ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES IN CONNECTION WITH MEDICAL DISCHARGE PROCESS. The Secretary of each military department must ensure that the judge advocate general's corps has enough personnel to provide legal assistance to all members of the Armed Forces undergoing medical discharge, including during evaluation by a medical evaluation board. The judge advocate general's corps must provide legal assistance to Armed Forces members undergoing medical discharge, including representation during evaluation by a medical evaluation board. Forces may undergo evaluation by a medical evaluation board if requested. SEC. 7. Maintenance and assignment of Judge Advocate General personnel to assist members of the Armed Forces with disability evaluation by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Each military department's judge advocate general's corps must have the capacity to provide legal assistance to Armed Forces members undergoing disability evaluation by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of each military department must ensure that these members receive appropriate legal assistance during the evaluation process. The judge advocate general's corps must provide legal assistance to Armed Forces members during disability evaluation by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including outreach and representation if requested. Members of the judge advocate generals' corps have powers and privileges to represent Armed Forces members during disability evaluation by the Department of Veterans Affairs, as prescribed jointly by the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs. These powers and privileges must not be more restricted than those given to representatives of recognized organizations under section 5902 of title 38, United States Code. Sense of Congress on allowing veterans service organizations access to military facilities for counseling and services for Armed Forces members. Sense of Congress is that commanders of military installations should ensure access for veterans service organizations to provide counseling and services to Armed Forces members. Private space should be provided for counseling, and information about the Wounded Warrior Resource Center should be widely disseminated. The Wounded Warrior Center, as mandated by the Wounded Warrior Act, should offer legal assistance referrals to Armed Forces members undergoing medical evaluations. A qualified veterans service organization is defined as one recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for representing veterans. The Act and its amendments will take effect 180 days after enactment. $50,000,000 will be allocated for this Act from recovered funds by the Department of Defense."
