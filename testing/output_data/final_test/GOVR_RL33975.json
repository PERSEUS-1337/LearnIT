    "content": "Congress has long been concerned about the well-being of youth, as the nation's future depends on young people being prepared for college or the workplace. Some youth face barriers to becoming contributing members of society due to characteristics or experiences that put them at risk of developing problem behaviors. Vulnerable youth, such as emancipating foster youth, runaway and homeless youth, and youth involved in the juvenile justice system, face challenges in transitioning to adulthood due to inadequate economic and emotional support in their home and neighborhood environments. The federal government has not implemented a comprehensive policy to address the challenges faced by at-risk youth during their transition to adulthood. Various programs established in the early 20th century and expanded through Great Society initiatives focus on workforce development, education, juvenile justice, social services, public health, and community service to help vulnerable youth develop skills for adulthood. Despite the range of federal services available, many programs have not been fully developed. Despite various federal programs for vulnerable youth, a coordinated system of support is lacking. Efforts have been made by federal policymakers, including passing legislation for a youth council. The Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs was formed in 2008 to address common goals for youth. Congress has also considered other legislation to improve services for vulnerable youth. The report focuses on improving services for vulnerable youth through policies with a \"positive youth development\" approach. It discusses the challenges of coordinating federal programs for youth and provides an overview of current federal programs targeted at vulnerable youth. The report also addresses the concept of \"disconnectedness\" and protective factors that can mitigate poor outcomes for youth. The report discusses federal programs for youth, federal legislation promoting coordination, and defines \"youth\" as individuals aged 10-24. This age range includes 64.1 million youth in the US, with adolescence now extending beyond traditional ages due to cultural and economic factors. Older youth up to age 24 are transitioning to adulthood, attending school, working, or living with family. The transition from adolescence to adulthood has become longer and more complex since the postwar period. Youth in the 1950s followed a more orderly path to adulthood, completing education, securing employment, and starting families in their early 20s. In contrast, today's youth face a global, information-driven economy that requires higher levels of education for well-paid employment. The transition to adulthood has become longer and more complex since the postwar period. More youth now receive vocational training or enroll in colleges and universities after high school. Young adults cycle between attending school, living independently, and staying with parents to explore career options and relationships. The median age of first marriage has risen each decade. Some youth may delay financial independence, creating a burden for their families. Just over 60% of young adults receive financial assistance from their parents, including help with bills, tuition, vehicles, and rent. The average value of assistance from 2005 to 2009 was $7,490. Higher income families provide more support, with top quartile families giving six times more assistance than bottom quartile families. Support from parents to young adults has increased over time, with a greater proportion of young adults receiving more support. Support for young adults ages 23-28 from their parents has not increased significantly, but it has been concentrated since 2003. Around 15% of adults aged 25-34 lived with their parents in 2016, most for at least a year. Programs aiding youth transitioning to adulthood now extend beyond age 18, such as the ACA providing health insurance coverage up to age 26. Since FY2003, the federal Chafee Foster Care Education and Training Vouchers program has provided vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually per youth aging out of foster care or adopted after 16. The vouchers cover higher education costs, and recipients can participate until age 23. Organizations like the Youth Transition Funders Group and the Network on Transitions to Adulthood focus on helping adolescents transition successfully to adulthood by age 25. The Transition Funders Group and the Network on Transitions to Adulthood aim to assist adolescents in successfully transitioning to adulthood by age 25. A study on early adulthood in the United States shows that while most young people grow up in supportive environments, some face challenges such as living in impoverished neighborhoods with limited resources. About one-third of young adults have graduated from a four-year college, but even those with academic and emotional support may encounter difficulties during the transition to adulthood. Vulnerable youth face challenges transitioning to adulthood, with no universal definition of \"vulnerable\" or \"at-risk\" youth. These labels can stigmatize individuals who may lack skills, face emotional problems, or grow up in unstable environments. Researchers define vulnerable youth as having characteristics that put them at risk of negative outcomes. \"At risk\" implies a higher likelihood of negative outcomes, even if not yet experienced. Vulnerable youth, including those emancipating from foster care, runaway and homeless youth, youth in the juvenile justice system, immigrant youth, youth with disabilities, mental disorders, and special education needs, are at risk of negative outcomes as they enter adulthood. Other vulnerable groups include young unmarried mothers, high school dropouts, and disconnected youth. Vulnerable youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, lacking financial and emotional support. Former foster youth struggle with financial assistance for education. Other vulnerable youth, such as those with disabilities or mental illness, have difficulty finding employment. Public systems of support often end at the age of majority, leading to loss of health insurance and vocational services. Professionals in adult public systems may not be equipped to address the needs of young adults, creating barriers to successful transition into their 20s. Vulnerable youth, including those with disabilities, face barriers in transitioning to adulthood due to factors like poverty, racism, and lack of access to care. Former foster youth are at risk of homelessness upon aging out of the system. Emancipated youth, especially those from foster care, may lack adequate housing support and face economic insecurity due to lower wages and limited access to education. Factors like poverty, family instability, and dysfunction can contribute to negative outcomes for vulnerable youth as they transition to adulthood. Family dysfunction, child maltreatment, exposure to community violence, and school resources all play a significant role in shaping the future well-being of children. Witnessing violence against mothers, criminal activity in the family, abuse, neglect, and lack of school resources can lead to negative outcomes such as poor health, lower cognitive functioning, and behavioral issues. Children living in environments with social issues like bullying and behavioral problems, as well as those in high-poverty neighborhoods, face challenges in perceiving work as common and succeeding in school. Residential mobility and minority status also contribute to negative outcomes such as lower academic performance, school dropout, emotional and behavioral problems, and limited job opportunities. Vulnerable youth experiencing multiple risk factors are particularly at risk. Youth advocates and researchers are focusing on supporting these vulnerable youth. Youth advocates and researchers are focusing on vulnerable youth who are disconnected, not working or attending school. The definition of disconnected varies, with differences in ages and length of time not in school or working. Some definitions also consider marital status and educational attainment. Studies may include only noninstitutionalized youth. Some studies exclude youth in institutions like prisons and mental health facilities. Vulnerable youth can still achieve success in education and employment with proper support. Positive youth development focuses on engaging young people in positive activities to build skills for adulthood. Youth development focuses on engaging young people in productive activities across various domains such as cognitive, social, physical, and emotional competencies. These competencies acquired during adolescence can lead to successful outcomes in education, career, self-confidence, relationships, and societal contributions. Good health risk management skills, positive mental health, coping skills, personal autonomy, safety, spirituality, future planning, strong moral character, community engagement, volunteering, vocational skills, and perception of future careers are important for youth development. Factors influencing these competencies include individual characteristics, social environment, and home environment. The development of youth is influenced by individual characteristics, societal conditions, and community interactions. Factors such as social skills, coping strategies, and positive self-perception promote resilience. Economic conditions, discrimination, and educational institutions also play a role in shaping youth competencies. Perception of future careers and community culture can impact youth development positively. The positive development of youth is supported by reinforcing cultural norms that promote academic and professional success. Communities can aid in youth development by offering various pathways to strengthen competencies through schools and other institutions. Youth advocates suggest providing services and long-term programs to offer opportunities during and after school hours. Resources within schools and quality youth-serving organizations can protect youth from negative community influences. Outside of schools, youth development programs focus on mentoring and leadership to engage young people in positive alternatives. The family context also plays a crucial role in youth development. The family context is crucial for youth development, with parental oversight and family structure influencing the transition to adulthood. Positive adolescent development occurs when youth have independence but also rely on parents for support and advice. Parenting styles and family structures that promote positive relationships can assist youth in developing control over their future. Belief in youth assets forms the basis of the youth development movement. The youth development movement, rooted in the belief that all youth have assets, emerged in the 1980s in response to policies focusing on specific youth problems. Various institutions, including policy organizations, national service organizations, research entities, philanthropic groups, and government agencies, have promoted this holistic approach to improving outcomes for youth and easing their transition to adulthood. The youth development movement aims to address the attitudes, skills, knowledge, and behaviors young people need for adulthood. Challenges include insufficient guidance for prioritizing youth to serve and a lack of program evaluation. Some youth development efforts lack data on demand and supply, leading to challenges in generating excitement among policymakers. Advocates propose clarifying concrete deliverables and connecting the movement to sustainable funding and training infrastructures. The recommendations made over 10 years ago called for evaluations of youth programs with a positive approach and improved monitoring. The federal government has increased coordination among agencies with youth programs and funded initiatives to assist localities in addressing youth challenges. The report discusses the federal government's role in assisting vulnerable youth and describes current programs focusing on coordination and positive youth development. The federal government's youth policy evolved from various programs and initiatives starting in the early 1900s to assist children and youth. The Children's Bureau, established in 1912, focused on child labor and protection of children with special needs. Youth policy was initially under a child welfare framework, with work and education programs created during the Great Depression to support older youth. In response to the Great Depression, programs were established to assist older youth, and federal focus shifted towards addressing delinquency. In the 1960s and 1970s, programs targeting youth were created in various policy areas. From the 1980s onwards, some programs expanded while others were eliminated. The federal government has adopted strategies to better serve the youth population through legislation and initiatives. Adolescence was formally defined by psychologists at the turn of the 20th century. During the early 1900s, psychologist G. Stanley Hall described adolescence as a period of \"storm and stress,\" highlighting risky behavior and conflict with parents. Concern for adolescent well-being grew alongside a focus on child welfare, leading to the establishment of laws protecting children from abuse and neglect. Juvenile courts and reform schools expanded, with 22 states passing legislation by 1912. This marked the federal government's initial involvement in child welfare matters. The Children's Bureau was created by the federal government during the Progressive Movement to address issues affecting children's welfare, such as infant mortality, child labor, and juvenile court. The bureau's focus was on investigating and reporting on various aspects of child life for the government. The Children's Bureau, established during the Progressive Movement, targeted youth aged 10 to 16, combating child labor and juvenile delinquency. Bureau Chief Julia Lathrop advocated for laws prohibiting child employment under 16. The bureau tracked juvenile delinquency causes, citing home conditions as a predictor. In 1955, a division on delinquency prevention was created. The bureau's child health and welfare programs under the Social Security Act of 1935 were significant. The Social Security Act of 1935 established public child welfare services for homeless, dependent, neglected, and delinquent children. It also created the Aid to Dependent Children Program (now TANF) to provide financial assistance to impoverished children. Amendments extended the age of eligible children to 18. In the 1930s, the federal government addressed youth poverty caused by the Great Depression. In response to youth poverty during the Great Depression, the government established relief programs like the Federal Transient Relief Act of 1933 and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to assist low-income older youth. President Franklin Roosevelt later created the National Youth Administration (NYA) in 1935 to provide employment and cash assistance to poor college and high school students. Legislation in 1938 proposed the American Youth Act to establish a federal National Youth Administration for public-works projects employing young individuals. The American Youth Act of 1938 aimed to provide employment opportunities for unemployed youth through public-works projects and vocational training. However, the act was never voted on due to concerns about its cost and overlap with existing programs like the CCC and NYA. By the late 1940s, federal government reorganizations limited the Children's Bureau's jurisdiction over youth-related matters. The Children's Bureau's focus on youth-related matters was diminished due to federal government reorganizations in the late 1940s. This trend continued as child health policy issues were transferred to other agencies, and the bureau's philosophy of the \"whole child\" was further marginalized. In the 1960s and 1970s, federal efforts to assist disadvantaged children and families were evident through President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty initiatives, which established youth-targeted programs in various areas. During the 1960s, federal government initiatives focused on youth-related matters, including education, delinquency prevention, social services, and health. Key legislation included the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, which established programs like Job Corps and Upward Bound to help low-income youth. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 provided federal funding to low-income schools. The Migrant Education Program and Migrant High School Equivalency Program were created in 1966 to assist children of migrant workers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 increased federal funding for universities, scholarships, and low-interest loans for students. The Talent Search Program was also established to identify low-income youth with potential for postsecondary education. In 1970, the Youth Conservation Corps Act was passed to provide opportunities for young people. The Youth Conservation Corps Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-378) established the Youth Conservation Pilot Program for youth to work on federal lands. The Comprehensive Employment and Training Activities Act (CETA) of 1973 (P.L. 93-203) provided funding for the Youth Employment and Training Program. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974 (P.L. 93-415) extended federal support for juvenile justice projects. The Runaway Youth Program, established under Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, provides shelter, counseling, and after-care services to runaway and homeless youth. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required public schools to provide equal access to education for children with disabilities. The White House Conference on Children has been organized by the executive branch since 1909. The White House Conference on Children has been organized since 1909. The conferences in 1960 and 1971 focused on promoting opportunities for youth. Recommendations included community agencies assisting parents with youth concerns, improved social services, and federal support for youth-related research. The 1971 conference addressed issues like the draft suspension, drug possession penalties, and income guarantees for poor families. In the 1960s, the Children's Bureau began focusing on the needs of adolescents by establishing a Youth Services Unit in 1966. The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) was created in 1970 to provide leadership on youth issues in the federal government, addressing the inappropriate placement of young people in the juvenile justice system and the lack of social services for others. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 emphasized the need for care and guidance for youth committing status offenses. This laid the foundation for much of FYSB's work today with runaway and homeless youth. Current federal youth policy has evolved from various social policy programs, including those from the War on Poverty era. Several new programs, including the Runaway and Homeless Youth program and the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program, have been created to address youth issues. Federal youth policy also includes initiatives to promote positive youth development and increase coordination between agencies administering youth-focused programs. Table A-1 in the Appendix describes over 50 federal programs for youth in various policy areas. The programs listed in Table A-1 aim to serve vulnerable youth aged 10 to 24, providing opportunities for skill development and support during the transition to adulthood. Congress has allocated funding for services like conflict resolution, counseling, mentoring, and research. The programs listed aim to serve vulnerable youth aged 10 to 24, providing opportunities for skill development and support during the transition to adulthood. The list includes various programs for parental/family intervention, planning, program development, research, and evaluation. Some major block grant programs like TANF and SSBG are not included but states can use their funds for youth activities. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides funding for states to offer a variety of services to adults and children, with a focus on preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and promoting two-parent families. Services funded by SSBG include education, foster care, independent living, pregnancy and parenting support, and services for youth involved in criminal activity. The federal government funds job training and workforce development programs for youth through the Department of Labor, targeting low-income youth ages 14 to 24. The programs include Job Corps, Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Youth Conservation Corps. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act authorizes these programs through FY2020, providing employment training and academic support services for in-school and out-of-school youth. Out-of-school youth, including high school dropouts and low-income individuals, are served by Job Corps centers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The program offers career preparation, academic initiatives, and character building. YouthBuild, authorized under WIOA, helps participants aged 16 to 24 earn their GED or high school diploma while learning job skills through building affordable housing. The Youth Conservation Corps, established in 1970, provides opportunities for youth to work on conservation projects. The Corps Act targets youth ages 15 to 18 to work on projects conserving natural resources. Federal education programs for vulnerable youth are authorized by the ESEA and HEA, providing funds for K-12 and postsecondary education. The ESEA supports programs for disadvantaged youth to increase their educational attainment, with Title I providing funding for low-income students in pre-K through grade 12 schools. Title I-C, Title I-D, Title III, and Title IV of the ESEA provide funding to support the educational needs of disadvantaged youth, including migrant students, neglected and delinquent youth, English learners, and students in after-school programs. The Higher Education Act authorizes programs like TRIO, GEAR UP, and Migrant High School Equivalency to assist vulnerable youth in pursuing higher education. TRIO programs, including Talent Search and Upward Bound, aim to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds in completing their postsecondary studies. TRIO programs like Talent Search, Upward Bound, and Educational Opportunity Centers aim to support disadvantaged students in completing their postsecondary education by providing information, financial aid, and academic assistance. Student Support Services projects focus on improving college students' retention and graduation rates. The GEAR UP program, added to the Higher Education Act in 1998, aims to increase disadvantaged students' school completion and postsecondary enrollment by providing support services from seventh grade to college. It differs from TRIO programs by serving a broader cohort of students and offering assurance of support. The Special Programs for Students Whose Families Are Engaged in Migrant and Seasonal Farmwork, authorized under HEA, provide funding to institutions of higher education to support individuals lacking a high school diploma and involved in migrant or seasonal farm work. The program aims to help students obtain a high school equivalency diploma and secure employment or attend college. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding for the education of children and youth with disabilities, ensuring \"free appropriate public education\" for youth up to age 21. This includes individualized education programs (IEP) outlining special instruction and educational goals. The McKinney-Vento Act authorizes funding for homeless children's education services, including assistance in school placement and removing barriers. The Youth ChalleNGe Program, administered by the Army National Guard, aims to help youth who have dropped out or been expelled from school. The Youth ChalleNGe Program, run by the Army National Guard, operates in 28 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. Eligible youth are ages 16-18, not on parole or probation, and drug-free. The program consists of three phases: pre-program assessment, 20-week residential phase, and 12-month post-residential phase. Cadets work towards their diploma or GED, develop life skills, and engage in community service. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) in the Department of Justice coordinates federal activities and administers programs related to juvenile offenders and delinquency prevention. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) was enacted in 1974 and reauthorized in 2002. It established federal institutions, grant programs for states, and core provisions. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) was enacted in 1974 to assist states in setting up their juvenile justice systems and established core mandates for grant funding eligibility. The Act features State Formula Grants, the Juvenile Mentoring Program, and Title V Community Prevention Block Grants. OJJDP administers State Formula Grants for the development of effective juvenile delinquency programs. The Juvenile Mentoring Program was repealed in 2002 but continues to receive appropriations each fiscal year. The Title V Community Prevention Block Grant program authorizes OJJDP to make grants to states for delinquency prevention programs. Social service programs for at-risk youth are administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Social Security Act. Title IV-E authorizes the federal foster care program for eligible children. Title IV-E provides reimbursement for room and board costs for eligible children in state care. Foster youth who turn 18 without reunification or adoption \"age out\" of foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) supports these youth. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides CFCIP funds to states, territories, and tribes to support children aging out of foster care. Education and Training Vouchers (ETVs) are also available for higher education costs. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program includes the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program consists of three components: the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP). These programs offer services such as shelter, counseling, and referrals to support vulnerable youth. Public health programs for this demographic are concentrated in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, addressing mental health, substance abuse, teen pregnancy prevention, and support for pregnant and parenting teens. The HHS, ACF, and SAMHSA administer programs for youth mental health, substance abuse, and teen pregnancy prevention. SAMHSA has four centers focusing on different aspects. These programs target youth with emotional disturbances and those at risk of substance abuse. SAMHSA funds suicide prevention activities for youth. The GLS Campus Suicide Prevention Grant Program and GLS State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and Early Intervention Grant Program fund services for students with mental health and substance abuse issues vulnerable to suicide. The Children's Mental Health Services program supports community-based care for children with emotional disturbances. Services are provided collaboratively across youth-serving systems to meet the mental health needs of each youth. The National Child Traumatic Stress Network provides services for children who have experienced traumatic events. The Juvenile Treatment Drug Courts offer treatment for drug-dependent youth, targeting juvenile offenders and providing substance abuse treatment, wrap-around services, and case management overseen by a judge. The Strategic Prevention Framework grants focus on preventing underage drinking and prescription drug misuse among youth aged 12 to 25. The grants support the prevention and reduction of substance abuse through SAMSHA's Strategic Prevention Framework, involving strategic planning and evidence-based prevention. It includes a five-step process: community needs assessment, capacity building, strategic plan development, implementation of prevention programs, and monitoring effectiveness. CSAP also administers the \"Drug-Free Communities Support Program\" in collaboration with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offers programs to reduce adolescent pregnancy and provide care services for pregnant and parenting adolescents, including the Title IV-E Abstinence Education Grants program. The Title IV-E Abstinence Education Grants program provides funding for abstinence education as part of the Maternal and Child Health block grant funds. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) for teen pregnancy prevention, which includes education on abstinence and contraception. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, established under the FY2010 omnibus appropriations law, aims to reduce teen pregnancy through evidence-based models. Funding is also available for research and demonstration grants. The Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program, funded by the FY2016 omnibus appropriations, focuses on promoting healthy life skills and educational success. The Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program was established and funded by the FY2016 and FY2017 omnibus appropriations laws. The program focuses on education in sexual risk avoidance, defined as refraining from non-marital sexual activity. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) administers programs aimed at providing public service to communities, with a particular focus on engaging disadvantaged youth. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) administers programs focused on engaging disadvantaged youth through AmeriCorps and Senior Corps. AmeriCorps addresses community needs by tutoring, mentoring, disaster response, health services, affordable housing, and environmental projects. Some projects specifically support disadvantaged youth, with a requirement for a portion of participants in the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) program to be disadvantaged. Participants in the NCCC program must be disadvantaged, with AmeriCorps members serving youth in after-school programs. They earn an education award equivalent to a Pell Grant for their service. Senior Corps volunteers, aged 55 or older, assist in various community programs like the Foster Grandparents Program and Retired and Senior Volunteer Program. The Foster Grandparents Program (FGP) provides aid to children and youth with exceptional needs, mentors troubled teenagers and young mothers, cares for premature infants and children with disabilities, and teaches reading instruction to children falling behind grade level. The Retired and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) offers services such as tutoring, home renovation, and museum docents. Despite the range of services for vulnerable youth, there is a lack of coordination among programs, leading to calls for improved mechanisms for communication and consultation among federal agencies. The text discusses the need for coordination among federal agencies to improve youth programs. Laws and an executive order have been implemented to promote coordination, including the YouthBuild Transfer Act and Executive Order 13459 establishing an Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs. The Claude Pepper Young Americans Act of 1990 (Title IX of the August F. Hawkins Human Services Reauthorization Act, P.L. 101-501) aimed to enhance coordination among federal agencies administering youth programs, but was never funded. It sought to improve social services for children, youth, and families at state and local levels. The Committee is concerned about the fragmented and disjointed system of services for children and families, leading to unmet and unresolved problems. The Federal Council on Children, Youth, and Families, authorized by the Young Americans Act, aims to address these concerns and promote cooperation at federal, state, and local levels. The Federal Council on Children, Youth, and Families, established by the Young Americans Act, advises the President on youth issues, reviews federal policies affecting youth, and recommends streamlining services for youth and families. The council was also tasked with identifying barriers to coordination and collaboration in programs and making recommendations for improvement. The Young Americans Act established the Federal Council on Children, Youth, and Families to advise the President on youth issues and recommend improvements in coordinating services. Despite funding not being appropriated, the act also provided grant funding for comprehensive services to children, youth, and families at state and local levels. Additionally, there were numerous other federal programs targeting vulnerable youth, as cataloged by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The White House Task Force for Disadvantaged Youth identified over 300 programs for vulnerable youth in 12 agencies, highlighting concerns about coordination of these programs for specific groups of youth. Congress has examined challenges in coordinating programs for specific groups of youth, such as abused and neglected children, disconnected and homeless youth. The Task Force for Disadvantaged Youth identified various programs to assist vulnerable youth. The Task Force for Disadvantaged Youth recommended transferring the YouthBuild program from HUD to DOL due to DOL's focus on workforce and training programs. The YouthBuild Transfer Act was signed into law in 2006, authorizing the transfer. The program provides education and job training in construction for low-income youth aged 16 to 24. The Tom Osborne Federal Youth Coordination Act (Title VIII of the Older Americans Act, P.L. 109-365) created the Federal Youth Development Council chaired by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. President Bush signed Executive Order 13459 to establish an Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs to improve coordination of youth policy across federal agencies. The legislation aimed to improve coordination of programs for vulnerable youth. The Federal Youth Development Council was created to improve coordination among federal agencies administering programs for vulnerable youth. The council's duties include reducing duplication of effort, improving policy effectiveness, and providing technical assistance to states. The Federal Youth Development Council was established to coordinate with other federal, state, and local efforts. It is required to work with existing interagency bodies and provide Congress with reports on youth well-being and needs. The Federal Youth Development Council coordinates federal, state, and local efforts for youth well-being. It assesses youth needs, coordinates federal programs, recommends improvements in training and communication, integrates policies, and facilitates collaboration among agencies and states. President Bush signed Executive Order 13459 in 2008 to establish the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs (IWGYP) following the success of the Helping America's Youth (HAY) initiative led by First Lady Laura Bush. The IWGYP aimed to promote positive youth development through collaboration with community-based organizations and federal agencies. The IWGYP was created in 2008 in partnership with nine federal agencies to improve coordination and effectiveness of youth programs. Its functions include engaging key organizations, developing a federal youth website, promoting high standards for program assessment, and reporting to the President. The Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs (IWGYP) was established in 2008 to enhance coordination and effectiveness of youth programs. Congress allocated $1 million in FY2009 for IWGYP to develop a strategic plan for federal youth policy, focusing on health, safety, education, and employment outcomes for youth up to age 24. Listening sessions were held in 10 communities from May to December 2010 to gather input. In 2010, the Working Group held listening sessions in 10 communities to gather input on the strategic plan. Meetings were held in August and October 2010 to solicit information from the public. A draft report of the plan was released in February 2013, with a final report issued in December 2016. The plan focuses on three goals: collaboration and coordination, evidence-based and innovative strategies to improve youth outcomes. The Federal Youth Development Council and Interagency Working Group focus on disseminating evidence-based programs and promoting youth engagement. Differences lie in their leadership structures, membership, and duties. The HHS Secretary serves as chair for both, with the IWGYP allowing for other agency heads to take on leadership roles after two years. The Federal Youth Development Council and Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs have different memberships and duties. The Council includes representatives from outside organizations and advises on youth needs and program goals, while the IWGYP consists only of federal staff and focuses on creating programs for youth development. The Federal Youth Development Council and Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs have similar functions despite differences in membership. Both aim to improve coordination among federal agencies and develop strategies to support youth. The Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs (IWGYP) collaborates with the Federal Mentoring Council and other partnerships to promote cost-effective solutions for youth programs. They identify and disseminate information about promising youth programs, encourage high-quality research and evaluation, and advocate for the adoption of high standards for assessing program results. The IWGYP's website serves as a platform for disseminating information. The IWGYP's website disseminates promising practices and provides technical assistance to youth-serving organizations. The executive order allows the IWGYP to identify target populations of at-risk youth, support initiatives for specific youth populations, and gather input from various stakeholders. The Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention focused on disconnected youth, now referred to as \"opportunity youth,\" ages 16 to 24. They engaged in outreach, developed a final report with recommendations for collaborative initiatives, and discussed successful collaborations and necessary resources. The Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, established by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, coordinates federal programs for juvenile delinquency prevention and vulnerable youth. Led by the Attorney General and OJJDP Administrator, it includes heads of various federal agencies. In February 2014, President Obama established the My Brother's Keeper Task Force (\"MBK Task Force\") to enhance outcomes for boys and young men of color. The Task Force developed recommendations for government, business, nonprofit, and community partners to support the education and workforce success of young men of color. The MBK Task Force, established by President Obama in February 2014, focuses on improving outcomes for young men of color through partnerships between the public and private sectors. The Task Force highlighted federal, state, and local initiatives aimed at enhancing educational and employment opportunities for this demographic. The private sector has pledged over $600 million in grants and resources to support MBK activities. President Obama's FY2013 budget proposed using existing funds for Performance Partnership Pilots (P3) to assist disconnected youth aged 14 to 24 with specific barriers. The FY2013 budget proposed using existing funds for Performance Partnership Pilots to assist disconnected youth aged 14 to 24 with specified barriers in achieving educational, employment, and other goals. The FY2014 to FY2017 appropriations laws provided authority for up to 10 Performance Partnership Pilot projects involving federal programs with related goals. The FY2013 budget proposed using existing funds for Performance Partnership Pilots to assist disconnected youth aged 14 to 24 with specified barriers in achieving educational, employment, and other goals. The FY2014 to FY2017 appropriations laws provided authority for up to 10 Performance Partnership Pilot projects involving federal programs with related goals. Selected appropriations for the Department of Justice and Department of Housing and Urban Development can be used to support the P3 initiative, allowing federal agencies to use discretionary funding for pilots targeting disconnected youth and preventing them from disconnecting from school or work. Agencies can enter agreements with states, regions, localities, or tribal communities for flexibility in using funds across various programs, ensuring no adverse effects on vulnerable populations. The law allows federal agencies to waive certain program requirements for pilot projects funded by discretionary funds, as long as they do not negatively impact vulnerable populations. Pilot communities must include those that have experienced civil unrest. The Department of Education is inviting eligible entities to apply for funding, including partnerships involving public and private organizations. The FY2017 appropriations law allows the P3 initiative to continue until September 30, 2021, focusing on the mental health and educational needs of children in foster care. HHS's Administration for Children and Families is collaborating with other agencies like CMS and SAMHSA to manage prescription medication for these children. State directors of child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies were convened in August 2012 to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. In August 2012, federal agencies collaborated to address the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and their mental health needs. State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities were urged to work together to improve health services for these children. Additionally, HHS partnered with the Department of Education to enhance the educational outcomes of youth in foster care through a meeting with state officials. In June 2014, ED and HHS issued guidance on educational support for children in foster care, followed by guidance on provisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act in June 2016. The departments continue to collaborate on implementing strategies for educational stability for children in foster care. The U.S. Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor collaborated with the Social Security Administration to improve communication and coordination for at-risk youth through the \"Shared Youth Vision\" initiative. An Interagency Work Group and regional forums were held in 16 states to develop policies and research for vulnerable youth. DOL awarded grants totaling $1.6 million to states in FY2014 to enhance collaboration among organizations serving at-risk youth. The Department of Labor awarded grants totaling $1.6 million to states to develop strategic plans linking systems for youth services. Arizona created an initiative to assist youth exiting foster care or the juvenile justice system in connecting to education and employment services. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, supported by HHS, ED, and DOJ since FY2009, aims to reduce violence and drug abuse in K-12 schools and communities through partnerships with local agencies. The Drug-Free Communities Support Program, administered by SAMSHA and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, awards grants to community coalitions for preventive and treatment intervention programs for troubled students, early childhood development, and safe-school policies. Programs for youth include tutoring, recreational activities, volunteering, and mental health services. The Drug-Free Communities Support Program awards grants to community coalitions to reduce substance abuse among youth and disseminate best practices. Vulnerable youth populations include those aging out of foster care, runaways, homeless youth, juvenile justice-involved youth, immigrant youth, youth with disabilities, mental disorders, and those receiving special education. Vulnerable youth face challenges in unstable home and neighborhood environments, impacting their transition to adulthood. Disconnectedness from school and the labor market is a strong indicator of inadequate transition. Developing cognitive, emotional, and vocational skills can lead to positive outcomes in adulthood. Advocates believe all youth have assets and can contribute to their communities. The federal government lacks a comprehensive policy to assist vulnerable youth. The federal government has not developed a single overarching policy or program to assist vulnerable youth, unlike the Older Americans Act for the elderly. Various programs have been working since the 1960s to address the specific needs of vulnerable youth in areas such as vocational, educational, social services, juvenile justice, and health. Recent efforts have been made to create a more comprehensive federal response, such as the YouthBuild Transfer Act of 2006 and the Tom Osborne Youth Coordination Act. President Bush also signed an executive order in February 2008 to establish a federal Interagency. The federal government has not established a unified policy for vulnerable youth, unlike the Older Americans Act for the elderly. Efforts to create a comprehensive federal response include the YouthBuild Transfer Act of 2006 and the Tom Osborne Youth Coordination Act. President Bush signed an executive order in February 2008 to establish a federal Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs, aiming to improve coordination among federal youth agencies. However, legislation targeting vulnerable young people has faced challenges in passing and full implementation. While federal legislation for vulnerable youth has not been passed or implemented recently, Executive Order 13459 and current collaborations like My Brother's Keeper and the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention have started addressing their needs to some extent."
