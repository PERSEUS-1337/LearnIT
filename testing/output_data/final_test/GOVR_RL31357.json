    "content": "Federal interagency coordinative mechanisms are executive entities that provide coordination in policy areas involving multiple agencies. These entities, numbering in the hundreds, vary in types and have different jurisdiction, authority, responsibilities, and leadership. This report and related documents offer information, examinations, and comparisons among these mechanisms. The congressional documents provide information on federal interagency coordinative devices, including rationales for and objections to these mechanisms. The fundamental rationale is to facilitate coordination among federal entities with shared responsibilities in different departments, which is increasingly important due to changing conditions and governmental characteristics. The development of interagency coordinative mechanisms in federal policy-making aims to address overlapping jurisdictions, shared responsibilities, and fragmented policy implementation among agencies. These mechanisms provide a flexible alternative to major reorganizations, allowing for easier modification or abolition based on changing policy priorities, political demands, and societal conditions. Formalized coordination is expected to enhance the development and implementation of public policies. The implementation of public policies benefits from formalized coordination mechanisms to eliminate dysfunctions and enhance effectiveness. These coordinating devices minimize rivalry, duplication of effort, and working at cross-purposes, improving policy effectiveness by increasing resource availability, promoting cooperation among units, integrating responsibilities, and ensuring accountability. Interagency coordinative entities may add bureaucracy, increase costs, and create inefficiencies. New policy priorities can lead to temporary mandates that result in permanent mechanisms. This can entrench the coordinative device, making it difficult to realign functions and responsibilities in the future. Criticisms include the devices being either too weak or too strong. Interagency coordinative entities may face criticism for being too weak or too strong, with concerns about their authority, jurisdiction, and effectiveness in promoting coordination among separate agencies. Critics argue that these devices may only serve as half-measures and call for more comprehensive reorganization, such as merging related components from different departments or agencies. This could lead to a loss of credibility for interagency operations and policy support. Interagency entities can be criticized for having too much power, potentially undermining the responsibilities of individual departments. This lack of standardization and uniformity means each entity differs in location, leadership, and authority, leading to potential conflicts with parent agencies. Interagency entities vary in location, leadership, and membership characteristics. Some are part of an agency head's office, while others are independent with representatives from multiple agencies. Membership can include the President, Vice President, agency heads, or sub-cabinet officials. Interagency entities, including working groups and task forces, consist of personnel from relevant agencies selected by higher echelon officials. Some officers like the Director of Central Intelligence have authority to direct activities and review budgets of other agencies. Other coordinative devices lack explicit powers and focus on reviewing and reporting on activities to various stakeholders. Interagency entities, such as working groups and task forces, vary in authority and permanency. Some are permanent entities established by public law or executive order, while others, like those created by presidential directive, can be changed or replaced. Additionally, there are ad hoc structures, like interagency working groups, formed temporarily through administrative directives or agreements. The powers, responsibilities, and jurisdictions of these organizations differ, with some focusing on specialized tasks with limited authority. Interagency entities, such as working groups and task forces, vary in authority and permanency. Some are permanent entities established by public law or executive order, while others, like those created by presidential directive, can be changed or replaced. The responsibilities, powers, and jurisdictions of these organizations differ, with some focusing on specialized tasks with limited authority. Additionally, coordinative mechanisms have been established, modified, abolished, or merged in response to societal changes, political needs, and perceptions of effectiveness. This has led to a variety of coordinative mechanisms and arrangements. Councils and committees play a key role in coordinating interagency efforts. Councils include the National Security Council, Homeland Security Council, and USA Freedom Corps Council. Committees consist of department and agency heads, sometimes with officials from the Executive Office of the President. Specially created positions or offices cover policy areas that span multiple agencies. The interagency coordination involves various entities such as separate agencies, agency heads with authority over other entities, sub-cabinet boards, committees, and councils, and transfers of personnel, resources, or units among different organizations. Interagency coordination involves various mechanisms such as staff details, transfers of authority, and redeploying personnel for crisis situations. This includes cross-designation of agents, special deputations, and partnerships among different agencies. The Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council were established after the 9/11 attacks by President George W. Bush. The President's Homeland Security Advisory Council provides advice with members from the private sector. The Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council were created after the 9/11 attacks by President George W. Bush. The new office, led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security, has a high profile due to its origin following the terrorist assaults on September 11. The office's mission is to secure the United States against terrorist attacks, giving it significant power and visibility. The Office of Homeland Security, established after 9/11, plays a key role in the \"war on terrorism\" domestically. It was announced by the President in a joint session of Congress and is located in the Executive Office of the President. The director holds cabinet-level status and has a close relationship with the President, guiding advisory councils and committees to acquire relevant information and make recommendations. The Office of Homeland Security, established post 9/11, has a significant role in coordinating the government's response to terrorist attacks within the United States. Various governmental commissions and organizations have advocated for changes in homeland security organization and capacity, laying the groundwork for the office's coordinative function. The office has a wide range of responsibilities in coordinating efforts across different agencies, programs, and activities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks. The homeland security office has limited budget review authority and works with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to identify programs contributing to the Administration's homeland security strategy. The chief advises on agency budgets but does not have formal veto or approval powers, funds to grant agencies, or authority to transfer funds among agencies without new statutory authority. The Office of Homeland Security (OHS) director, not confirmed by the Senate, has limited authority and a small staff. Created by executive order, its jurisdiction is limited to the executive branch. Despite these limitations, the office holds significant influence in coordinating interagency responsibilities. A dispute has arisen over whether the OHS director can be compelled to testify before a congressional committee on homeland security budget matters. The Office of Homeland Security director, not confirmed by the Senate, has limited authority and a small staff. A dispute has arisen over whether the director can be compelled to testify before a congressional committee on homeland security budget matters. President Bush stated that the director doesn't have to testify as he is part of his staff. The Office of Homeland Security director, not Senate-confirmed, refuses to testify before a congressional committee on budget matters, citing Executive Branch prerogative. He offers a public briefing instead, arguing he lacks the authority to testify as an agency head. The Office of Homeland Security director, a non-confirmed appointment, refuses to testify before a congressional committee on budget matters, citing Executive Branch prerogative. Supporters argue he implements public policy and holds cabinet-rank status. E.O. 13228 created a Homeland Security Council to advise the President on homeland security coordination and policy implementation. The Homeland Security Council, established by E.O. 13228, advises the President on homeland security coordination. The chief of homeland security oversees the council's agenda and operations, with three layers of committees assisting in its undertakings. The HSC Principal's Committee serves as the senior forum for homeland security issues, chaired by the homeland security office director. Accompanying it is the HSC Deputies Committee, consisting of deputy secretaries and directors of HSC components. The HSC Deputies Committee, made up of deputy secretaries and directors of HSC components, serves as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for policy issues affecting homeland security. HSC Policy Coordination Committees coordinate the development and implementation of homeland security policies across multiple departments and agencies. These committees, organized along functional lines, address surveillance, intelligence, border security, airspace security, law enforcement, and investigation. Proposals to enhance the Office of Homeland Security's authority or create a new Department of Homeland Security have been discussed since late 2001. Plans involve transferring agencies for better coordination in domestic security efforts. Proposals have been made to enhance the Office of Homeland Security's authority or establish a new Department of Homeland Security to improve coordination in domestic security efforts. President George W. Bush also created the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board to recommend policies and coordinate programs for protecting critical infrastructure information systems. The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, chaired by senior executive branch officials, coordinates efforts to protect physical assets supporting information systems. Members include heads of various departments and officials from the Executive Office of the President. The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, chaired by senior executive branch officials, coordinates efforts to protect physical assets supporting information systems. Members include heads of various departments and officials from the Executive Office of the President, forming its Coordination Committee. The chair reports to both the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security for full coordination. The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, established in 2001, coordinates efforts to protect the nation's critical infrastructure against intentional attacks. President Clinton's PDD-63 assigned specific government functions to departments or agencies. PDD-63 assigned specific government functions to departments or agencies, such as intelligence to the CIA, foreign affairs to the State Department, and national defense to the Defense Department. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism was created to oversee internal security measures and coordinate policy development. This role has evolved into the Homeland Security Council and Office, the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, and the Special Advisor to the President for Cyberspace Security. The Federal Computer Incident Response Center (FedCIRC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) are key components derived from PDD-63. NIPC, housed in the FBI, coordinates federal efforts against computer-based attacks. FedCIRC is a central facility for analyzing and coordinating computer security issues for federal civilian agencies. President George W. Bush established the USA Freedom Act in 2002. President George W. Bush established the USA Freedom Corps in 2002 to coordinate and strengthen federal service opportunities, including homeland security preparedness, public and social service, and international service. The Freedom Corps is an interagency initiative bringing together executive branch departments, agencies, and offices with public service programs. The USA Freedom Corps, established by President George W. Bush in 2002, includes the Citizen Corps, AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and Peace Corps. The Freedom Corps Council, chaired by the President and including various department heads, oversees the initiative. The director of the USA Freedom Corps Office is responsible for managing the council's agenda and recording decisions. The USA Freedom Corps, established by President George W. Bush in 2002, includes the Citizen Corps, AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and Peace Corps. The Freedom Corps Council, chaired by the President and including various department heads, oversees the initiative. The White House Office provides funding and administrative support to the council and office as directed by the Chief of Staff to the President. The National Security Council and its subunits offer interagency coordination on multiple levels. The National Security Council (NSC) consists of various committees and working groups, including the Principals Committee, Deputies Committee, Policy Coordination Committees, and Interagency Working Groups. Established in 1947, the NSC advises the President on integrating domestic, foreign, and military policies related to national security. The National Security Council (NSC) is a special construct headed by the President, with a statutory membership including the Vice President, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense. It has subunits for interagency coordination, such as boards, committees, centers, task forces, and working groups. These mechanisms operate on different levels below the NSC itself, adapting to changing conditions, policy priorities, and presidential administrations. The National Security Council established a Board for Low Intensity Conflict and a Committee on Transnational Threats to coordinate US policies and activities in combating transnational threats. The committee includes key government officials and is tasked with developing guidelines and policies for enhancing coordination among federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence community elements outside the US. The National Security Act established a Committee on Foreign Intelligence to assist in identifying intelligence requirements for national security, establishing priorities among programs, and setting policies for intelligence activities. The Committee on Foreign Intelligence was established to set policies for intelligence activities and conduct annual reviews of the national security interests of the United States. Other specialized units have also been created through executive orders and presidential directives. The NSC, established by Executive Order 12333 in 1981, includes the NSC Principals Committee (NSC/PC) and the NSC Deputies Committee (NSC/DC) as key bodies for reviewing and guiding national security policies. The NSC/PC consists of high-ranking officials like the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, while the NSC/DC serves as a sub-Cabinet forum for policy issues. The NSC includes the NSC Principals Committee and the NSC Deputies Committee, with high-ranking officials like the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. The NSC also has a panel that prescribes and reviews the work of various interagency groups, including NSC Policy Coordination Committees responsible for managing national security policies across different agencies. These committees are organized by geographical regions and functional topics. The NSC/PCC is authorized to establish subordinate Interagency Working Groups to assist in international development, humanitarian assistance, intelligence, and counterintelligence. NSPD-1 abolished pre-existing working groups and established new units, except for those established by statute. PDD 24, issued in 1994, created a new CI structure under the direction of the NSC to coordinate CI policy matters and enhance governmentwide counterintelligence capabilities. The National Counterintelligence Policy Board was established to enhance accountability for CI policy and execution, consisting of senior representatives from various agencies. This structure, created in 1994, was replaced by a new board under President Clinton in 2000, known as \"CI-21.\" This initiative was developed based on recommendations from a Special Review Process led by the DCI, FBI Director, and Secretary of Defense. The new arrangement for national counterintelligence, established by the DCI, FBI Director, and Secretary of Defense, aims to improve interaction with policymakers and the private sector. It includes a board of directors responsible for national counterintelligence, a national CI executive and support organization, and activities focused on interagency coordination and critical asset protection. The integration of the CI budget and resource plans, evaluating strategy effectiveness, identifying gaps, and coordinating national level CI activities are key tasks. Task forces like the rapidly deployable interagency Emergency Support Teams (EST) respond to terrorist incidents domestically and abroad. Additional interagency support structures have been planned based on presidential directives. The United States Government Interagency Domestic Terrorism Concept of Operations Plan establishes a structure for a coordinated national response to terrorism threats. It includes cooperative multi-agency entities like the Strategic Information and Operations Center, Unified Incident Command Post, and Joint Operations Center. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) has key responsibilities in this plan. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), who also heads the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), derives authority from the National Security Act of 1947 and the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949. These laws were created to enhance intelligence gathering and coordination among components of the intelligence community (IC). The DCI has unique powers to task other agencies, access their intelligence collections, control budgets, transfer funds and personnel, and set security clearance standards. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) has authority to appoint and remove members of the National Intelligence Council, which reports to the Director. The council is composed of senior analysts and experts from the public and private sector. The DCI also provides direction for national intelligence collection and establishes requirements and priorities for intelligence gathering. The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) oversees intelligence collection requirements, approves budgets for intelligence activities, and has authority to transfer funds between intelligence programs with approval from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The United States Secret Service (USSS) was established in 1865 after the Civil War for anti-counterfeiting operations. It later took on the responsibility of protecting the President and other protective assignments. Recently, the Secret Service has been tasked with leading security arrangements at national events. The USSS is the lead agency for security at national events and has statutory authority to call upon other federal entities for assistance. The Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 mandates that executive departments and agencies provide temporary and reimbursable assistance to the Secret Service when requested. The Secret Service was given added authority in 1976 to secure assistance from other agencies for protection duties related to the President or Vice President. This change was prompted by the need for better controls and accountability over security arrangements and expenditures at the President's private residences. The Secret Service's authority was clarified to ensure that protective determinations rested with them, and the Director was ultimately responsible. In the 20th Century, the Secret Service was given expanded authority for protective assignments and security responsibilities in the Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000. This includes participating in security operations at special events of national significance, leading interagency task forces at National Special Security Events (NSSEs) attended by protectees like the President and Vice President. The Secret Service was granted expanded authority in the Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 for security at special events like the Superbowl, Winter Olympic Games, and political conventions. This included creating a national network of electronic crime task forces after the 9/11 attacks. The New York enterprise, established in 1995, improved information sharing and coordination among federal agencies, state and local governments, businesses, and academic institutions to combat crimes, including potential terrorist attacks against critical infrastructure. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy coordinates efforts to control illegal drug abuse and devise a national anti-drug strategy. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, also known as the \"drug czar,\" lacks extensive legal authority and autocratic power. The office is strategically placed in the Executive Office of the President for support and coordination among agencies, despite limitations in assigning tasks or changing budgets. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is strategically located within the Executive Office of the President, giving its Director high visibility and authority. The Director is responsible for promulgating the national anti-drug strategy, advising the President on agency organization and budgeting, and ensuring agency compliance with the national drug control strategy. The Director also has powers to review and comment on agency spending plans for anti-drug purposes. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director has authority over agency budgets for anti-drug purposes and can detail personnel among agencies. The Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 enhances the U.S. Secret Service's authority and gives new powers to the Attorney General for specialized duties, including establishing Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces. Efforts to combat trafficking of people led to the Victims of Violence Protection Act of 2000, creating an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking internationally. The task force includes heads of various departments and agencies, chaired by the Secretary of State, with an Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking established within the State Department. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established independent offices of inspector general (OIGs) in federal agencies to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. These offices have the authority to seek assistance from outside agencies and require agency heads to provide necessary information. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established independent offices of inspector general (OIGs) in federal agencies to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The agency head is required to provide information or assistance to the OIGs, and if refused, the OIG can report the circumstances to the head of the establishment involved. OIGs have reporting obligations to the agency head and Congress, including periodic reports summarizing activities and immediate reports on serious problems. Inspectors general belong to coordinative councils that operate under an agency or unit thereof. Inspectors general are part of two councils established by President George H. W. Bush in 1992: the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) for IGs who are presidential appointees in cabinet departments, and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE) for IGs appointed by agency heads in smaller boards and government corporations. Other council members include officials from the Office of Management and Budget, FBI, and Office of Government Ethics. The councils established by President George H. W. Bush in 1992 include the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, and the Deputy Director of the Office of Personnel Management. Their functions involve identifying weaknesses in Federal programs to combat fraud, waste, and abuse, and coordinating Governmentwide activities to address these issues. Committees within the councils focus on various areas such as audits, investigations, legislation, and integrity matters. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 established positions of Chief Financial Officers in 25 departments and agencies, along with a coordinating council to advise and coordinate financial management activities. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was also established in the Executive Office of the President. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established in the Executive Office of the President by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the Environmental Quality Improvement Act of 1970. It is responsible for developing policies that align social, economic, and environmental priorities, advising the President on environmental matters, and overseeing federal agency implementation of NEPA. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), established in 1979, consolidates emergency-related programs previously operated in five separate agencies. FEMA, an independent agency in the executive branch, funds emergency programs, provides guidance and training, and deploys federal resources during catastrophic disasters. It has developed partnerships with other agencies through cooperative agreements to carry out its responsibilities. The U.S. Coast Guard can operate as a service in the Navy during war or as directed by the President. This allows Coast Guard personnel to conduct law enforcement operations on naval vessels at sea. Additionally, personnel can be temporarily transferred between departments or agencies for specific tasks through task forces and working groups. Task forces and working groups are established within organizations to facilitate changes in staff deployment and organizational structure. These efforts are authorized by various means such as public laws, executive orders, and interagency agreements. These transfers are typically temporary and focused on specific tasks, with some exceptions like the Attorney General's fugitive apprehension task forces and the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, which have long-term status. Operational task forces have narrow jurisdictions and specialized duties, bringing together personnel from multiple agencies with shared responsibilities. Task forces and working groups are established to facilitate changes in staff deployment and organizational structure. They bring together personnel from different agencies with shared responsibilities in a policy area, into a new organizational arrangement. For example, Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces were created to address multi-national or multi-state organized criminal enterprises involved in high-level drug trafficking operations and money laundering. Some task forces and working groups have achieved long-term status with broad jurisdiction, involving various federal agencies, state and local entities, and private organizations. Examples include the Secret Service electronic crime task force in New York and interagency groups assisting the National Security Council. The Secret Service is involved in various information and operations centers, working groups, and interagency partnerships. Personnel transfers between agencies aim to enhance interagency cooperation and operational capacity. Staff details or redeployments are used to improve effectiveness in carrying out policies and projects. Involvement in projects includes staff developing contacts with other agencies, gaining experience, and familiarity with different organizations. Officials like the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of ONDCP have authority to detail staff among agencies. Redeployments can occur during crises, like after the September 11 attacks. Amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act allow for military assistance in law enforcement operations at the request of federal agencies. The participation of federal agencies in law enforcement operations includes detecting, monitoring, and communicating air and sea traffic outside the U.S., aerial reconnaissance, interception of vessels and aircraft, and transporting civilian law enforcement personnel. Interagency coordination involves cross-designating agents to carry out duties and use authority from other agencies with overlapping jurisdiction. Interagency coordination in law enforcement operations involves cross-designating agents to carry out duties and use authority from other agencies with overlapping jurisdiction, including special deputation by the United States Marshals Service for personnel in other federal departments or agencies. This allows for expanded capacity and capabilities of U.S. Marshals by deputizing personnel from various sources. U.S. Marshals can deputize personnel from other federal agencies to assist in law enforcement duties independently for specific operations or durations. This special deputation grants police powers to agencies lacking them, allowing them to carry firearms, make arrests, and execute warrants. This enables recipients to conduct law enforcement operations on their own without relying on other officers. The U.S. Marshals can deputize personnel from other federal agencies to assist in law enforcement duties independently. Recipients must have approval to acquire police powers and renew them later. This allows the Marshals Service to track operations, coordinate with their projects, and assess performance. Federal interagency coordination mechanisms have become prevalent, ranging from well-established entities to joint task forces and working groups. The growth of interagency devices in the U.S. is driven by various factors such as expanding federal responsibilities, increasing complexity of public policies, and changes in policy priorities. These devices aim to improve cooperation and coordination among entities for more effective policy implementation. Improving policy implementation can be done quickly and efficiently through different coordinative models. However, concerns arise regarding the impact of some devices, which may create bureaucratic layers, interfere with agency responsibilities, or bypass legislative oversight."
