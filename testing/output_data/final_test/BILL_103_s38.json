If a claim was not raised properly in State proceedings and resulted in actual prejudice, it can only be entertained if the failure was due to State action violating the Constitution or laws of the United States, or if the Federal right asserted was newly recognized by the Supreme Court after the procedural default. The Act, named the \"Reform of Federal Intervention in State Proceedings Act of 1993,\" amends Section 2244 of title 28, United States Code, regarding claims raised in State proceedings for a writ of habeas corpus.
