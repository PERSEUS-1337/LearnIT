    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congenital Heart Futures Act\". Congress finds that congenital heart defects are the most common and deadly group of birth defects, affecting nearly 1 percent of all live births. Approximately 36,000 births a year are affected, with a child born with a congenital heart defect every 15 minutes. The population of those living with congenital heart disease in the United States is rapidly growing, with around 800,000 children and 1,000,000 adults requiring specialized life-long cardiac care. Despite advancements, there is currently no cure for congenital heart disease. (4) There is no cure for congenital heart disease. Survivors of childhood treatment face life-long risks including heart failure, stroke, and neurocognitive dysfunction. (5) Less than 10 percent of adults with complex congenital heart disease receive recommended cardiac care, leading to premature death and disability. (6) Life expectancy for those with congenital heart disease is significantly lower than the general population, with those born with moderately complex defects having an estimated life expectancy of 55. The prevalence and seriousness of congenital heart disease are highlighted, with limited federal research and awareness activities. Strategic plans from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute aim to improve treatment for adults with congenital heart diseases. The curr_chunk focuses on research related to congenital heart disease, including understanding genetic basis, improving care for children and adults with the disease. Public Health Service Act amended to include public education and awareness programs for congenital heart disease. The Secretary may conduct public education campaigns on congenital heart disease in collaboration with relevant organizations. Eligible entities can receive grants for awareness programs. SEC. 399II. NATIONAL CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE REGISTRY is added to Title III of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may enhance infrastructure to track congenital heart disease epidemiology and establish the National Congenital Heart Disease Registry. The purpose is to support research on patient health services and identify areas for educational outreach and prevention. The Congenital Heart Disease Registry may include data on incidence, prevalence, demographic factors, risk factors, causation, treatment approaches, and outcome measures for congenital heart disease patients in the United States. Analysis of outcome measures aims to derive evidence-based best practices and guidelines. The National Congenital Heart Registry aims to collect longitudinal data on individuals of all ages with congenital heart disease, including infants, children, adolescents, and adults. It will coordinate with existing data systems and surveillance programs at the federal, state, and local levels. The Congenital Heart Disease Registry will be accessible to the public and researchers, while maintaining patient privacy according to regulations. Entities seeking grants must have expertise in congenital heart disease and meet application requirements. SEC. 399JJ. ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE. The Secretary may establish an Advisory Committee on Congenital Heart Disease through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The committee's members, appointed by the Secretary, must include representatives from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a national patient advocacy organization for congenital heart disease patients, and an epidemiologist with data registry experience. The Advisory Committee on Congenital Heart Disease, appointed by the Secretary, includes clinicians with experience in diagnosing and treating congenital heart disease, using medical data registries, and researchers with expertise in researching the disease. The committee's duties involve reviewing and making recommendations on the National Congenital Heart Disease Registry's development, data collection, storage, collection methods, and data use. The Advisory Committee on Congenital Heart Disease will submit a report to the Secretary every 180 days, including recommendations on data use and other relevant matters. SEC. 6. CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE RESEARCH. An amendment is made to the Public Health Service Act regarding congenital heart disease. The Director of the Institute may expand research on congenital heart disease, including causation, long-term outcomes, diagnosis, treatment, and barriers to care for individuals with the condition. The Director of the Institute may coordinate research efforts related to congenital heart disease among multiple research institutions and develop research networks. Additionally, the Director shall consider the application of research and activities to minority and medically underserved communities. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 to carry out the amendments made by this Act."
