    "content": "SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended. Congress has reauthorized and made changes to the act multiple times, with the most recent reauthorization in 2016. Funding for OAA programs was authorized through FY2019, with grants administered by the Department of Labor. SCSEP is the only OAA program administered by DOL and is supported by discretionary appropriations under the DOL-HHS appropriations bill. SCSEP operates on DOL's program year, which is nine months behind the fiscal year. Programs under Title V of the OAA may also be known as CSEOA programs, with DOL using the terms interchangeably. The OAA establishes three reservations from its total appropriation. Title V of the OAA allocates funds for various projects, including DOL-selected pilots, territories like Guam and American Samoa, and activities supporting eligible individuals like American Indian and Pacific Islander/Asian American. The funds also support formula grants for national and state organizations, with national grantees receiving the majority of funds in PY2018. National grantees include organizations like AARP and the National Council on Aging. In PY2018, about 15-20 national grantee organizations, such as AARP and the National Council on Aging, received funds. State agencies received 22% of the grant funds. Both national and state grantees subgrant funds to partner organizations for actual employment. The OAA allocates excess funds based on formulas linked to the number of individuals aged 55 and over and the state's per capita income. States with larger elderly populations and lower incomes receive more funds. Hold harmless provisions ensure proportional funding if funds are below FY2000 levels. Since PY2010, grant funds have been consistently below FY2000 levels, with each state receiving a proportionate share based on their FY2000 levels. Funding is allocated to national grantees and state agencies, with the proportion varying. States with larger elderly populations and lower incomes receive more funds based on formulas. Hold harmless provisions ensure proportional funding if funds are below FY2000 levels. The state governor must submit a state plan to DOL to receive SCSEP funds, which can be independent or part of a combined plan with WIOA. The plan must identify eligible individuals and areas in need of services, and be developed in consultation with stakeholders. Coordination with WIOA activities and minimizing duplication is required, with funds typically allocated to subgrantees or hosts. Grantees receiving funds from DOL allocate them to subgrantees or host agencies for work placements. Participants must be 55 or older, unemployed, and meet income criteria. Priority is given to those with additional barriers to employment, such as age 65+, disabilities, limited English proficiency, veterans, or homelessness. The SCSEP program under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act prioritizes eligible veterans and individuals at risk of homelessness. Host agencies can employ participants part-time in various community service activities, including social, health, and educational services. Participants are paid at least the federal minimum wage or prevailing rates for similar occupations. Title V of the OAA does not define \"part-time\" work or limit participant hours. The cost per authorized position is calculated based on the federal minimum wage and hours worked. Grantees assess participants' skills and develop individual employment plans, including post-service objectives and timelines. Training and supportive services may also be provided. The SCSEP program offers training, supportive services, and financial assistance for participants. There is a limit of 48 months of participation per individual, with an average duration of 27 months. Grantees must match SCSEP grants so that federal funds cover no more than 90% of the project cost. The Department of Labor (DOL) requires SCSEP grantees to match federal funds up to 90% of project costs. Waivers for match requirements are possible in emergencies or economically depressed areas. 75% of grants must go towards wages and benefits for participants, with a possible reduction to 65% for training and services. Administrative expenses cannot exceed 13.5% of the grant. Six core indicators are established for CSEOA grantees, with three focusing on unsubsidized employment and earnings post-program participation. The performance accountability measures for SCSEP grantees include indicators for unsubsidized employment, earnings, effectiveness in serving stakeholders, and the number of individuals served. These measures were established by the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 established performance accountability measures for SCSEP grantees, who negotiate expected performance levels with DOL. Performance is assessed at the grantee level, with oversight of subgrantees and host agencies. Performance is measured as a percentage of the negotiated level, such as 50% of participants in unsubsidized employment in the second quarter after exit. If a grantee reaches 96% of its agreed-upon performance level, it is considered to have met the core level of performance. Failure to meet performance levels may result in technical assistance and a corrective action plan. National grantees failing for four consecutive years may be disqualified from future competitions, while state grantees failing for three consecutive years must award funds to a new grantee through a competition. DOL provides SCSEP participation data reports by program year. The DOL provides various reports by program year, including Aggregate and Individual Performance Reports, Nationwide Quarterly Progress reports, and Service to Minority Individuals reports as required under Section 515 of the OAA. These reports detail the performance of grantees, total participation, demographics, barriers to employment, and outcomes of minorities."
