    "content": "Section 139 of the IRC exempts qualified disaster relief payments from the recipient's income, including payments for personal, family, living, or funeral expenses, repair or rehabilitation of a personal residence, and government assistance for promoting general welfare after a qualified disaster. This exclusion applies to expenses not covered by insurance. For taxpayers whose principal residence is damaged or destroyed by a disaster, gross income does not include insurance payments for household living expenses during the period of non-use. The exclusion applies to actual living expenses exceeding normal expenses incurred. Expenses incurred due to a casualty for housing, food, and transportation can be deducted by taxpayers in disaster situations. Special temporary rules have been enacted by Congress in various acts like KETRA and the GO Zone Act. The IRS can postpone tax-related deadlines for those affected by a federally declared disaster, including filing returns and making tax payments. KETRA granted the IRS authority to postpone deadlines for income, gift, and estate taxes. Underpayment of estimated income tax incurs a penalty, which can be waived in certain circumstances. Rollover distributions from retirement accounts must be transferred within 60 days to avoid penalties, but the Secretary has the power to waive this period in hardship situations. The Treasury Secretary can waive the 60-day rollover deadline in hardship situations like casualties or disasters. The Heartland Act and related acts provided temporary rules for various tax provisions for federally declared disasters. Taxpayers can deduct unreimbursed property losses not related to business. Unreimbursed losses of property from casualties, like hurricanes, can be deducted if not connected to a trade or business. The deduction is based on the decrease in fair market value compared to the taxpayer's adjusted basis, subject to limitations. The deduction is generally claimed in the year of the loss. The Heartland Act made changes for individuals affected by federally declared disasters, waiving restrictions and increasing deductions. Capital expenditures are typically added to a property's basis, except for certain property under IRC Section 179 which allows for immediate expensing. Total cost of Section 179 property cannot exceed $125,000. The Heartland Act increased Section 179 limitations by up to $100,000 and $600,000 for qualified disaster area property for federally declared disasters before January 1, 2010. It also added IRC Section 198A for full expensing of qualified expenditures related to hazardous substances, debris removal, and property repair after a disaster. This provision only applies to disasters before January 1, 2010. The Heartland Act allowed taxpayers to carry back and deduct net operating losses (NOL) for up to 20 years after the NOL year, with extended periods for certain individuals, small businesses, farmers, and qualified losses from federally declared disasters before January 1, 2010. It also suspended the alternative minimum tax provision for NOL deductions and provided for an additional depreciation amount for certain types of property. The Heartland Act introduced a 50% bonus depreciation provision for qualified property from federally declared disasters before January 1, 2010. Mortgage revenue bonds finance below-market rate mortgages for low and moderate-income homebuyers, with exceptions for low-income areas.

It allowed owner-financing for home repair as a qualified rehabilitation loan up to $150,000. Other federal provisions also provided temporary relief for capital expenditures. Section 198 allowed taxpayers to expense qualifying environmental remediation costs for hazardous substances at contaminated sites before January 1, 2012. The provision has been extended multiple times but has now expired. The Heartland Act and GO Zone Act temporarily extended Section 198 for specific disaster areas and treated petroleum products as hazardous substances. C corporations can deduct charitable donations based on inventory basis and appreciated value. KETRA allowed enhanced deductions for food and book donations, extended multiple times, most recently through 2011. Involuntary conversion occurs when property is destroyed or stolen. Involuntary conversion happens when property is converted to money or other property due to destruction, theft, seizure, or condemnation. If the received cash or property is worth less than the basis of the converted property, the taxpayer incurs a loss eligible for deduction. If the received cash or property is worth more than the basis of the converted property, a gain is realized, which may or may not be immediately included in gross income. No immediate tax consequences apply if the property is converted to similar property, but if it is converted to cash or dissimilar property, any gain must be recognized. If property is involuntarily converted to cash or dissimilar property, the taxpayer must recognize any gain unless purchasing similar property within a certain time period. An election is available to recognize gain only if the amount realized exceeds the cost of the new property. Taxpayers whose principal residence is converted due to a disaster have special rules for insurance proceeds. If property is involuntarily converted to cash or dissimilar property, the taxpayer must recognize any gain unless purchasing similar property within a certain time period. An election is available to recognize gain only if the amount realized exceeds the cost of the new property. Taxpayers whose principal residence is converted due to a disaster have special rules for insurance proceeds. In cases of federally declared disasters, the replacement period for property involuntarily converted is extended to four years.

The replacement period for condemned business property is three years, but can be extended to five years in applicable disaster areas.

Individuals with specific tax attributes were required to reduce them by the excluded amount, deferring the tax impact.

The credits ranged from 25% to 40% of wages based on hours worked. Eligible employees had to meet specific criteria related to the disaster events.

The credits were for businesses that continued to pay wages to employees unable to work due to the disaster. Eligible employees had to work in the disaster area and the credit equaled 40% of wages up to $6,000. The credits were limited to businesses with up to 200 employees per day before the disaster. The Acts also excluded certain employer-provided housing from employee income and allowed a 30% credit for that amount. The GO Zone Act and Heartland Act allowed states to issue tax-exempt bonds for various projects in disaster areas. The maximum amount of bonds each state could issue was determined by population and capped at $2,500 and $1,000 per person respectively. The Job Creation Act and GO Zone Act allowed states to issue tax-exempt bonds for disaster relief projects based on population. New York could issue up to $8 billion in bonds for various projects in the disaster zone. Additionally, operators of low-income rental projects could rely on displaced individuals' income representations. Section 142(d) bonds allow displaced individuals to provide income qualifications for tenancy within six months of displacement.

The standard business mileage rate is set by the IRS and was 55.5 cents per mile for 2012 and 56.5 cents per mile for 2013. Additionally, both KETRA and the Heartland Act provided a temporary exclusion from gross income for qualifying charitable volunteer mileage. The Job Creation Act shortened the recovery period for leasehold improvement property to five years in the New York disaster zone. KETRA, the GO Zone Act, and the Heartland Act allowed disaster victims to use prior year's income for tax credits. Taxpayers qualified if the disaster displaced them from their home. The Treasury Secretary could adjust tax laws for disaster-affected taxpayers to prevent loss of deductions or credits. Eligible individuals could claim the Hope Scholarship or Lifetime Learning credit for tuition expenses. The Hope credit was 100% of the first $1,000 of expenses plus 50% of the next $1,000.

Special rules were created for timber producers in disaster zones, including an increased carry back period to five years under IRC Section 172. The GO Zone Act extended the Section 172 carry back period to five years for certain losses related to timber property in disaster zones. This allowed for the deduction of public utility disaster losses in the fifth taxable year before the disaster."
