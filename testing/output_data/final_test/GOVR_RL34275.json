    "content": "The House and Senate approved an omnibus FY2008 appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, providing $485 billion in regular FY2008 appropriations. The bill also includes $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense. The funding is projected to sustain Army accounts until mid-June and Marine Corps accounts for a longer period. Congress initially faced an impasse on supplemental funding until the bill was signed into law on December 26. On November 14, the House approved a bill for $50 billion in war costs with a troop withdrawal requirement. The Senate rejected the bill and the White House threatened a veto. On December 17, the House approved $31 billion for Operation Enduring Freedom. The Senate later approved $70 billion in supplemental appropriations without spending limits. The House approved $460 billion for Defense Department baseline programs in FY2008. The Administration requested $189.3 billion for war-related costs in FY2008. Until supplemental appropriations were enacted, the Department of Defense funded military operations with funds from the regular FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act. In FY2008, Congress approved $16.8 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, but the remaining funds were held up due to the ongoing debate over Iraq policy. Secretary of Defense Gates warned of potential Army and Marine Corps funding shortages by February and March, leading to the possibility of shutting down Army bases by mid-February. Secretary Gates warned of potential Army and Marine Corps funding shortages by February and March, leading to the possibility of shutting down all Army bases by mid-February next year. This would result in furloughs of 100,000 civilian and 100,000 contractor personnel, with notifications to personnel starting in December. The Defense Department requested approval to transfer $4.5 billion to extend Army operations for two to three weeks, with funding estimated to run out on February 23. The Army and Marine Corps faced funding shortages by February and March, with potential shutdowns of bases and furloughs of personnel. The Defense Department requested approval to transfer $4.5 billion to extend operations, with funds projected to run out on February 23. Army and Marine Corps Operation and Maintenance accounts were crucial for various activities, including recruitment, training, and equipment maintenance. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act provided $27.4 billion for these purposes. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. Without supplemental appropriations, the Army and Marine Corps faced funding shortages by February and March, risking base shutdowns and personnel furloughs. A requested transfer of $4.1 billion to the Army would extend operations by two to three weeks. The Defense Department could extend operations by transferring additional funds or invoking the Feed and Forage Act. Army Chief of Staff George Casey expressed concerns about unstable funding disrupting military operations. The Army Chief of Staff George Casey is concerned about the impact of unstable funding on military operations, especially as soldiers are redeploying from Iraq and Afghanistan. Discussions about closing or reducing tasks at installations are distressing for those returning after 15 months away. The Administration used cash flowing to fund operations for the Iraq war, starting in 2004. Congress added unrequested funds for war expenses in FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration requested a bridge fund of $50 billion in FY2006, but only began to request appropriations for it in FY2007. Alternatives for extending Army and Marine Corps operations include transferring additional funds from working capital funds, slowing the pace of obligations, invoking the Feed and Forage Act, and using standing authorities to limit costs. The Defense Department planned to transfer funds from Air Force and Navy personnel accounts to the Army and JIEDDO, as well as shift cash balances to the Army. This transfer would exhaust the General Transfer Authority provided by the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act, but additional funds were available in working capital funds. Transferring excess cash balances is permitted by the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act allows working capital funds in the Defense Department to maintain cash balances for disbursements. Excess cash balances can be transferred to other accounts, including service operation and maintenance accounts. As of December 2007, $628 million from FY2008 excess cash balances had been used. The Defense Department used $1.4 billion from excess cash balances to offset Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense-Wide operation and maintenance accounts. The Government Accountability Office reported $3.5 billion in excess cash balances at the start of FY2008, leaving $2.1 billion available. By tapping into the remaining funds, operations for the Army and Marine Corps could have been extended for a week or two, reducing financial flexibility for future developments. DOD requested Congress to restore $3.7 billion in transfers to the Air Force. The Defense Department requested Congress to restore $3.7 billion in transfers to the Air Force and Navy. If Congress did not act, the Defense Department would have limited transfer authority, leading to potential restrictions on Army and Marine Corps activities to reduce obligations by up to $3.6 billion over three months. The Army and Marine Corps could have deferred funding by delaying depot maintenance orders, potentially reducing obligations by up to $5 billion over four months. This would have allowed for an additional three weeks of operations. Some measures could have been less disruptive if undertaken temporarily. The Army and Marine Corps could have deferred funding by delaying depot maintenance orders, potentially reducing obligations by up to $5 billion over four months. This would have allowed for an additional three weeks of operations. Congress may need to consider the impact of reduced funds on military readiness and other related matters. Defense Department officials emphasized the need for more significant cuts due to uncertainty about supplemental funding. The Defense Department would have to shut down operations almost completely in the absence of funding, leading to basic security and safety personnel operating on military bases. Day care centers and libraries would cease to operate due to lack of funds. Defense officials faced the challenge of implementing a shut off of funds, rather than coping with a delay in funding. The Feed and Forage Act gives the Defense Department authority to finance some costs of military operations. The Feed and Forage Act, enacted before the Civil War, allows the Defense Department to finance military operations in advance of congressional appropriations. It has been used to pay for unplanned contingencies and sustain operations during delayed appropriations. The Act permits funds to be obligated for clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, and medical supplies, but not exceeding the current year's necessities. These categories cover most activities in operation and maintenance accounts, including transportation for combat operations and equipment repairs. The Feed and Forage Act allows the Pentagon to fund military operations in advance of congressional appropriations, covering expenses like equipment repairs and spare parts in Southeast Asia. However, it does not permit payment for uniformed personnel or weapons. Pentagon spokesperson Geoff Morrell mentioned that the Act is only used in extraordinary circumstances to provide for the survival of personnel, emphasizing that it is a desperate measure not currently being considered. The Feed and Forage Act has been used in the past to finance major military operations when appropriated funds were insufficient, providing considerable flexibility for the Department of Defense to marshal funding. In FY1968, $7.4 billion was used during the Vietnam War, and in FY1991, $2.6 billion was used for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The Feed and Forage Act grants the Department of Defense flexibility to fund military operations in case of unexpected events. Concerns have been raised about the Act's implications for congressional war powers, especially if used for combat operations when Congress has not approved war funding. Past debates and proposals to repeal the Act highlight ongoing concerns about eroding congressional authority. Current use of the Act may raise similar worries unless Congress restricts funding for specific operations. The Feed and Forage Act allows the Defense Department to obligate funds but not make actual expenditures without congressional appropriations. This could lead to contractors agreeing to deferred payments. The Act may require deficiency appropriations, which have not been used frequently since the 1950s. There are other authorities in standing law that could be used to extend Army and Marine Corps operations. One provision that could extend Army and Marine Corps operations is 10 USC 165, allowing the Secretary of Defense to assign responsibility to other components of the Defense Department for support of combatant commands. The Secretary of Defense may assign administration and support responsibilities for forces to other components of the Department of Defense, subject to their authority. This includes assigning management and budget responsibilities to the Air Force and Navy for support activities like food and housing services and contracts for linguists. In FY2008, $6.2 billion is requested for various war support activities, including $1.1 billion for linguist contracts and $675 million for subsistence for DOD civilians and contractors. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to detail civilian personnel from one service to another, potentially extending Army and Marine Corps operations without supplemental funding by assigning responsibilities to the Air Force and Navy. The FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $32.2 billion for Air Force O&M and $33.1 billion for Navy O&M, which could further extend Army operations if responsibilities were shifted. The Defense Department has the authority to extend Army and Marine Corps operations by assigning responsibilities to the Air Force and Navy, potentially extending operations by a month-and-a-half. This unprecedented use of authority raises concerns about undermining congressional limitations on funds and the integrity of the account structure. The Defense Department warned that funding for Army and Marine Corps operations could run out in February or March, with calculations supporting this projection. Transferring limited additional funds could further extend military operations. The Defense Department has the authority to extend Army and Marine Corps operations by transferring limited additional funds, potentially extending operations by a month-and-a-half. Excess cash balances in working capital funds could be as high as $2.1 billion, but tapping into these funds would reduce DOD's flexibility. The Army projected that measures to slow down operations could avoid up to $3.6 billion in obligations over three months, but these measures may disrupt day-to-day operations. Deferring new orders for depot maintenance could reduce planned obligations by $400 million per month. The Defense Department has the authority to extend Army and Marine Corps operations by transferring limited additional funds, potentially extending operations by a month-and-a-half. Measures to reduce funding requirements could provide up to $7.3 billion, allowing operations to continue until the end of March 2008. The Feed and Forage Act could potentially finance up to $7.4 billion of war-related operations, sustaining operations for another month or longer. However, using this act raises significant war powers issues. The Feed and Forage Act raises war powers issues by potentially allowing the Executive Branch to bypass legislative restrictions on war funds. The Act could give the Secretary of Defense unprecedented flexibility in reallocating support activities. This could undermine congressional controls on fund usage. Tables show how long Army and Marine Corps funding would last without additional appropriations. The estimated funding for the Army and Marine Corps in the FY2008 consolidated appropriations bill, including the McConnell $70 billion defense bridge fund, is expected to last longer with higher planned obligation rates. The Army is projected to exhaust funding by February 23 based on monthly obligation rates. The estimated funding for the Army and Marine Corps in the FY2008 consolidated appropriations bill, including the McConnell $70 billion defense bridge fund, is expected to last longer with higher planned obligation rates. The assumed Marine Corps obligation rate is close to the average monthly rate reflected in Marine Corps budget requests. The projected obligation rates reflect the average monthly rate of funding that would result from amounts requested in the regular FY2008 defense appropriations act and in the amended supplemental appropriations request for each budget account. If obligations rates were slower, money would last longer."
