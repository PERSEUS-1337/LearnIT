    "content": "The 20th century saw significant changes in the American administrative state, with a focus on executive organization and reorganization through landmark commissions. These commissions studied philosophical norms and values guiding their work, emphasizing institutional issues. The landmark commission approach in the 20th century emphasized institutional issues and structural changes resulting from recommendations. The term \"reorganization\" encompassed more than just structural changes, as laws could be passed to achieve policy objectives. The Inspectors General Act of 1978 altered agency structures and behaviors. The discussion of landmark commissions in the 20th century is guided by six crucial periods in administrative management evolution. The evolution of the executive branch organization in the 20th century is analyzed through six crucial periods, including the Founders' political theory in 1789, the interplay between the President and Congress, the Progressive Movement, the rise and decline of orthodox management, the interregnum period, and the emergence of New Public Management. Landmark commissions from the 20th century, starting with the Keep Commission in 1905, are examined in chronological order, highlighting conflicting values in administrative agency supervision. The recurring nature of value issues in administrative agency supervision is evident in commission recommendations. The question arises whether there is a need for periodic reviews and realignments of government structure in the 21st century. Legislation is frequently introduced in Congress to establish commissions with broad mandates. Senator Fred Thompson introduced the \"Government for the 21st Century Act\" in the 106th Congress, aiming to establish a Commission on Government Restructuring and Reform to reduce costs and increase effectiveness of the Executive Branch. The Commission was to submit recommendations by December 1, 2002, followed by public comment and a final report to Congress for implementation. The \"Government for the 21st Century Act\" introduced by Senator Fred Thompson aimed to establish a Commission on Government Restructuring and Reform to improve the Executive Branch's efficiency and reduce costs. However, Congress did not act on the proposal. The question now arises whether a new comprehensive commission is necessary, especially in light of post-9/11 events. The debate continues on whether organizational management should be a separate field or tied to the budgetary process, and the extent to which departments and agencies should have autonomy in initiating organizational changes. The possibility of centralizing organizational management under a central agency is also being discussed. The report discusses the evolution of executive branch management through temporary commissions in the 20th century. It raises questions about the values that should guide governance in the 21st century and the need for a central agency to apply management principles uniformly. The report delves into the historical significance of landmark commissions in shaping the executive branch's theoretical foundations. While classical political theory influenced the Framers in establishing a democratic republic, they relied on their own experiences rather than traditional texts for guidance in organizing and administering executive powers. The Framers relied on their own experiences to shape the executive branch after the Revolutionary War. Alexander Hamilton's frustrations during the Confederational period influenced the discussions on organizing the executive branch at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The Constitution is vague on organizational matters, but there was a lively concern for generating energy in the executive branch. Hamilton emphasized the importance of energy in Federalist #70. The Framers emphasized the need for energy in the executive branch, as highlighted by Hamilton in Federalist #70. They created an independent presidency with specific powers to prevent an overbearing Congress. Their focus was on ensuring an energetic Executive, not a too-dependent one. The fear of a too-dependent President dominated by Congress was a concern for the Framers, who emphasized the need for an energetic Executive. The continuity between the old and new systems was maintained, with key laws and authorities remaining intact. The Framers were willing to break new ground in establishing the administrative elements of the new government. The new government of the United States reflected 18th-century Enlightenment values, unlike Great Britain and France, which had poorly organized and corrupt administrative systems. Enlightenment philosophy emphasized reason and scientific methodology, with Alexander Hamilton considered the \"father of public administration.\" France's feudal administrative structure was swept away by the Revolution. Alexander Hamilton, considered the \"father of public administration,\" argued that public administration was a \"science\" and believed in creating a government that was efficient and representative. In Federalist #9, Hamilton discussed the advancements in political science, such as the distribution of power, legislative balances, and representation of the people in the legislature. The Framers believed in the possibility of creating a rational and effective government. The Framers believed in creating a rational and democratically accountable administrative structure, following principles of organization. The establishment of executive departments, including Treasury, State, and War, was one of the first orders of business for the new Congress in 1789. The role of historical and legal precedent in the federal executive establishment was evident during the early years of the Republic. The Federalists established a unitary administrative structure under the President, assigning functions to three departments. This was intended to complement their theory of government, emphasizing the need for governmental power to avoid impotence. They did not advocate for irresponsible power but sought a government capable of governing effectively. The Federalists established a unitary administrative structure under the President, assigning functions to three departments to avoid impotence. In contrast, Thomas Jefferson's theory of organization focused on citizen participation and viewed government as utilitarian and minimalist. Jefferson believed in rotation-in-office to prevent the \"degeneracy of public servants,\" while Hamilton saw government as a catalyst for greatness. Jefferson maintained the existing organization and structure of government, with Congress asserting more authority over executive agencies. The concept of an integrated executive branch under the President remained persuasive throughout the 19th century. Only four permanent \"detached agencies\" were created before 1860. The federal government's functions were initially assigned to existing departments or new ones, like the Department of the Interior in 1849. The Civil Service Commission and Interstate Commerce Commission marked a shift from departmentalism in the late 19th century, driven by the civil service reform movement. This period saw rapid industrialization straining government capacity, leading to calls for regulation in various sectors. The expansion of national capacity in America around the turn of the century was a response to industrialism, leading to the construction of a centralized bureaucratic apparatus. Congress exercised leverage over administrative affairs through its control of the purse strings and authority to initiate investigations. In the late 19th century, Congress expanded its investigatory activities to include management issues. Two notable inquiries were conducted by a Senate committee and a joint commission, resulting in the enactment of laws to improve agency business methods. The late 19th-century commissions led to the creation of new agencies, focusing on the institutionalized presidency and its relationship with departments and agencies. The governmental reform movement impacted both municipal and national levels, as Congress struggled to directly manage federal agencies. Congressional leaders believed only they could bring about administrative changes, but their unfocused approach hindered effective reform efforts. Congress was too unfocused for administrative reform, leading to a shift towards delegating authority to the President and executive agencies. However, the institutionalized presidency lacked the necessary leverage over agencies due to limited staff, budgetary authority, and management laws. The new century presented opportunities for Presidents to enhance their leadership in a rapidly growing government with increased resource requirements. Progressives believed in the separation of politics and administration, with the legislative branch forming policy and the executive branch implementing it. This concept was popularized by Frank J. Goodnow in his book \"Politics and Administration\" in 1900. The Progressive era emphasized the separation of politics and administration, with the legislative branch forming policy and the executive branch implementing it in an impartial manner. Scientific management principles, advocated by Frederick W. Taylor, were believed to be applicable to public administration as well. The Progressive era promoted \"scientific management\" for the executive branch, favoring reorganization and centralized authority. Scientific management emphasized the perfectibility of human institutions. The Progressive era promoted \"scientific management\" for the executive branch, emphasizing the perfectibility of human institutions through properly constructed and managed institutions. Reformers believed that managers could triumph over the alleged ineptness of politicians, with the President as the Chief Manager of a revitalized national government. This required a comprehensive plan and integrated executive branch organization with strict lines of responsibility and accountability. The struggle to increase the President's managerial capacity led to reorganization of executive agencies and functions. The Progressive era emphasized reorganization of executive agencies as a key component of governance. Theodore Roosevelt believed in the concept of reorganization for administrative management, passing the 1903 Act to create the Department of Commerce and Labor. The Department of Commerce and Labor was authorized by the President to transfer units engaged in statistical or scientific work through an Executive Order. Progressives believed in information, analysis, and experts, leading to the idea of \"commissions\" consisting of experts and political leaders to address issues. During the Progressive era, advisory commissions consisting of experts and political leaders were established to address issues in a less politically influenced manner. This approach aimed to make the government more efficient and accountable. A \"good government\" alliance formed between business leaders, academics, and social reformers, but it was short-lived, ending with America's entry into World War I. During the Progressive era, an alliance focused on efficient government and accountability was formed, but ended with America's entry into World War I. The Progressive values emphasized presidential administrative leadership and hierarchical structure in organizational design and management, which still hold appeal today. However, post-World War II saw a rejection of these values in practice, with Presidents now viewing organizational structures as a minor element in the political equation. There is a lack of consensus on guiding principles for organizational design and management. The decline in central management agencies of the U.S. government has led to a fragmented political environment where agencies, interest groups, and congressional committees play a significant role in organizational design and management. Landmark commissions have shaped the idea that management, particularly organizational design, is guided by theoretical premises. The prevailing theoretical premises of organizational management in the federal government emphasized hierarchy, staff agencies, limited span of control, and subdivision of work based on scientific principles. These principles became known as the \"orthodox theory\" of public administration. The 1937 essay by Luther Gulick, \"Notes on the Theory of Organization,\" accompanied the Report of the President's Committee on Administrative Management. The orthodox principles of organization faced criticism from behaviorists who labeled them as mere \"proverbs\" lacking adequate guidance on their application. The prevailing doctrine in organizational management was deemed inadequate, leading to a call for a new theory based on scientific research. Behaviorists have struggled for decades to develop a comprehensive theory to replace traditional principles, causing a decline in their legitimacy among academics and practitioners. Public administrators are hesitant to openly support orthodox organizational principles, fearing criticism for being politically naive. This shift away from traditional principles has created an opportunity for those advocating for a new, all-encompassing management approach. In the 1960s, a break occurred between academics and political leaders regarding orthodox organizational principles. Political leaders still use orthodox rhetoric when proposing reorganization, citing reasons like improving \"economy and efficiency.\" The Ash Council report of 1971 was the last landmark study to reaffirm orthodox principles. The Ash Council report of 1971 to President Nixon highlighted public management principles, but subsequent landmark commissions like President Carter's PRP and President Reagan's Grace Commission rejected orthodox organizational principles and government theory. They also displayed an anti-government, populist bias in their thinking. Administrative reforms from Carter to Clinton reflected populist concerns about government size and performance. The purpose shifted to align with public expectations, moving away from orthodox principles. The PRP under Carter lacked a guiding theory, focusing on management instead. The PRP believed in bottom-up management and pragmatism over doctrine. The Carter and Reagan administrations rejected the strong institutional presidency in favor of a political presidency. In the 1980s, there was a lack of comprehensive organizational management theory to replace orthodox principles. The Carter and Reagan administrations moved towards deconstructing the state, showing a populist distrust of government. The Clinton Administration aimed to \"reinvent government\" to make it smaller and more focused on performance. This shift was influenced by economic literature advocating for market superiority over government-managed economies post-World War II. Public choice theory, based on rational self-serving maximization, had a significant political impact globally, leading to the collapse of planned economies and the rise of free market advocacy. The emergence of New Public Management in the 1990s further promoted government management reforms internationally. The New Public Management (NPM) promotes convergence of governmental and private sectors based on generic management principles. The American variation, \"reinventing government,\" led by Vice President Al Gore, rejected public choice theory in favor of business school language. This model has been rapidly accepted worldwide, causing some disruptions. The 1993 National Performance Review (NPR) Report emphasizes the shift towards results over legal processes in government management, aiming to create effective entrepreneurial governments. Vice President Gore highlighted the need for a new approach to power distribution, breaking down barriers between sectors. The NPR vision aimed to create government/private partnerships with autonomous bodies run by managers under contract. Critics challenge the entrepreneurial management paradigm as anti-democratic and subverting the Constitution. Constitutionalists believe government actions should be based on public law, not private interests. The hierarchical structure in the executive branch prioritizes accountability over control. They value accountability to political leadership and due process in decision-making over performance and results. The debate between entrepreneurs and constitutionalists in public administration focuses on the balance between political accountability and efficiency. Landmark commissions study the shaping of contemporary ideas, institutions, and people in democratic governance. The executive branch of the United States government is a product of theoretical concepts aimed at creating a democratic republic. These concepts have evolved over time to adapt to changing circumstances and values. New challenges, such as reorganizing the executive branch for counterterrorist measures while maintaining democratic accountability, are emerging in the 21st century. The executive branch of the United States government faces challenges in reorganizing for counterterrorist measures while maintaining democratic accountability. The role of advisory commissions in addressing these issues is being considered, with a focus on their diverse mandates and potential contributions. There are essentially five categories of advisory commissions: reorganization, mega-commission, crisis-induced, technical, and major policy. These commissions serve various purposes such as realigning authorities, examining national life, investigating crises, providing technical advice, and studying major policies. In this study, attention is focused on reorganization commissions within advisory committees, which are tasked with studying the organization and management of the executive branch. The literature primarily focuses on advisory committees related to the executive branch, with less attention given to those related to the legislative branch. The Base Closure and Realignment Commission, reporting to Congress, impacted the organization of the executive branch. The United States was in a period of industrial and technological growth, with calls for government reform to enhance its capacity. Theodore Roosevelt, as Governor of New York, led reorganization projects at both state and national levels. Theodore Roosevelt supported military professionalization and brought Progressive values to reorganize the executive branch as President. He believed in using advisory commissions composed of volunteers to study and provide recommendations for improvements in government agencies and programs. Gifford Pinchot outlined the establishment of a commission to examine all executive branch departments and agencies. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed the Keep Commission to study administrative practices. The commission upset Congress by making recommendations without their approval. Despite completing its main work in 1907, it continued until 1909. The Keep Commission consisted of five government executives. The Keep Commission, established in 1909, consisted of five government executives of sub-cabinet rank. The selection of these officers upset some cabinet secretaries due to the potential highlighting of deficiencies in department administration. President Roosevelt's administrative philosophy was outlined in his 1905 Message to Congress. President Roosevelt outlined his philosophy on administrative management in his 1905 Message to Congress, emphasizing the need for government machinery to be well planned, economical, and efficient like business organizations. He recommended legislative consideration for transferring, distributing, consolidating, and assigning duties to promote economy, efficiency, and high-quality government work. In 1906, the Keep Commission was aided by subcommittees and federal employees to investigate management problems. President Roosevelt requested $25,000 for specialists, but Congress only granted $5,000 for hiring private experts. This led to minimal outside consultants being hired, with federal officers and employees mainly performing the work. The Keep Commission in 1906 investigated management problems with minimal outside consultants hired, mainly federal officers and employees working on their own time. Congress passed the Tawney amendment in response to Roosevelt's use of commissions to bypass them, prohibiting public funds for presidentially created commissions without specific appropriations. The commission issued 19 reports to the President by the end of Roosevelt's term in 1909, but they were never compiled into a single document. The Keep Commission's reports were not published publicly, making them difficult to obtain. The Institute of Governmental Research (later The Brookings Institution) has the only complete set known. The commission made numerous recommendations, but their success was hard to measure as most were not implemented through executive orders or legislation. Implementation varied by department, with recommendations focusing on housekeeping changes in accounting, purchasing, records management, statistics coordination, and government printing. The Keep Commission made innovative recommendations in personnel management, calling for competitive pay and a retirement system for federal workers. It was praised for its quality research and insightful recommendations, leading to management improvements in various fields. Congress, however, was resistant to its activities as it threatened vested interests. The Keep Commission produced quality reports that focused on improving agency management, introduced new concepts, and emphasized capacity building for agency heads. Despite facing resistance from Congress, it made innovative recommendations in personnel management, including competitive pay and a retirement system for federal workers. The Keep Commission introduced new vocabulary and concepts for public administration, emphasizing Presidential responsibility for administration. When William Howard Taft became president in 1909, there were budgetary issues and deficits, leading Congress to task the President and Secretary of the Treasury with comparing revenues and agency appropriations. President Taft and his Treasury Secretary were tasked by Congress to compare revenues and agency appropriations. Taft requested funds from Congress to establish a commission for the executive budget issue. President Taft requested $100,000 from Congress to establish a commission for the executive budget issue. The project was conducted in two phases, with phase one involving preliminary studies under the President's Secretary, Charles Norton. Phase two included the establishment of a commission chaired by Frederick Cleveland to study data and make recommendations to the President. Walter Warwick, Frank J. Goodnow, Harvey S. Chase, and Merritt O. Chance were key members of the Isthmian Canal Commission. Taft later reduced the commission to three members in 1912. Congress wanted the commission to prioritize efficiency and congressional dominance over agency management and funding. Former members Goodnow and Willoughby remained connected to the commission. President Taft aligned himself with public administration and initiated a comprehensive study based in the White House to reorganize the executive branch. The study aimed to address organization, budgetary matters, and management practices, shielding it from congressional and cabinet pressures. Taft's message to Congress in 1912 highlighted the status of the executive branch. President Taft initiated a study to reorganize the executive branch, aiming to improve organization, budgeting, and management practices. In his message to Congress in 1912, he highlighted the lack of comprehensive understanding and coordination within the vast government organization. President Taft's reorganization of the executive branch aimed to improve organization, budgeting, and management practices. He redefined the debate over organizational management, establishing the President as the key player for future organizational management. The traditional view of agencies tied to Congress was replaced with a new conception of hierarchy and ordered authority within a bureaucracy. Charles Norton began a preliminary investigation into organization, staff support, and funding. The commission received a total funding of $260,000 from 1910 to 1913 for its investigations, despite complaints of inadequate funding and support from Congress. Many reports were produced by the commission, some of which were submitted to Congress. The commission produced numerous reports, including messages to Congress, circulars, and miscellaneous documents. Most recommendations focused on agency-specific or process-based issues, emphasizing personnel, financial practices, and business activities. The overarching theme was the need for agencies to be grouped by purpose and follow similar procedures. One recommendation had government-wide and political significance. President Taft forwarded a Message to Congress calling for a national executive budget, leading to a debate over authority between the President and Congress. Taft proposed a presidential staff agency to support the President in budgetary responsibilities before leaving office in 1913. Opposition to the proposal came from Members of Congress and cabinet secretaries. In the immediate term, Congress prevailed over President Taft due to his political weakening from the 1910 and 1912 elections. Taft proposed a presidential staff agency to support the President in budgetary responsibilities as part of executive budget reforms. Little action directly resulted from the commission report or its leadership. President Taft's leadership in developing executive branch budgetary and management methods was generally well-received. The Commission's success was noted despite none of its major recommendations being implemented. Taft urged his successor, Woodrow Wilson, to continue the Commission's work, but Wilson did not show interest. The Commission's main contribution was in theoretical and conceptual realms rather than specific recommendations, emphasizing presidential authority. The Bureau of Efficiency was established by Congress in 1913 as a branch of the Civil Service Commission to manage the federal bureaucracy. It faced funding challenges but its mandate was expanded in 1915 to investigate duplication of work in government branches. In 1916, it became an independent agency. The Bureau of Efficiency, established in 1913 as part of the Civil Service Commission, became an independent agency in 1916. It had an ambiguous status and was abolished in 1933. The context of its establishment was the need for administrative reorganization highlighted during World War I. President Taft's call for a national budget and administrative reorganization gained traction after the war. Following World War I, the House passed a bill in 1919 to establish a Bureau of the Budget under the President for national budgeting. President Wilson initially supported the bill but later vetoed it due to concerns about the removal of the Comptroller General. Efforts to revise the bill before adjournment were unsuccessful. Efforts to revise the bill before adjournment were unsuccessful, ending President Wilson's opportunity to establish a national budget agency. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 was passed with changes, including the creation of a separate Budget Bureau under the Department of the Treasury. Warren Harding, the new President, did not challenge the removal procedure for the Comptroller General. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, described as a significant landmark in administrative history, was passed into law. A Joint Committee on Reorganization was created to survey government administrative services for efficiency. President Warren Harding supported this effort, leading to a supplementary resolution authorizing the President to take action. President Harding's personal representative, Walter F. Brown, was appointed as the chairman of the Joint Committee on Reorganization, despite Congress's usual dominance in organizational matters. Harding asserted presidential prerogatives over executive organization and successfully pushed for the establishment of the General Accounting Office and Bureau of the Budget. He aimed for executive branch leadership on the committee. President Harding's personal representative, Walter F. Brown, led the Joint Committee on Reorganization, with a focus on executive branch leadership. The committee consisted of members from both houses of Congress, including Senators Smoot, Wadsworth, and Harrison, and Representatives Reavis, Temple, and Moore. Walter F. Brown was elected chairman at the President's request. The committee's administrative philosophy centered on the executive reorganization proposal submitted to Congress during President Coolidge's term. The joint committee, led by Walter F. Brown, aimed to reorganize the executive branch based on \"major purpose\" to streamline government activities. President Harding emphasized the need for departments to have similar major purposes and grouped together similar services for efficient administration. Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce under Harding's administration, played a key role in reorganizing the executive branch to emphasize efficiency and effectiveness. Hoover's dynamic approach and expertise made him a central figure in the reorganization efforts, earning the trust of President Harding. As Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover led the reorganization of the executive branch, focusing on expanding the Department of Commerce's functions into three divisions: industry, trade, and transportation. Hoover's efforts aimed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness within the government. Secretary Hoover's reorganization effort aimed to transform the Commerce Department into a department of economic development and management, serving as a general coordinator. However, the proposal faced opposition within the cabinet and Congress was not enthusiastic about the final recommendations. The joint committee, led by Walter F. Brown, sought help from the Bureau of Efficiency to address the institutional weaknesses in the presidential office's management of the executive branch. The Bureau worked with congressional committees and the executive branch to promote central managerial interests, recognizing the lack of effective machinery for the Chief Executive to discharge this responsibility. The President's inability to function as an administrative officer due to various responsibilities like commissions and appointments. Herbert Hoover utilized his staff at the Commerce Department to advocate for his views on executive branch organization. Hoover had conflicting beliefs on building up the executive branch's capacity while also advocating for limited government functions. The joint committee received reports and recommendations on improving executive branch management. The joint committee reviewed reports and recommendations from the Harding-Coolidge administration in 1924. However, they were discouraged from pursuing legislation due to factors like a lack of interest from President Coolidge, divisions of opinion on reorganization proposals, and a lack of discussion on cost-saving measures. The plan submitted to Congress was similar to Harding's plan but without the provision to merge the Departments of War and Navy. The full Congress adopted the Harding plan, excluding the merger of War and Navy departments. No firm statistics on savings were provided. Reorganization lost appeal, and the Joint Committee's recommendations were not seriously considered. Departments were tasked with submitting reorganization plans to Walter Brown, a method favored by Secretary Herbert Hoover. Herbert Hoover proposed a reorganization plan in 1921 to make the Commerce Department a \"super department\" overseeing government activities in industry, trade, and transportation. This led to controversy within the Administration as agencies were to be transferred to the new Department of Commerce. Brown found himself refereeing a political struggle instead of facilitating a rational debate on organizational design alternatives. Brown received reports from departmental secretaries and outside organizations, like the National Budget Committee and the Brookings Institution. He worked to consolidate multiple departmental plans into one for the President's review. Cabinet members opposed the reorganization plan, leading to intense debates and little progress. Pressure from Congress eventually pushed Harding to act. The joint committee's reorganization proposals in the 1920s influenced executive organization, leading to the President's increased supervisory role over administrative agencies. Agency-specific studies were conducted to enhance managerial capacities, setting the stage for future presidential reorganization efforts. The President's Committee on Administrative Management (Brownlow Committee) was established in 1936, following reorganization efforts in the 1920s. Hoover had advocated for giving the President authority to reorganize executive departments and agencies, but no action was taken. In 1929, Hoover requested authority from Congress to submit reorganization proposals, emphasizing the need for congressional delegation of authority. During 1930, Hoover consolidated Prohibition enforcement agencies into the Department of Justice and created the Veterans' Administration, saving $10,000,000 a year. Hoover emphasized the need for Congress to delegate authority over reorganization to the Executive for efficient government restructuring. President Hoover emphasized the need for executive reorganization in his 1931 Annual Message, seeking authority to consolidate various government organizations and activities. He recommended that Congress grant the President the power to transfer and consolidate executive groups within departments or independent establishments through Executive orders, subject to a 60-day review period by Congress before taking effect. During 1932, Hoover campaigned for reelection and the topic of government reorganization was prominent. Both political parties called for spending cuts, leading to the creation of a committee to explore agency consolidation. Congress leaned towards granting the President more authority to avoid legislative delays caused by interest groups. Senator David Reed expressed frustration with the system, suggesting a need for a leader like Mussolini. Hoover received reorganization authority in 1933 through the Economy Act, allowing him to transfer functions between executive agencies and departments. This authority was granted to avoid legislative delays and satisfy the country's desire for swift and decisive action. The President was granted reorganization authority in 1933 to consolidate functions within departments or agencies. The authority allowed for proposals subject to a one-house veto, with Congress having the power to approve or disapprove within a 60-day period. Hoover signed the bill on June 30, 1932, and issued 11 executive orders consolidating 58 governmental activities shortly after Congress reconvened on December 3rd. Hoover issued 11 executive orders consolidating 58 governmental activities, but was defeated in the general election. Congress intended to leave reorganization changes to Roosevelt. Hoover stated that Congress must keep hands off or give larger powers to his successor for effective reorganization. The House Committee recommended disapproval of all executive orders. Congress passed a resolution of disapproval of all executive orders and granted the President reorganization authority without a legislative veto process. The Economy Act of 1933 gave extraordinary power to the President to abolish executive agencies and functions for a two-year period. Franklin Roosevelt initially showed little interest in executive organization, preferring a loose approach to management. Roosevelt's management style involved creating new agencies under emergency powers rather than by statute or reorganization plan authority. This led to significant government growth outside the executive department structure. The use of emergency legislation for reorganization peaked in 1935 but faced challenges, including the Supreme Court striking down delegations of power in the National Industrial Recovery Act. A major challenge to Roosevelt's authority occurred on May 27, 1935. On May 27, 1935, the Supreme Court limited Roosevelt's authority to remove members of regulatory commissions. This led Roosevelt to consider reorganizing the executive branch to integrate agencies under major departments for better supervision. He issued Executive orders to transfer agencies and functions, aiming to streamline administrative management. President Roosevelt formed the President's Committee on Administrative Management in 1936, chaired by Louis Brownlow with Charles E. Merriam and Luther Gulick as members. The committee aimed to address overall management issues within the executive establishment. Luther Gulick, head of the Institute of Public Administration in New York City, published a volume on the Science of Administration. President Roosevelt, influenced by Brownlow and Merriam, sought a comprehensive reorganization strategy for the executive branch during his second term. The report was intended to be based on neutral principles, not partisan advantage. The Brownlow Committee's administrative philosophy focused on political accountability to the President and strengthening the executive branch. They believed in making the President the central figure in reorganization, viewing the presidency as a uniquely American institution. Their approach aimed to address contemporary government issues. The Brownlow Committee aimed to address contemporary government issues by providing tools to the President for managing the executive branch through consistent laws and government-wide procedures. The committee, consisting of young political science Ph.Ds, worked on their papers during the summer and reconvened in September. The Brownlow Committee reconvened in September to put together the draft Report before the November election. Funding was limited, with $100,000 allocated from emergency funds. The House and Senate were also conducting reorganization studies, with political considerations affecting appropriations. The committee allocated $10,000 to the House committee and $40,000 to the Senate subcommittee, leaving $50,000 for their own use, of which $45,000 was spent. The Brownlow Committee submitted a 55-page report with recommendations to expand the White House staff, strengthen central management agencies, extend the merit system, and overhaul independent agencies. They proposed creating two new departments: Public Works and Social Welfare. The Brownlow Committee recommended creating new departments (Public Works and Social Welfare) and changing the Department of the Interior to the Department of Conservation. They also suggested appointing an auditor general within the executive branch, increasing presidential assistants to six, and transferring administrative functions of independent regulatory commissions to executive departments. The Bureau of the Budget would oversee designing new agencies and programs. The Brownlow Committee recommended reorganizing executive departments and creating supervisory agencies for government corporations. President Roosevelt introduced a bill in 1937 based on the recommendations but faced opposition due to concerns about establishing a \"presidential dictatorship.\" In 1939, he submitted a more modest reorganization proposal. President Roosevelt submitted a more modest reorganization bill in 1939, authorizing the appointment of six administrative assistants and the submission of reorganization plans subject to congressional veto. Despite concerns about the constitutionality of the approval process, the bill was passed by Congress and signed into law on April 3, 1939. The Brownlow Committee's report emphasized clear accountability and policy-making responsibility for the President and departmental secretaries. The Reorganization Act of 1939 emphasized improved management over cost reduction, marking a departure from previous administrations. President Roosevelt focused on setting standards at the presidential and departmental levels rather than agency level, with the goal of achieving better management. Senator Harry Byrd added an emphasis on economy to the bill, highlighting the Scientific Management ideal. President Roosevelt emphasized good management over economy in executive reorganization, despite skepticism towards the objective of reducing expenditures. Congress, while sympathetic towards economy, also protected favored agencies and programs, leading to restrictions on the President's authority in creating or abolishing functions. The Reorganization Act of 1939 limited the President's authority to create or abolish executive departments, with Congress having the power to disapprove reorganization plans within 60 days. This legislative veto procedure sparked controversy due to the President's advantage. Only a few reorganization plans were submitted under this act, establishing the Executive Office of the President and other agency transfers. President Truman took office after President Roosevelt's death in 1945 and prioritized the orderly transition of the economy from wartime to peacetime. He believed in the need for substantial reorganization and Congress approved the Reorganization Act of 1945, granting the President more flexibility in submitting reorganization plans. Only minor changes were made under the previous reorganization plans before the authority expired in 1941. President Truman used the reorganization authority infrequently and on minor issues after Congress reorganized itself under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Control of Congress shifted to the Republicans in November 1946, leading to a focus on the federal budget and a perceived shift of power to the President. Between 1947 and 1955, two major studies on the organization and functions of the executive branch were conducted by the Hoover Commissions, chaired by former President Herbert Hoover. The first commission submitted its recommendations in 1949, while the second commission did so in 1955. Representative Clarence Brown studied previous reorganization efforts in 1946, finding them unsatisfactory. In 1946, Representative Clarence Brown proposed a \"blue ribbon\" commission to review the entire government and make reorganization recommendations. After the 1946 congressional elections, he introduced a bill in the House to establish a \"mixed commission\" to study the executive branch organization. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. introduced a similar bill in the Senate, both referred to Committees and favorably reported. The bill proposing a \"blue ribbon\" commission to review government organization was unanimously approved by both chambers and signed into law on July 7, 1947. The commission was to consist of 12 members appointed by the President, President pro tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the House of Representatives. The commission to review government organization was established with 12 members appointed by the President, President pro tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the House of Representatives. The commission had the authority to hold hearings, administer oaths, and request information from executive agencies. Republican Arthur Vandenburg appointed Senators George Aiken and John L. McClellan to the commission. Compensation for members was specified in the Act. The commission to review government organization was established with 12 members appointed by the President, President pro tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the House of Representatives. Vandenburg appointed James K. Pollack and Joseph P. Kennedy from the private sector, while Speaker Joseph Martin named Clarence Brown, Carter Manasco, Herbert Hoover, and James Rowe. President Truman appointed James A. Forrestal from within the executive branch. President Truman appointed James A. Forrestal as the Democratic member from within the executive branch, and Arthur Fleming as the Republican member. From private life, Truman selected Republican George Mead and Democrat Dean Acheson. Herbert Hoover played a crucial role in the Hoover Commissions as chairman. Herbert Hoover, as Secretary of Commerce, President, and chairman of the Commissions, was influenced by Progressivism and Scientific Management. He believed in fact-finding, research, planning, and strong leadership. Hoover's experience in business and food distribution gave him essential tools for his political career. Despite facing criticism during his presidency, he was seen as a modern public manager. Herbert Hoover faced criticism during his presidency but was viewed as a modern public manager. As chairman of the Hoover Commission, he aimed to vindicate his reputation and establish efficient government services. However, divergent attitudes within the commission threatened its success due to clashes over interpretations of the enabling legislation. The commission had the authority to recommend reducing government expenditures and abolishing unnecessary services. The Hoover Commission's mandate was to review and restructure government activities for efficiency. There were differing interpretations of the mandate, with some wanting to maintain the status quo and others seeing it as an opportunity for retrenchment and reorientation. Defenders of the Administration wanted the government to continue its functions but be reorganized for better performance. The Hoover Commission's mandate was initially seen as retrenchment and reorientation of the federal government. However, Mr. Hoover's focus shifted towards enhancing the President's managerial authority. President Truman shared similar organizational ideals with Hoover, leaning towards Scientific Management principles. Truman had an organizational strategy in line with Hoover's goals. According to Harold Seidman, President Truman's organizational strategy was influenced by the first Hoover Commission's reports, which provided a framework developed by Herbert Hoover. Despite occasional partisan maneuvers, Truman and Hoover developed a close relationship that was critical to the commission's success. The commission's first meeting was held at the White House in 1947, where Mr. Hoover was unanimously elected chairman. The Hoover Commission elected Mr. Hoover as chairman and Dean Acheson as vice chairman. They established 24 task forces without a master plan, each led by a project director and advisory committee. The commission had 74 staff members divided into four groups. The Hoover Commission, led by Mr. Hoover and Dean Acheson, had 18 commissioners' assistants, a 13-member central staff, a four-member administrative staff, and a 39-member secretarial staff. They also utilized over 300 outside specialists from various fields. The commission divided its work among 24 task forces, each submitting technical findings and recommendations. The total cost of the investigation was around $2 million. The Hoover Commission divided its job among task forces, each submitting reports with recommendations. The commission felt constrained to use these reports as \"working documents,\" resulting in 19 separate reports being submitted over three months. The final compiled report was forwarded in May 1949. The Hoover Commission submitted 19 reports with recommendations over three months, which were compiled into a single document and published by a private firm in May 1949. The commission aimed to reorganize the Executive Branch for simplicity, unity of purpose, and clear lines of authority from the President to department heads and their subordinates. The Hoover Commission aimed to centralize responsibility for policy-making and setting standards in the President, central management agencies, and department secretaries. They criticized the dispersal of functions to independent agencies and called for a renewed hierarchical administrative structure. The Hoover Commission criticized the fragmented administrative system and called for a centralized structure with departments grouped by major purposes. Department secretaries should have full responsibility and authority for effective administration. The Hoover Commission recommended decentralization of department functions, increased staff support for department heads, and consolidation of agencies. They also called for the creation of a new Office of Personnel within the Executive Office of the President. The commission did not propose converting the cabinet into a more cohesive policy unit with collective responsibility. The Hoover Commission recommended decentralization of department functions, increased staff support for department heads, and consolidation of agencies. They also proposed creating a new Office of Personnel within the Executive Office of the President. The commission did not suggest converting the cabinet into a more cohesive policy unit with collective responsibility. The report on \"General Management of the Executive Branch\" recommended giving the President permanent authority to submit reorganization plans without restrictions or exemptions. The results of the recommendations were deemed extraordinary, leading to the passage of major legislation like the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act. Former President Hoover was innovative in gaining public support for the commission's recommendations, which included decentralization of department functions and consolidation of agencies. Not all recommendations were accepted, such as creating a Water Development Use Service and a United Medical Administration outside the departmental structure. Hoover emphasized the importance of delegation of responsibilities to the secretary for efficiency. Former President Hoover successfully gained public support for the commission's recommendations by creating the Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report (CCHR), which garnered widespread support and funding from various sources. The CCHR drafted legislative proposals and distributed materials to national organizations for further dissemination. The Citizens Committee for the Hoover Report (CCHR) submitted proposals to Congress, claiming potential savings of $4 billion if all recommendations were adopted. Critics dismissed these figures as \"guesswork,\" but the CCHR emphasized the importance of savings estimates. The committee focused on highlighting government incompetence and resisted compromising on their recommendations. The CCHR refused a White House request to drum up support for better pay for government executives. The public relations effort was considered effective, with both sides seeking to avoid confrontation. The White House and supporters of a strong managerial presidency were pleased that the CCHR focused on \"savings\" as their theme, as it meant that significant aspects of the Hoover Report would be missed by the press and public. The first Hoover Commission's main achievement was enhancing the presidential office as the government's manager, masking it with administrative orthodoxy to reduce opposition. President Truman created his own Advisory as the commission's work concluded in 1949. President Truman created his own Advisory Committee on Management in 1949 to study federal government management issues from a presidential perspective. The committee emphasized the need for continuous management improvement for all agencies under the guidance of the Bureau of the Budget's Office of Management and Organization. Truman sent legislation to Congress in January 1949 to renew his reorganization authority, which was broader in scope than the previous 1945 Act. The 1949 bill expanded Truman's reorganization authority beyond the 1945 Act, removing termination dates and agency exemptions. It allowed for new executive departments but required Congress approval to disapprove plans. Rep. Hoffman argued the constitutionality of this process, stating it violated the legislative veto process. Hoffman's interpretation of the Constitution was not supported by witnesses, including the Comptroller General. Most witnesses requested exemptions for their agencies, opposed by the Administration. Senator McClellan opposed transferring Army Corps of Engineers functions. A single-house veto procedure was proposed to eliminate exemptions while protecting favored agencies. The President could implement reorganizations in line with the Committee's recommendations. The committee, in line with the Hoover Commission's recommendations, avoided exemptions for specific agencies to allow for desirable realignments. They believed the one-house veto was constitutional and a sound political decision. A time limit was set for the authority, expiring in 1953. Supporters of a strong managerial presidency were initially disappointed by the one-house veto. The one-house veto was inserted to strengthen congressional powers over presidential reorganization plans. Despite initial doubts, the 1949 Reorganization Act saw an increase in approved plans, with President Truman submitting significant ones that were well-received. In 1950, President Truman submitted 27 reorganization plans aimed at consolidating responsibilities within departments to establish clear lines of authority. Despite some controversy, Truman was satisfied with the congressional treatment of his plans. In 1950, President Truman submitted 27 reorganization plans to consolidate responsibilities and establish clear lines of authority within departments. He fared reasonably well with 22 plans approved, but faced political challenges in 1951 and 1952 due to the Korean War and scandals involving key agencies. In 1952, with Truman's waning interest in reorganization and a Republican victory in sight, supporters of the \"citizens commission\" concept saw a second chance to address policy issues underlying the growth of \"big government.\" Robert Johnson, chairman of the Citizens Committee, took a leading role in promoting a new Commission by raising funds to sponsor a Temple University Survey of Federal Reorganization. The survey began in October 1952 during the presidential campaign. The Temple Survey, initiated in October 1952, involved contributions from 102 individuals, some of whom had previous experience with the first Hoover Commission. President-elect Dwight Eisenhower was informed of the survey in December and received a copy in October 1953. While the Temple Survey itself was not significant, it sparked interest in a second Hoover Commission among Republican leaders. Despite not sharing the enthusiasm for a new Commission, President Eisenhower established his own President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization (PACGO) in response to congressional efforts. The President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization (PACGO) was established in response to congressional efforts, despite President Eisenhower's lukewarm attitude. The Commission, created in the 83rd Congress, consisted of 12 members appointed by the President, Senate pro tempore, and Speaker of the House. The bill was signed into law on July 10, 1953. The second Hoover Commission was created without a partisan parity requirement. Herbert Hoover was unanimously elected as chairman, with Arthur S. Fleming, Senator John McClellan, Representative Clarence Brown, and Joseph P. Kennedy as members. The Senate Committee suggested including former members for their experience. The second Hoover Commission was created with 7 Republicans and 5 Democrats, including new members like James A. Farley and Herbert Brownell. Despite intentions for continuity, there was discord on the commission due to contentious issues. Senator Homer Ferguson highlighted the commission's administrative philosophy. The second Hoover Commission, with a mix of Republicans and Democrats, aimed to delve into policy matters regarding the activities of the Federal Government. Controversy arose over the commission's broad mandate, with member Chet Holifield questioning its authority to address policy issues. The second Hoover Commission questioned the wisdom of creating unelected policy-oriented commissions, such as itself, as an unwise departure from representative government. The commission divided its job among 19 task forces with varying sizes and staff support, involving close to 200 persons. The \"mandate battle\" continued throughout its existence and remains an issue for citizen commission proposals. MacNeil and Metz estimated that around 200 individuals served on the task forces and committees of the commission, while James Fesler stated that the commission was assisted by 513 persons at its peak. The central staff of the second Hoover Commission was small and mainly provided support to the chairman, leaving the bulk of the work to task force staff and consulting organizations. The central staff did not develop summary reports for Congress like the first commission. The second Hoover Commission had around 200 individuals serving on task forces and committees, with 513 persons assisting at its peak. The central staff was small and mainly supported the chairman, leaving the bulk of the work to task force staff and consulting organizations. Unlike the first commission, the central staff did not develop summary reports for Congress. The Commission's deliberative process was limited, focusing on working papers that omitted or modified task force recommendations. Time was spent on textual questions rather than discussing underlying assumptions or the impact of recommendations on the administrative system. Recommendations were taken up sequentially without integration into a single report or distinction between major and minor recommendations. The second Hoover Commission submitted nineteen separate reports to Congress, followed by a Final Report estimating $8 billion in savings from its recommendations. The Commission received appropriations of $2,848,534, spent $2,768,562, and returned $83,527 to the Treasury. The reports did not have systematic categories but focused on functions and managerial problems across departments and agencies. Unlike the first commission, there was no integration of major and minor recommendations into a single report. The second Hoover Commission submitted nineteen separate reports to Congress, focusing on functions and managerial problems across departments and agencies. The reports varied in importance and quality, with some proposing substantial changes in areas such as Personnel, Budget, Legal Services, Business Enterprises, Lending Agencies, and Water Resources. Other reports covered minor contemporary subjects with recommendations for minimal agency changes. The second Hoover Commission submitted 20 reports with 314 recommendations, of which 63.9% were fully or partially implemented by 1958. Mr. Hoover emphasized the importance of setting up a senior civil service. Assessments of the commission's success vary, with some claiming it met all its goals by attacking Big Government without eliminating essential activities for American security and welfare. The second Hoover Commission made 314 recommendations, with 63.9% implemented by 1958. It emphasized senior civil service and reorganized the Department of Defense for civilian control. Government competition with the private sector was reduced. The second Hoover Commission focused on senior civil service, reorganized the Department of Defense, and reduced government competition with the private sector. Critics felt it lacked a clear administrative model, unlike the first commission. The second Hoover Commission aimed to improve government efficiency and eliminate waste, but it was criticized for lacking a clear administrative model. Despite some positive changes like civil service improvements, it was seen as adrift without proper organization or management. The second Hoover Commission aimed to improve government efficiency and eliminate waste, but lacked clear organization or managerial principles. Despite civil service improvements, it appeared adrift without proper guidance. Hoover's ability to balance political values and administrative principles was fragile, leading to tension when policy judgments were made. In retrospect, the executive branch was reasonably well managed during the 1940s and 1950s. The two Hoover Commissions in the 1940s and 1950s emphasized political and managerial accountability, leading to improved government efficiency. President Eisenhower valued structured advice for himself, establishing a competing advisory panel. During the years 1953 through 1958, President Eisenhower established the President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization (PACGO) chaired by Nelson Rockefeller. The committee drafted 14 reorganization plans, which were accepted by Congress. Other commissions, committees, and task forces were also created during this 15-year period, with some reports being made public and others remaining unpublished. These bodies had varying mandates and organizational impacts. During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, task forces were appointed to review the organization of the executive branch and develop policy positions. President Kennedy commissioned 29 task forces before his inauguration, while President Johnson relied heavily on both formal and informal task forces. Some task forces focused on immediate legislative needs, while others took a longer-term perspective. In the field of executive reorganization, two task forces were created during this time, with the first chaired by Don K. Price. Peri Arnold's task force operated contemplatively, relying on the Bureau of the Budget for information. It submitted a 116-page report to President Johnson in 1964, recommending the creation of five new executive departments. The recommendations also included establishing institutional capacity for policy planning and evaluation, and making executive officers more responsive to presidential direction. The task force had close ties with the Budget Bureau, amidst challenges in managing Great Society programs and growing international issues related to the Vietnam War. President Johnson created the Task Force on Government Organization in response to the Vietnam War and growing international issues. The task force, chaired by Ben Heineman, focused on systemic recommendations and administrative fixes for poverty programs run by the Office of Economic Opportunity. Proposals were made to reorganize the Bureau of the Budget and create \"super-departments,\" with an emphasis on resisting pressures to create more departments and agencies outside regular accountability systems. Few recommendations were immediately adopted. The Heineman Task Force recommendations were adopted during the Vietnam War, but President Johnson's focus was on increasing presidential power rather than efficient agency management. He refused to publish the Heineman report when requested by a Nixon official. Roy Ash later made the report public in 1969. President Nixon appointed Roy Ash to head the President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization in 1969. Ash later requested a copy of the Report from Heineman, who made it available. Nixon's election in 1968 was partly a reaction to the perceived failure of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs. Many programs were initiated from Washington with little regard for their impact on state and local governments, leading to fears of a unraveling political and administrative system. President Nixon aimed to centralize policy and decentralize administration by reorganizing the government, believing that structures could influence behavior. He prioritized restructuring the White House-Executive Office complex to be more responsive to presidential direction. This approach was a response to the perceived failure of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs, which had undermined fundamental relationships within the federal system. President Nixon aimed to centralize policy and decentralize administration by reorganizing the government. He intended to rely more on his cabinet for domestic policy leadership, focusing on foreign affairs. Roy Ash, an outsider, was appointed to head a task force on government management. Nixon established an Advisory Council on Executive Organization in April 1969, with Ash as chairman. The Advisory Council on Executive Organization was established in April 1969 with Roy Ash as chairman. The Council consisted of George Baker, John Connally, Frederick Kappel, Richard Paget, and later Walter Thayer. The Council aimed to have a close relationship with the President. Nixon believed in reorganizing the government to solve problems and appointed Ash to lead a task force on government management. Murray Comarow served as the executive director of the Council. Nixon's reorganization goal was to enhance presidential power and ultimately decentralize government through the \"New Federalism.\" The Ash Council advised on centralizing policymaking while decentralizing administration. The Ash Council relied on earlier recommendations for \"super departments\" and a regional executive structure to decentralize administration and enhance presidential power. Nixon aimed to reorganize the government to focus more on foreign affairs, allowing cabinet officers to lead domestic affairs. He requested reorganization authority from Congress, which was granted until April 1, 1973. Additionally, he proposed changing the status of the Post Office Department to an independent entity. The Post Office Department was changed to the United States Postal Service, an independent government corporation. The Ash Council, with a small prestigious membership, provided reports and recommendations to the President. It had a staff of 35-47 employees in fiscal year 1970. The Ash Council, with a staff of under 40, had a sometimes tense relationship with the Bureau of the Budget. Six working groups were formed, focusing on the organization of the Executive Office for management. The Council met monthly for two-day meetings and reached out to individuals in agencies for recommendations. President Nixon received 13 memoranda from the Council and implemented Reorganization Plan no. 2 of 1970 before all recommendations were received. President Nixon implemented Reorganization Plan no. 2 of 1970, which included reorganizing the Bureau of the Budget into the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and creating a separate Domestic Policy Council. The plan controversially allowed for presidential appointment of division heads in the OMB. After approval by the House, the Council aimed to present a comprehensive executive branch reorganization proposal to improve management and reflect contemporary service demands. The Council proposed centralized lines of authority within the executive branch to address fragmentation and lack of coordination. They advocated for a \"package\" approach combining elements of the \"new Federalism\" with executive branch reorganization. The objective was to move towards broader, general purpose departments. The Council, despite being business-oriented, adopted traditional public administration theory for organizational management. In March 1971, President Nixon proposed reorganizing seven departments and independent agencies into four new \"super departments\" focused on Human Resources, Community Development, Natural Resources, and Economic Affairs. Each department would be led by a secretary with a small team of staff officers for program direction. The concept of \"Administration\" was introduced for rational grouping of bureaus and programs, modeled after the Department of Transportation. The proposal in 1966 aimed to create management centers within departments, with administrators leading basic units reporting directly to the secretary. The use of staff officers and program administrators was expected to enhance decentralized management while maintaining secretarial control and department cohesion. Regional boundaries were to be established to strengthen the field structure. This proposal built upon earlier public administration values and aimed to strengthen policy directions and lines of accountability to department secretaries. The council's recommendations proposed four new departments to strengthen the executive branch. The legislation aimed to implement public management principles but faced opposition in Congress due to potential disruptions to existing structures. Democrats in Congress were hesitant to support President Nixon's proposals. During a time of bitter partisanship, Congress, dominated by Democrats, rejected most of President Nixon's organizational proposals. Only the reorganization plan establishing the Domestic Council and renaming the Bureau of the Budget to the Office of Management and Budget was accepted. This led Nixon to shift towards a strategy influenced by Richard Neustadt's view of the presidency. Richard Neustadt argued in his book \"Presidential Power\" that Presidents should focus on personal power through political skills rather than relying on Constitutional authority. He emphasized the importance of influence and persuasion over public administration principles. Nixon embraced this personalized presidency approach, moving away from managing the executive branch to pursue a more impactful leadership style. President Nixon implemented the Ash Council recommendations through administrative orders, creating a \"super-cabinet\" and bypassing congressional approval. This \"administrative presidency strategy\" included impounding funds and using appointments to hinder legislatively mandated programs, leading Congress to respond with laws like the War Powers Act of 1973 and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974. The Nixon presidency implemented an \"administrative presidency strategy\" to decrease presidential discretion in administrative matters. This led to the passing of laws like the War Powers Act of 1973 and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974. The organizational legacy of Nixon's presidency resulted in downsizing central management agencies and reducing their missions. Executivereorganization was used to diminish the government's capacity. As a candidate for President in 1976, Jimmy Carter aimed to clean up Washington through a broad-scale executive branch reorganization. He emphasized his experience in Georgia state government as governor and his commitment to comprehensive reform. Jimmy Carter aimed to reorganize the executive branch in Washington to address corruption, drawing from his experience as governor of Georgia. He sought to reduce the number of agencies from 1900 to 200, but found only 597 units in the executive branch. President Carter's reorganization project focused on structural reform as the linchpin, led by OMB Director Bert Lance. The project was an in-house exercise without a board of prominent citizens, rejecting orthodox organizational management principles. The PRP leadership rejected orthodox organizational management principles and focused on making government more efficient through a bottom-up approach, prioritizing program and people's needs over theory. After a year of work with the Government Reorganization Project, Mr. McIntyre outlined three guiding principles: solving problems, seeking least disruptive remedies, and involving the public and Congress. Deputy Director John P. White emphasized the importance of identifying problems before restructuring in 1979. These statements reflect the Project's mission of prioritizing practical solutions over idealized structures. The Carter Administration's approach to reorganization focused on starting with facts to evolve principles, emphasizing bottom-up wisdom over top-down directives. However, there was a discrepancy between their philosophy and actions, as they publicly disavowed a top-down approach but implemented it in practice by restructuring departments. The Carter Administration restructured four departments, creating two super departments without specifying the problems that warranted such major changes. The President showed interest in the PRP, but it was implemented by the Office of Management and Budget. Harrison Wellford was responsible for the Project. Facts and figures on the PRP were elusive, with John Osborne noting it as a significant operation. In early 1977, the Carter Administration initiated a reorganization project with 129 full-time employees and 150-175 detailees from various departments. The staff was divided into working groups, conducting 30 studies by early 1978. Studies focused on organizational objectives like border management and the administration of the Employee Retirement Security Act. By the end of 1978, 10 groups were still active in reviewing various government service delivery and workplace safety matters. The Carter Administration initiated a reorganization project in early 1977 with 129 full-time employees and 150-175 detailees. By the end of 1978, only 10 groups remained active, focusing on government service delivery and workplace safety. The project required a $2,172,000 supplemental appropriation and did not produce comprehensive reports or recommendations. President Carter shifted to an incremental approach for reorganization, requesting Congress to renew his authority to submit plans.

The project required a $2,172,000 supplemental appropriation and did not produce comprehensive reports or recommendations. President Carter shifted to an incremental approach for reorganization, requesting Congress to renew his authority to submit plans. Reorganization plans were not limited to the PRP, with proposals for new departments like Energy and Education developed with assistance but taking on lives of their own. The Department of Energy proposal had presidential backing, while the Department of Education proposal aimed to break up the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The separate Department of Education was seen as a way to highlight the nation's commitment to education, while critics viewed it as a political favor. A Personnel Management Project aimed to make significant changes in the federal civil service, working independently from the larger reorganization project. During the Carter Administration, a reorganization project involved working with key members of Congress and interest groups to ensure passage of 10 reorganization plans. The most significant plan restructured the Executive Office of the President, while the others were minor in scope. During the Carter Administration, reorganization efforts included the creation of federal inspector for the Alaska natural gas pipeline project. The White House and OMB staff believed reorganization authority must be used regularly to avoid losing it. Carter had some success with statutory proposals, establishing the Departments of Energy and Education through the regular legislative process. President Carter also submitted legislation to reorganize the civil service system based on recommendations from the President's Federal Personnel Management Project. The Carter Administration's reorganization efforts included establishing the Senior Executive Service through the President's Federal Personnel Management Project. Critics were skeptical of the PRP and Carter's management improvement projects, noting a lack of conceptual framework and alternative principles for evaluation. The Carter Administration's reorganization efforts lacked a unifying theme or innovative organizational principles, leading to criticism. Harold Seidman highlighted the absence of principles in the proposals for various departments and agencies, except for civil service reform. The reorganization plans did not align with Carter's goal of energizing and controlling the bureaucracy. The Carter Administration's reorganization efforts lacked a coherent theme or innovative principles, leading to criticism. Specific proposals were justified with orthodox doctrines, but overall, the exercise was viewed as a disappointment. The reorganizers lacked experience, working under a President with a rigid conception of administration. President Carter sought to renew his reorganization plan authority, which had expired in 1973. Over the years, there had been a gradual erosion of the President's authority in this area, reflecting Congress's ambivalence. The reorganization efforts of the Carter Administration lacked a coherent theme and innovative principles, leading to criticism. The reorganizers lacked experience and worked under a President with a rigid conception of administration. The erosion of the President's reorganization authority reflected Congress's ambivalence towards delegation of power. The original 1949 Act gave broad authority to the President, following the Hoover Commission's recommendation. However, in subsequent years, Congress imposed limits and exemptions on this authority, rendering it less effective. Congress is often seen as facing obstacles in the legislative process, leading to a dispersion of power and authority. The Kennedy Administration faced opposition in establishing a Department of Urban Affairs and Housing through the normal legislative process. To overcome this, they submitted a reorganization plan to create the department, bypassing the traditional procedures. The Senate and House rejected the reorganization plan proposed by the Kennedy Administration, focusing more on political implications rather than the details of the departmental structure. This led to Congress restricting the President from submitting similar plans in the future. The Reorganization Act of 1977 aimed to ease restrictions on the President's ability to amend reorganization plans within 30 days, unless a Resolution of Disapproval had been issued by Congress. This was in response to previous limitations imposed on the President's authority to propose new executive departments. The Reorganization Act of 1977 aimed to ease restrictions on the President's ability to amend reorganization plans within 30 days. Changes included eliminating the requirement for only one plan submission, removing the single subject matter rule, and replacing cost savings with management efficiency information. The authority extension was increased to four years. The Senate accepted some provisions but added prohibitions on establishing executive departments through reorganization. The Reorganization Act of 1977 expanded the President's authority to submit reorganization plans, with restrictions on abolishing certain agency functions. The House debated approval processes, favoring a joint resolution within 60 days for statutory enactment. Representative Jack Brooks opposed the legislative veto approach. The Reorganization Act of 1977 expanded the President's authority to submit reorganization plans, with restrictions on abolishing certain agency functions. To ensure Congress had a chance to vote on future plans, an action-forcing requirement was added where a resolution of disapproval had to be introduced simultaneously with the President's plan. Chairman Brooks withdrew his opposition, calling it \"the best unconstitutional bill you could draw up.\" President Carter submitted 10 reorganization plans under this authority. President Carter submitted 10 reorganization plans in 1977, all approved by Congress. In 1979, he proposed a plan to establish a Department of Natural Resources, facing opposition from Senator Ribicoff due to concerns about violating the Reorganization Act. Administration officials argued it was not creating a new department. Senator Ribicoff disagreed with administration officials who argued that the proposal to establish a Department of Natural Resources was not creating a new department. He cited the Reorganization Act of 1977, stating that no reorganization plan should create a new executive department. The White House withdrew the proposal when Senate leadership opposed using a reorganization plan for its establishment. President Carter's administration believed this was the only way for the proposal to succeed. During the Carter administration, a proposal to establish a Department of Natural Resources was withdrawn due to opposition from Congress. President Carter faced consequences as Congress only granted a one-year extension of reorganization authority and demanded a review of the procedures. The reorganization authority was deemed of questionable value, leading to confusion and conflict between the branches of government. The reorganization authority granted to the President under the 1977 Act was gradually restricted by Congress, making it less effective. The authority expired in 1981, just three months after President Ronald Reagan took office. Reagan's administration had a clear policy agenda upon entering office. President Reagan's administration had a clear policy agenda upon entering office in 1981, focusing on reducing government intervention in economic and social spheres. Despite initial reluctance, they were persuaded to conduct an \"outside\" study on executive branch management by business executives. President Reagan's administration, focused on reducing government intervention, agreed to an \"outside\" study proposed by J. Peter Grace to improve executive branch management. Grace chaired the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, despite legal questions surrounding its authority. Reagan issued an executive order to establish the commission, utilizing an obscure provision in a law administered by the Department of Commerce. The Grace Commission, chaired by J. Peter Grace, consisted of 161 CEOs but was mainly led by Grace and a few associates. It rejected the idea of unique organizational management principles for the public sector and federal government. The commission's report challenged the distinctiveness of the public sector. The Grace Commission, led by J. Peter Grace and 161 CEOs, focused on government inefficiencies and advocated for applying private sector management principles to improve organization and reduce waste. The Grace Commission, led by J. Peter Grace and 161 CEOs, focused on applying private sector management principles to government inefficiencies. The commission organized like a large corporation, with top-down control and a central Office of Federal Management. It had 36 task forces staffed by 2,000 people from corporations, costing $75 million. The commission produced 47 volumes of recommendations, including 2,478 specific ones. The Grace Commission, led by J. Peter Grace and 161 CEOs, focused on applying private sector management principles to government inefficiencies. The commission produced specific recommendations in a report titled War on Waste, emphasizing statistics and money. It claimed potential savings of $424 billion in the first three years and trillions in the 1990s if Congress adopted its proposals. The commission criticized Congress as a hindrance to good management and suggested ignoring it whenever possible. The Grace Commission produced specific recommendations in a report titled War on Waste, with mixed reception. Recommendations split between congressional action and presidential authority. OMB tasked with implementation, but acceptance and implementation of recommendations were complicated. The Grace Commission recommendations were accepted and implemented, with credit difficult to assign due to the long-standing nature of some proposals. The Chief Financial Officers Act (P.L. 101-576) was a significant law influenced by the Grace Commission. OMB claimed success in implementing 83 percent of the recommendations in the Fiscal 1990 Annual Management Report to Congress. The President accepted 83 percent of the Grace Commission recommendations, with 90 percent agreed to by Congress. Financial savings were only possible through major policy changes, with modest savings in administrative expenses. Mr. Grace and his commission were disappointed with the reception to their report. The Grace Commission's report was criticized for lacking understanding of government operations. The Reorganization Act of 1977 expired in 1981, with calls for renewal in the Reagan Administration. The President did not prioritize this renewal. In 1983, the Administration requested Congress to renew the authority for reorganizations, leading to hearings on H.R. 1314 by the Subcommittee on Legislation and National Security. The bill aimed to expedite needed reorganizations in the executive branch, influenced by the Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha declaring legislative vetoes unconstitutional. H.R. 1314 required a joint resolution from both the House and Senate for a reorganization plan to become law. Failure to vote in either house would reject the plan. The bill extended the congressional consideration period from 60 to 90 days, aiming to streamline the reorganization process. H.R. 1314 extended the congressional consideration period to 90 days, allowing more time for various actions such as amending the proposal, withdrawing a reorganization plan, and committee action. It also required an implementation section in the President's message accompanying the plan. The GAO found that agencies faced significant challenges in implementing reorganization plans, including delays in key officials, staffing issues, funding shortages, and administrative difficulties. To address these problems, future reorganization plans should include front-end implementation planning objectives. An \"implementation provision\" was added to Section 903(b) of Title 5, requiring the President's message to include an implementation section. The President's message must include an implementation section detailing actions, orders, and a timetable for reorganization. President Reagan did not utilize reorganization authority before it expired in 1984. The Reagan Administration did not take advantage of the opportunity to submit reorganization plans due to the disadvantages of the process. No subsequent President requested the reintroduction of reorganization plan authority. The National Performance Review represented a break with earlier reorganization efforts. The NPR was different from past public sector management approaches due to a global shift towards decentralized, competitive, and market economies after the collapse of centrally planned economies in the 1980s. The shift towards decentralized, competitive, and market economies after the collapse of centrally planned economies in the 1980s was rapid and comprehensive, especially in Commonwealth countries like Great Britain and New Zealand. New Zealand, in particular, embraced the New Public Management (NPM) approach quickly by implementing private sector managerial practices and separating administrative policymaking from service delivery. The New Zealand government introduced private sector managerial practices and reoriented management incentives towards individual self-interest. This management revolution, known as the 'new public management,' aimed to address government inefficiencies by promoting market competition and market-like incentives. The reforms included large-scale divestiture, performance contracting, administrative devolution, and the creation of quasi-governmental organizations. Similar approaches were adopted by other Commonwealth countries like Canada and Great Britain. The 'new public management' reform aimed to shrink government, reduce costs, and improve performance by introducing market-like incentives. The movement sought to transform how government performed its basic functions, with changes first seen in Commonwealth countries, then in selected OECD nations, and finally in the United States. Unlike parliamentary systems, the U.S. operates under a Constitution that separates powers, making executive direction changes more challenging. The United States, unlike other countries, did not widely accept government ownership of key industries, leading to less need for New Public Management reforms. The American approach to the reform was the \"reinventing government\" initiative led by Vice President Al Gore, emphasizing public choice principles. The U.S. Constitution's separation of powers between the President and Congress also made significant shifts in executive branch control less likely. The \"reinventing government\" initiative led by Vice President Al Gore aimed to move Democrats towards market principles and away from traditional government planning. This shift was made palatable by using language from business schools instead of public choice principles. The entrepreneurial management paradigm, originating from David Osborne's and Ted Gaebler's book, combined market economics with business motivational literature to transform the public sector. The National Performance Review was established in 1993 by President Bill Clinton as part of the \"reinventing government\" initiative led by Vice President Al Gore. The NPR aimed to make government agencies resemble private sector corporations and operate more efficiently. There was no statutory authority assigned to the NPR, and it remained informal and fluid with a changing cast of participants. In 1997, the NPR changed its name to the National Partnership for. The National Partnership for Reinventing Government, formerly known as the NPR, aimed to address public disenchantment with government through a fluid structure under the Vice President's Office. Key staff included Elaine Kamarck, Bob Stone, and John Kamensky. In the 1980s, there was a push for privatization of government services, but some wanted a New Public Management approach. Vice President Al Gore announced plans to \"reinvent\" government to prioritize serving customers, empowering employees, and fostering excellence. The NPR issued a report six months later, outlining the shift from regulations to incentives in government management. The report emphasized the need for a clear mission, delegated authority, budget-based outcomes, and measuring success by customer satisfaction. It highlighted four key premises, including the similarity between government and private sectors in responding to management incentives, viewing government agencies as entrepreneurial bodies, reducing the number of civil servants to decrease government size, and advocating for competitive market environments for federal agencies. The NPR rejected the old administrative management paradigm based on law, advocating for entrepreneurial management where agency managers have central roles. They criticized Congress for micro-management and suggested downgrading central management agencies like OMB. Agencies should have more autonomy over personnel, compensation, and regulations according to the NPR's administrative philosophy. The NPR advocated for a shift towards entrepreneurial management in government agencies, emphasizing customer needs and outcomes over bureaucratic turf. Vice President Gore envisioned agencies resembling private companies with CEO-like leaders to cut costs and operate with more autonomy. Entrepreneurial managers blur the distinctions between government and private sectors. Managers believe legal distinctions between government and private sectors hinder contemporary business practices. They advocate for government-private partnerships run by autonomous managers focused on performance. Future managers should be risk-takers willing to bypass unnecessary rules for cost-effective results. The emphasis is on changing attitudes and behavior rather than laws, reducing Congress's role. Empirical results, not legal processes, will be prioritized in the entrepreneurial model. The NPR literature emphasizes economically based values over legally based values. When President Clinton announced the National Performance Review, there was no existing staff, funding, or work plan. A small team was formed, which developed an interagency task force. The NPR had to rely on personnel detailed from agencies and funding from existing agency appropriations. Consultants were hired, and the staff size reached 250, mostly career government employees on detail from their agencies. The National Performance Review (NPR) was announced by President Clinton in March 1993, with a report and recommendations expected in six months. The report, titled \"From Red Tape to Results: Creating a Government that Works Better and Costs Less,\" was unveiled in September 1993. It outlined roughly 100 important recommendations for changes in government management to produce savings. The NPR relied on personnel detailed from agencies and existing agency funding for its operations. The National Performance Review (NPR) recommendations aimed to save $108 billion over 5 years, with the largest savings from streamlining bureaucracy. This included cutting half of executive branch middle management. Other recommendations included biennial budgeting and restructuring the Inspectors General role. The report also suggested redefining the government's role. The National Performance Review recommended redefining the role and authorities of the institutional President and central management agencies, downgrading the \"M\" side of OMB and replacing it with interagency committees. The report called for a pluralistic organizational structure, with agencies acting as competitive enterprises in charge of their own personnel and financing systems. The focus was on placing greater faith in politically appointed leadership and a re-culturated federal and contract workforce to ensure performance. The National Performance Review recommended shifting focus to performance over political accountability in federal organization and management. Evaluating the NPR's results is challenging due to its broad scope and elusive underlying theory. The NPR aimed to change the approach to reorganization by prioritizing performance improvement. The National Performance Review aimed to prioritize performance over political accountability in federal organization and management. The focus was on changing behavior at the agency level, with the concept of \"change\" being central. The Government Performance and Results Act reflected this shift towards performance, although the development of the bill was influenced more by Congress and external organizations than the NPR itself. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) was actively promoted in Congress with assistance from GAO. Unlike previous budgetary exercises, GPRA had a statutory basis and mandate, making it harder for agencies to ignore. NPR leaders and outside organizations pushed for GPRA integration into agency management. A government-wide set of GPRA goals was published for FY 2001. Evaluations of GPRA are mixed, but it remains a work in progress. The NPR evaluated itself before the 2000 election, emphasizing the reduction of the federal government's size. The NPR reduced the federal workforce by 426,200 positions, exceeding their original promise. They implemented cuts and savings by eliminating unnecessary elements like bloated headquarters and outdated field offices. This included cutting 78,000 managers, 640,000 pages of internal rules, and closing nearly 2000 obsolete field offices. Additionally, 250 programs and agencies were eliminated, such as the Tea-Tasters Board and the Bureau of Mines. Critics questioned whether these actions truly improved government efficiency. The NPR reduced the federal workforce significantly, cutting managers and eliminating unnecessary elements. Critics disputed the effectiveness of these actions, questioning if they truly improved government efficiency. Some agencies saw success in implementing second-level objectives like employee empowerment and creating entrepreneurial organizations. The federal government was seen as a business incubator under the Clinton administration. Entrepreneurial organizations have thrived since the Clinton administration aimed to reshape government in a business-like manner. Critics argue that this approach has weakened government management, eroded the legal basis for administrative management, and led to a retreat from democratic values. Executive organization in government is constantly evolving, with changes ranging from visible to low-key, reflecting various values. Reorganization of the executive branch of government is a continuous and natural activity that can reflect different values and purposes. It is not a neutral process, as there are winners and losers, and not all proposals hold equal value. Reorganizations are instrumental in achieving political or policy objectives but cannot fix fundamentally flawed programs. Reorganizations of the executive branch can be costly and may have unintended consequences. It is challenging to determine the effectiveness of reorganizations and whether they are based on sound principles or past experiences. The motives behind reorganizations have evolved over the 20th century. The evolution of the force for comprehensive reorganization commissions has changed over time. Initially, these commissions were seen as tools to promote political accountability within the executive branch. The establishment of the Budget Bureau, for example, aimed to hold the President accountable for agency budgets and oversight. This centralizing element benefited both the President and Congress. However, by the 1970s, a different motivating force emerged, leading to a shift in the approach to reorganizations. In the 1970s, a new motivating force for reorganization emerged, emphasizing managerial autonomy at the agency level over political accountability. The National Performance Review (NPR) promoted entrepreneurial values and focused on achieving better results and performance through management processes, relying on success stories rather than theory. Congress had minimal presence in their approach. The entrepreneurs in the reinventing government exercise focus on success indicators like customer satisfaction rather than theory. The future of landmark commissions in the coming century is important, even if the New Public Management paradigm fades. Commissions study specific issues and make recommendations to various authorities. The future of landmark commissions in the coming century is uncertain, as the need for a comprehensive review of the executive branch may require a new approach. Entrepreneurial management paradigm could potentially replace the traditional theory of organizational management in guiding commissions' studies and recommendations. The future of landmark commissions in the coming century is uncertain, as the need for a comprehensive review of the executive branch may require a new approach. Questions arise about the compatibility of traditional constitutionalist values with entrepreneurial values, the complexity of the executive branch for a single commission to study, the inclusion of quasi-government entities in future commissions, and the role of the President in organizational management. Despite doubts about their utility, landmark commissions continue to appeal to lawmakers. Landmark commissions continue to appeal to lawmakers, with efforts to establish a \"new Hoover Commission\" in Congress. Senator Fred Thompson introduced bill S. 2306 in the 106th Congress, charging a nine-member commission to make structural recommendations for the executive branch. Supporters, including Paul Light of the Brookings Institution, emphasized the need for structural reform and urged the passage of S. 2306. S. 2306 aims to reform the Federal Government's structure through legislation, similar to past commissions like the Hoover Commission. Presidential initiative is required to activate this new Commission. The newly inaugurated President George H.W. Bush had the opportunity to activate a Commission to review the executive branch structure but did not take action by the deadline. The potential Commission would have faced challenges in dealing with the political and institutional aspects of the presidency and Congress. Recent Presidents have been ambivalent towards management generally, and organizational management in particular. There is no longer a consensus that the President should be the \"chief manager\" of the executive branch. Scholars and aides have advised Presidents, starting with John F. Kennedy, to avoid management issues. Stephen Hess argued in 1976 that the President should focus on political leadership, not management. The argument that the President should focus on political leadership rather than management has been reiterated throughout the century, leading to a decline in the Office of Management and Budget's capacity to perform management functions. This decline was evident after the implementation of the Reorganization Plan of 1970, which changed the name of the Bureau of the Budget to the Office of Management and Budget. Employee statistics reflect the decrease in OMB's management capacity and the institutional presidency's decline. The decline in OMB's management capacity is evident through a decrease in staff numbers from 224 in 1970 to only 47 during the Reagan Administration. The Clinton Administration integrated most remaining staff into five Resource Management Offices. By early 2002, only 12 staff members remained, with vacancies in key positions. This retreat from management by the President and OMB is linked to future proposals for a landmark-style commission. The proper design and implementation of structural management proposals rest with a central management agency working from a presidential perspective. Reorganizations initiated by agencies may not align with the President's interests. The Hoover Commission in 1949 intended for executive reorganization to involve ongoing communication between the Bureau of the Budget and Government Operations Committees in Congress. Today, these committees continue to function with altered missions. Presidential reorganization plans are to be sent to these committees to ensure coordination. The reorganization proposals in the executive branch are now typically referred to subject field committees, leading to increasing disaggregation in organization and management. This institutional weakness in both the executive and legislative branches could impact the success of any new landmark commission. For a commission to be successful, it needs institutional support and cannot work in isolation from the government. A successful landmark commission requires institutional support and ties with central managerial agencies in the executive branch and general management committees in Congress. A focused and limited mandate is more likely to provide useful results than a broad mandate with substantial policy implications. Others besides the commission must have a stake in the success of the exercise. Landmark commissions should have institutional support and ties with central managerial agencies. Commissions need to be aware of the legal character of governmental organization and activities. Consensus among commission members on organizational principles is crucial for effectiveness. Ignoring these principles may hinder success."
