The bill passed the House on May 25, was referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services on June 6, and was discharged by the Committee on November 15. The Senate passed the amended bill on December 19, 2005, and it was enacted by the President on January 3, 2006 (P.L. 109-163). The House Committee on Appropriations reported an original measure on June 10, 2005 (H.Rept. 109-119), which was passed by the House on June 20. The House passed the bill on June 20, 2005, and the Senate received it on June 21. The Senate passed an amended version on October 7, 2005, and a conference report was agreed upon on December 14.

Representative Jerry Lewis proposed a reorganization of the House Committee on Appropriations in January 2005, resulting in the elimination of the Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Military Construction. The Subcommittee on Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs, chaired by Representative James T. Walsh, took over responsibilities from the eliminated VA-HUD and Military Construction subcommittees. It now oversees appropriations for various Department of Defense accounts related to military construction, family housing, and housing assistance programs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reorganized under Senator Thad Cochran's chairmanship, dissolving the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing, and Urban Development. The Subcommittee on Military Construction now handles military construction appropriations and additional obligations for Veterans Affairs, American Battle Monuments Commission, and Cemeterial Expenses. The Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing, and Urban Development was dissolved under Senator Thad Cochran's chairmanship. The reconstituted subcommittee, chaired by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, was renamed the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. House and Senate appropriators resolved differences over appropriation accounts, with the House agreeing to follow Senate preferences. The Army is undergoing significant structural reorganization, transitioning from divisions to smaller brigades. This change could lead to an increase in the number of garrisons. The Department of Defense announced locations for 44 new \"Modular Brigade Combat Teams\" (MBCT). The Army's reorganization is linked to Military Base Realignment and Closure and redeployment initiatives. The Army is undergoing structural reorganization, transitioning to smaller brigades and increasing garrisons. The 2005 round of Base Realignment and Closures (BRAC) involved redeploying troops and appointing a BRAC Commission. Funding is expected for these initiatives to be carried out simultaneously. The 2005 BRAC Commission presented recommended actions to the President, who approved them on September 15, 2005. Congress had 45 days to pass a resolution disapproving the list, but two resolutions failed. This marked the fifth time a commission determined military base closures. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closing or reducing military bases. Congress authorized several rounds of closures, with the 2005 round being the most recent. The Department of Defense released a list of recommended actions, including deactivating the 111th Fighter Wing and redistributing aircraft from the 183rd Fighter Wing. The Governor of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense for recommending the deactivation of the 111th Fighter Wing without his consent, citing a violation of federal statute. Governor Rendell requested a court judgment declaring that the Secretary cannot deactivate the wing without his approval. Governor Blagojevich of Illinois filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense and BRAC Commissioners, claiming that the realignment of the 183rd Fighter Wing violated federal law by not obtaining the Governor's consent. Other states also took legal action, arguing that state governors' approval was required before recommending military realignments. The appropriation request for Fiscal Year 2006 is split between two Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Accounts, one for 1990 and one for 2005. The BRAC 1990 account is devoted to funding environmental remediation on federal property deemed excess during previous BRAC rounds. The President requested almost $378 million for FY2006, with the Senate increasing it to nearly $403 million. The amount enacted was slightly less than $255 million. The BRAC 2005 account will fund realignment and closure actions, including unit and equipment movement, infrastructure construction, and property closure. Implementation must start within two years and finish within six years of enactment. Appropriations tend to peak in the third or fourth year before declining due to environmental remediation and land transfer. The BRAC 2005 appropriations account was established to fund the first year of realignment and closure activity. The President's initial appropriation request for BRAC 2005 was $1.88 billion, but the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations approved only $1.57 billion and $1.50 billion respectively. The Committee cited the President's intention to retain unobligated funds as the reason for reducing the appropriation. The Conference recommended $1.50 billion. Despite previous BRAC rounds, a significant amount of surplus land remains under the Department of Defense's ownership due to cleanup responsibilities before transfer. The House discussed the situation at former Ft. Ord where DOD still holds large tracts of land. The Committee is aware of discussions between the Army and the re-use authority at former Ft. Ord to transfer surplus land before cleanup completion. They suggest exploring an environmental services cooperative agreement for immediate land transfer with cleanup funding access. Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana previously hosted aircraft operations recommended for closure by the 1995 BRAC Commission. The 1995 BRAC Commission recommended closing fixed-wing aircraft operations at Malmstrom AFB, which was subsequently carried out. A provision in H.R. 3 in 2005 called for the reopening of the airfield, but it was later removed by H.Con.Res. 226. In the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, recommendations were often redirected by the Secretary of Defense and/or the BRAC Commissions. For example, in 1995, the Secretary of Defense changed receiving sites for squadrons at NAS Miramar from NAS Lemoore and NAS Fallon to other naval air stations. In the 2005 round, conditional recommendations were made for Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico and Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach. Cannon Air Force Base occupies over 4,500 acres near Clovis, New Mexico. Cannon Air Force Base in eastern New Mexico hosts the 27th Fighter Wing and supports active duty Air Force operations. The BRAC Commission realigned Cannon, keeping the base open but redistributing its aircraft to other units. This decision would impact approximately 20% of the local employment base. The recommendation to keep Cannon Air Force Base open was made with the condition that a new mission be identified by December 31, 2009. The Air Force was working on finding this new mission. Concerns were raised about the impact of real estate development near Naval Air Station Oceana on the Navy's air fleet and surrounding population. The BRAC Commission recommended realigning Naval Air Station Oceana by relocating the East Coast Master Jet Base to Cecil Field, Florida if Virginia fails to prevent further encroachment by March 2006. Despite opposition, Jacksonville's mayor withdrew support for reopening NAS Cecil Field. Virginia Beach continues efforts to meet BRAC Commission's conditions for retaining the Master Jet Base at Oceana. The BRAC Commission recommended legislation for future infrastructure reconfiguration and potential new BRAC rounds in 2014-2015. Ft. Belvoir will add 21,300 military, civilian, and contractor positions due to realignment and closures at other defense installations. Alexandria, Virginia will add approximately 21,300 military, civilian, and contractor positions to Ft. Belvoir. Concerns have been raised about the impact on transportation infrastructure. Representatives introduced H.R. 4457 to upgrade roads important to national defense. The Overseas Basing Commission (OBC) released its draft report on May 9, 2005, as mandated by Congress. The Commission conducted a thorough study on the military facility structure of the United States overseas and submitted recommendations to the President and Congress for legislation and administrative actions. The Overseas Basing Commission (OBC) released a draft report with a proposal for an overseas basing strategy for the Department of Defense to meet current and future missions. The report also mentioned the redeployment of military personnel to garrisons within the United States and its territories. The OBC emphasized that the overseas basing structure should be evaluated in the context of other national security considerations. The Overseas Basing Commission's draft report highlighted the need for a reordering of steps due to excessive activity, calling for deliberation and review. Key issues for Congress include the absorption of personnel at U.S. military bases, BRAC interaction, and military construction requirements. The Department of Defense announced the return of 11 military installations in Germany to full German control in FY2007. The Department of Defense announced that installations in Germany will be returned to full German national control during FY2007. Two additional facilities in W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg Hospital, and Leighton Barracks, will also be returned to German control at a later date. Funding of $2.2 billion was requested to support military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, raising questions about the long-term U.S. presence in the region. The Department of Defense is evaluating the funding and oversight of military construction projects for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, including the use of supplemental funding. U.S. Central Command operates from installations in these countries and surrounding states. Political unrest in Kyrgyzstan in 2005 led to assurances from the interim Prime Minister regarding the continued use of the Manas facility. The Minister of the country assured the United States of continued use of the Manas Air Base near Bishkek. Uzbekistan also called for a reexamination of U.S. use of the Karshi-Khanabad Air Base. The government of Uzbekistan gave the U.S. 180 days to cease operations at Khananabad. The Department of Defense worked to improve housing for military personnel in the late 1990s. The Department of Defense has improved housing for military personnel by increasing housing allowances and entering into public-private partnerships with real estate developers. The target date for ensuring adequate housing was revised to 2007 for personnel in the US and 2009 for overseas personnel. The House Committee on Appropriations highlighted issues for veterans transitioning from active duty to veteran status, urging interoperability between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs electronic systems. The 109th Congress passed emergency bills providing $62.3 billion for hurricane response and recovery in the Gulf Coast region. The 109th Congress passed emergency bills providing $62.3 billion for hurricane response and recovery in the Gulf Coast region. $60 billion was allocated to FEMA for emergency food, shelter, and medical care, while $1.9 billion went to the Department of Defense for facility damage and personnel evacuation costs. Additionally, $400 million was given to the Army Corps for flood control projects. The Administration later requested $17.1 billion reallocated for FEMA use and submitted a rescission request of $2.3 billion from 17 accounts to cover disaster costs. The CRS has prepared various reports on Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, which can be accessed online or at the CRS Product Distribution Center. Federal policy towards veterans emphasizes their service and the Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs for veterans and their dependents. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) consists of three primary organizations - Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). They provide various benefits including compensation for disabilities, pensions for disabled war veterans, education and training services, medical care, life insurance, and burial assistance. The Administration's budget for VA in FY2006 is estimated at $69.5 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion from FY2005. Both the House and Senate passed budget resolutions for veterans benefits and services, with the House recommending $68.9 billion in new budget authority. The final budget resolution approved by both houses on April 28, 2005, included $69.0 billion for the veterans budget function in FY2006. H.R. 2528, as approved by the House Appropriations Committee on May 18, 2005 and by the House on May 26, 2005, would have provided a total of $68.1 billion for the VA budget with $31.5 billion of the bill's $85.2 billion 302(b) allocation going for VA discretionary spending. The Senate passed a bill on September 22, 2005, providing a total of $70.7 billion for VA, including $34.1 billion in new budget authority for discretionary spending. The final conference report provides $37.2 billion in mandatory funding and $33.0 billion in discretionary funding for a total of $70.2 billion for VA cash benefit programs. VA entitlement spending is projected to reach $37.2 billion in FY2006, with increases due to a rising number of beneficiaries and cost-of-living adjustments. The Senate passed an amendment in 2005 to address disparities in disability compensation for veterans. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for veterans medical services in response to a budget shortfall. The Administration announced a budget shortfall of over $1 billion. The House and Senate adopted a conference agreement for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill in 2006. The President's FY2006 budget requested $28.2 billion for VHA, with an additional $2.0 billion requested for medical services. VHA medical care collections for FY2006 are expected to be $2.2 billion. The House budget resolution called for $31.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for VA medical care programs in FY2006. The Administration proposed several legislative changes, including an annual enrollment fee of $250 for veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8, increasing pharmacy co-payments, suspending grants for construction and renovation of state extended care facilities, and providing per diem payments to state veterans nursing homes for specific care needs. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee proposed S. 1182 to authorize payment for insured veteran patients' out-of-pocket expenses for emergency services obtained outside the VA health care system. The House passed H.R. 2528 for Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs appropriations for FY2006. The MIL-QUAL appropriations bill, H.R. 2528, allocated $28.8 billion for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in FY2006. The House version included $31.0 billion for VHA, with $2.2 billion from collections. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2528, providing $31.3 billion for VHA programs. The MIL-CON appropriations bill allocated $31.3 billion for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) programs in FY2006, which is $1.2 billion more than the Administration's request and $2.5 billion more than the House-passed version. The bill included funding for medical services, administration, facilities, research, and information technology programs. The total amount of funds available for VHA under the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2528 would be $33.5 billion, including collections. No fee increases proposed by the President were recommended in the bill.
