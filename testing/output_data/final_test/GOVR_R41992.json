    "content": "Nearly one-third of the United States is covered by forest land, with 750 million acres owned by individuals, corporations, and various levels of government. The Forest Service, part of the Department of Agriculture, manages 193 million acres of national forests for multiple uses like recreation, timber, grazing, and habitat protection. Controversies surround reduced timber harvests, wildfire risks, forest health, and user disagreements. Some suggest third-party certification for sustainable forest management to address congressional disputes over national forest management. These programs aim to promote sustainable practices by balancing resource demand with ecological, economic, and social needs through independent assessments and product labels. Certification programs for sustainable forest management are developed by multi-stakeholder groups without much government involvement. While initially for private forest owners, they now certify public forests as well. The USDA Forest Service decided not to pursue certification for national forests in 1997, but certification of state, DOE, and DOD forests has raised questions. A study in 2005 evaluated potential certification for national forests, but no policy changes have been made since 2007. Congress could direct the Forest Service to pursue certification for some or all of the 105 national forest units. Certification of national forests as sustainably managed may demonstrate high standards and reduce conflicts over management decisions. Certification could streamline the management process by replacing existing requirements with a more efficient structure. Additionally, certification may benefit the private sector, including the timber and wood products industries. Certifying national forests as sustainable may benefit the private sector by providing access to certified materials. However, there are costs and uncertainties involved in the certification process, including initial fees, ongoing maintenance costs, and potential changes to meet certification requirements. These costs may not always be recovered through improved management or higher prices for certified products. The report outlines the history and development of forest certification as a voluntary mechanism to promote sustainable practices. It compares and contrasts the two major certification programs in the United States, highlighting the challenges and complexities involved in the certification process. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio De Janeiro failed to address global forest degradation issues due to opposition from developing countries. Instead of a legally binding agreement, the Statement of Forest Principles was created, which was considered a disappointment. In 1995, the Montreal Process was established to define sustainable forest management measures. The Montreal Process established criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, including conservation of biodiversity, maintaining ecosystem productivity, and legal frameworks. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standard was developed in 1993 by the World Wildlife Fund to promote sustainable forest management through private-sector tools. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standard, developed by the World Wildlife Fund in 1993, promotes sustainable forest management through market incentives. FSC is a global standard applicable to various forest types, with regional adaptations. The FSC-US chapter, established in 1995, is responsible for developing the U.S. standard for the lower 48 states. The FSC-US certification standard, established in 1995, covers the lower 48 states and is divided into nine regions with region-specific guidance. By July 2011, FSC had certified 353 million acres of forest land in 79 countries, including 33 million acres in the United States. Competing with FSC, the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) was established in 1994 by the American Forests & Paper Association (AF&PA) to focus on sustainable forest production in the US and later expanded to Canada. Initial SFI criteria were developed by industry representatives with no external stakeholder participation. The SFI standard, established by AF&PA in 1994, has undergone significant changes to compete with FSC. It now requires third-party audits, is independent from AF&PA, and has certified 58 million acres of forest land in the US. The FSC and PEFC are the primary global certification programs, with smaller programs operating at national or regional levels. The PEFC is a global organization endorsing national certification programs for sustainable forest management. It was initiated in Europe and now includes industry groups. The PEFC endorsed the SFI standard in 2005, with the SFI Board of Directors governing the U.S. chapter. As of July 2011, the PEFC had 35 national members and certified 576 million acres. In 2011, the PEFC had 35 national members and certified sustainable management of 576 million acres through 30 national certification programs. The Canadian Standards Association Sustainable Forest Management System (CSA-SFM) is Canada's official national standard, endorsed by PEFC, certifying over 160 million acres. The American Tree Farm System (ATFS) promotes responsible forest stewardship on privately owned forests in the United States. The American Tree Farm System (ATFS) is the oldest certification system for privately owned, nonindustrial forests in the United States. Established in 1941, it is a program of the American Forest Foundation. Landowners with at least 10 acres of managed forest land can participate, with over 26 million acres certified. The ATFS targets small landowners and requires third-party verification. Participation is voluntary, but compliance with standards is mandatory for certification. Sustainable forest certification involves negotiating standards among various stakeholder groups to ensure balanced management. Independent third parties verify compliance throughout the supply chain, with monitoring, reporting, and re-certification requirements in place. This private governance system uses eco-labels to communicate responsibly produced forest products to consumers. The market for certified wood products has grown exponentially in response to demand by wood suppliers, driven by concerns over rapid deforestation. Retailers like Home Depot began carrying FSC-certified wood in the late 1990s, leading to a chain reaction of demand for certified products. Landowners and paper producers also responded to the growing demand by certifying their forests and sources. The market for certified wood products has grown significantly in under two decades, with a quarter of global industrial wood production coming from certified sources. After boycotts, Home Depot initially accepted only FSC-certified wood products, despite pressure from other certification programs. Environmental groups favored the FSC program over the SFI program, questioning its validity and rigor. Home Depot commissioned a consultant to compare both programs independently, highlighting stronger ecological protections in FSC and more lenient verification procedures in SFI. This led to changes in the SFI program in response. The SFI program underwent revisions to enhance competitiveness and comparability with the FSC program, including third-party audits and separation from AF&PA. The FSC program also made changes, strengthening its standards and accreditation processes in response to SFI and PEFC programs. Market forces influence certification programs, with the USGBC only awarding credit for FSC-certified wood products in the green building market. The SFI has revised its standards to align with FSC, gain LEED credit, and access the green construction market. In 2010, there was an unsuccessful attempt to include SFI in the LEED program. Landowners and firms invest in forest certification for market advantage and accountability. Market benefits from certification include price premiums, niche market access, product differentiation, and customer loyalty, but U.S. forests have not fully realized these benefits due to limited consumer demand for certified products. Despite limited consumer demand and minor price premiums, certified wood from tropical countries and luxury home building products have seen market advantages. Certification is increasingly seen as a market access requirement and signals responsible management. Forest landowners in the United States are generally satisfied with certification due to its accountability mechanisms. Certification can also serve as a defensive tool against negative publicity. Certification programs like FSC and SFI ensure sustainable forest management through landowner and chain-of-custody certification. Timber harvesting is not mandatory, but evaluations assess adherence to management plans and sustainable standards. FSC and SFI operate similarly with governance structures, standard development procedures, and accreditation requirements. The sustainability standards for forest management require collaboration among environmental, social, and economic groups. Certification audits are conducted by independent third parties to evaluate management plans and activities, with non-conformances needing to be addressed for certification. Maintenance and re-certification are necessary, with monitoring and enforcement provisions in place. Certified forests can use the system's label on products, but chain-of-custody certification is needed for supply chain use. Chain-of-custody certification is required for using the certification label along the supply chain. It ensures certified wood is accounted for from the forest to production, with sourcing, controls, record-keeping, and documentation. Producers and vendors must be certified to use the label. FSC and SFI programs have similar frameworks but unique attributes. FSC is international with regional distinctions, while SFI is North American endorsed globally. The FSC and SFI programs have similar frameworks but unique attributes. The FSC is a global organization with a national chapter in the United States, while the SFI is a North American organization endorsed by an international certification system. The governance and membership structures differ between the two programs, with the FSC being a multi-stakeholder organization open to individuals and organizations, excluding governments. Members in the FSC are organized into social, environmental, or economic chambers, each carrying equal voting weight. The FSC is a global organization with a national chapter in the United States. The General Assembly elects three members from each chamber to serve on the Board of Directors. FSC-US adapts global FSC principles to the specific conditions in the U.S. with a national board of nine members. The U.S. chapter of the FSC has a national board with nine members, reflecting the global FSC structure. Global FSC members in the U.S. can participate in committees, standards review, and elect board members. Certificate holders in the U.S. automatically become FSC-US members with voting rights. SFI operates nationally in the U.S. and Canada, with an 18-member Board of Directors representing environmental, economic, and social interests. The SFI organization has a Board of Directors with 18 members representing environmental, economic, and social interests. Board members nominate and elect successive members based on knowledge of sustainable forestry. The Board sets policies, elects the executive committee, appoints task groups, and develops standards. An External Review Panel monitors the program's development and implementation. Implementation Committees at state or regional levels promote sustainable forestry practices. Membership requirements vary by committee, generally open to SFI certificate holders with operations in the location. Both the SFI and FSC certification programs have Implementation Committees at state or regional levels. The programs use hierarchical standards based on sustainable management principles, with differences in geographic scopes. Both programs emphasize an open and inclusive process for developing standards, with functional differences due to governance structures. The FSC standard is based on 10 principles implemented through 56 criteria, focusing on promoting forest stewardship. The FSC certification program focuses on promoting forest stewardship, biological diversity, and ecosystem functionality through 56 criteria. The principles and criteria are globally applicable and adapted to local conditions through 192 indicators set at the national level. The FSC is currently undergoing a full revision of its principles and criteria, with the FSC-US standards being reviewed and revised every five years. The FSC certification program focuses on promoting forest stewardship, biological diversity, and ecosystem functionality through 56 criteria. The principles and criteria are globally applicable and adapted to local conditions through 192 indicators set at the national level. The FSC is currently undergoing a full revision of its principles and criteria, with the FSC-US standards being reviewed and revised every five years. The SFI standard is based on 14 principles of sustainable forest management implemented through performance measures and indicators, focusing on forest stewardship, biological diversity, and forest operations in the United States. The SFI standard is reviewed and revised every five years by a task group appointed by the Board of Directors. The latest revision was approved in January 2010, with certificate holders given one year to comply. Certification audits are conducted by independent third-party organizations accredited internationally. The certification bodies for sustainable forest management programs like SFI and FSC are evaluated annually to maintain credibility and impartiality. Both programs draw from ISO standards for quality and environmental management processes. ISO is an international organization that sets standards for various products and services. The FSC developed its own accreditation process through Accreditation Services International (ASI) and certifies sustainable resource management programs. The SFI program requires accreditation by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) National Accreditation Board and has specific qualification requirements for auditors and audit teams. The certification audit includes a review of operating plans, procedures, and supporting documents. The certification process involves review of operating plans, staff consultations, field inspections, and stakeholder consultations by the certification body. A report is issued identifying non-conformances and corrective actions needed for certification. The final assessment is publicly available on the system's website. Monitoring, recertification, and complaint procedures vary by system. Stakeholder consultations are required, and the audit report must be peer-reviewed. Non-conformances must be resolved within specific timeframes, or certification may be revoked. Annual monitoring includes surveillance audits. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has a dispute resolution process for handling complaints and appeals against the FSC, certification bodies, or certificate holders. The process involves stakeholder consultations, with minor non-conformances to be resolved within one year and major non-conformances before certification. Annual monitoring includes surveillance audits. Re-certification is required every five years. The Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) has annual monitoring and maintenance requirements, with re-certification needed every three years. Compliance with indicators is mandatory, but substitutions or modifications can be made with proper analysis and justification. The SFI has a dispute resolution process through Implementation Committees or the External Review Panel. There are no restrictions on certifying federal lands, with specific requirements for public lands in the standard. The FSC standard has specific requirements for public lands, with a Federal Lands Policy for federal government agencies seeking certification. Three threshold standards must be met: a willing landowner, public consensus on forest management, and development of FSC standards for the agency. Direct costs for certification include an initial fee. The direct costs of certification include the initial certification fee, annual maintenance fees, and re-certification fee. The initial fee covers the third-party audit, team site visit, and certification issuance. Certification costs vary based on land size, ranging from less than ten cents to hundreds of dollars per acre. Larger landowners find it easier to absorb these costs. SFI and FSC programs offer assistance to smaller landowners. Indirect costs of certification are also considered. The SFI and FSC programs have comparable costs, including management and operation costs for certification. Certification may require changes in operational practices, investments in equipment, technologies, training, and management practices. It may also involve developing monitoring and record-keeping programs, adjusting harvest levels, and non-commercial thinning. Few reports directly compare SFI and FSC programs for large landowners in the US. Several reports claim objectivity in comparing SFI and FSC programs for large landowners in the United States, but many are published by FSC, SFI, or their partners and are based on outdated standards. The only recent comparison based on current standards was released by the Dovetail Partnership, Inc., an environmental NGO with no ties to either program. The general consensus from objective comparisons is that structurally, the programs are similar. The FSC and SFI programs are structurally similar but have different strengths and weaknesses related to sustainability. SFI emphasizes sustainable timber harvesting, while FSC focuses on sustainable forest management. Dual certification from both programs is common, especially for public forests. Directly comparing the two programs is challenging due to their different targets and approaches. The FSC program uses performance-based targets, while the SFI program uses both performance- and systems-based targets. Performance targets focus on achieving specific goals, while system targets focus on developing processes to achieve desired outcomes. Performance-based standards are more prescriptive and evaluated in the field, while systems-based standards are flexible and evaluated in an office. The comparison between the FSC and SFI certification programs evaluates various issues related to the certification of U.S. national forests. Both programs cover forest management, wildlife and habitat management, water and soil resource management, other forest uses and values, decision-making and management planning, and miscellaneous aspects. The SFI program focuses on sustainable timber harvesting, while the FSC program emphasizes sustainable forest management. The FSC program emphasizes sustainable forest management through timber harvests as a tool, with more stringent ecological protections and detailed standards compared to the SFI program. The FSC standard is more complex and global in focus, spanning 75 pages, while the SFI standard is described in 14 pages. The differences between the programs may be driven by varying environmental and social regulations in different countries. The forest management category of sustainable forestry covers silvicultural activities related to tree growth, harvest operations, roads management, fire and fuels management, insect and pest management, and economic considerations. Sustainable harvest operations balance forest productivity and economic benefits while limiting ecosystem impacts and resource damage. Regeneration of forests can be done naturally or manually through carefully planned pre- and post-harvest activities. The forest management category of sustainable forestry covers activities such as site preparation, road-building, and restoring natural disturbance regimes. Both SFI and FSC programs emphasize healthy ecosystems, fuel management, and biodiversity while discouraging chemical pest control methods and excessive harvest waste. Despite similarities, there are some differences between the two programs. The FSC and SFI programs have similarities in promoting healthy ecosystems and biodiversity while discouraging excessive harvest waste. However, they differ in the calculation method for sustainable harvest levels, clearcut harvest size guidance, reforestation time frames, and old growth harvesting prohibitions. The FSC program has regionally specific guidance, while the SFI program has a national size limit. The wildlife and habitat management category includes activities related to the ecosystem, such as endangered species protection, biodiversity requirements, invasive species control, and wilderness designations. Biodiversity is crucial for sustainable forestry, helping ecosystems withstand disturbances and adapt. Protecting endangered species and preserving landscapes through special designations are also important for biodiversity conservation. The SFI and FSC programs have similar wildlife and habitat management approaches. The FSC program has more stringent protections for rare, threatened, and endangered species and habitats, including habitat connectivity. It also emphasizes a precautionary approach for actions affecting these species. The FSC has stricter protections for old growth and a broader definition of special places with more stringent requirements compared to the SFI program. The FSC program has stricter protections for old growth and prohibits any harvest on public lands. In contrast, the SFI program encourages conserving old growth but does not prohibit old-growth harvests. The FSC program also prohibits the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), while the SFI program allows their use with adherence to laws and regulations. Water and soil resource management in forest ecosystems are crucial for maintaining ecosystem health and productivity, with erosion and sedimentation being primary concerns associated with harvest operations. The FSC and SFI programs have similar water and soil resource management provisions, focusing on erosion control and water quality. The FSC explicitly considers soil productivity for multiple harvests, while the SFI does not address this. The other forest uses and values category covers issues related to the multiple-use mandate of national forests. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 directed the Forest Service to manage national forests for range, recreation, timber, wildlife, and water supply. Subsurface use of national forest land is managed in conjunction with other federal agencies, including addressing aesthetic, visual impacts, and climate change concerns. The FSC and SFI programs differ in their treatment of forest uses and values, with the SFI program focusing more on mitigating visual and aesthetic impacts, while the FSC program has more requirements for grazing, mineral development, and carbon storage. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) focuses on land tenure and user rights to minimize ecological damage from grazing and mineral development, while also calling for no net loss of carbon storage capacity. Sustainable forestry requires careful planning, including assessing current resource conditions and understanding the implications of different management options for the future. The management of national forests involves selecting options that achieve desired future conditions, monitoring implementation, and considering public involvement and transparency. Laws such as the National Forest Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act govern decision-making. Both the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) programs require compliance with laws and regulations in their decision-making and management planning. Both the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) programs require compliance with laws and regulations, development of management plans, collection of data and maps, and annual reporting. Differences include FSC's more stringent management plan updates and SFI's worker safety requirements for contractors. Other differences become less distinct when applied to national forests and U.S. laws. The miscellaneous category captures additional areas of interest. Forest certification programs have expanded beyond private forest owners to include public forest management agencies in the United States. Several state and county forests, such as those in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Washington, have become certified. Most forests choose to participate in multiple certification programs. Several state and county forests in the United States, including those in Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Washington, have opted for dual certification by both the SFI and FSC programs. There are no standard metrics to evaluate the benefits and costs of state certification programs. The FSC program is still developing procedures for national forest certification, while the SFI program is ready to certify national forests. Certification could impact the management of national forests by evaluating their sustainability. Certification could evaluate forest management plans alignment with standards and implementation. Third-party evaluations could resolve disputes over national forest management. Unclear if Forest Service has authority to certify. Congress may need to decide on certification programs, management process requirements, and impact on timber purchasers. The comparison table presents FSC and SFI standards for U.S. national forests, with criteria developed for sustainable forestry assessment. Measures from both programs are listed, identifying relevant standards using their numbering system. Some measures are not included as they are not relevant for federal forest management."
