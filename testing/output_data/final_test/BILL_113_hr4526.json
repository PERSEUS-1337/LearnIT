    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"21st Century Energy Workforce Development Jobs Initiative Act of 2014\". The Congress acknowledges the significant opportunities for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in the energy industry, emphasizing the need to raise educational achievement for future generations. Workforce training and education in various fields are crucial for meeting the industry's growth demands. Improving minority preparation in STEM disciplines at primary and secondary levels is crucial for increasing minority science-based degree attainment in higher education and vocational certificates. African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans' employment rates in the energy industry are influenced by their choice of college degrees and vocational certificates. Data from 2001 to 2010 show these students opting for and completing 4-year programs. American and Hispanic-American students choose and complete 4-year college degrees relevant to the oil and natural gas industry at rates lower than the total student population. African-American and Hispanic-American students opt for 2-year associate degrees and certificates in the same field at rates slightly above and below the total student population. The American Petroleum Institute predicts 525,000 new job opportunities in the industry by 2020, with 31 percent of these jobs expected to be filled. The American Petroleum Institute projects significant job growth in the oil and natural gas industry, with a focus on high-paying skilled and semiskilled blue-collar jobs. By 2030, it is expected that 811,000 new job opportunities will be created, with over 35 percent of these jobs being filled by minorities. The Gulf region is expected to contribute the most to this job growth, with approximately 417,000 new jobs projected. The National Mining Association reported that the coal mining industry supported 805,680 jobs in 2011, including 204,580 direct jobs. Potential job categories in the upstream oil and gas industry include management, professional, service, sales, and office support jobs. Potential job creation in the upstream oil and gas industry includes various occupations such as derrick operators, roustabouts, construction workers, equipment operators, truck drivers, pump operators, and extraction workers. The National Petroleum Council predicts a need for 30,000 miles of new natural gas pipelines in the next decade due to shale gas supply. Minority and woman-owned firms own a small percentage of pipelines compared to nonminority males. The Energy Information Administration estimates a 16% increase in natural gas use in industrial and electric power sectors due to low prices from shale gas production. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 16% increase in natural gas production in the United States, leading to the country becoming a net exporter of natural gas by 2019. Additionally, the United States is expected to become a net exporter of liquefied natural gas by 2016. This growth in natural gas production will result in the creation of new jobs in the sector. The Energy Information Administration predicts that coal-fired electricity generation will remain dominant in the United States, representing 34% of baseload electricity in 2035. A report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates clean energy investment to grow by 230% to $630 billion annually in 2030, driven by improvements in wind and solar technologies. Additional investment in STEM education will be required for the increased use of non-intermittent clean energy sources like hydropower and geothermal. Renewable energy projects, including wind, solar, hydropower, and biomass, are projected to account for 70% of new power generation capacity between 2012 and 2030. By 2030, renewable energy is expected to make up half of the global generation capacity, up from 28% in 2012. This will require additional investment in infrastructure such as long-distance transmission systems, smart grids, storage, and demand response. Since 2005, renewable energy has attracted over $1.3 trillion in investment, and global energy consumption is forecasted to increase by 47% between 2010 and 2035, with a focus on clean energy sources. Global energy consumption is forecasted to increase by 47 percent between 2010 and 2035, with clean energy attracting up to $5.9 trillion worth of investment, leading to new employment and investment opportunities. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOR ENERGY-RELATED JOBS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to improve education and training for energy-related jobs, focusing on increasing skilled minorities and women in STEM fields and providing necessary skills and certifications for energy-related jobs. The Secretary will prioritize educating and training minorities and workers for energy-related jobs. Direct assistance will be provided to community colleges, workforce development organizations, and minority-serving institutions. A clearinghouse will be established to maintain information on training programs and provide guidance for schools and universities. The Secretary will collaborate with various organizations to develop energy-related training programs, including schools, community colleges, universities, and workforce training organizations. Collaboration, mentorships, and partnerships will be encouraged among entities providing effective job training programs in the energy field. The Secretary will collaborate with organizations to establish energy training programs at all educational levels and develop guidelines for institutions. Collaboration with Energy Information Administration and Bureau of the Census will provide insights into energy workforce needs by State and region. The Secretary will collaborate with organizations to establish energy training programs at all educational levels, including colleges and universities, to provide graduates with skills for energy-related jobs. Input will be solicited from various industries for developing guidelines. Guidelines will include teaching energy efficiency and conservation initiatives and promoting STEM education for job opportunities in energy-related fields. Outreach to Minority-Serving Institutions will be conducted as part of the program. Outreach to Minority-Serving Institutions is a key aspect of the program, with a focus on historically black colleges, Hispanic serving institutions, and tribal institutions. Resources will be provided to increase the number of skilled minorities and women in the energy sector, while industry will be encouraged to offer internships and work/study programs for students from these institutions. Additionally, guidelines will be developed to enhance skills for the energy industry workforce. The Secretary will collaborate with the energy industry to identify workforce needs and develop guidelines for skills in energy efficiency, pipeline, utility, and alternative fuels sectors. The program established under subsection (a) includes training and apprenticeship programs in various industries such as alternative fuels, nuclear, oil and gas, renewable energy, and coal. When carrying out the program established under subsection (a), the Secretary will collaborate with organized labor and community-based workforce organizations to identify candidates, including minorities, women, and veterans, for energy-related training and apprenticeship programs."
