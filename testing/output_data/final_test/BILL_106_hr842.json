    "content": "The Act of 1999 is known as the \"Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset Act.\" Congress has made findings regarding this Act. Congress finds that injurious dumping and actionable subsidies must be effectively neutralized to protect domestic industries and prevent job and investment loss. The continued dumping or subsidization of imported products can hinder fair trade conditions and deter domestic producers from reinvesting or rehiring. United States trade laws should be strengthened to ensure the laws achieve their remedial purpose, as producers, small businesses, farmers, and ranchers may struggle to maintain benefits, pay debts, or remain viable without fair trade conditions. SEC. 754. CONTINUED DUMPING OR SUBSIDY OFFSET is added to the Tariff Act of 1930 to address unfair trade practices. SEC. 754 of the Tariff Act of 1930 introduces the Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset, where duties assessed due to dumping or subsidization will be distributed to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures. The term 'affected domestic producer' includes manufacturers, producers, farmers, ranchers, or worker representatives involved in the petition leading to antidumping or countervailing duty orders. The term 'Commissioner' refers to the Commissioner of the United States Customs Service, while the term 'Commission' refers to the United States International Trade Commission. A 'qualifying expenditure' is an expense incurred after the issuance of antidumping or countervailing duty orders in categories such as plant, equipment, research and development, personnel training, and acquisition of technology. The Commissioner will prescribe procedures for disbursing the continued dumping or subsidies offset required by this section, including expenses for personnel training, acquisition of technology, health care benefits, pension benefits, environmental equipment, raw materials, and working capital. Disbursement must occur within sixty days after the beginning of the following fiscal year. The Commission will provide a list of petitioners and companies eligible for distribution of antidumping and countervailing duties to the Commissioner within sixty days of the effective date of the section or an order. If no injury test was required, the Commission will consult with the Department of Commerce to identify petitioners and domestic parties supporting the petition. The Commissioner will publish a notice in the Federal Register prior to distributing duty assessments, listing eligible companies and requesting certification from recipients regarding their desire to receive distribution, continued eligibility, and qualifying expenditures. All funds will be distributed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will distribute funds from assessments to domestic producers based on responses to paragraph (2) on a pro rata basis. Special accounts will be established for outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty orders within fourteen days. The Commissioner will distribute funds from special accounts established for antidumping or countervailing duty orders based on actual assessments, including interest. Regulations will dictate the timing and method of fund distribution until all duties are collected and a final notice is given for distribution. The Commissioner will distribute funds from special accounts for antidumping or countervailing duty orders. Amounts not claimed within 90 days of final distribution will be returned to the Treasury. A conforming amendment is made to the Tariff Act of 1930. The continued antidumping or subsidy offset, effective from October 1, 1996, applies to assessments on outstanding antidumping findings or countervailing duty orders."
