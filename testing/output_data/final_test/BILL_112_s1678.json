The \"Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011\" approves limited access privilege programs under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, amending eligibility requirements and initiation processes for certain fishery management councils. The \"Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011\" allows for a limited access privilege program to harvest fish, but certain conditions must be met before it can take effect. These conditions include submitting a petition, providing fishermen with a fee estimate, and waiting at least 90 days after the estimate is given. The \"Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011\" allows for a limited access privilege program for fisheries. A petition can be submitted by a group of fishermen representing over 50% of eligible fishermen in a fishery to request the program. The proposed plan must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote of eligible fishermen in the fishery. The \"Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011\" allows for a limited access privilege program for fisheries. A petition can be submitted by a group of fishermen representing over 50% of eligible fishermen in a fishery to request the program, which will be certified by the Secretary upon review of signatures. Eligible fishermen are defined as holders of permits issued under a fishery management plan. SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF CERTAIN LIMITED ACCESS PRIVILEGE PROGRAMS. Section 303A of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include provisions for terminating limited access privilege programs in certain fisheries under specific Fishery Management Council authorities. The Secretary is required to assess the number of eligible fishermen in the fishery before and after the establishment of the program to determine if there has been a significant decrease in participation. The Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011 requires the Secretary to assess the number of eligible fishermen in a fishery one year after a limited access privilege program is established. If the number of eligible fishermen decreases by at least 15 percent, the program may be terminated. The Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011 mandates the termination of a limited access privilege program one year after its establishment if the number of eligible fishermen decreases by 15 percent. The appropriate Council must develop an alternative Fishery Management Plan during this 1-year period. The Saving Fishing Jobs Act of 2011 amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to allow for fees collected for limited access privilege programs to recover all program costs, including observer costs, without the 3 percent limitation."
