    "content": "This report provides an overview of FY2016 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the LHHS bill, which includes discretionary and mandatory appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as related agencies like the Social Security Administration. The LHHS bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. The LHHS bill is a major source of discretionary funds for federal programs, with a focus on appropriations. It addresses controversial issues like abortion and stem cell research. Congressional clients can refer to the LHHS experts list for specific agency and program information. The LHHS bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for federal programs, focusing on appropriations and addressing controversial issues. The report provides an overview of major congressional actions on FY2016 appropriations, a comparison of proposed and enacted funding levels for FY2016 and FY2015, and highlights for each major title of the bill. Additionally, an Appendix summarizes budget enforcement activities for FY2016. The report focuses on appropriations for agencies under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittees. It excludes funding for accounts under other subcommittees. The LHHS bill provides funding for the Department of Labor and most agencies at the Department of Health and Human Services. The LHHS bill provides funding for agencies under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittees, excluding accounts under other subcommittees. Funding for agencies such as the Department of Education, Social Security Administration, Corporation for National and Community Service, and more is included in the bill. Funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside of the annual appropriations process. Certain direct spending programs receive funding directly from their authorizing statutes and are not reflected in the report. The LHHS bill includes discretionary and mandatory budget authority. Mandatory programs funded through annual appropriations are known as appropriated entitlements, with little control by appropriators over the amounts provided. Authorizing statutes control program parameters for entitled recipients. Mandatory spending is funded through budget authority provided by the program's authorizing statute. The funding amounts in this report only include funds provided through appropriations acts, not outside sources. The President's budget submission reflects current law estimates and does not include proposed changes to mandatory spending programs. The report focuses on discretionary funding, which receives more attention during the appropriations process. Sequestration may involve across-the-board reductions in discretionary or mandatory spending, with different triggers and processes for each type of spending. Budget authority is the amount allocated for spending. The report focuses on discretionary funding and budget authority, which is the amount of money a federal agency is authorized to spend. Appropriations bills may include budget authority for the current fiscal year or future years. The report displays total budget authority provided in an appropriations bill, regardless of the year it becomes available. It also breaks out current-year appropriations for obligation in a given fiscal year. The process of measuring appropriations against spending ceilings includes scorekeeping adjustments made by the Congressional Budget Office. The report provides a timeline of legislative actions for FY2016 LHHS appropriations and details on supplemental appropriations for HHS enacted as part of the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016. President Obama signed H.R. 5325 (P.L. 114-223) into law on September 29, 2016, providing $1.1 billion in emergency appropriations for Zika response efforts. $933 million was allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services, with $394 million going to the CDC for Zika prevention and response. $152 million allocated to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for Zika-related research and development of vaccines. $387 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for preventing, preparing for, and responding to the Zika virus. Includes funds for reimbursing Zika-related health care costs, projects in Puerto Rico and other territories, expanding primary health services, and supporting National Health Service Corps members in Puerto Rico. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $170 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS, which is $6 billion more than FY2015 enacted levels. This law provided regular, full-year appropriations for all 12 annual appropriations acts, including LHHS. $6 million was designated to support the assignment of National Health Service Corps members to Puerto Rico and other territories. The FY2016 omnibus allocated $888 billion for LHHS, $6 billion more than FY2015 levels. The omnibus followed three CRs and did not include emergency-designated funding for HHS in response to the Ebola outbreak. The FY2016 omnibus allocated $888 billion for LHHS, $6 billion more than FY2015 levels. The first FY2016 CR (P.L. 114-53) included special provisions for LHHS appropriations, which were continued in subsequent extensions. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2016 LHHS appropriations bill with $162 billion in discretionary funds, 1% less than FY2015 levels. The House Appropriations Committee approved its FY2015 LHHS bill with $161 billion in discretionary funds, 2% less than FY2015 levels. The bill also included $718 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $879 billion for LHHS as a whole. The Obama Administration released the FY2016 President's budget on February 2, 2015, requesting $175 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS, a 6% increase from FY2015. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 into law on December 16, 2014, providing $164 billion in discretionary funding for LHHS. In FY2015, the omnibus appropriated $681 billion in mandatory LHHS funding, totaling $846 billion for LHHS. Additionally, $2.7 billion in emergency-designated funding was provided to HHS in response to the Ebola outbreak in Africa, with allocations to CDC, NIH, and the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, administered within the HHS Office of the Secretary, is allocated for drug and vaccine development and domestic hospital preparedness. FY2016 discretionary and mandatory LHHS budget authority is displayed in Table 2, with HHS accounting for the largest share of total appropriations at $732 billion. The LHHS appropriations amount to $732 billion, with HHS receiving 82% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies follow with 8% each. The majority of HHS funding is for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds, while ED funding is mostly discretionary. Related Agencies focus on mandatory payments and administrative costs for programs like Supplemental Security Income. DOL receives the smallest share of LHHS funds at roughly 2%. The LHHS appropriations amount to $732 billion, with HHS receiving 82% of the total funding. ED and Related Agencies follow with 8% each. The majority of HHS funding is for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds, while ED funding is mostly discretionary. DOL receives the smallest share of LHHS funds at roughly 2%. In terms of discretionary funds, HHS receives the largest share (44%), followed by ED (40%). DOL and Related Agencies account for the remaining 16% of discretionary LHHS funds. The Department of Labor (DOL) receives the smallest share of LHHS funds at roughly 2%. DOL entities primarily focus on workforce development and worker protection, administering programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) and providing employment services. The Department of Labor (DOL) includes the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) for veterans' employment services and agencies like OSHA, MSHA, and WHD for worker protection. BLS collects labor market data. The FY2016 omnibus allocated $13.7 billion for DOL, a 3% increase from FY2015. The FY2016 omnibus allocated $13.7 billion for the Department of Labor, which is $384 million more than the FY2015 enacted level and $812 million less than the FY2016 President's request. Approximately $12.2 billion of the total provided is discretionary. The omnibus matched the President's budget request by providing an increase of $86 million to three state formula grant programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act compared to the FY2015 enacted levels. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $13.7 billion for the Department of Labor, with $384 million more than FY2015 and $812 million less than the President's request. It included an increase of $86 million for three state formula grant programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act compared to FY2015. The FY2016 House and Senate committee bills differed in funding levels for these programs, with the Senate bill proposing a $132 million decrease. The omnibus restored the governors' reserve limit for WIOA state formula grants to 15%, consistent with the Senate committee bill. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $221 million for the Dislocated Workers Activities National Reserve (DWA National Reserve), with $19 million directed towards employment and training activities for dislocated coal workers, in line with the President's FY2016 request and the Senate committee bill. The FY2016 President's budget requested an increase in funds for the DWA National Reserve to $241 million, including a $20 million set-aside for reemployment and training for workers dislocated from coal mines and coal-fired power plants. The FY2016 Senate committee bill proposed decreasing funding for the DWA National Reserve to $200 million. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $221 million for the Dislocated Workers Activities National Reserve, with $19 million for dislocated coal workers. The House committee bill reduced funding for the DWA National Reserve to $74 million. The omnibus rejected moving the Office of Disability Employment Policy into ETA and provided $38 million for ODEP. $90 million was allocated for the Apprentice Grant program, supported by funds from H-1B fees. The President's budget requested $100 million for the Apprentice Grant program, not funded by the Senate or House committee bills. The FY2016 omnibus maintained funding for the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) at $228 million, despite the President's request for an increase of $49 million. The WHD enforces labor standards like minimum wages and working hours. The President's request emphasized \"strategic enforcement\" for proactive compliance monitoring. The FY2016 Senate and House committee bills proposed reductions in WHD funding. The FY2016 omnibus called for a $5 million decrease in funding for ILAB compared to FY2015. The President's budget requested a $4 million increase for ILAB, which supports workers' rights globally. The Senate and House committee proposals aimed to cut ILAB funding significantly to eliminate new international grants. Annual LHHS appropriations acts often include provisions related to labor issues. The FY2016 omnibus did not include provisions from the FY2016 Senate and House committee bills related to the proposed fiduciary rule by the DOL. The rule would expand the definition of \"investment advice\" and individuals providing such advice must meet a higher \"fiduciary\" standard. The comment period for this proposed rule ended in September 2015. The FY2016 Senate and House committee bills included provisions to prohibit the use of DOL funds for finalizing the proposed fiduciary rule. The FY2016 omnibus adopted language regarding private surveys in the H-2B wage determination process. The Senate committee bill directed the Secretary of Labor to accept private wage surveys for prevailing wages in the H-2B program. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for workers to be paid the prevailing wage and the conditions for private employer surveys. It also clarifies that the figures mentioned are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and do not include funds from other sources. Amounts are rounded for simplicity, and dollar and percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts. The curr_chunk provides details on the composition of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the agencies funded by the LHHS appropriations laws. It mentions five Public Health Service agencies receiving funding: HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ. The LHHS bill provides funding for various public health agencies with diverse missions, including the provision of health care services, advancement of health care quality and research, and prevention of infectious and chronic diseases. It also funds components of CMS responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and consumer protections. Additionally, funding is allocated to HHS agencies focused on social services, such as the Administration for Children and Families and the Administration for Community Living. The Administration for Community Living (ACL) was established in April 2012 to increase access to community supports for older Americans and people with disabilities. The FY2016 omnibus provided $732.2 billion in appropriations for HHS, a 6% increase from FY2015. The FY2016 omnibus provided $732.2 billion in appropriations for HHS, with $75.1 billion being discretionary. CMS accounts for the majority of funding, receiving $647 billion. ACF and NIH receive about 4% each of total HHS appropriations. Discretionary funding for CMS constitutes only about 6% of HHS appropriations in the FY2016 omnibus, with the bulk going to PHS agencies. In FY2016, the bulk of discretionary appropriations for HHS go to PHS agencies, with NIH receiving the largest share (42%) and ACF the second-largest (25%). Additional funding mechanisms like the Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside and the Prevention and Public Health Fund have been used to support specific programs. The Evaluation Tap, authorized by the Public Health Service Act, allows the Secretary of HHS to direct additional funding to certain activities. The Public Health Service Act allows the Secretary of HHS to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation purposes. The set-aside percentage ranges from 0.2% to 1%, but LHHS appropriations acts have set it higher, with the FY2016 omnibus maintaining it at 2.5%. The FY2016 President's budget proposed increasing it to 3.0%, but this was rejected. The Senate committee bill proposed to keep it at 2.5%, while the House committee bill suggested reducing it to 2.4%. The LHHS appropriations for FY2015 and FY2016 directed tap funds to only a few programs within three HHS agencies, excluding AHRQ, CDC, and HRSA. AHRQ received discretionary appropriations for the first time in over a decade in FY2015, continuing in FY2016. In FY2015 and FY2016, LHHS appropriations directed the largest share of tap transfers to NIH, making them a net recipient of tap funds. The ACA authorized and appropriated mandatory funding for multi-billion dollar trust funds to support PHS agencies' programs. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) was initially allocated $2 billion in FY2016 but was later reduced to $1 billion by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. This resulted in a total reduction of $6.25 billion over FY2013-FY2021. PPHF funds are meant to supplement funding for selected programs and support new programs within HHS accounts. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) funds are allocated to support new programs authorized by the ACA. The CDC receives the largest share of PPHF funds, with $892 million directed to them in FY2016. Annual appropriations acts have directed the distribution of PPHF funds since FY2014. The HHS tables display additional amounts beyond the budget authority provided in the bill. PPHF transfers reflect estimated effects of mandatory spending sequestration. FY2016 discretionary funding highlights by HHS agency are compared to FY2015 enacted appropriations levels and proposed appropriations levels. The section also includes significant provisions from annual HHS appropriations laws. Two tables provide detailed information on FY2015 enacted appropriations. The FY2016 omnibus provided $6.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for HRSA, $35 million more than FY2015 enacted funding. $286 million was allocated for the Title X Family Planning Program, the same as FY2015, despite earlier proposals to eliminate funding. The FY2016 Senate committee bill reduced funding for the Title X Family Planning program to $258 million (-10%) compared to FY2015. The FY2016 omnibus provided $6.3 billion for CDC, an increase of $303 million (+5%) from FY2015. Additionally, $892 million in PPHF transfers were directed to the CDC, a $5 million (+1%) increase from FY2015. The omnibus increased funding for certain CDC programs like Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (+50%) and Injury Prevention and Control (+38%), but decreased funding for Immunization and Respiratory Disease. The FY2016 omnibus provided $31.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for NIH, an increase of $1.9 billion from FY2015. $780 million in PHS tap transfers were directed to NIH, with the entirety going to NIGMS. The omnibus also increased discretionary appropriations by $76 million for NIGMS, with a requirement of $321 million for the IDeA program. The FY2016 omnibus provided a $1.9 billion increase in discretionary budget authority for NIH, with a net increase of 4% or more for each Institute and Center. The National Institute on Aging received the largest increase of $1.6 billion (+33%), with $936 million reserved for Alzheimer's disease research, a departure from past precedent. The FY2016 omnibus allocated a $1.9 billion increase in discretionary budget authority for NIH, with a significant increase for the National Institute on Aging, including $936 million for Alzheimer's disease research. The omnibus did not specify funding amounts for specific diseases, leaving decisions to NIH and its advisory panels. The NEF, established in 2008, was not altered despite proposed changes in committee bills, allowing the HHS Secretary to use unobligated balances for capital acquisitions within HHS. The Senate committee bill proposed restricting NEF funds to the Office of the Director at NIH for NIH activities. The FY2016 omnibus maintained the National Institutes of Health (NIH) activities and the National Evaluation Fund (NEF) for HHS infrastructure and technology investments. SAMHSA received $3.6 billion in discretionary budget authority, a $160 million increase from FY2015, with $134 million transferred from the PHS evaluation tap. SAMHSA was directed to reserve $15 million for a new grant program supporting Assisted Outpatient Treatment for Individuals with Serious Mental Illness. The FY2016 omnibus directed SAMHSA to allocate more funding towards opioid abuse issues, early serious mental illness, and communities affected by civil unrest. It also instructed SAMHSA to implement Government Accountability Office recommendations for grant administration and federal mental health program coordination. The omnibus provided $334 million in discretionary budget authority for AHRQ, which is $30 million less than FY2015 enacted. No PHS tap transfers were directed to AHRQ in FY2016, unlike the $88 million requested by the President. In FY2016, AHRQ received $334 million in discretionary budget authority, $30 million less than FY2015. No PHS tap transfers were directed to AHRQ, unlike the $88 million requested by the President. AHRQ is also scheduled to receive annual transfers from the PCORTF for patient-centered outcomes research dissemination. The omnibus rejected a proposal to terminate AHRQ and prohibited HHS from using FY2016 discretionary funds. The House committee bill proposed prohibiting HHS from using FY2016 discretionary appropriations for patient-centered outcomes research and rescinding unobligated AHRQ funding. The FY2016 omnibus provided $4.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for CMS, $9 million more than FY2015 enacted. $681 million was appropriated for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities, with $370 million exempt from budget caps. The FY2016 omnibus provided $3.7 billion in flat funding for the CMS Program Management account, supporting basic CMS operations. The appropriation was less than the President's request but more than proposed in House and Senate bills. The omnibus also allowed the HHS Secretary to transfer up to $305 million from Medicare trust funds for program management activities related to the Medicare program. The FY2016 omnibus limits the transfer to $305 million and prohibits funds from being used to support ACA implementation. It also retains a provision preventing certain funds from being used for risk corridor payments associated with health insurance exchanges. The ACA requires HHS to administer a risk corridor program for qualified health plans offered through exchanges in 2014-2016. The omnibus prohibits HHS from making risk corridor payments with funds from the Medicare trust funds or other accounts funded in the LHHS bill. The FY2016 omnibus bill limits HHS transfer to $305 million and prohibits funds for ACA implementation. It also retains a provision preventing funds from being used for risk corridor payments. The omnibus did not include various restrictions from earlier House or Senate bills, such as prohibiting funds for research and evaluation activities or health insurance navigator programs required by the ACA. The FY2016 omnibus bill provided $18.9 billion for ACF, a $1.1 billion increase from FY2015. It prohibited certain funds from being used for health care exchanges and directed the largest increase to ACF. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $9.168 billion to the Head Start program, with a significant increase of $570 million. Funding for the Abandoned Infants Assistance program was eliminated, which was established in 1988 to address concerns about infants born with drug or HIV exposure. The President's budget request and House committee bill proposed maintaining funding at $11 million for placement alternatives for at-risk infants and toddlers. The Senate committee bill suggested eliminating the program, stating that states had implemented more effective community responses. The omnibus bill noted a transfer of funding for the Office of Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to the HHS Office of the Secretary. The FY2016 omnibus bill provided nearly $2.0 billion in discretionary funding for ACL, which is $292 million more than FY2015. It also directs $28 million in PPHF transfers to ACL, the same as FY2015. The bill expects ACF to reserve $750,000 for a study on child poverty, aiming to cut the number of children living in poverty by half over a ten-year period. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $2.0 billion in discretionary funding for ACL, an increase of $292 million from FY2015. New appropriations totaling $239 million were directed to ACL for various programs, including the National Institute on Disability and Assistive Technology. Additionally, the bill transferred the Traumatic Brain Injury program from HRSA to ACL and increased funding for ACL Program Administration by $10 million (+33%) compared to FY2015. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $2.0 billion in discretionary funding for ACL, with new appropriations totaling $239 million for various programs. The omnibus changed the funding source for the Senior Medicare Patrol program to the CMS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control account, while administrative responsibility remains at ACL. The FY2016 omnibus bill allocated $2.0 billion in discretionary funding for ACL, with new appropriations totaling $239 million for various programs. The program remains at ACL, but the allocation of HCFAC appropriation for certain activities is unspecified. LHHS appropriations acts commonly include restrictions on federal funds for controversial issues like abortions, human embryos for research, needle exchange programs, and gun control advocacy. Abortion funding under LHHS appropriations acts is limited to cases where the life of the mother is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest. The FY2016 omnibus bill included restrictions on abortion funding under LHHS appropriations, limiting it to cases where the mother's life is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest. The bill also prohibited discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. The FY2016 omnibus bill included restrictions on abortion funding under LHHS appropriations, limiting it to cases where the mother's life is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest. It also prohibited discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. Additionally, the bill prohibited the use of LHHS funds for creating human embryos for research purposes or for research involving the destruction of human embryos. It also modified the provision on needle exchange programs, allowing funds to be used for certain aspects of the programs under specific conditions. The FY2016 omnibus bill included restrictions on abortion funding under LHHS appropriations, limiting it to cases where the mother's life is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest. It also prohibited discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. Additionally, the bill prohibited the use of LHHS funds for creating human embryos for research purposes or for research involving the destruction of human embryos. Gun control restrictions were also included, preventing CDC from spending funds on gun research or data collection. The FY2016 omnibus bill included restrictions on abortion funding under LHHS appropriations, limiting it to cases where the mother's life is endangered, or in cases of rape or incest. It also prohibited discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions. Additionally, the bill prohibited the use of LHHS funds for creating human embryos for research purposes or for research involving the destruction of human embryos. Gun control restrictions were also included, preventing CDC from spending funds on gun research or data collection. The FY2016 LHHS appropriations have included provisions limiting or altering the ability of HHS to implement various aspects of the ACA. The content and scope of these provisions has evolved over time. Notably, the FY2016 omnibus did not include a provision from the House committee bill that would have prohibited LHHS appropriations from being used to implement any provision of the ACA. The tables below detail FY2016 enacted and proposed funding levels for HHS, along with FY2015 enacted levels. Table 6 shows total HHS funding levels by agency, while Table 7 displays discretionary funding levels for selected HHS programs. PHS Evaluation Tap funds are shown in addition to budget authority amounts, without adjustments for potential fund transfers. PPHF transfer amounts in the tables are also separate from budget authority provided in the bill. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) was established in 1980 with a mission to promote student achievement and ensure equal access to education. Three-quarters of ED's discretionary appropriations typically go towards this mission. Amounts in this section are based on regular LHHS appropriations only and do not include mandatory funds provided outside of the annual appropriations process. The dollar and percentage changes discussed are based on unrounded amounts. The U.S. Department of Education's discretionary appropriations primarily support local educational agencies for economically disadvantaged or disabled children and low-income postsecondary students through Pell Grants. The federal government contributes 11% of overall funding for elementary and secondary education, while states and local districts provide the majority of school funding. In higher education, the federal government supplied about 68% of undergraduate and graduate student aid in 2014-2015. The FY2016 omnibus provided $71.7 billion in funding for the U.S. Department of Education, with $68.3 billion being discretionary. $16.0 billion was allocated for the Education for the Disadvantaged account, which is $481 million more than the previous year. The FY2016 omnibus provided $14.9 billion for Grants to Local Educational Agencies under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is less than the President's request of $15.4 billion. The Title I-A program aims to support low-achieving students in schools with high concentrations of low-income families. The FY2016 omnibus provided $1.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for programs supported by ED's Innovation and Improvement account, which is $79 million more than the FY2015 enacted funding level. The final agreement maintained funding levels close to FY2015 enacted levels for most programs within the Innovation and Improvement account, with exceptions including the elimination of funding for the Transition to Teaching program and an increase for Charter School Grants. The Transition to Teaching program was eliminated, resulting in a $14 million cut, while Charter School Grants received an $80 million increase. The program aimed to help mid-career professionals enter teaching, while the grants support successful charter schools. The President's budget proposed new programs like Teacher and Principal Pathways, Leveraging What Works, and Next Generation High Schools. The FY2016 omnibus budget did not include defined appropriations for new programs like Teacher and Principal Pathways. $245 million was provided for Safe Schools and Citizenship Education, a $22 million increase from FY2015. Within this total, $73 million was allocated for the Promise Neighborhoods program, a $17 million increase aimed at improving educational outcomes for disadvantaged children in distressed communities. The President's request and House committee bill focused on funding for the Promise Neighborhoods program in FY2016. The President's request allocated most of the increase for Safe Schools and Citizenship Education to Promise Neighborhoods. The House committee bill proposed funding Promise Neighborhoods at FY2015 levels and eliminated other activities in the account. The Senate committee bill recommended reduced funding for Safe Schools and Citizenship Education programs and eliminated the Carol M. White Physical Education Program. The omnibus budget provided $13.0 billion in funding, including $37 million for Promise Neighborhoods. The omnibus budget for FY2016 provided $13.0 billion in funding for Special Education programs, including $37 million for Promise Neighborhoods. The House committee bill recommended $13.0 billion, while the Senate committee bill recommended $12.6 billion. The President's request included increases for Preschool Grants and Grants for Infants and Families, but the House committee bill did not recommend increases for these programs. The FY2016 omnibus budget increased State Grants by 4%, Preschool Grants by 4%, and Grants for Infants and Families by 5%. These programs provide formula funding for educational services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. State Grants assist with special education costs for school-aged children, Preschool Grants fund services for children aged three to five, and Grants for Infants and Families support early intervention services. The omnibus budget for FY2016 provided $22.5 billion for the Pell Grant program, equal to the previous year's funding level. The maximum award for AY 2016-2017 is projected to remain at $4,860, with a total maximum award of $5,915 for eligible students. The Pell Grant program offers need-based financial aid to low-income postsecondary students. The Pell Grant program is the largest federal grant aid source for college students, providing around $31 billion to 8.2 million undergraduates in 2015-2016. Mandatory appropriations for Pell Grants are separate from annual appropriations and not included in regular LHHS appropriations. Figures are rounded to the nearest million or billion. The FY2016 omnibus provided about $70.8 billion in combined mandatory and discretionary appropriations for related agencies, with $14.6 billion being discretionary. The Social Security Administration receives the largest share of funding in the LHHS bill, accounting for 97% of the total funding for related agencies. The Social Security Administration (SSA) receives the majority of funding for related agencies in the FY2016 omnibus, accounting for 97% of the total appropriation. SSA's funding supports programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for disabled individuals and seniors. Discretionary SSA funding covers administrative expenses for Social Security, SSI, and Medicare. After SSA, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is the next-largest agency, receiving less than 2% of the total appropriation. The FY2016 omnibus appropriated $12.2 billion for the SSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) account, with $1.4 billion reserved for program integrity activities. This funding is more than the FY2015 enacted level, House, and Senate committee bills, but less than the FY2016 President's request. The FY2016 omnibus maintained funding at $274 million for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which enforces provisions in the National Labor Relations Act. This amount is higher than what was proposed in the FY2016 House and Senate committee bills. The omnibus also included a provision from the FY2015 omnibus that prohibits the NLRB from issuing certain directives or regulations. The omnibus bill for FY2016 maintained funding for the National Labor Relations Board at $274 million. It included a provision prohibiting the NLRB from issuing certain directives or regulations related to collective bargaining procedures. The bill did not include new provisions proposed in both House and Senate committee bills that would have restricted the use of funds for implementing or enforcing rule amendments, investigating administrative actions related to the \"joint employer\" standard, or changing the standard for initial bargaining unit determination. The budget enforcement framework includes statutory elements like discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester from the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Procedural elements are linked to the budget resolution and limit discretionary spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 impacted budget enforcement requirements for FY2016 by increasing discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 provide mechanisms to reduce mandatory and discretionary spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017, extending the mandatory sequester to FY2025. Sequestration is used to reduce spending in each fiscal year between FY2013-FY2025 for mandatory spending and FY2014-FY2021 for discretionary spending. The LHHS bill only includes funding in the nondefense category. President Obama issued the FY2016 sequestration order on February 2, 2015, calling for reductions in nonexempt mandatory spending. The Office of Management and Budget estimated a total reduction of $18 billion in FY2016, with specific percentages for Medicare and other nondefense mandatory spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 amended the statutory spending limits for FY2016, with separate limits for defense and nondefense spending. Discretionary spending in FY2016 is not subject to sequestration unless the statutory limits are breached. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased defense and nondefense discretionary limits by $25 billion each for FY2016, totaling $1.067 trillion in spending. Cap adjustments allow for increases to nondefense limits for specified program integrity initiatives at HHS and SSA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 revised SSA adjustment amounts for program integrity initiatives, exempting certain programs from sequestration in the LHHS bill. The LHHS bill includes programs like unemployment compensation, student loans, health centers, and Medicare, subject to special rules under sequestration. Budget enforcement procedures are based on the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, with Appropriations Committees receiving 302(a) allocations and dividing them into 302(b) suballocations for subcommittees. The 302(b) suballocations act as a cap on each of the 12 regular appropriations bills, enforced through points of order. Final action on the FY2016 budget resolution occurred on May 5, 2015, with initial FY2016 302(b) suballocations reported by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.
