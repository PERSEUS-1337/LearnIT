The Medical Error Reduction Act of 2000 aims to address concerns about the safety of the US healthcare system due to a high occurrence of medical errors, which are the fifth leading cause of death. Studies show that millions of Americans have experienced medical errors, with a significant number resulting in permanent harm. Key patient-safety issues include infection exposure, level of care, and healthcare professionals' credentials. Studies suggest that thousands of Americans may die each year due to medical errors. The prevalence of medical errors in the US healthcare system is a significant concern, with studies indicating that thousands of Americans may die each year due to these errors. The total national cost of preventable medical errors resulting in injury is estimated to be between $17-29 billion annually. Adverse drug events alone result in over 7,000 deaths annually, exceeding the number of yearly workplace injuries. The total national cost of preventable medical errors is estimated to be between $17-29 billion annually. Adverse drug events alone cost $2 billion nationally and lead to thousands of deaths each year. These errors not only result in financial burdens for purchasers and patients but also erode trust in the healthcare system and impact healthcare professionals' morale. The purpose of this Act is to ensure individuals are free from accidental injury. Individuals have the right to be free from accidental injury, accidental death, and medication-related errors. Title IX of the Public Health Service Act is amended to redesignate part C as part D and sections 921 through 928 as sections 931 through 938. A new part C is inserted to focus on reducing errors in health care, starting with definitions in section 921. In this part, definitions are provided for terms like adverse event, error, health care provider, health care-related error, and medication-related error. These definitions aim to clarify preventable adverse events and errors in health care interventions. The term 'related error' refers to a preventable adverse event linked to medication administration. 'Safety' for an individual means the right to be free from preventable serious injury. A 'sentinel event' is an unexpected occurrence resulting in death or serious injury unrelated to the individual's illness or condition. Establishment of state-based medical error reporting systems. The Secretary will provide grants to States to establish medical error reporting systems to improve healthcare quality. States must assure the use of grant funds for implementing reporting systems based on guidelines developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Quality shall develop and publish guidelines for states receiving grants to establish medical error reporting systems. States must make data available only to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and comply with confidentiality laws. States must submit an application to the Secretary to be eligible for a grant. \"Section 923 establishes demonstration projects to reduce medical errors, improve patient safety, and evaluate reporting.\" The Secretary may establish a program for funding 15 demonstration projects in healthcare facilities to reduce medical errors, develop models, encourage reporting, and minimize paperwork. The Secretary may establish a program for funding 15 demonstration projects in healthcare facilities to reduce medical errors, develop models, encourage reporting, and minimize paperwork. Participating health care providers in the projects must utilize technologies to reduce medical errors and report adverse events to the Secretary. Five of the demonstration projects require healthcare providers to report adverse events, errors, and medication-related errors to the Secretary. Confidentiality of the reported information is ensured by the Secretary and the grantee organization. The information reported under this section remains confidential and can only be used by the Secretary for evaluating the ability to reduce errors in care delivery. It cannot be disclosed, is nonadmissible as evidence, and is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The Secretary encourages the use of technologies to reduce medical errors in demonstration projects, such as electronic prescription pads and bar-coding of drugs. A national database of medical errors is established for evaluation purposes. The Secretary promotes the use of technologies like electronic prescription pads and drug bar-coding to reduce medical errors in demonstration projects. A national database of medical errors is created for evaluation purposes. Evaluation results of demonstration projects must be submitted to Congress before October 1 of the third fiscal year. The Secretary is tasked with educating patients and family members on reducing medical errors in federally-funded health care programs. Programs will be developed to encourage patients to play a more active role in their medical treatment, including providing information on pre-existing conditions and medications. Additionally, private, nonprofit efforts to reduce medical errors are also addressed. The Secretary will make grants to health professional associations and organizations for training to reduce medical errors. Entities must submit an application to be eligible for a grant. Additionally, a report to Congress is required. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of enacting the program, detailing the costs of upgrading healthcare technology to reduce medical errors. Another report will be submitted after all demonstration projects are completed, evaluating their success in reducing errors. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of enacting the program, detailing the costs of upgrading healthcare technology to reduce medical errors. The report will also address the best methods for reducing medical errors nationwide and how other Federal agencies can share information on best practices to reduce errors in all Federal health care programs. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the implementation of the healthcare technology upgrade program."
