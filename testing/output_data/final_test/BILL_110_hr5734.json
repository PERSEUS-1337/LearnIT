    "content": "The \"Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2008\" defines key terms such as \"Secretary\" and \"motor vehicle\" as used in the Act. Congress acknowledges the increasing popularity of environmentally friendly vehicles like hybrid and electric cars, which operate quietly. The number of hybrid vehicles sold in the US is rising rapidly and may eventually surpass traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. This poses a challenge for blind pedestrians who rely on sound to navigate traffic. Blind pedestrians rely on sound to navigate traffic safely, while other pedestrians benefit from multi-sensory information from vehicle traffic. Hybrid vehicles operating quietly pose a danger to blind individuals and others in various situations. Blind pedestrians rely on sound for safe navigation in traffic. Hybrid vehicles operating quietly pose a danger to blind individuals and others. Immediate action is needed to prevent pedestrian injuries and fatalities by ensuring vehicles emit a minimum level of sound to alert pedestrians.

Immediate action is needed to prevent pedestrian injuries and fatalities by ensuring vehicles emit a minimum level of sound to alert pedestrians. Study of method to protect blind and other pedestrians. The Secretary must conduct a study within 90 days to determine how to provide blind pedestrians with necessary information from vehicle sounds, establish minimum sound levels for pedestrian safety, and evaluate the most reliable method for ensuring safe travel for blind individuals. The Secretary must conduct a study to determine the best method for providing blind pedestrians with information about vehicle location, motion, speed, and direction. The study will also assess the cost, feasibility, and independence of each method for blind pedestrians. The Secretary will review research on traffic sounds' impact on pedestrian safety, consult with various groups and automobile manufacturers, and complete a study within 2 years, transmitting findings to Congress. SEC. 5. MINIMUM SOUND REQUIREMENT FOR MOTOR VEHICLES. The Secretary must establish a motor vehicle safety standard within 90 days of the study's conclusion to alert blind and other pedestrians of nearby vehicles for safe travel in various environments. This standard requires every vehicle to have a non-visual alert system providing information on the vehicle's location, motion, speed, and direction to ensure pedestrian safety. The motor vehicle safety standard requires every vehicle to have a non-visual alert system that allows blind or other pedestrians to determine the location, motion, speed, and direction of travel of a vehicle with the same certainty as they would with a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of Transportation for the implementation of this Act. The new motor vehicle safety standard will be applicable to all vehicles manufactured or sold in the US two years after its issuance."
