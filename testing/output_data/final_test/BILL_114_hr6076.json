    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"To Research, Evaluate, Assess, and Treat Astronauts Act\" or the \"TREAT Astronauts Act\". It includes findings and a sense of Congress. The \"TREAT Astronauts Act\" acknowledges the risks of human space exploration, including health issues like vision impairment, bone demineralization, and radiation exposure. These risks can lead to long-term health consequences such as cancer and tissue degeneration. To advance long-duration spaceflight missions, astronaut Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space while his twin brother acted as a control on Earth. This study provided insights into the effects on the musculoskeletal, central nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems, as well as vision in space. The Administration currently provides medical monitoring and treatment for astronauts due to unknown long-term health consequences. The Administration seeks statutory authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for former US government astronauts for psychological and medical conditions related to spaceflight. Congress supports continued US leadership in space exploration, recognizing the value of astronaut health data in understanding human diseases. The Administration should provide monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for unique conditions related to spaceflight for US government astronauts. This should not replace private health insurance and data collected should inform treatment and prevent disease in the astronaut corps. The 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the ISS was pivotal for the United States' goal of deep space exploration and Mars. It provided new insights into how the human body adapts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and long-duration space flight, supporting the well-being of astronauts on future missions. SEC. 3.
