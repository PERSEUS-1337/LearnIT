    "content": "The U.S. Intelligence Community faces new challenges in the fight against international terrorism, requiring different skills than those needed during the Cold War. Human intelligence (humint) is crucial for countering terrorism, emphasizing the need for spies and informers over signals intelligence and imagery satellites. The renewed emphasis on human intelligence (humint) for countering terrorism involves accepting risks, training analysts in difficult skills and languages, and developing expertise in third world areas. Intelligence agencies must also work closely with law enforcement agencies in counterterrorism efforts. Policies and statutes are changing to improve cooperation between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but challenges remain in using intelligence agencies and collecting information on U.S. persons. Military operations against terrorists require precise intelligence gathered by platforms like reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. In the past decade, platforms like reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles have become crucial for counterterrorist operations. The primary responsibility for meeting these challenges lies with executive branch officials, while Congress must decide on budgetary resources and oversee Intelligence Community efforts. Some believe Congress should establish a clear statutory framework to guide intelligence-law enforcement relationships and prevent failures in the fight against terrorism or erosion of individual liberties. After September 11, 2001, Congress swiftly provided intelligence agencies with expanded authorities and increased funding. In 2002, congressional intelligence committees investigated the September attacks and recommended legislation to reorganize the U.S. Intelligence Community. Vast intelligence assets were deployed to support military operations in Iraq and ongoing requirements in Afghanistan. Programs will be established to combat terrorism long-term with necessary budgetary resources identified. Intelligence support for the Department of Homeland Security is a key concern under review. Members of the intelligence committees released recommendations in December 2002 to strengthen management of intelligence activities. The Intelligence Community received recommendations in December 2002 to enhance counterterrorism efforts, emphasizing the importance of good humint, analysis, ties to law enforcement, and support for military operations. During the Cold War, terrorism was not a top priority, but resources have been dedicated to the terrorist threat since 1986 with the establishment of a Counterterrorism Center. The Counterterrorism Center was established within the CIA to gather information on international terrorism and develop counterterrorism plans. The threat of terrorism was a growing concern, highlighted by attacks on U.S. military forces and installations in the 1990s. The DCI George Tenet warned of the real and evolving threat from terrorism in February 2001. The threat from terrorism is real, immediate, and evolving, with transnational groups emerging as a significant concern. Osama bin Laden and his network remain a serious threat, with plans to attack the country and acquire dangerous weapons. The CIA's Counterterrorism Center was created to gather data on terrorist activities, but its success has been limited. The FBI's relationship with the law enforcement community in the Counterterrorism Center (CTC) did not fully evolve as hoped. The CTC doubled in size after 9/11, but the success of the overall counterterrorism effort is difficult to judge. Several terrorist plans have been thwarted, including an attack on the Los Angeles airport in 2000. Public discussion continues on the effectiveness of counterterrorism efforts post-9/11. The House and Senate intelligence committees conducted a joint investigation in 2002 to determine if September 11 was an \"intelligence failure.\" Findings and recommendations were made public in December 2002, highlighting inadequacies in the Intelligence Community. An independent commission was established by Congress to review evidence surrounding the 9/11 attacks, with comparisons drawn to investigations after Pearl Harbor. The investigations after Pearl Harbor and September 11 highlighted the need for better coordination among intelligence agencies and policymakers. Lessons learned from these events led to the establishment of national intelligence efforts. The aftermath of 9/11 saw the passing of the USA Patriot Act to enhance intelligence and law enforcement cooperation. The USA Patriot Act was passed after 9/11 to enhance law enforcement-intelligence cooperation. Changes to FISA were also made to support counterterrorist efforts. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 aimed to integrate intelligence and law enforcement information, but a separate Terrorist Threat Integration Center was created under the DCI's direction. The Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was established in May 2003 under the DCI's direction. Concerns have been raised about intelligence gathering on U.S. citizens post-9/11, with criticism of the USAPatriot Act for weakening civil liberties. Efforts to align law enforcement and intelligence are expected to face opposition. Intelligence agencies are focusing on human intelligence, improved analysis, cooperation with law enforcement, and real-time intelligence for the campaign against terrorism. The CIA's Operations Directorate and Defense Humint Service are key players in human intelligence collection for counterterrorism efforts. While satellites and signals intelligence receive major budget allocations, humint remains crucial despite its risks. Emphasis on humint and data sharing between intelligence and law enforcement agencies will shape U.S. intelligence evolution. The emphasis on human intelligence (humint) and information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement agencies will impact the future of the U.S. Intelligence Community. This focus may detract from traditional intelligence missions, such as foreign political, economic, and military analysis. The shift towards human intelligence (humint) and information sharing in counterterrorism efforts requires significant changes in intelligence agencies. Potential complications, such as imprisonment of agents and diplomatic embarrassment, must be carefully considered. Terrorists do not typically appear in diplomatic or business circles, making humint collection challenging. Terrorist groups are often involved in criminal activities and may consist of members from one ethnic or religious group. Developing contacts with these groups is a difficult challenge for U.S. intelligence agencies, requiring preparation and a willingness to work with unsavory individuals. It may also require knowledge of local dialects and customs. Determining which groups may be involved in future terrorist activities is a complex task. Critics of the current U.S. humint collection effort point to institutional problems, such as a lack of qualified Arabic-speaking officers and personnel in key positions who do not know the major languages of the areas they are responsible for. A former CIA official highlighted the challenge of finding agents who can effectively gather intelligence in regions like Afghanistan. The Intelligence Community faces challenges in realigning humint operations, especially in Afghanistan, due to a lack of Dari and Pashtun speakers. Policy decisions are needed to reorient humint collection towards greater effectiveness. The reorientation of humint collection involves a shift towards greater reliance on non-official cover (NOC), where agents work undercover as employees or owners of local businesses. This poses challenges such as lack of diplomatic immunity, difficulty in providing support services, and potential involvement in unethical or illegal activities. The House Intelligence Committee highlighted the urgent need for more U.S. intelligence agents with advanced foreign language skills, especially in areas where terrorist groups operate. Recruiting individuals with similar ethnic backgrounds to the target societies may create challenges, including potential pressures on agents with family in the targeted areas. Language education is costly, and few U.S. college graduates possess the required language skills, making it a significant limitation in intelligence agency personnel expertise. The House Intelligence Committee emphasized the need for more intelligence agents with advanced foreign language skills, especially in areas where terrorist groups operate. Developing resources worldwide over time is administratively challenging and costly. Reorienting humint collection to focus on terrorist groups would have significant administrative implications for the Intelligence Community. Budgetary increases may not be dramatic given the existing intelligence budget size. The Senate Intelligence Committee, in its report accompanying the FY2004 Intelligence Authorization bill (S. 1025), highlighted the interest in more vigorous humint collection, especially under non-official cover and from non-traditional platforms. There were suggestions for a specialized HUMINT entity to target non-traditional threats and rogue states resistant to traditional operations. The Senate Intelligence Committee emphasized the need for more robust HUMINT collection, including non-official cover operations. Congress faces the challenge of accepting risks associated with maintaining agents connected to terrorist groups. There is a consensus on the threat posed by Al Qaeda, but public and congressional views on other groups may vary. Intelligence agencies faced public criticism for their associations with anti-communist elements in Central America, leading to excessive scrutiny and suspicion. The 9/11 attacks may have increased public willingness to accept risks, but intelligence professionals are cautious about shifts in public opinion affecting their work. Terrorist activities pose challenges for intelligence analysts. Terrorist activities challenge intelligence analysts by requiring awareness of various environments and shifting areas of concern. Analysts with specialized skills are needed to analyze terrorist movements, often relying on open source documents for information. The Intelligence Community relies on open source information for analysis, but some believe they should focus more on secret information. When a terrorist group is identified, resources are targeted at gathering information on its membership and activities. The challenge for analysts is to predict terrorist attacks, especially in open societies vulnerable to suicide attacks. Creating a \"war room\" of analysts to sift through data has been suggested, but hiring more people and spending more money does not guarantee success. Some recommend relying on outside consultants or an intelligence reserve corps when threats are imminent. One approach to address the challenge of predicting terrorist attacks is to utilize outside experts with obscure language skills and establish an intelligence reserve corps. Congress faces issues such as ensuring accountability for the quality of intelligence work and the effective use of open source information. Leadership, accountability, and a willingness to accept limitations are crucial for analysts in foreseeing all potential threats, including terrorism. Since the end of the Cold War, efforts have been made to improve coordination between military and law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism. The USA Patriot Act was enacted in response to the 2001 attacks, aiming to enhance information sharing. Concerns persist about the lack of a centralized database for intelligence information on potential terrorists. While concerns exist about centralized databases, there is a need for better information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies regarding potential terrorist activities. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was established in 1978 to authorize surveillance for national security purposes, with special courts and procedures to prevent abuse. FISA was created due to worries about politically-motivated surveillance on U.S. citizens, aiming to provide judicial oversight. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) has undergone modifications over the years to cover physical searches and new communication technologies. Some criticize FISA procedures for hindering efforts to track foreign terrorists, citing a case where a warrant was initially denied for Zacarias Moussaoui. After September 11, changes were made to FISA through the USA Patriot Act and the FY2002 Intelligence Authorization Act. Further amendments have been proposed in the 108th Congress to adapt FISA to current needs. The 108th Congress proposed amendments to adapt FISA to the current international environment, reflecting a determination to combat terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security and the Terrorist Threat Integration Center were established to integrate intelligence and law enforcement information to assess and address terrorist threats. Discussions continue on the roles of DHS and TTIC in emphasizing law enforcement. The U.S. government has maintained relations with countries with different legal systems, sometimes accepting their protection of criminals in exchange for cooperation on mutual interests. This approach conflicts with law enforcement agencies seeking to prosecute criminals, as seen in efforts to cooperate with Saudi Arabia on prosecuting terrorists responsible for the Khobar Towers attack. The U.S. government faced challenges in prosecuting terrorists responsible for the Khobar Towers attack in Saudi Arabia due to a lack of support from State Department officials. The relationship between intelligence collection and law enforcement in dealing with terrorism poses complex issues for policymakers, with differing approaches needed based on the threat level to the U.S. homeland. Information used in judicial proceedings differs from that collected by intelligence agencies in terms of collection methods and storage. The U.S. government has worked to enhance information sharing between intelligence agencies and law enforcement, with initiatives and policies like the USA-Patriot Act. Challenges arise from the differing roles and missions of these agencies, based on constitutional and statutory principles. The danger of using intelligence methods as a routine law-enforcement tool is matched by the danger of regularly using law enforcement agencies as instruments of foreign policy. Bureaucratic overlap and conflicting roles and missions are concerning when it affects agencies with the power to arrest individuals or affect national security. Despite efforts to encourage closer cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, bureaucratic obstacles remain. Within the Intelligence Community, there is a tendency to restrict information dissemination for security reasons. Some suggest clear channels for transferring information must be established with oversight by the executive branch and congressional committees to ensure smooth functioning. The President holds responsibility for directing intelligence and law enforcement efforts, with the Justice Department included in National Security Council deliberations. The Bush Administration's arrangements have been effective, with some issues noted during the Clinton Administration. During the Clinton Administration, FBI Director Louis Freeh was criticized for not sharing important information with the NSC and the White House. Close monitoring by the President may be necessary to ensure information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in dealing with terrorist threats. Congress faces challenges in budgeting and overseeing intelligence and law enforcement efforts for counterterrorism, especially due to separate budget categories for these agencies. The budget constraints on law enforcement agencies have hindered their ability to acquire sophisticated information technology systems like those used by intelligence agencies. This disparity has prevented the development of a seamless system for storing and exchanging real-time information on potential terrorist threats across all levels of intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The budget constraints on law enforcement agencies have hindered the development of a seamless system for storing and exchanging real-time information on potential terrorist threats. Efforts to enhance intelligence and law enforcement IT resources require determination from both the executive and legislative branches due to shared budgeting responsibilities. The budget is proposed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and allocated to separate Appropriations sub-committees, creating procedural hurdles for shifting funds between functional categories. Both branches may need coordinated inter-agency examination of law enforcement and intelligence spending on counterterrorism. Intelligence agencies are overseen by select committees and receive thorough oversight, although little is shared with the public. Intelligence committees are bipartisan in their approach to oversight. Law enforcement agencies are overseen by judiciary committees and appropriators. The Defense Department's significant role in intelligence efforts complicates oversight. The judiciary committees and appropriators oversee law enforcement agencies, while intelligence agencies are overseen by select committees. There are differences in congressional oversight for intelligence and law enforcement agencies, with some calling for greater scrutiny of the intelligence-law enforcement relationship. The importance of changes in intelligence support for military operations was highlighted during the campaign against Afghan-based terrorists and the Iraq war of 2003. Since Desert Storm in 1991, U.S. military operations have relied more on precision guided munitions (PGMs) for targeted strikes with minimal civilian casualties. Accurate intelligence, gathered through humint, UAVs, aircraft, and satellites, is crucial for successful precision attacks. These new operational concepts have been effective in combating terrorist groups by focusing on small targets and avoiding widespread strikes on civilian populations. The U.S. military's focus on attacking small groups or facilities and avoiding wide-scale strikes on population centers requires significant investment in real-time intelligence support. Manned aircraft like U-2s and UAVs such as the Predator and Global Hawk provide tactical intelligence for military campaigns against terrorist units. These platforms, linked to precision guided munitions, have proven valuable in various operations, including the Iraq War and the Afghan campaign. The U.S. military relies on manned aircraft like U-2s and UAVs such as the Predator and Global Hawk for real-time intelligence support in operations against terrorist targets. Despite the recognized value of these platforms, the numbers available to the Department of Defense are limited. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld highlighted the need for more unmanned aircraft due to their effectiveness in Afghanistan and plans to increase funding for UAVs and other platforms in the future. The integration of intelligence analysis into military operations requires adjustments to organizational relationships among agencies. Imagery and sigint undergo analysis before use, with target identification needing input from various disciplines and approval from Washington-level agencies. Enabling agencies in Washington and elsewhere to support low-level combat units involves a high degree of responsiveness and flexibility, potentially at the cost of other responsibilities. Concerns have been raised that support to military operations may detract from traditional missions of providing strategic analyses for national policymaking. Congress recognizes the need for improved data displays linked to geographical points for all military echelons and policymakers, incorporating information from various intelligence disciplines in real-time. The issue for Congress is the extent of support from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) is being considered for the primary responsibility of maintaining a global system for the Defense Department and Intelligence Community. Congress is facing issues related to the transformation of the U.S. military services, including requirements for information dominance, precision weapons, and replacing aging platforms. Coordination of programs managed by DOD and CIA is necessary to ensure data availability from various sensors within time constraints. Observers believe that ensuring the functionality of weapons platforms and intelligence systems will continue to be challenging. Effective counterterrorism requires good intelligence, but counterterrorism intelligence differs from Cold War-era intelligence. Challenges exist in humint collection, which could be costly and controversial. Intelligence and law enforcement are increasingly interconnected, with valuable insights coming from correlating information from different sources. The close correlation of information from differing intelligence and law enforcement sources raises concerns about potential impacts on legal principles and constitutional rights. Decisions need to be made regarding organizational responsibilities, and there is a perceived need to transform the U.S. defense structure to leverage information technologies and precision munitions in the campaign against terrorism. Counterterrorist missions influence intelligence collection, communications, and information links. Despite the focus on terrorism, traditional geopolitical concerns remain important. Maintaining expertise on international military and geopolitical issues is challenging. Terrorist threats are a central concern for the U.S. Intelligence Community, but policymakers also consider other global issues. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the need to not solely focus on terrorism as the only threat, highlighting the possibility of cyber-warfare or traditional state-on-state conflicts in the future."
