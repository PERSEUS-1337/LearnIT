    "content": "Personal property management for federal agencies involves tracking, evaluating, disposing of, and replacing various items. This includes desks, computers, vehicles, and laboratory equipment. In FY2017, federal agencies reported $1.3 trillion in personal property assets. Effective management is crucial to prevent waste, fraud, and loss. Effective management of federal personal property is essential to prevent waste, fraud, and loss. Agencies must implement internal controls to ensure efficient use of assets, including inventory tracking, asset necessity assessment, disposal of unneeded items, and safeguarding against theft. The Office of Management and Budget provides guidance on internal controls through Circular A-123, while specific policies are outlined in the Federal Management Regulation. The Federal Management Regulation, promulgated by the General Services Administration, and Circular A-123's Appendix B establish requirements for internal controls over federal charge cards and personal property management. Agencies lack a government-wide data source on inventories, leading to challenges in identifying and disposing of unneeded items. Agencies must regularly assess their property holdings, identify unnecessary items, and dispose of them through various methods like transferring to other agencies, donating, selling, or destroying. Executive agencies dispose of excess property through various methods like transferring, donating, selling, or destroying to prevent wastage and unnecessary expenditures. Inefficient tracking and inventory processes lead to duplicate purchases, lost or stolen property, and missed opportunities for state and local entities to acquire federal property at no cost. This results in higher costs for public services and increased storage expenses for the federal government. Congress passed the Federal Personal Property Management Act to address these issues. The Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 was passed by Congress to address concerns about inefficient tracking and inventory processes in federal agencies. The Act establishes new inventory tracking and assessment requirements to improve the personal property disposal process. Agencies are required to maintain adequate property controls and continually survey their inventories to identify unneeded items. The Act aims to prevent wastage, duplicate purchases, and missed opportunities for acquiring federal property. The Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 requires agencies to maintain property controls and survey inventories to identify excess items. Items with an acquisition cost under $10,000 can be transferred to another federal agency, while those over $10,000 require verbal approval. Direct transfers are typically free for the property but the requesting agency covers transportation costs. Computers and peripherals can also be transferred to schools or educational nonprofits through the Computers for Learning Program. The Federal Personal Property Management Act of 2018 requires agencies to maintain property controls and survey inventories to identify excess items. Excess property must be reported to GSA for a 21-day screening process, during which it may be transferred to federal agencies, Congress, or donated if no requests are made. Surplus personal property declared by GSA can be donated to eligible recipients within five days, including state and local governments, municipal agencies, and nonprofits supporting education, public health, or veterans groups. Each state's SASP distributes the property to qualified agencies and organizations. Unsold surplus property may be sold to the public through various methods. Proceeds from sales are deposited into the U.S. Treasury, with unsold items potentially recycled, abandoned, or destroyed if deemed valueless. Items that do not sell may be recycled, abandoned, or destroyed if they have no value or the estimated cost of their continued care and handling exceeds the estimated proceeds from sale. Agencies may need to replace personal property that is not excess or surplus, such as vehicles near the end of their useful lives or aging medical equipment. Executive branch agencies have the authority to exchange or sell old property to reduce acquisition costs, choosing the option that results in the greatest savings. Federal agencies have the option to exchange or sell personal property to reduce acquisition costs, with sales proceeds used to purchase new items within one year. Between FY2013 and FY2017, agencies generated $3.1 billion in exchange allowances and sales proceeds, with GSA accounting for 60% of the total. Vehicle sales were the primary source of funds, totaling $2.6 billion. Each agency is responsible for declaring unneeded property as \"excess.\" Federal agencies are responsible for efficiently managing and disposing of personal property to avoid wasteful spending. The Government Accountability Office found that agencies did not always maximize exchange allowances or sales prices when replacing items, leading to inefficient use of resources. Property custodians oversee personal property management and disposal, but varying disposal policies contribute to inefficiencies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that federal agencies had broad personal property policies but lacked oversight. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had inaccurate inventories due to poor contractor oversight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) faced challenges implementing continual survey requirements. The FAA's personal property policies were not effectively enforced, leading to custodians not performing required inventories or maintaining accurate records. Nearly 8% of cost centers had never been inventoried, resulting in millions of dollars worth of items being retained unnecessarily. This misalignment of policies and internal structure limited access to assets and increased storage costs. Agencies did not provide detailed guidance on personal property surveys, leading to limited access to assets and increased storage costs. Inventories are divided into capitalized property with high acquisition costs and accountable property with a useful life of two years or longer. The accountable property includes high-cost items like property and laptops for sensitive information. Non-accountable property, such as desks and chairs, falls below the threshold and is not considered sensitive. Agencies can set their own capitalization and accountability thresholds, varying across the government. EPA, FAA, HUD, and GSA have different thresholds for accountable property. The variation in thresholds for accountable property among agencies leads to challenges in inventory management, particularly in tracking non-accountable items. Some agencies argue that the manpower needed to track low-value items is not cost-effective, while others claim it is not required by law. OMB emphasizes the importance of assessing non-accountable property for effective internal controls. For instance, EPA conducted an audit of its Landover warehouse, leading to the inventory of thousands of non-accountable items and the transfer of excess furniture and property to other locations. The EPA disposed of excess non-accountable property at its warehouses to save costs. Lack of clear criteria for determining excess property may lead to inconsistent practices across government agencies. The Internal Revenue Service provides guidance on assessing need to ensure cost-effectiveness in property disposal. Failing to regularly survey accountable and non-accountable property can lead to agencies not reporting excess property in a timely manner, resulting in unnecessary expenses on storage space and missed opportunities for disposal. Agencies often only address excess property when triggered by events like office relocations or renovations. During office relocations or renovations, agencies establish disposal plans to get rid of unneeded items like furniture or computers to make space for new property. The amount of excess personal property identified during these events may increase due to initiatives like OMB's Reduce the Footprint (RTF), which aims to reduce the space federal agencies own and lease by implementing new design standards for workstations. For example, GSA reduced its standard for usable square feet in offices from 150 per person to 136. When agencies relocate or renovate, their existing furniture may not fit the reduced space allotments, leading to excess personal property. Executive agencies can exchange or sell used property to acquire replacement items, but not all agencies maximize this benefit. Knowledge of how to use the exchange/sale authority varies across agencies, especially with decentralized disposal processes. Some agencies, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, struggle with understanding the exchange/sale process for equipment disposal. Lack of clarity leads to missed opportunities for higher returns. Only a subset of agencies utilize the exchange/sale authority, with some needing more guidance or training to maximize its benefits. GSA and VA officials lack knowledge and guidance on using the exchange/sale authority for property disposal. Monitoring and reporting of transactions have been inadequate, leading to errors in sales reporting. VA medical centers have made numerous incorrect sales transactions under the authority due to a lack of oversight and training. The Personal Property Act (P.L. 115-419) addresses inconsistent standards in agency inventory practices and requires agencies to conduct annual inventory assessments to identify excess property. Monitoring and reporting errors have led to incorrect sales transactions under the exchange/sale authority at VA medical centers. The Personal Property Act (P.L. 115-419) requires agencies to regularly inventory and assess their personal property, establish thresholds for acquisitions, and maintain records in a centralized system. GSA has not issued the required guidance for this act as of the date of the report. The Personal Property Act requires agencies to inventory and assess their property, with a focus on improving oversight and disposal processes to reduce unnecessary storage costs and provide more opportunities for acquiring property at no cost. The new guidance aims to address weaknesses in the property disposal process and enhance agency assessment policies. The new guidance requirements focus on managing the highest-value items in an agency's inventory, emphasizing the management of capitalized and accountable property to make cost-effective use of limited resources. The Personal Property Act also requires GSA to set capitalization and accountability thresholds, which currently vary widely among agencies, leading to inconsistencies in how property is treated. Capitalized property must be recorded on an agency's balance sheet as an asset, with the capitalization threshold affecting the number of assets reported. Standardizing capitalization thresholds can improve agency financial reporting by capturing a larger number of personal property assets. This can lead to more consistent treatment of items with the same acquisition cost and may require agencies to expand the scope of their inventory surveys. In August 2017, GSA began reconfiguring federally leased space at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City, relocating agencies to One World Trade Center. Lack of preparedness for excess property disposal during transitions can cause delays and increased costs. GSA did not have a proper plan to dispose of excess personal property left behind at 26 Federal Plaza during the reconfiguration to One World Trade Center. This lack of disposal plan led to delays in managing the disposition of items, as GSA did not follow the required screening process for property disposal. Instead, they relied on informal communication with other federal agencies. The disposal process was further hindered by inadequate personal property records, resulting in a large volume of excess property remaining at 26 Federal Plaza one year after the relocation was complete. This may cause further delays in the reconfiguration and increase costs. The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) requires federal landholding agencies to submit recommendations for the sale, transfer, conveyance, renovation, reconfiguration, or consolidation of unneeded real property. The process involves submitting recommendations to the GSA administrator, who then passes them on to the Public Buildings Reform Board for review and compilation of a revised list of recommendations to send to the director of OMB for approval or rejection. The FASTA process requires agencies to submit recommendations for real property transitions to the OMB director for approval. Agencies must start implementing approved recommendations within two years and complete them within six years. Many agencies may lack accurate inventories or resources to manage excess personal property disposal efficiently. One way to address concerns about managing excess personal property during transitions is for OMB and GSA to develop specific implementation guidance. This guidance could include prioritizing property inventories at recommended sites, incorporating disposal into transition plans, and requesting assistance from GSA if needed. Policymakers could also consider expanding the Federal Real Property Profile to include personal property in the future. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) provides data on federal properties, including size and status. Adding personal property data to the FRPP could offer similar benefits, giving the public and policymakers a single source for data on government investments. The Personal Property Act requires agencies to maintain inventories of accountable property. The expanded FRPP could include data on accountable property, such as cars and medical equipment, with a shorter useful life. This information could help policymakers assess funding needs for agencies with aging assets and assist government agencies and nonprofits in estimating when federal property might become excess. Regularly updated data on excess property could hold agencies accountable for completing inventories and timely disposal."
