    "content": "The Obama Administration and congressional leaders are considering changes to U.S. immigration policy towards Cuban migrants, but a normalization is not imminent. The report provides a historical analysis of the unique immigration policy with Cuba and discusses current challenges. Cuba's communist regime has limited freedoms, including travel, leading to special humanitarian provisions for Cuban immigrants to the U.S. Most Cubans have entered the United States through special humanitarian provisions due to political events in Cuba. The exodus escalated after Fidel Castro took power in 1959, with a peak of 78,000 in 1962. The Mariel boatlift in 1980 brought approximately 125,000 Cubans to South Florida. Congress established immigration policies in response to the costs incurred by the boatlift. Congress established the \"Immigration Emergency Fund\" in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act to provide federal aid for health and safety problems caused by mass migration. The Cuban exodus by boat escalated in 1994 after riots in Havana, with almost 40,000 Cubans intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard or Border Patrol. Repatriation of Cubans was generally not done until 1995. The United States has a policy regarding Cuban immigration established in the 1960s, which includes the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Migration Agreements of 1994 and 1995, and the Special Cuban Migration Lottery. Undocumented Cubans who arrive in the US can stay and adjust to permanent resident status under the Cuban Adjustment Act. The Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 allows undocumented Cubans in the US to apply for permanent resident status, along with their spouses and children. The Act predates the Refugee Act of 1980 and provides a unique opportunity for Cubans to adjust their status without using traditional refugee or asylee definitions. Efforts to repeal the Act have been unsuccessful, but Congress added language in 1996 regarding its continuation. In 1996, Congress enacted language stating that the Cuban Adjustment Act would be repealed when Cuba became a democracy. A migration agreement signed in 1994 aimed to normalize migration between the US and Cuba, with objectives of safe, legal, and orderly immigration. The agreement included measures such as not allowing Cubans intercepted at sea to come to the US and placing them in a safe haven camp in a third location. Cuba also agreed to discourage people from setting sail, and both countries pledged to cooperate in preventing illegal transport of migrants. The United States and Cuba agreed to cooperate in preventing illegal migration and violence. The US agreed to admit at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants annually, excluding immediate relatives of US citizens. They also agreed on the voluntary return of Cubans intercepted at sea. Discussions continue on handling excludable Cubans. The 20,000 minimum level per year was challenging to meet due to visa eligibility criteria. Cubans qualified for visas as family-sponsored or employment-based immigrants. The US used parole authority to allow Cubans to become LPRs through the CAA. A visa lottery program was established to select migrants. An agreement in 1995 resolved the situation of 33,000 Cubans at Guantanamo. The United States allowed Cubans detained at Guantanamo to come to the US through humanitarian parole provisions. Cuba agreed to credit these admissions towards the annual LPR quota. Interdicted Cubans were repatriated to Cuba instead of safe haven camps, with the promise of no action taken against them. Repatriated Cubans were informed about legal immigration procedures at the US Interests Section in Havana. Those involved in alien smuggling would face prison terms in Cuba. Interdicted Cubans could express fear of persecution and be considered as refugees or asylees. From May 1995 to July 2003, 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in 11 countries. The Department of State monitors returnees to Cuba for reprisals. Migration talks between the US and Cuba have stalled since January 2004 due to unresolved issues. The United States and Cuba have agreements regarding immigration policies, including the repatriation of Cubans intercepted at sea. Cubans who reach US shores are generally allowed to stay and adjust their status under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Visa lotteries have been held to implement the Special Cuban Migration Program. The Special Cuban Migration Program holds visa lotteries every two years, with increasing numbers of qualifying registrants. Eligible Cubans must be between 18 and 55 years old and meet certain criteria. Successful applicants receive parole status and a visa valid for six months, with the option to bring spouses and minor children. Reports of barriers faced by Cuban parolees have been documented. Cuban parolees face barriers such as expensive medical exams and exit visa fees. They are eligible for federal benefits, but restrictions apply under the PRWORA. Amendments extended the period of eligibility for certain benefits for refugees. The term \"Cuban-Haitian Entrant\" is not defined in the INA, but its usage dates back to 1980 when Cubans and Haitians were labeled as such by the Carter Administration. They were admitted to the US through discretionary parole authority and later granted LPR status under the IRCA of 1986. Entrants who arrived during the Mariel Boatlift were labeled as Cuban-Haitian Entrants by Congress for federal assistance eligibility. The Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 defined Cuban and Haitian Entrants as individuals granted parole status or other special status under immigration laws for Cuba or Haiti, regardless of their current immigration status. The Fascell-Stone provision treats Cubans and Haitians as refugees and asylees for federal benefits. The Office of Refugee Resettlement uses the term \"Cuban-Haitian Entrants\" for Cubans meeting this definition. Asylees, refugees, and Cuban-Haitian entrants may be eligible for SSI benefits for seven years after entry. In order to receive SSI benefits, qualified aliens like Cuban entrants must meet eligibility requirements similar to native-born citizens, including age, disability, or blindness criteria and income/resource thresholds. SSI beneficiaries could receive up to $637 a month in 2008. Cuban entrants are ineligible after seven years unless naturalized or receiving SSI benefits before August 22, 1996. SSI eligibility for Cuban entrants, refugees, asylees, and other humanitarian categories was extended to nine years from FY2009 to FY2011. Eligible aliens for SSI are likely eligible for Medicaid enrollment. Cuban Entrants may be eligible for time-limited cash assistance through a state's TANF program, with a 60-month lifetime limit. States can exempt up to 20% of the caseload from the time limit due to hardship. TANF benefits are state-administered and payment levels vary by state, with an average monthly maximum benefit of $389 for a family of three in 2008. Refugees in job training programs sponsored by ORR are considered. Refugees in job training programs sponsored by the ORR may be exempt from certain state TANF program requirements. SSI beneficiaries are generally ineligible for TANF in addition to SSI. Cuban entrants are eligible for federal resettlement assistance through the ORR. ORR provides funding to states for transitional cash and medical assistance. Resettlement assistance is designed to help refugees and entrants achieve self-sufficiency and social adjustment quickly. Refugees are expected to become self-sufficient within six months of arrival. Refugees and entrants are expected to become self-sufficient within six months of arrival. Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) are limited to eight months. States have the option of choosing a publically administered or public/private RCA program. In publically administered RCA programs, payment levels to refugees vary by state. In Florida, the maximum benefit is $180 per month, in Tennessee it is $95 for individuals and $185 for a family of three, and in California, a family of three could receive up to $706 per month. Public/private RCA programs have been approved in several states including Maryland, Texas, Oregon, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Minnesota. The Texas RCA Provider Manual outlines maximum payment levels for different family sizes. The RCA program provides varying payment levels for different family sizes, with payments distributed in cash and vendor payments for rent and utilities. RMA programs, funded by ORR, cover 100% of costs for eligible refugees and entrants who are not eligible for Medicaid. RMA benefits can last up to eight months, with costs varying based on factors like age and health. Florida estimated the average monthly RMA benefit per person at $165.29 in 2007. In FY2008, 49,500 Cubans became legal permanent residents in the United States, making Cuba one of the top immigrant-sending countries. Despite travel restrictions, the number of Cuban interdictions by the U.S. Coast Guard has increased over time. The number of Cuban interdictions by the U.S. Coast Guard has significantly increased over the years, reaching a peak of 2,868 in FY2007. In FY2008, 2,199 Cubans were interdicted. Additionally, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 4,295 Cuban nationals in FY2007, which slightly decreased to 3,351 in FY2008. The U.S. Border Patrol apprehends most Cubans in coastal areas rather than along the southern land borders. Cubans migrants traditionally travel by sea through the Florida Straits towards South Florida. Some migrants sail from Cuba to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula before making their way to the U.S. border. Mexico has become a principal route for Cuban migration to the United States. In FY2007 and FY2008, inadmissible Cubans arriving at ports of entry reached a high of 13,019 and fell slightly to 11,278. The Laredo CBP field office reported the largest number of inadmissible Cubans during FY2004-FY2008, with Miami CBP field office following. In October 2008, Cuban Foreign Minister announced Mexico would repatriate Cubans with proper documents to reduce arrivals. Effective November 20, 2008, the Mexican Navy added Cuban interdiction efforts. Effective November 20, 2008, the Mexican Navy has reportedly added Cuban interdiction and repatriation to their duties patrolling Mexico's eastern coast. Cuban nationals presenting themselves at a U.S. border with Mexico are inspected by CBP regardless of valid immigration documents. Cubans are exempt from expedited removal provisions, often paroled into the U.S. and eventually adjusting to LPR status under the CAA. Unauthorized Cuban migrants entering through Mexico are more likely to identify themselves to CBP officers. The United States conducts in-country refugee processing in Cuba for Cubans under the Priority 2 (P-2) category, which includes former political prisoners, persecuted religious minorities, and others facing harm due to their beliefs or relationships. Refugee processing and admissions dropped significantly after new security procedures were implemented. The United States saw a significant decrease in Cuban refugee arrivals after implementing new security procedures post-9/11. In FY2004, USCIS approved 5,670 Cubans for refugee status, but only 2,980 actually arrived in the US. By FY2005, the logjam eased with 6,260 Cuban refugee arrivals. In FY2008, over 4,200 Cubans were approved for the in-country refugee program. In FY2008, the refugee program approved over 4,200 Cubans, with 4,100 expected to arrive. Approximately half a million Cubans have become legal permanent residents since FY1981, with 49,500 becoming LPRs in FY2008. Cuba ranked fifth as a top immigrant-sending country in FY2008. U.S. immigration policy towards Cuban migrants in FY2008 remains contentious, balancing immigration control and humanitarian compassion. The change in leadership in both the U.S. and Cuba may offer opportunities for policy revisions, but a normalization of immigration policies is not imminent. Challenges include the interdiction and repatriation policy, with some seeing it as conflicting with the U.S. Coast Guard's rescue mission while others view it as essential for maritime security. An incident in 1999 highlighted these challenges when the U.S. Coast Guard used force to prevent Cuban migrants from reaching Florida. In late November 1999, the U.S. Coast Guard brought six-year old Elian Gonzalez and two other survivors of a journey to the United States instead of taking them to Cuba as per the migration agreement. Elian was initially in the care of his uncle in Miami, but when his father arrived in April 2000 to take custody, there was a dispute. Attorney General Janet Reno ordered federal officers to remove Elian from his uncle's home in April 2000. In April 2003, three men who hijacked a ferry in Havana were executed by firing squads by the Cuban government. This action was condemned by international human rights groups and several countries. In July 2003, a group stole a Cuban-flagged boat and kidnapped three watchmen before being intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard in international waters. The U.S. Coast Guard interdicted a vessel with 15 persons on board, including 3 watchmen who wanted to return to Cuba. The Cuban government offered to sentence 12 individuals for crimes, and the U.S. agreed to return them. In January 2006, 15 Cubans, including women and children, were found on an old Key West bridge. The decision to repatriate them was made by the Coast Guard in conjunction with DHS Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Operation Vigilant Sentry (OVS) was designed in 2006 as a response plan for Caribbean mass migration, with a focus on migrant interdiction and repatriation. Supporters argue that repatriation is necessary to deter dangerous migration, while critics claim it denies individuals their rights to due process. Some called for a full investigation into the repatriation decisions. Some argue for a full investigation into incidents and seek to end the current interdiction and repatriation policy. The 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act is seen as outdated and unnecessary, allowing Cubans to seek asylum under refugee laws. Critics claim the Act is discriminatory and serves as a magnet for unauthorized Cuban migrants. Some argue for updating immigration policies with Cuba, while opponents fear sending the wrong message during the transition of power from Fidel to Raul Castro. Supporters of the Cuban Adjustment Act highlight the importance of maintaining the commitment to admit at least 20,000 Cubans annually. If the Act were repealed, only Cubans meeting specific criteria would be able to immigrate to the United States. Employment-based immigrants could face increased backlogs for immigrant visas in the United States. Allegations of Cuban migrants receiving federal cash payments above normal amounts have raised concerns about payments being used to pay smugglers for entry into the country. Media reports suggest smugglers can charge up to $15,000 per Cuban migrant. However, the RCA payments for Cuban entrants are not given as a lump sum and only provide basic monthly assistance for a maximum of eight months. Some question why all Cubans, regardless of entry status, receive federal benefits like refugees. The debate includes whether Cubans should be considered refugees, and if the US should resume migration talks with Cuba. The State Department cancelled talks in 2004, impacting policy discussions. The State Department cancelled the 20th round of migration talks with Cuba in January 2004. Cuba refused to discuss key issues, prompting criticism from Cuban officials. Fidel Castro's departure in 2006 raised hopes for renewed talks, but Ra\u00fal Castro's assumption of the presidency in 2008 cast doubt on the possibility of resuming discussions. President Obama signaled the possibility of resuming migration talks with Cuba in 2009, emphasizing a new beginning. Senator Richard Lugar also called for the revival of US-Cuban migration talks, which have been suspended since 2004, as a key element in addressing illegal migration. The talks on illegal migration between the US and Cuba should continue, with a review of the \"wet-foot, dry-foot policy\" suggested. This policy allows Cubans who reach US soil to stay, while those intercepted at sea are sent back. Some argue that Cuba should address concerns before talks resume. The State Department spokesman emphasized the need to address serious issues before moving forward with talks on illegal migration between the US and Cuba. Roger Noreiga argued against a \"go slow\" approach, suggesting that helping Cubans press for real change at home is the best way to avoid a mass migration to the US. In the post-Fidel period, any suggestion of accepting power transfer from one dictator to another in Cuba would extinguish hopes for freedom and prolong dictatorship for 11 million Cubans. The Cuban government expressed interest in resuming talks on legal immigration to the US, aiming for safe and orderly migration."
