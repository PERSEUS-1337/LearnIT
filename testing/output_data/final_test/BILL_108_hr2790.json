    "content": "The \"Breastfeeding Promotion Act\" and the \"Pregnancy Discrimination Act Amendments of 2003\" are titles within the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The purpose of these acts is to address discrimination related to pregnancy and promote breastfeeding. Congress finds that women with infants and toddlers are a growing segment of the labor force, with over 50% of mothers with children under 1 year old working. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least the first year of a child's life, as research shows that not breastfeeding can lead to various health issues in children. Breastfeeding provides protective effects against chronic diseases for both mothers and children, including diabetes, lymphomas, Crohn's disease, and more. Maternal benefits include reduced risk of postpartum hemorrhage and certain cancers. Children who are breastfed have lower rates of illness, leading to decreased parental absenteeism. Congress recognizes breastfeeding as protected conduct under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amended title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect breastfeeding and expressing breast milk in the workplace. This aims to promote the health of infants and clarify that such actions are protected conduct. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was amended to include lactation as a protected condition related to childbirth. Employers can now receive a credit for providing a suitable environment for employed mothers to breastfeed or express milk for their children on business premises. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has been amended to include a new section, SEC. 45G, which provides a credit for employer expenses incurred to facilitate employed mothers who breastfeed or express milk for their children.

The recapture percentage is determined based on a table provided in the subsection. The recapture percentage for the credit under section 45G of the Internal Revenue Code varies depending on the year of recapture event, starting at 100% in Year 1 and decreasing to 0% in Year 4 or thereafter. Rules similar to section 50(a) apply for this subsection. Special rules apply for purposes of this section, including aggregation rules for treating certain persons as a single taxpayer and allocation of dollar amounts among them. Reduction in basis rules and limitations on other deductions and credits also apply to property eligible for the credit determined under this section. The breastfeeding promotion and support credit is added to the tax code under section 38(b) and cannot be carried back before January 1, 2003. The unused business credit attributable to section 45G cannot be carried back before January 1, 2003. The \"Safe and Effective Breast Pumps Act\" provides a credit for employer expenses related to supporting employed mothers who breastfeed or express milk for their children. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 2002. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish performance standards for breast pumps, regardless of their classification under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The standards will be based on efficiency, effectiveness, and sanitation for communal use in workplaces. A compliance policy guide will also be issued to provide complete information for women who want to breastfeed. Women who want to breastfeed will receive complete information about breast pumps. Title IV expands the definition of medical care in the Internal Revenue Code to include breastfeeding equipment and services.
