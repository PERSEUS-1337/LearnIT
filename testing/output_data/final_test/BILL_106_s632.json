    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act\". Congress finds that over 2,000,000 poisonings are reported annually in the US, with 90% occurring at home and 53% affecting children under 6 years old. Poison control centers are crucial for saving lives and reducing costs, with every dollar spent on them saving $7 in medical expenses. However, funding instability has led to a decline in the number of centers, with 2 closing in the past year. The funding instability has led to the closure of 2 poison control centers this year, with a third center scheduled to close in April 1999. Stabilizing funding and increasing accessibility to these centers will improve access for US residents and reduce inappropriate use of emergency medical services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a national toll-free number for poison control centers, with $2,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004. This funding will not support any privately funded toll-free numbers for poisonings or accidental exposures. The Secretary will establish a national media campaign to educate the public about poison prevention and the availability of poison control resources. This includes advertising the nationwide toll-free number. The campaign will involve contracts with media firms for monthly public service announcements on television, radio, and newspapers. $600,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004. Additionally, a grant program will be established. The Secretary will award grants to regional poison control centers for financial stability and prevention/treatment of poisonings. Funds will also be used for education programs, patient management protocols, data collection systems, toxic exposure surveillance, and physician supervision. Centers must be certified to receive grants. The Secretary awards grants to poison control centers for financial stability and prevention/treatment of poisonings. Centers must be certified by a professional organization or State government to receive grants, with the option for a waiver under certain circumstances. The Secretary may renew a waiver for a poison control center for 3 years. Funding must supplement, not supplant, other funds. Centers must maintain expenditures at or above the previous fiscal year level. Matching requirements may be imposed by the Secretary for grant amounts. Authorization of Appropriations: $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 for this section. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
