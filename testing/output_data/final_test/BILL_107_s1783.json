    "content": "The text discusses the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the United States in 1898 and their transfer to the State of Hawaii in 1959. It defines \"indigenous, native people\" as descendants of the original inhabitants of the United States and \"Native Hawaiian\" as those eligible for programs under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act in 1921 and their descendants. The term \"Native Hawaiian\" refers to individuals eligible for programs under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act in 1921 and their descendants. The term \"Native Hawaiian governing entity\" is the sole governing entity organized by Native Hawaiians through a process involving maximum participation. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The United States policy and purpose are outlined in Section 3. The United States reaffirms its special responsibility to promote the welfare of Native Hawaiians and has enacted legislation to address their conditions. This includes the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, the Act for the admission of Hawaii into the Union, and over 150 other Federal laws. The United States has enacted laws to address the conditions of Native Hawaiians, including over 150 Federal laws. Native Hawaiians have inherent rights to autonomy, self-determination, and self-governance, as well as the right to reorganize a governing entity. The purpose of this Act is to establish a process for the recognition of a Native Hawaiian governing entity for a government-to-government relationship. Establishment of the United States Office for Native Hawaiian Relations. The United States Office for Native Hawaiian Relations, established within the Office of the Secretary, is responsible for coordinating the special political and legal relationship between the Native Hawaiian people and the United States. It also aims to continue the process of reconciliation with the Native Hawaiian people and governing entity. The United States Office for Native Hawaiian Relations, under the Office of the Secretary, is tasked with coordinating the relationship between Native Hawaiians and the U.S. It includes consulting with Native Hawaiians before actions affecting their resources, rights, or lands, collaborating with other federal and state agencies on related policies, and submitting an annual report to relevant congressional committees. The United States Office for Native Hawaiian Relations submits an annual report detailing reconciliation efforts and consultations with the Native Hawaiian governing entity, along with recommendations for changes to Federal statutes or regulations. SEC. 5 outlines the process for recognizing the Native Hawaiian governing entity. The Native Hawaiian people have the right to organize for their common welfare and adopt governing documents. After organization, adoption of documents, and election of officers, the governing entity must submit documents to the Secretary and the State of Hawaii for certification. The Native Hawaiian governing entity must submit organic governing documents to the Secretary for certification within 120 days of election. The documents must establish citizenship criteria, involve maximum Native Hawaiian participation, outline governmental authorities, and provide for the Native Hawaiian people. The Native Hawaiian governing entity is authorized to negotiate with governments and entities, protect civil rights, and require consent for any sale or lease of lands or assets. The Native Hawaiian governing entity, authorized to negotiate with governments and protect civil rights, must submit organic governing documents to the Secretary for certification within 120 days. The Secretary will certify if the State of Hawaii supports the entity's recognition by the United States. The Native Hawaiian governing entity must submit organic governing documents to the Secretary for certification within 120 days. If the documents are not consistent with federal law, the Secretary will resubmit them to the entity with justifications for noncompliance. The Native Hawaiian governing entity must amend and resubmit organic governing documents to comply with federal law if they are not consistent with it. Upon the election of officers of the Native Hawaiian governing entity and the Secretary's certifications, the United States extends Federal recognition to the entity. If the Secretary does not act within 180 days of receiving the governing documents, certifications are deemed made. The United States extends Federal recognition to the Native Hawaiian governing entity as the representative body of the Native Hawaiian people. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Such sums as necessary for activities in this Act. SEC. 7. REAFFIRMATION OF DELEGATION OF FEDERAL AUTHORITY; NEGOTIATIONS. SEC. 7 reaffirms the delegation of federal authority to Hawaii for addressing indigenous issues and authorizes negotiations for the transfer of lands and resources to the Native Hawaiian governing entity. This Act does not settle any claims against the United States. SEC. 8 clarifies that the Native Hawaiian governing entity is not authorized to conduct gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It also states that individuals not eligible for programs and services provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Indian Health Service cannot gain eligibility through this Act. ETHICS: Section 208(a) of title 18, US Code does not apply to Native Hawaiians working for the US Office for Native Hawaiian Relations if the financial interest involved is solely due to their status as a Native Hawaiian. \n\nSEVERABILITY: If any section of this Act is deemed invalid, the rest of the Act will remain in effect."
