    "title": "SB 789",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Chapter 3.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows local public entities in California to impose an excise tax on excessive water users, with a maximum rate of 300 percent of the water purchase price. The tax must be approved by two-thirds of the voters and the revenue is split between the public entity and the State Water Resources Control Board for local water conservation efforts. A tax imposed under this section may be in addition to other authorized taxes. Section 16072 of the Vehicle Code is amended. Section 16072 of the Vehicle Code is amended to specify that a person's driving privilege suspension will not be terminated until one year has passed from the start of the suspension and proof of financial responsibility is filed. Failure to maintain proof of financial responsibility for three years will result in reinstatement of the suspension. Alternatively, the driving privilege can be restricted to necessary travel to and from the person's place of employment upon filing proof of financial responsibility and paying a penalty fee of $250. The restriction on driving privilege can be limited to necessary travel for employment, driving required for work duties, and transporting a minor dependent to school. The restriction remains in effect during the suspension period as long as proof of financial responsibility is maintained. If a suspension has been imposed under Section 16070 and one year has elapsed, it shall be terminated if the driving privilege is suspended under Section 16370 or 16381 due to a judgment from an accident. The department may reimpose the suspension under Section 16070 if the suspension under Section 16370 or 16381 is later set aside for reasons other than satisfying the judgment and providing proof of ability to respond in damages. All penalty fees collected will be deposited in the Financial Responsibility Penalty Account in the General Fund, after deducting administrative costs. Commercial driver's license holders are exempt from these penalties and cannot obtain a restricted license unless they surrender their commercial license for a noncommercial one. Section 16072 of the Vehicle Code will be inoperative on July 1, 2016, and repealed on January 1, 2017, unless a later statute extends these dates. Section 16072 of the Vehicle Code states that a person's driving privilege suspension will not be terminated until one year has passed from the start of the suspension and proof of financial responsibility is filed. Failure to maintain proof of financial responsibility for three years will result in reinstatement of the suspension. Alternatively, the driving privilege can be restricted to necessary travel to and from work upon application, proof of financial responsibility, and payment of a $250 penalty fee. (1) Necessary travel to and from person's place of employment.\n(2) Driving required for person's primary employment duties.\n(3) Driving to or from school, including college campuses.\n(4) Transporting a minor dependent to and from school if no public transportation is available. If a suspension has been imposed under Section 16070, it will remain in effect until proof of financial responsibility is maintained. The suspension may be terminated after one year if the driving privilege is suspended under Section 16370 or 16381 due to a judgment from the accident. The department can reimpose the suspension under Section 16070 if the suspension under Section 16370 or 16381 is later set aside for reasons other than satisfying the judgment and providing proof of ability to respond in damages. (d) Revenues from penalty fees go to Financial Responsibility Penalty Account in General Fund after deducting administration costs. Funds not subject to appropriation revert to General Fund. Commercial driver's license holders exempt. Those with suspended driving privilege must surrender commercial license for noncommercial one. Effective July 1, 2016."
