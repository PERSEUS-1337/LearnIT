    "content": "The federal government has historically supported information technology (IT) research and development (R&D) to address various issues like artillery trajectories, nuclear testing simulations, cryptanalysis, and weather modeling. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program, established in 1991, coordinates these efforts to meet evolving government needs effectively, including homeland security. The NITRD Program coordinates federal agencies' networking and information technology R&D investments to leverage strengths, increase interoperability, and avoid duplication. The National Coordinating Office (NCO) oversees the program's activities. The National Coordination Office for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NCO/NITRD) supports planning, coordination, budget, and assessment activities of the program. The NCO's role is recognized in NSTC charters, legislation, and congressional hearings. The director of the NCO is appointed by the White House OSTP and reports to the director of the White House OSTP. The NCO supports the NITRD Subcommittee in policy, program, and budget planning. The NITRD Subcommittee oversees policy, program, and budget planning for the NITRD Program, consisting of representatives from participating agencies, OSTP, OMB, and NCO. The President's FY2017 budget request for the NITRD Program is $4.54 billion, a 1.11% increase from FY2016. The budget reflects changes in individual agency NITRD budgets, which are aggregated into the overall NITRD budget. The NITRD budget is not a centralized source of funds allocated to individual agencies. Agency IT R&D budgets are developed internally and approved by OMB as part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress. The NITRD budget is calculated by aggregating IT R&D components of appropriations provided by Congress to federal agencies. An interactive history of NITRD Program funding is available online. The High-Performance Computing Program Act of 1991 was passed by Congress to improve coordination among agencies with high-performance computing programs. The OSTP released Grand Challenges outlining an R&D strategy for high-performance computing and communications, leading to the creation of the HPCC Program. The NITRD Program is part of the federal effort to promote IT R&D through various channels, including federally funded research labs and multi-agency programs. Federal funding of IT R&D has led to positive results, with programs like the NITRD Program focusing on nanotechnology R&D and combating terrorism. The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board highlighted the importance of unanticipated research results, such as the development of electronic mail and instant messaging from government-funded research in the 1960s. The report emphasizes the importance of federally funded programs in supporting long-term research into fundamental aspects of computing. It states that industry is less likely to invest in fundamental research on its own, and government sponsorship helps develop IT talent used by various sectors. Companies benefit from products created using ideas and workforce resulting from Federally-sponsored research. Government-funded IT R&D leads to job creation, tax revenues, productivity gains, and global leadership. It also promotes open standards, unlike industry which often focuses on proprietary products. Supporters believe that government funding creates a synergistic environment for research benefiting government, industry, academia, and the public. The CSTB stated that government funding for IT R&D allows for research on a larger scale with greater diversity and flexibility. Critics argue that government funding may lead to picking \"winners and losers\" in technological development, a role that should belong to the private sector. The size of the NITRD Program could influence industry research directions. No legislative activity related to the NITRD Program in the 115th Congress. The NITRD Program involves coordination among government, academia, and industry for U.S. competitiveness in high-performance computing. Key issues include the federal IT R&D research agenda, reliance on commercial hardware, and potential impact of deficit cutting on funding. Governed by the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991, the program aims to enhance interagency planning and coordination. The Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 expanded the mission of the NITRD Program to cover Internet-related research. The High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 set goals for federal high-performance computing research, development, and networking, as well as promoting competition and private sector investment in high-speed data networking. The Next Generation Internet Research Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-305) amended the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 to authorize research programs related to high-end computing, human-centered systems, and education. It also focused on developing a comprehensive U.S. research program and coordinating efforts in high-performance computing and telecommunications standards. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 revised the program requirements for the National High-Performance Computing Program, focusing on computer network infrastructure, high-speed data access, and networking technology. The Act required the director of the OSTP to establish goals and priorities for federal high-performance computing research and development. The America COMPETES Act of 2007 revised the National High-Performance Computing Program requirements, emphasizing computer network infrastructure and networking technology. The program aims to address broad economic and scientific challenges through multidisciplinary teams and high-performance computing resources. Annual reports must now detail program areas, federal funding levels, and incorporation of advisory committee recommendations. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for the advisory committee on high-performance computing to conduct periodic evaluations of the program and report to congressional committees. It also instructs the NSF to support basic research related to advanced information and communications technologies. The NSF director is required to award multiyear grants to establish Centers for Communications Research at higher education institutions or research institutions. Funding for basic research activities, including support for these centers, will be increased. Reports on research funding allocations must be submitted to Congress annually."
