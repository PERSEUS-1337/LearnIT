    "content": "On July 20, 2012, a 24-year-old male carried out a mass shooting in a theater in Aurora, CO, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. He used multiple firearms, including an M16 rifle, a shotgun, and handguns, all purchased legally. Sixteen days later, on August 5, 2012, a 40-year-old U.S. Army veteran committed another mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Milwaukee, WI, killing six worshipers and injuring three others. On August 5, 2012, a 40-year-old U.S. Army veteran carried out a mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Milwaukee, WI, killing six worshipers and injuring three others. The shooter, identified as a neo-Nazi and white supremacist, mistakenly targeted the Sikh temple, thinking it was a Muslim mosque. He used a 9mm semiautomatic pistol acquired legally in North Carolina. This incident, along with other mass shootings, led to calls for reinstating a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Since March 2011, the gun control debate in the 112th Congress has focused on allegations of mishandling in a Phoenix-based gun trafficking investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious.\" This operation came to light when suspect firearms linked to it were found at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. ATF whistleblowers contacted Senator Charles Grassley with concerns that suspected gun traffickers were not being arrested promptly, leading to a large number of suspect firearms passing into the hands of drug dealers. The whistleblowers revealed that suspect firearms from the investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious\" had been allowed to pass into the hands of criminals. Law enforcement recovered 665 firearms at crime scenes, while 1,355 remain unaccounted for. Congressional committees have issued reports and held hearings on this controversial operation. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary's Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee heard testimony about the risks of \"gun walking\" in April 2010. Attorney General Eric Holder admitted to inaccurate information in a DOJ letter regarding ATF's use of the tactic. Congressional hearings questioned senior officials' knowledge of Operation Fast and Furious. The President signed the Consolidated and... The President signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 into law, providing ATF with $1.152 billion for FY2012. A provision in the act, sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, prevents the expenditure of funds for facilitating firearm transfers to drug cartels without continuous monitoring. The ATF funding provisos and FBI funding proviso were made permanent with \"futurity\" language, prohibiting centralization of firearm records. The Administration proposed removing language prohibiting \"gun walking\" and stripping futurity language from ATF and FBI funding provisions in FY2013 DOJ budget submission. Additionally, the Administration proposed removing futurity language from the Tiahrt amendment, which restricts ATF from releasing firearm acquisition records. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits ATF from releasing firearms trace data under certain circumstances. Congress has modified the language of the Tiahrt amendment multiple times to clarify when it is appropriate to release this data. In the 112th Congress, Representative Issa and Senator Grassley released Part II of their report on the Fast and Furious operation. The Senate voted to invoke cloture on the Sportsmen's Act of 2012, allowing consideration of the bill. The bill aims to promote access to federal lands for hunting and sporting activities. A hearing was held on a report by the DOJ Office of Inspector General regarding ATF's Operation Fast and Furious, highlighting errors by high-ranking officials. The DOJ headquarters and Main Justice were blamed for errors in judgment and management failures in Operation Fast and Furious. A report by Representative Issa and Senator Grassley detailed how ATF Phoenix Division and U.S. Attorney's Office used controversial tactics compromising public safety. The House passed a resolution holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to produce documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. President Obama asserted executive privilege to withhold the documents. Another resolution authorized the committee to enforce subpoenas. Additionally, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, including a provision for Department of Defense mental health. The House passed a bill allowing DOD mental health professionals to inquire about service members' privately owned firearms off-base if they are at risk of suicide or a danger. The bill also funded ATF for FY2013 at $1.151 billion and included provisions to make certain ATF appropriations permanent law. The House bill funded ATF for FY2013 at $1.151 billion and included provisions to make certain ATF appropriations permanent law. It also included a provision prohibiting ATF from collecting long gun sales reports. Representative Issa issued a draft resolution to cite the Attorney General with contempt for not complying with committee subpoenas. The Senate bill (S. 2323) funded ATF for FY2013 at $1.153 billion, including the Cornyn provision but not the Rehberg amendment. The House passed the Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 (H.R. 4089) to facilitate access to federal public lands for recreational activities. Another bill (H.R. 822) aimed to increase reciprocity for concealed carry permits between states. The House passed a bill to facilitate access to federal public lands for recreational activities. Another bill aimed to increase reciprocity for concealed carry permits between states. In the 111th Congress, a similar amendment regarding concealed carry permits for handguns was narrowly defeated. The House also passed a Veterans' Benefits Act with a provision related to gun control and mental incompetence determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Similar proposals were considered in previous Congresses after the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. Firearms-related amendments were offered in bills related to national security investigations in May 2011. In the 112th Congress, amendments related to national security investigations and firearms transfers were proposed but not passed. Representative Mike Quigley's amendment would have allowed firearms transfers to be denied for individuals under FBI national security investigation, while Senator Rand Paul's amendment aimed to exclude firearms transfer records from warrantless collection during such investigations. The Congress also considered issues stemming from the Tucson shootings in January 2011, where 6 people were killed and 13 wounded, including Representative Giffords. The shooter used a 9mm Glock 19 semiautomatic pistol with extended magazines. Legislation has been introduced to reinstate the ban on large capacity ammunition feeding devices (LCAFDs) and to ban firearms near high-level federal officials. Congressional interest may also focus on the shooter's mental illness and illegal drug use. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism held a hearing on the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011. This proposal would amend certain deadlines and apply deeper cuts to federal law. P.L. 110-180 was passed after the Virginia Tech shootings to incentivize sharing firearms-related disqualifying records. Questions on permissible gun restrictions, crime control, and the impact of stricter regulations on reducing violence are raised. Proponents of gun control argue that federal laws are necessary to prevent guns from flowing illegally between states with varying restrictions. They believe the Second Amendment is outdated, intended to protect state militias, and does not guarantee an absolute right to bear arms. In today's society, proponents of firearms restrictions question the need for private citizens to own firearms not primarily for hunting or sporting purposes. Certain types of firearms, like fully automatic weapons and short-barreled rifles, have been heavily regulated since 1934. Fully automatic firearms have been banned from private possession since 1986, except for those registered before May 19, 1986. Opponents of gun control argue that laws are ineffective in preventing high-risk individuals from acquiring weapons. They believe stricter regulations would only burden law-abiding citizens and potentially infringe on civil rights. They also dispute the correlation between gun control and low crime rates in other countries, attributing differences to cultural factors. Gun control opponents reject the assumption that gun ownership is only for recreational purposes, emphasizing the need for self-defense. They argue that gun possession reduces crime and question the ability of law enforcement to ensure public safety. Some believe the Second Amendment allows for arms to defend against government tyranny. The debate between advocates and opponents is intense. The gun control debate is intense, with advocates and opponents holding opposing views on the Second Amendment and the effectiveness of regulation in reducing crime. Existing statistics do not definitively prove a causal connection between firearms and violence. During the 10-year period (1994-2004) when firearms were banned in the United States, data on gun ownership, firearms-related homicides, victimizations, mortality rates, personal defense use, and recreational use were collected. In 1994, 44 million people owned 192 million firearms, including 65 million handguns. By the end of 1996, approximately 242 million firearms were available for sale or possessed by civilians, with around 72 million being handguns. The number of firearms possessed by civilians in the United States increased from 259 million in 2000 to 294 million in 2007. Handgun imports nearly doubled from 2001 to 2007, reaching 2.2 million in 2009. Rifle imports increased from 228,000 to 632,000, and shotgun imports increased from 428,000. By 2009, rifle imports had increased to 864,000, but shotguns had decreased to 559,000. The estimated total number of firearms available to civilians in the United States had increased to approximately 310 million by 2009, with 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles, and 86 million shotguns. Per capita, the civilian gun stock has roughly doubled since 1968. Retail prices of guns vary widely, from $75 or less for inexpensive handguns to over $1,500 for higher-end rifles and shotguns. One study estimated that 1.5 million assault weapons were privately owned in 1994. Data on assault weapons in private possession are not available. The firearms-related murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate per 100,000 population decreased from 6.6 in 1993 to 3.6 in 2000. It fluctuated between 3.2 and 3.9 from 2001 to 2011, with peaks in 1974, 1980, 1991, and 1993. The estimated total number of firearms available in the US was approximately 310 million by 2009, with handguns, rifles, and shotguns making up the majority. Retail prices vary widely. The murder rates leveled off somewhat from 2001 to 2006, with slight increases in some years, then decreased and stabilized at 3.2 for 2010 and 2011. Over the years 1968-2011, about two-thirds of murders were committed with firearms, and roughly half with handguns. Non-firearms murder rates peaked in 1975, 1980, 1986, and 1991. National data on firearms deaths is sourced from Vital Statistics, published annually by the National Center for Health Statistics. Firearms deaths are categorized as homicides, legal interventions, suicides, accidents, and unknown circumstances, with data available for 1993 through 2007. Firearms fatalities decreased from 39,595 in 1993 to 28,664 in 2000, a 28% decrease. However, there was an increase in deaths in 2001 and 2002, followed by fluctuations until 2007. In 2009, there were 11,826 homicides, 18,735 suicides, 554 accidental shootings, and 232 deaths of unknown causes. In 2007, there were 1,520 juvenile firearms-related deaths. In 2007, there were 1,520 juvenile firearms-related deaths, including homicides, suicides, unintentional deaths, and deaths of unknown causes. Juvenile firearms-related deaths decreased by 56% from 1993 to 2001, with fluctuations in the following years. The National Crime Victimization Survey provides information on weapons used by offenders based on victims' reports. Based on victims' reports, the National Crime Victimization Survey estimated 4.3 million non-lethal violent crimes in 2009, with weapons used in 22% of incidents and firearms in 8%. The number of firearms-related non-lethal violent crimes decreased from 2000 to 2009. Additionally, NCVS data from 1987 to 1992 showed that 62,200 victims used guns for self-defense annually. The National Self-Defense Survey conducted by criminology professor Gary Kleck estimated that handguns were used 2.1 million times per year for self-defense, and all types of guns were used approximately 2.5 million times a year for that purpose during the 1988-1993 period. Law enforcement agencies do not collect data on civilians using firearms for self-defense, leading to contradictory statistics from household surveys. Criminal justice statistics are often estimates due to underreporting by victims and offenders. Different methodologies can lead to varying statistics, and survey research may have limitations in producing statistically significant findings. In 1994, recreation was the most common reason for owning a firearm, with approximately 15 million hunters representing about 35% of gun owners. In 1994, approximately 15 million hunters, representing about 35% of gun owners, engaged in sport shooting in the United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported over 14.7 million paid license holders in 2003, with 15.2 million persons hunting and nearly 19.8 million participating in target shooting that year. Federal statutes like the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 regulate firearm commerce and possession, with many states having stricter firearms laws. The National Firearms Act of 1934 regulates firearms perceived as especially lethal, such as machine guns and short-barreled long guns. It also covers concealed firearms like pen guns and requires registration with the Attorney General. Federal firearms regulation aims to assist law enforcement in reducing crime. The Gun Control Act (GCA) aims to assist law enforcement in reducing crime and violence by regulating domestic commerce in small arms and ammunition. It requires federal licensing for those manufacturing, importing, or selling firearms as a business, prohibits interstate mail-order sales of firearms, and sets restrictions on who firearms or ammunition can be sold to. The GCA also prohibits the interstate sale of handguns and allows the Attorney General to prohibit the importation of non-sporting firearms. The Gun Control Act (GCA) regulates domestic commerce in firearms and ammunition to reduce crime and violence. It requires federal licensing for firearm businesses, prohibits interstate mail-order sales of firearms, and sets restrictions on sales. The GCA also allows the Attorney General to ban non-sporting firearm imports and mandates record-keeping for commercial gun sales. Background checks are required for unlicensed persons seeking firearms from federal licensees, with private transactions exempt. State laws may cover possession, registration, and licensing for firearms owners. Under current law, there are nine classes of persons prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition, including convicted criminals, fugitives, drug users, mentally ill individuals, unauthorized immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced citizens, individuals under restraining orders, and those convicted of domestic violence. Since 1994, it has been illegal for anyone under 18 years of age to possess a handgun or handgun ammunition. Federal firearms licensees are prohibited from transferring firearms or ammunition to prohibited persons, including those convicted of domestic violence or under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. Since 1994, it has been illegal for anyone under 18 years of age to possess a handgun or handgun ammunition. The Gun Control Act (GCA) does not differentiate between citizens and legal permanent aliens; both can possess firearms and ammunition as long as they are not prohibited persons. Illegal immigrants and nonimmigrants are prohibited from possessing firearms, with exceptions outlined in a 2011 DOJ legal opinion. Legal immigrants and nonimmigrants who establish a 90-day state residency were previously eligible to purchase firearms, but in 1999, nonimmigrant aliens with visas were prohibited from doing so. Nonimmigrants with visas are generally prohibited from purchasing, receiving, or possessing firearms, with exceptions for certain individuals such as official representatives of foreign governments, designated visitors, foreign law enforcement officers on duty, and visitors admitted for lawful hunting or sporting purposes. ATF implemented a rule in 2002 to enforce this law. The ATF implemented a rule in 2002 prohibiting nonimmigrants from possessing firearms, including those legally admitted without a visa. The DOJ Office of Legal Counsel later found ATF's interpretation of the law to be in error, stating that it only applied to nonimmigrants admitted under a nonimmigrant visa. The ATF's 90-day residence requirement for noncitizens was found to be in error, as there was no statutory basis for different tests for citizens and noncitizens. Noncitizens were previously required to provide additional documentation to prove 90 days of residency, which citizens were not required to do. ATF issued a final rule in 2012 to align with legal opinions, updating Form 4473 for compliance. FFLs and their customers must use the revised Form 4473 to document that a customer is not prohibited from receiving firearms. Nonimmigrants admitted legally to the US without a visa are not prohibited from possessing firearms. Visa-exempt aliens, including Canadians, must still demonstrate their intention of making a home in the state where they are acquiring a firearm. Nonimmigrants admitted legally to the US without a visa are not prohibited from possessing firearms. Visa-exempt aliens, like Canadians, must show intent to establish residency in the state where they are acquiring a firearm. They may face challenges in obtaining necessary documentation and would need to involve a federally licensed exporter to take firearms out of the US. International transfers must comply with ITAR and EAR regulations. Nonimmigrant firearms owners in the US cannot personally ship or carry firearms out of the country. Federal firearms licensees (FFLs) are authorized to engage in interstate transfers of firearms, conducting background checks and verifying identities before transferring firearms to non-licensed individuals. Licensees can transfer long guns to out-of-state residents face-to-face, but not handguns. Since 1986, there are no restrictions on interstate ammunition transfer. A federal firearms license is needed to manufacture or import ammunition. FFLs must submit multiple sales reports for multiple handgun purchases within five days. They must maintain records and respond to ATF requests for firearms tracing information within 24 hours. Since 1986, non-licensees are prohibited from transferring firearms to out-of-state residents and prohibited persons. Gun trafficking involves moving firearms from legal to illegal markets, with Internet transfers subject to the same federal laws as other methods. ATF agents can inspect business premises and gun records without warrants. The Gun Control Act (GCA) aims to combat gun trafficking, especially interstate trafficking, by preventing convicted felons, drug traffickers, and gang members from acquiring firearms. ATF's strategy includes targeting straw purchasers, corrupt licensed dealers, unlicensed dealers, secondhand firearms trafficking, and stolen firearms. Gun trafficking involves moving firearms from legal to illegal markets. ATF agents have the authority to inspect gun records without warrants. ATF works to reduce firearms-related crime by regulating the U.S. firearms industry and conducting criminal investigations. Despite tensions with the firearms industry, ATF Special Agents and Industry Operations Investigators can inspect FFLs without search warrants in certain scenarios. ATF Special Agents and Industry Operations Investigators can inspect FFLs without search warrants in specific scenarios to trace crime guns and generate leads in criminal investigations. ATF investigators inspect FFL records to uncover illegal activities like straw purchases, where someone buys a firearm for another person. Straw purchases involve lying on ATF Form 4473 to transfer guns illegally. Straw purchases, known as \"lying and buying for the other guy,\" are illegal under the Gun Control Act (GCA). Making false statements to a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) or falsifying identity documents is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Additionally, providing false information regarding FFL records can result in up to five years' imprisonment. These illegal activities are difficult to detect until the true intent of the straw purchaser is revealed during a subsequent transfer. When a straw purchaser's true intent is revealed by a subsequent transfer to the actual buyer, who may be a prohibited person, it is a violation of federal law. The penalty for such actions can result in up to 10 years' imprisonment. Alternatively, the actual buyer may seek to acquire firearms without leaving a paper trail, making the illegal transfer less apparent. Under federal law, unlicensed individuals can buy and resell firearms as long as certain conditions are met. They can purchase multiple firearms and give them as gifts, but cannot sell firearms as their primary source of income without a federal license. No federal background checks are required for these transactions. No federal background checks are required for recipients of subsequent intrastate firearms transfers. If a suspected straw purchaser is seen transferring firearms to another person immediately after leaving a licensed gun dealer, there is reasonable suspicion. The actual buyer would only be guilty if proven to have sponsored the straw purchase. Illegal arrangements are often revealed when the straw purchaser admits to buying firearms for a non-prohibited person. The illegality of transfers may not be apparent until the true intent of the actual buyer is known. The illegality of firearm transfers may not be evident until the true intent of the buyer is revealed, such as transporting firearms across state lines or engaging in illegal activities. Suspicious behavior of straw purchasers, like making multiple cash purchases of semiautomatic firearms, can raise concerns prompting investigations by ATF and licensed gun dealers to avoid negative attention. It is notable that if an FFL believes a firearms transfer to be suspicious, he may choose not to sell those firearms to the individuals in question. If he should proceed with the transfer, as long as he had conducted the required criminal background check on the prospective buyer and filled out the proper paperwork, his obligations under federal law would have been fulfilled. Regarding interstate transfers, it is unlawful for any person who is not federally licensed to deal in firearms to transport or receive a firearm into his own state of residence that was obtained in another state. Additionally, it is unlawful for any person who is not federally licensed to deal in firearms to deliver a firearm to another unlicensed person who resides in a state other than the transferor's state of residence. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Southwest Border gun trafficking cases often involve multiple straw purchases. Large-scale straw purchasing schemes were central to ATF Phoenix-based gun trafficking investigations, such as Operation Fast and Furious. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona reportedly hesitated to prosecute straw purchasing cases despite ATF investigations from 2006 to 2010 involving numerous firearms and defendants. Violations of firearms smuggling laws can result in fines and up to 10 years' imprisonment. Federal prosecutions for straw purchasing and related offenses have decreased in recent years, despite efforts to increase ATF appropriations. An ATF agent testified that current penalties are not sufficient to deter gun trafficking to Mexican drug organizations due to the lack of significant jail time in the statute. Federal prosecutions for straw purchasing and related offenses have decreased in recent years, despite efforts to increase ATF appropriations. A CRS analysis showed a decline in defendants charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A) from FY2004 to FY2010. The ATF agent's concern about insufficient penalties for gun trafficking to Mexican drug organizations was highlighted, as straw purchases were seen as paperwork violations with minimal jail time. Federal prosecutions for straw purchasing and related offenses have decreased in recent years, despite efforts to increase ATF appropriations. Convictions under the relevant provisions declined through FY2008 but increased for FY2009 and FY2010. About two-thirds of defendants were convicted cumulatively from FY2004 to FY2010. Over a third of those convicted received no prison sentence, while the rest received varying prison sentences. The U.S. Sentencing Commission proposed amendments to potentially increase penalties for cases involving cross-border trafficking in small arms or ammunition. The U.S. Sentencing Commission proposed amendments to potentially increase penalties for cases involving cross-border trafficking in small arms or ammunition, including straw purchases. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 required background checks for firearms transfers between FFLs and non-licensed persons. The Brady Act of 1993 included interim provisions for background checks on handgun transfers, leading to 312,000 denials out of 12.7 million checks. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was activated by the FBI on November 30, 1998, for both handgun and long gun transfers. The Brady background check ensures that unlicensed transferees are not prohibited persons under the GCA. States can have stricter firearms regulations, such as waiting periods and licenses. FFLs submit transferee information to NICS for crosschecking against databases to determine eligibility for firearms transfer/possession. Optional numeric identifiers can expedite the background check process. The NICS index, III, and NCIC are computerized databases used to check firearms transfer eligibility. The NICS index contains disqualifying records not found in the III or NCIC, including records on previously denied transfers. The III is a criminal history index system maintained by the FBI for sharing records on persons arrested and convicted of felonies and serious misdemeanors at the federal or state level. The NCIC system holds nearly 70 million criminal history records, including files on wanted persons, domestic abusers, deported alien felons, and suspected terrorists. Some states serve as points of contact for background checks, where FFLs contact a state agency for the process. The NICS process involves FFLs contacting a state agency for background checks, with outcomes of \"proceed,\" \"denied,\" or \"delayed.\" If delayed, the transfer can proceed after three days if no response is received, while the FBI continues adjudication for up to 90 days. The NICS process allows for a 90-day adjudication period for background checks. If a person is found to be prohibited during this time, the FBI will inform ATF for firearms retrieval. Denied individuals can challenge the accuracy of their denial by requesting the reason from the agency that conducted the NICS check. The denied person can challenge the accuracy of the record, and if found inaccurate, the denying agency must correct it. False positives can occur in Brady background checks, but the FBI has implemented measures to reduce them, such as the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) established in 2004. This allows individuals with similar names or birth dates to prohibited persons to avoid misidentification in the future by authorizing the FBI to keep their information in the VAF. The FBI can maintain personally identifying information in the VAF to prevent delayed transfers. Prohibited persons can petition the Attorney General for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore firearms eligibility, but a funding rider has prevented processing such petitions since FY1993. Under the Brady Act, individuals can regain firearms eligibility by having civil rights restored, expunging criminal records, or receiving a pardon. Over 95.1 million background checks were completed from December 1998 to 2009, resulting in 1.6 million denials. FBI conducted 54.2 million checks for non-POC states, DC, and territories with a denial rate of 1.4%, while POC states had a higher denial rate of 2.1%. Congress authorized a grant program under the Brady Act. The Brady Act allows individuals to regain firearms eligibility through various means. The National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) was established to enhance access to firearms-related disqualifying records. DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics administers NCHIP grants to states for updating criminal history records. Over 18 years, Congress has allocated $562.8 million for NCHIP. In FY1995-FY2012, Congress allocated $562.8 million for NCHIP to improve access to firearms-related disqualifying records. Following the Virginia Tech tragedy in 2007, DOJ reported missing criminal history records in the III, leading to delayed background checks and firearms transfers. Some states had not forwarded mental defective records to the FBI due to privacy laws and other limitations. Following the Virginia Tech tragedy, the NICS mental defective file increased significantly, with California contributing a large number of records. By May 2010, the number of records had surpassed 859,000, thanks to the NCIS Improvement Amendments Act. However, many states had not provided any or only a few records. Funding for NCHIP in FY2012 varied between the President's budget request, the House-reported CJS appropriations bill, and the Senate-passed CJS appropriations bill. The NCHIP program received $6.0 million in funding under the FY2012 Minibus appropriations bill, which was signed into law. For FY2013, both the Senate and House proposed $6 million in funding for NCHIP, in line with the Administration's request. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 authorized the Attorney General to provide grants to states for improving electronic access to records for NICS background checks. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 requires the Attorney General to report annually to Congress on federal agency compliance. The BJS Director must report on states' progress in providing firearms-related disqualifying records for NICS background checks. The grant program is known as NARIP, with funding authorized for FY2009 through FY2013. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 requires a percentage of grants to be allocated for relief from disabilities programs and state court computer system improvements. States providing at least 90% of disqualifying records may be eligible for a waiver of the match requirement under NCHIP. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 mandates states to provide a certain percentage of disqualifying records within 180 days of enactment. Failure to comply may result in reductions in Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. The Attorney General can withhold funding from states that do not meet specified percentages of disqualifying records over different time periods. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 requires states to provide disqualifying records within 180 days. The Attorney General can waive 5% cuts if states show compliance efforts. Congress allocated $10 million in FY2009 and $20 million in FY2010 for NARIP grants. BJS awarded grants to Nevada, New York, and Oregon in FY2009, and to Florida in FY2010. In FY2010, BJS awarded NARIP grants totaling $20.1 million to various agencies, including Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Idaho State Police, Illinois State Police, New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts, New York Division of Criminal Justice Services, Oregon State Police, Texas Department of Public Safety, and Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance. In FY2010, BJS awarded NARIP grants totaling $20.1 million to various agencies, including Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Idaho State Police, Illinois State Police, New Jersey Administrative Office of the Courts, New York Division of Criminal Justice Services, Oregon State Police, Texas Department of Public Safety, and Wisconsin Office of Justice Assistance. States must certify relief from disabilities programs for mentally defective individuals to be eligible for grants. Only 14 states applied in FY2009, with Nevada, New York, and Oregon being certified and awarded grants. In FY2010, BJS awarded NARIP grants totaling $20.1 million to various agencies in Nevada, New York, and Oregon. Factors inhibiting states from applying for grants included opposition at the state level to restoring firearm rights and limited time to respond to the certification deadline. For FY2012, the President's budget requested $12.0 million for the program, with differing amounts proposed in the House and Senate bills. In FY2010, BJS awarded NARIP grants totaling $20.1 million to various agencies in Nevada, New York, and Oregon. For FY2012, the President's budget requested $12.0 million for the program. S. 1572 was folded into the Senate-passed FY2012 Minibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2112), which provides $5.0 million for NARIP. The Senate-reported CJS appropriations bill for FY2013 would provide $7.0 million for NARIP, while the House Committee on Appropriations ordered reported a measure for $12.0 million. Congress has prohibited the collection of fees for firearms-related background checks through the FBI-administered NICS since FY1999. The Brady Act prohibits the establishment of an electronic registry of firearms, but a rule proposed by the DOJ under Attorney General Janet Reno allowed for the retention of approved background check records for audit purposes. The NRA challenged this rule, but the Court of Appeals found that temporary retention for audit purposes was permissible. Eventually, a final rule was implemented allowing records to be kept for up to 90 days. The final rule allowed records to be maintained for up to 90 days, but Attorney General John Ashcroft proposed next-day destruction of files. GAO reported FBI conducting non-routine searches of NICS audit log under Attorney General Reno to check for prohibited persons. FBI stated searches were secondary to system maintenance. GAO also mentioned next-day record destruction would impact NICS operations. The DOJ took steps to minimize adverse effects of next-day destruction of NICS records, but opponents of federal gun control viewed it as beyond the Attorney General's authority under the Brady Act. Additional issues arose post-9/11 regarding Brady background checks. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 required NICS approved firearm transfer records to be destroyed within 24 hours. The provision in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 requires NICS approved firearm transfer records to be destroyed within 24 hours, making it permanent law. The gun control debate during the 111th Congress was influenced by key Supreme Court decisions in District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago, which affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense under the Second Amendment. Senator Orrin Hatch proposed related amendments during Senate consideration of H.R. 2112, but they were not voted upon. The 111th Congress revisited gun control issues following key Supreme Court decisions affirming the right to possess firearms for self-defense. Members of Congress passed bills related to overturning gun laws in the District of Columbia and amending a DC voting rights bill. Future cases are expected to further define permissible gun control laws under the Second Amendment. The House leadership tabled its version of the DC voting rights bill (H.R. 157) to avoid amendments that could overturn DC gun laws. The Senate considered legislation (S. 669) to revamp procedures for veterans deemed \"mentally incompetent\" and lose their firearms eligibility. Representative John Boozman offered an amendment to a draft veterans' benefits bill in the 111th Congress. In the 112th Congress, the House passed legislation (H.R. 822) regarding national reciprocity for concealed carry of firearms. The Senate also considered similar bills, including denying firearms to suspected terrorists. In the 112th Congress, legislation was passed regarding national reciprocity for concealed carry of firearms. The House also passed amendments to federal bankruptcy law allowing for firearm exemptions. The Senate considered bills related to denying firearms to suspected terrorists. During the 111th Congress, amendments were made to allow firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges, as well as on Amtrak trains. Congress also passed amendments to the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. Amendments to the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA; P.L. 108-277) were made to widen eligibility for qualified police officers to carry concealed firearms across state lines. Congress also included firearms-related provisions in the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, addressing issues such as the collection of information on privately owned firearms by military personnel and demilitarization of small arms. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 included increased funding for ATF to investigate gun trafficking cases across the Southwest border. After mass shootings in Aurora, CO, and Oak Creek, WI, some Members of Congress called for a reconsideration of the ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. The 112th Congress saw calls to ban large capacity ammunition feeding devices following the Tucson mass shooting. Attention was also given to the ATF Southwest border gun trafficking investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" leading to the resignation of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held hearings on this operation, and the House passed a resolution holding the Attorney General in contempt of Congress for asserting executive privilege. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform passed a resolution holding the Attorney General in contempt of Congress for failing to produce subpoenaed documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. The committee also released Parts I and II of its final report on the operation. Additionally, the House passed bills related to gun control issues, including establishing greater reciprocity between states with concealed carry statutes and prohibiting the Department of Veterans Affairs from making mentally incompetent determinations about beneficiaries for gun control purposes without judicial authority. On July 20, 2012, a 24-year-old male entered a theater in Aurora, CO, and allegedly shot to death 12 people and wounded another 58 people, 7 of them critically. He was armed with multiple firearms purchased legally from federally licensed gun dealers in Colorado, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition bought through online transactions. This incident prompted discussions on gun control measures in Congress. The Aurora, CO shooting in 2012 led to discussions in Congress about reinstating a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Questions arose about the legality of the shooter's firearms and ammunition purchases, as well as his mental health. It is noted that the shooter bought his weapons legally, including a Smith & Wesson AR-15 with a 100-round magazine. The 1994 SAW ban defined a rifle as a SAW if it was semiautomatic with the ability to accept a detachable magazine and had specific features. The ban named the Colt AR-15 as prohibited but did not specifically prohibit any Smith & Wesson firearm. Post-ban, Colt modified its rifle to comply with the features test, making it legal. The 1994 SAW ban included a pistol grip and the ability to accept a detachable magazine as key features. High capacity ammunition feeding devices over 10 rounds were banned, but existing ones were grandfathered in. The 1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act repealed restrictions on interstate transfers of ammunition. The 1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act repealed restrictions on interstate transfers of ammunition, allowing for the transfer of ammunition between unlicensed persons without recordkeeping requirements. Internet-based firearm sales are subject to the same regulations as any other type of firearm transaction. The Internet facilitates communication and allows for efficient contact between individuals. Prior to the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, only licensed firearms dealers could transfer ammunition to unlicensed persons, with recordkeeping requirements for handgun ammunition transfers. Unlicensed individuals could purchase ammunition face-to-face from out-of-state dealers, but now interstate transfers of ammunition between unlicensed persons are allowed without recordkeeping. Senator Frank Lautenberg introduced the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act (S. 3458) to require federally licensed ammunition dealers and prohibit unlicensed persons from selling ammunition. This bill mandates in-person purchases with state-issued identification from licensed dealers. The bill introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg requires in-person purchases of ammunition with state-issued identification from federally licensed dealers. It also mandates record-keeping on ammunition transfers and reporting of large purchases to law enforcement. The bill was prompted by a tragic shooting incident at a Sikh temple in Milwaukee, where the shooter legally acquired a 9mm pistol in North Carolina. Page, a neo-Nazi white supremacist, was wounded by law enforcement and then shot himself to death at a Sikh temple. The FBI did not have a file on Page and indicated he acted alone without leaving a manifesto. The attack could be considered a hate crime under Wisconsin state law. The 112th Congress revisited concealed carry laws. The Judiciary committee reported the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011 (H.R. 822) after a split vote. The House passed the bill, which aims to increase reciprocity among states allowing concealed carry of handguns. 38 states have \"shall issue\" laws, while 10 have more restrictive \"may issue\" laws. Several states have varying laws regarding concealed carry permits, with some states allowing it without a permit while others do not allow it at all. Some states have recognition statutes, open statutes, or hybrid statutes for concealed carry permits. Reciprocity between states also varies, with some states extending reciprocity to each other while others do not, even to more restrictive states. Under H.R. 822, a permit holder from one state would be able to travel to another state with a concealed handgun, regardless of the type of concealed carry law in the destination state. However, issues could arise as the bill does not account for the differences between more permissive \"shall issue\" and more restrictive \"may issue\" state laws, potentially causing conflicts between states. The bill H.R. 822 allows permit holders to carry concealed handguns across state lines, regardless of destination state laws. Issues may arise due to differences in \"shall issue\" and \"may issue\" state laws, such as varying eligibility requirements and age restrictions. \"Forum shopping,\" where residents obtain permits from more lenient states, is also a concern. The bill H.R. 822 allows permit holders to carry concealed handguns across state lines, regardless of destination state laws. Representative Daniel Lungren offered an amendment for a GAO study on \"open\" state concealed carry laws. Minority Members proposed amendments to deny permits to certain individuals, while other amendments focused on improving concealed carry documentation and information sharing for law enforcement. The bill H.R. 822 allows permit holders to carry concealed handguns across state lines, regardless of destination state laws. Representative Louie Gohmert's amendment for concealed carry in the District of Columbia was defeated. Proponents argue for reciprocity similar to driver's license recognition, while opponents highlight differences in eligibility requirements. Proponents also argue that armed individuals are less likely to be victimized, leading to reduced crime rates. Lamar Smith cited NRA data showing lower crime rates in concealed carry states. Opponents fear more firearms could lead to misuse and harm. Data from the Violence Policy Center shows incidents involving concealed carry permit holders. Other bills, like H.R. 2900 and S. 2213, have been introduced in Congress. Representative Timothy Johnson introduced H.R. 3543, similar to H.R. 822. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced S. 176 for concealed carry reciprocity with federal eligibility requirements. The bill may be more restrictive than state laws, requiring good cause and public trust for a permit. Senator Mark Begich introduced the National Right-to-Carry Act. Senator Mark Begich introduced the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2012 (S. 2188), a companion bill to H.R. 822. Senator John Thune introduced the Respecting States' Rights and Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2012 (S. 2213), allowing residents of certain states to carry concealed weapons in other states without a permit. The 112th Congress revisited the issue of firearms carry on public lands, with Senator Coburn sponsoring legislation allowing individuals to carry firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges. The House passed the Sportsmen's Heritage Act of 2012 (H.R. 4089) to promote recreational fishing, hunting, and shooting on federal public lands, with exceptions for certain areas. The bill aims to facilitate access and use of these lands for these purposes, while also considering national security, public safety, and resource conservation. The Senate voted to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to the Sportsmen's Act of 2012 (S. 3525) on July 22, 2012. The bill addresses hunting and fishing issues, similar to H.R. 4089, but with different approaches. The Senate recessed without further consideration of S. 3525. Additionally, H.R. 4089 includes a provision to prohibit the EPA from regulating lead content in ammunition and fishing tackle under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA has denied petitions to regulate ammunition and lead in fishing tackle, citing lack of legal authority. Bills like H.R. 4063 aim to repeal provisions restricting firearms in national parks, while H.R. 1865 / S. 1588 seek to prevent bans on firearms possession on public lands. The bill aims to allow firearms possession at Corps-operated water resources projects, similar to National Parks legislation. Corps staff are not authorized to be armed, unlike National Park Service rangers. Firearms possession would still be subject to state and local laws. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (H.R. 4310) includes provisions related to firearms possession on corps projects and lands. It clarifies that military personnel may be asked about privately owned firearms if deemed high risk for suicide or harm to others. Representative Phil Gingrey's amendment expresses Congress's support for active duty military personnel living in certain areas. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 includes provisions exempting active duty military personnel in DC from firearms laws. ATF's Project Gunrunner aims to stop illegal gun flow to Mexico through increased enforcement and cooperation with Mexican authorities. In FY2010-FY2012, ATF prosecuted 1,467 defendants for gang-related offenses, seized over 10,500 firearms, and received funding of $1.152 billion from Congress. Additionally, $68.9 million was allocated for efforts related to addressing firearms trafficking. Approximately $68.9 million in direct funding has been allocated to address Southwest Border gun trafficking groups. ATF has trained Mexican law enforcement officials to use its eTrace program to trace firearms and identify gun trafficking trends. However, the interpretation of trace data has limitations, but it shows that certain firearms, like semi-automatic rifles, are increasingly used by Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The DOJ Office of the Inspector General evaluated Project Gunrunner in November 2010, recommending ATF to focus on reporting multiple long gun sales to combat Mexican drug trafficking organizations' preference for military-style firearms. ATF was advised to concentrate on complex criminal conspiracies involving high-level traffickers rather than low-level straw purchasers. ATF's Southwest border efforts faced controversy after a U.S. Border Patrol agent's murder in December 2010, linked to firearms from Phoenix, AZ. The murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in December 2010 was linked to firearms from a Phoenix, AZ-based Project Gunrunner investigation known as \"Operation Fast and Furious.\" Allegations of misconduct by DOJ and ATF upper-level management have been the focus of multiple congressional hearings, urging more transparency about potential missteps leading up to the operation. Congress is concerned about the gun walking tactics used in Operation Fast and Furious and the selective release of ATF firearms trace data. GAO recommended regular updates on firearms trace data to track trafficking trends. ATF released limited firearms trace data on Mexican authorities' requests in 2012. DOJ and ATF requested emergency approval for an information collection initiative in 2010, eventually approved in 2011. Opposition tried to block ATF's initiative but failed in FY2012 appropriation. ATF is currently collecting multiple rifle sales reports in Southwest Border. ATF is collecting multiple rifle sales reports in Southwest Border states, requiring FFLs to report sales of certain rifles to unlicensed persons within five consecutive business days. The initiative is limited to FFLs in Southwest border states and is initially a one-year pilot project. On February 4, 2011, OMB denied emergency approval for ATF's rifle sales reporting pilot project. Despite this, ATF received over 12,000 comments during the 60-day comment period, with 70% in support and 30% opposed. After further consideration and an additional 30-day comment period, OMB approved the initiative for a three-year period ending July 31, 2014, following a recommendation from the DOJ OIG based on ATF investigations into Mexican drug trafficking organizations' preference for long guns. The OIG recommended that ATF work with DOJ to explore options for requiring multiple long gun sales reporting due to drug trafficking organizations' preference for these firearms. Despite initial concerns about authority, ATF and DOJ concluded they had sufficient legal basis to collect reports on multiple long gun sales from FFLs under current law. ATF proposed this information collection using its authority to issue \"demand letters.\" The ATF proposed collecting information from FFLs through \"demand letters\" to obtain records for trace data and ensure compliance. This authority has been challenged but upheld in federal courts, as seen in a 2000 case where 41 FFLs were issued demand letters for non-compliance with trace requests. The ATF issued demand letters to FFLs to submit information on firearm purchases and sales for the past three years and monthly thereafter. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ATF's authority to issue these letters, stating it did not violate the prohibition on creating a national registry of firearms. In 1999, another demand letter was sent to 450 FFLs with 10 or more crime guns traced to them, requiring reporting of secondhand firearm acquisitions without disclosing identities. The ATF issued demand letters to FFLs for information on firearm purchases and sales. U.S. Courts of Appeals ruled that Section 926(a) was not violated by the demand letters. Critics argue that ATF lacks authority for multiple rifle sales reports and that it could lead to an illegal firearms registry. While additional documentation on firearms transactions involving rifles is not entirely unprecedented, some Members of Congress disagree with the ATF's proposal for multiple rifle sales reports, arguing that similar statutory authority should be required as with multiple handgun sales reporting in 1986. The House passed an amendment to prohibit ATF from implementing a multiple rifle sales reporting requirement in 2011, but the Senate rejected the bill for budgetary reasons. Senator Jon Tester introduced a bill to prevent DOJ from collecting information on multiple rifle or shotgun sales. Representative Rehberg successfully amended the FY2012 CJS appropriations. Rehberg successfully amended the FY2012 Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill to block ATF from implementing a reporting requirement. The Senate later folded its appropriations bill into a minibus bill, but the language from Rehberg's amendment was not included in the final bill signed into law. ATF collected 502 multiple rifle sales reports from August 14, 2011, through October 6, 2011. ATF collected 502 multiple rifle sales reports from FFLs in Southwest Border states from August 14, 2011, through October 6, 2011. Despite challenges in federal courts, ATF's demand letter authority to collect such information was upheld. Efforts to end the reporting requirement were renewed during the FY2013 appropriations cycle. During the FY2013 appropriations cycle, Representative Rehberg successfully prohibited ATF from collecting multiple long gun sales reports. Over 115 defendants were referred for federal prosecution based on leads from these reports, resulting in the seizure of 168 firearms. Approximately 1,045 FFLs submitted 3,500 reports, costing an estimated $12 per year per FFL. In January/February 2011, ATF and Project Gunrunner faced scrutiny for Operation Fast and Furious in Phoenix, AZ. Suspected straw purchasers were allowed to acquire large quantities of firearms for long-term trafficking investigations. Some firearms \"walked\" to criminals before arrests were made, with some ending up in Mexico. Two AK-47 rifles linked to the operation were found at the scene of a shootout where U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed. ATF acknowledged that 195 firearms purchased by individuals under investigation were involved. Senator Charles E. Grassley raised concerns about Operation Fast and Furious, where 195 firearms purchased by individuals under ATF investigation were recovered in Mexico. Questions arose about a firearm used in the murder of U.S. ICE Special Agent Jamie Zapata. Policymakers expressed dismay over the circumstances, prompting Grassley to write letters to ATF Acting Director Kenneth E. Melson and U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder regarding whistleblower allegations. Senator Grassley raised concerns about Operation Fast and Furious, where firearms purchased under ATF investigation were recovered in Mexico. He requested a briefing on Project Gunrunner due to allegations of ATF sanctioning the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers for transport into Mexico. The DOJ denied these allegations, stating that ATF makes efforts to interdict illegally purchased weapons. Senator Grassley raised concerns about Operation Fast and Furious, where firearms purchased under ATF investigation were recovered in Mexico. He requested a briefing on Project Gunrunner due to allegations of ATF sanctioning the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers for transport into Mexico. Weich emphasized the need to protect investigations from political influence and requested that Committee staff refrain from contacting law enforcement personnel for information on pending criminal investigations, including the case of Customs and Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's death. Senator Grassley had previously written to Attorney General Holder with documents from whistleblowers alleging that a federally licensed gun dealer was encouraged by ATF and the Arizona U.S. Attorney's Office to continue transferring firearms to a suspected straw purchaser despite concerns about legal liabilities. The gun dealer could be held liable for firearms found at Agent Terry's murder scene, including two AK-47 variants with specific serial numbers. Senator Grassley expressed concerns about political influence in seeking information on these matters, emphasizing the importance of holding officials accountable to the American people. These events were part of the chain of events stemming from whistleblower allegations related to Operation Fast and Furious. The House approved a resolution citing the Attorney General with contempt, the first time Congress has done so to a sitting officer of a presidential Cabinet. This followed allegations of gun walking, leading to calls for independent reviews and commendations for tasking the DOJ OIG with investigating ATF's gun trafficking investigations. The House approved a resolution citing the Attorney General with contempt for allegations of gun walking. Representative Smith commended the Attorney General for tasking the OIG with reviewing ATF's firearms trafficking methods and asked specific questions about the \"Fast and Furious\" program. DOJ responded to the questions raised by Representative Smith. On March 31, 2011, Representative Darrell Issa issued a subpoena to DOJ and ATF for documents related to Project Gunrunner. On May 3, 2011, Attorney General Holder testified about Operation Fast and Furious, claiming he had only recently learned about it. Representative Issa then released DOJ documents suggesting officials knew more than they had admitted. The DOJ documents released by Representative Issa suggested officials knew more about Operation Fast and Furious than they had previously admitted. The documents included a memorandum from the ATF Phoenix Field Division Office, a memo from DOJ Criminal Division Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, and an email referencing a directive from the Deputy Attorney General. The email referenced a directive from the Deputy Attorney General regarding undercover operations involving guns crossing the border, including cases in Mexico. ATF line supervisors raised concerns about firearms being illegally transferred during surveillance operations in Operation Fast and Furious, but were directed not to arrest suspects or interdict firearms. This departure from past investigative practices was questioned. On June 15, 2011, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing regarding concerns about DOJ's lack of cooperation in investigating firearms ending up at crime scenes in Mexico and on the Southwest border. Representative Cummings issued a report on June 29, 2011, discussing penalties for firearm straw purchases and gun control proposals related to gun shows and trafficking offenses. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a follow-up hearing on \"Operation Fast and Furious: The Other Side of the Border\" on July 26, 2011. A joint staff report revealed that ATF and DOJ leadership did not inform key officials about the investigation, leading to increased firearms in Mexico. The ATF Attach\u00e9 in Mexico City raised concerns about the implications of illegal firearms flow for both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officers and the public. Despite concerns, officials assured that the investigation was under control. Operation Fast and Furious involved 2,020 firearms, with some recovered in Mexico and the US. The investigation led to indictments of 20 individuals for straw purchasing and other offenses. Despite initial assurances, no additional arrests of high-level traffickers have been made. The House Committee recommended further action in the appropriations bill. The Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill recommended appointing an independent investigator to look into allegations against ATF regarding Operation Fast and Furious. The House committee urged DOJ and ATF to cooperate with oversight investigations, while the Senate committee emphasized that Operation Fast and Furious was just a small part of ATF's border operations. The Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act, 2012 does not call for an independent investigator, but urges DOJ and ATF to cooperate with congressional oversight. Following fallout from Operation Fast and Furious, U.S. Attorney Dennis K. Burke resigned, ATF Acting Director Melson was reassigned, and B. Todd Jones was appointed interim ATF Director. President Obama's nominee for ATF Director remains Andrew Traver. Representative Smith sent a second letter to Attorney General Holder on September 23, 2011. In 2011, Representative Smith expressed concerns about Operation Fast and Furious and the appointment of an acting ATF director who also served as U.S. Attorney for Minnesota. He questioned how the director could fulfill both roles. Smith asked the DOJ about potential staff changes at ATF and why the U.S. Attorney resigned while ATF managers involved in Fast and Furious faced no discipline. The ATF's managers in charge of Fast and Furious faced no discipline. Questions were raised about the Department's oversight of the operation and Todd Jones' residency in Minnesota as the acting director of ATF. Representative Smith expressed concerns about the department's responses to inquiries and deliberate attempts to obscure facts about Operation Fast and Furious. Representative Smith raised concerns about the Department of Justice's attempts to obscure facts regarding Operation Fast and Furious. He disputed the department's claim that ballistic tests on rifles found at the murder scene of Border Patrol Agent Terry were inconclusive. Additionally, Smith mentioned an audio recording where a federal agent referenced a third firearm linked to the operation. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a subpoena for all communications related to Fast and Furious. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) in Phoenix, Arizona is involved in firearms trafficking cases. Representative Issa and CBS correspondent Sharyl Attkisson discussed the possibility of a third firearm found at Agent Terry's murder scene linked to Operation Fast and Furious. Representative Cummings has called for further investigation by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Representative Cummings has urged the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to hear testimony from former ATF Acting Director Melson regarding the controversial gun trafficking operation. Senator John Cornyn's amendment to the FY2012 minibus appropriations bill passed unanimously, prohibiting funding for criminal investigations that allowed firearms to be transferred to drug cartels without continuous monitoring by law enforcement. The Senate later passed H.R. 2112, including this provision. The conference report version of H.R. 2112 (H.Rept. 112-284), signed into law as P.L. 112-55, includes a provision prohibiting federal law enforcement officers from transferring firearms to individuals connected to drug cartels without continuous monitoring. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer testified about Operation Wide Receiver during a Senate hearing on International Organized Crime. Breuer testified about Operation Wide Receiver, where 350 firearms were allowed to \"walk.\" He failed to connect it to Operation Fast and Furious but called \"gun walking\" unacceptable. ATF processed 94,000 firearm trace requests for Mexican authorities, with 64,000 traced to the US. On November 4, 2011, nearly 700 firearms linked to Operation Fast and Furious were recovered, with 276 in Mexico and 389 in the United States. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary questioned Attorney General Holder about inaccurate information in a DOJ letter regarding ATF's tactics. Only about a quarter of the 94,000 firearms submitted for tracing were fully traced back to the first U.S. retail owner. The Attorney General stated that 64,000 firearms linked to Operation Fast and Furious were sourced to the United States. However, no additional information was given about the 25,000 firearms that were fully traced back to the United States. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole admitted inaccuracies in a letter to Senator Grassley and Representative Issa, leading to the withdrawal of the letter by the DOJ on December 8, 2011. On December 8, 2011, the House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on DOJ oversight regarding Operation Fast and Furious. Attorney General Holder testified about his knowledge of the operation, stating he had only heard about it recently. However, internal DOJ documents suggest that high-level managers were aware of and possibly directed the operation. Emails between ATF officials and the National Security Council also indicated updates on the operation. On January 31, 2012, Chairman Smith sent a letter to the Attorney General criticizing DOJ's handling of Operation Fast and Furious. He demanded a full account of the operation's approval and who knew about it. The House Oversight Committee held a hearing on February 2, 2012, questioning Attorney General Holder about possible false statements regarding the operation. Representative Cummings mentioned a report prepared by his staff. Representative Cummings highlighted ATF and U.S. Attorney's Arizona Office involvement in \"gun walking\" operations during Southwest border gun trafficking investigations. He mentioned three ATF investigations - Wide Receiver (2006-2007), Hernandez (2007), and Medrano (2008). He also called for former Attorney General Mukasey to testify, as the tactics originated during President George W. Bush's administration. Representative Lynch questioned DOJ oversight of investigative techniques like gun walking during a hearing. The issue at hand is the authorization of criminal activity by law enforcement agencies, leading to the death of agents and innocent civilians. It is concerning that FBI offices can approve such strategies outside the law. A proposed solution is for Congress to pass a law regulating the authorization of criminal activities by law enforcement. Attorney General Holder acknowledges the need for law enforcement to engage in illegal activities like undercover operations, but emphasizes the importance of proper approval processes to prevent abuse of power and ensure accountability. The Attorney General emphasizes the need for proper approval processes in law enforcement activities. Representative Connolly questions the need for tougher gun laws, while Chairman Issa notes the lack of gun control legislative proposals from the Obama Administration. The Attorney General did not comment on any gun control legislative proposals from the Obama Administration but expressed willingness to submit a proposal to Congress. Chairman Issa expressed frustration with the department, questioning why a former official invoked the Fifth Amendment. Representative Issa emphasized the importance of complying with the committee's subpoena for documents related to Operation Fast and Furious, stating that failure to do so is a violation of federal law. He released a staff briefing paper and draft resolution to cite Attorney General Holder in contempt of Congress for not cooperating with the subpoenas. The Department was accused of obstructing and slowing down the committee's work by issuing false denials and misleading answers. The Department has issued false denials, misdirected investigators, intimidated witnesses, unlawfully withheld documents, and acknowledged uncomfortable facts only when confronted with evidence. During House consideration of the FY2013 CJS Appropriations bill, amendments were passed addressing Operation Fast and Furious. Representative Trey Gowdy's amendment reduced the DOJ General Administration account by $1.0 million due to non-compliance with committee subpoenas. Another amendment by Representatives Jason Chaffetz, Paul Gosar, and Blake Farenthold aimed to prohibit the expenditure of any funding. On June 7, 2012, the House Committee on the Judiciary held a DOJ oversight hearing questioning Attorney General Holder about Operation Fast and Furious. On June 11, 2012, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform announced a meeting to consider holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to produce subpoenaed documents. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved a report to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for not producing subpoenaed documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. The House later approved a resolution citing the Attorney General with contempt by a vote of 255 to 67. The House approved a resolution (H.Res. 706) authorizing the committee to enforce subpoenas in judicial proceedings by a vote of 258-95. Supporters of the contempt resolution emphasized government transparency and accountability in relation to Operation Fast and Furious, citing the lack of document disclosure by the Department of Justice. The House approved a resolution authorizing the committee to enforce subpoenas in judicial proceedings by a vote of 258-95. Supporters of the contempt resolution emphasized government transparency and accountability in relation to Operation Fast and Furious, highlighting the delayed acknowledgment by the DOJ of guns being allowed to \"walk\" across the border. They argued that executive privilege was invoked to hide something, suggesting high-level officials embraced the risky investigative technique of gun walking in an attempt to build a major gun trafficking case. Opponents of the contempt resolution dismissed it as \"election-year political theater\" and defended Attorney General Holder against unjust disparagement. The Attorney General Holder has been open with the committee, providing over 7,600 pages of documents and testifying at nine congressional hearings on Operation Fast and Furious. The minority criticized the majority for not considering witnesses or hearings related to \"gun walking\" and \"gun trafficking.\" They called for a bipartisan investigation into past administrations' investigative techniques. Additionally, they highlighted the lack of proposals to strengthen gun laws and address criminal firearm trafficking in Mexico. The criminal appetite for firearms in Mexico, especially assault weapons acquired illegally from U.S. civilian gun markets, was highlighted. Representative Issa and Senator Grassley released Part I of their joint staff report on Fast and Furious, criticizing ATF tactics that compromised public safety and contributed to violent crime. The ATF's Operation Fast and Furious led to violent crime and death on both sides of the border. Part I of the report examines ATF supervisory officials' performance and the misinterpretation of case law by the Arizona U.S. Attorney's Office. Despite evidence of firearms trafficking to Mexico, no indictments were filed until after the death of Border Patrol Agent Terry. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that high-ranking officials in ATF headquarters and the Phoenix Field Division, as well as the U.S. Attorney's Office and Main Justice, were responsible for errors in judgment and management failures in Operation Fast and Furious. ATF agents chose not to confront straw purchasers and deferred enforcement actions, leading to illegal firearms transfers without legal intervention. The OIG found that ATF agents did not adequately consider the implications of the gun trafficking strategy, known as \"gun walking,\" on public safety. ATF headquarters failed to provide oversight despite the risks involved. The U.S. Attorney's Office and DOJ were not fully informed of the shift in strategy during Operation Wide Receiver. In contrast, during Operation Fast and Furious, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to ATF's strategy shift. During Operation Fast and Furious, ATF implemented a new strategy of allowing guns to walk, despite red flags in wiretap applications. DOJ reviewers failed to notice the risks to public safety posed by this practice. During Operation Fast and Furious, DOJ reviewers focused on legal grounds for wiretap applications rather than public safety concerns. They only read the agent's affidavit and overlooked concerns about the investigation. A trial attorney noted that guns sold in the operation were unaccounted for and likely in Mexico, leading to the belief that guns had \"walked.\" The DAAG and others suspected guns had \"walked\" during Operation Fast and Furious. Despite briefing the Assistant Attorney General about the issue, connections to Phoenix-based operations were not made. Former Attorney General Mukasey was not informed of potential flaws in Operation Wide Receiver. The joint staff report on Operation Fast and Furious revealed that Attorney General Holder was not informed of potential flaws during the investigation. Part II of the report examines interactions between DOJ officials and ATF headquarters. Part III will focus on alleged obstruction of the investigation by senior DOJ officials. The ATF and federally licensed gun dealers maintain transaction records that can trace firearms from manufacturer to first private owner. Successful traces have aided criminal investigations and provided data on trafficking trends. ATF supports Project Gunrunner with a Spanish-language eTrace program for Mexican authorities. Not all seized firearms are traced, with submissions more likely for those believed to originate in the United States. The ATF and federally licensed gun dealers maintain transaction records to trace firearms from manufacturer to first private owner. Problems persist with the quality, quantity, and timeliness of firearms trace requests made by Mexican authorities. Data on some firearms were submitted multiple times, leading to potential errors in the system. Despite challenges, trace data have been valuable in identifying trafficking trends and sources of firearms. The GAO recommended that the Attorney General direct ATF to update its reporting on firearms trace data and trends. Over 23,000 firearms were traced from FY2004 to FY2008 for Mexican authorities, with over 86% originating in the US. Most firearms traced in Mexico from FY2006 to FY2008 were from the US, with Texas, California, and Arizona being major sources. Mexican authorities submitted only a fraction of recovered firearms. In FY2008, only about 7,200 out of nearly 30,000 firearms recovered in Mexico were submitted to ATF for tracing. Mexican President Calderon revealed that 80% of the 75,000 seized firearms were traced back to the United States. ATF processed 78,194 trace requests for Mexican authorities from FY2007 to FY2010. The Embassy did not release the percentage of trace requests involving firearms from the US civilian market. A smaller percentage could be traced to the first private owner. Data on firearms with a short \"time-to-recovery\" or details on the most frequently traced firearms were missing. This information would have been valuable for trend analysis. In June 2011, ATF released limited trace data to the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, reporting that 70% of firearms recovered by Mexican authorities in 2009 and 2010 were either manufactured in or imported into the United States. Senator Grassley raised concerns about ATF's lack of detailed analysis on successful traces and the sources of illegal firearms in Mexico. Senator Grassley expressed concerns about the misleading focus on U.S. manufactured firearms in Mexico. He also highlighted the issue of unsubmitted firearms recovered by the Mexican Army for tracing. The flow of illegal guns into Mexico remains unclear, whether it is a gradual trickle over the years or a recent surge by Mexican DTOs seeking firearms from the U.S. civilian market. The majority of firearms submitted for tracing in the U.S. originated from the country, but only a small percentage could be traced back to the first private owner. Methodological limitations prevent using trace data as a proxy for all crime guns in Mexico or the U.S. While the U.S. could be a major source of crime guns in Mexico, trace data do not definitively prove this. Mexico submitted 78,000 firearms for tracing, but the actual percentage of these guns involved in crimes is unknown. Unknown percentages of firearms may have been illegally smuggled into Mexico over decades. Mexican DTOs are capable of acquiring military grade firearms from illicit international sources due to the profitability of the drug trade. The ATF is required to provide annual data on firearms recovered in Mexico for tracing purposes. ATF released limited trace data for firearms recovered in Mexico from 2007-2011. Out of 99,691 firearms submitted for tracing, 68.3% were U.S.-sourced. 27.9% of these U.S.-sourced firearms were traced back to the initial purchaser. In 2007-2011, ATF traced 68.3% of 99,691 firearms recovered in Mexico to the initial purchaser. 1.4% were exported to Mexico from U.S. gun dealers. The percentage of rifles submitted for tracing increased from 28.2% in 2007 to 58.6% in 2010, then decreased to 43.3% in 2011. The 112th Congress addressed veterans, mental incompetency, and firearms eligibility. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Disability and Memorials marked up and reported a veterans' benefits bill (H.R. 2349) on October 22, 2011. Representative Denny Rehberg successfully offered an amendment to the bill that would restrict the Department of Veterans Affairs from determining a beneficiary to be mentally incompetent for gun control purposes without a judicial authority's finding of danger. The full committee approved the bill on October 6, 2011, and the House passed it on October 11, 2011, including the Rehberg amendment. Senator Burr introduced a similar bill (S. 1707) on October 13, 2011. Senator Burr introduced a bill (S. 1707) on October 13, 2011, similar to the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act. Proponents argue that the current VA policy unfairly labels veterans as mentally defective, while opponents, like the Brady Campaign, believe the VA is acting in accordance with the law to ensure public safety. The VA's policy aims to protect veterans and others from potential harm by restricting firearm access. The ATF enforces laws on alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives, working with various partners to reduce crime. Congress typically funds ATF through the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2112; H.Rept. 112-284) funded ATF at its FY2011 level through November 18, 2011. The act provided ATF with $1.152 billion for FY2012, reflecting an increase of nearly $39.5 million from the previous year. The FY2013 budget request for ATF is $1.153 billion, a net increase of about $1.3 million. The FY2013 budget request for ATF is $1.153 billion, with no new budget enhancements but anticipates over $26.9 million in savings. The largest portion ($875.5 million) would be allocated to the firearms budget decision unit, followed by arson and explosives ($253.7 million) and alcohol and tobacco diversion ($23.1 million). The Administration's request includes proposals to remove futurity language from two ATF appropriations riders. The Administration's request includes proposals to remove futurity language from two ATF appropriations riders related to firearms records maintenance and electronic searching. The first rider prohibits ATF from consolidating or centralizing gun dealer records, while the second rider restricts electronic searches of out-of-business records by name or personal identification code. ATF can search these records electronically by firearm serial number but not by owner. The Administration's request aims to remove futurity language from ATF appropriations riders. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported an FY2013 funding measure providing ATF with $1.153 billion, but does not agree with removing the futurity language. Operation Fast and Furious is highlighted as part of ATF's Southwest border operations to reduce illegal gun trafficking to Mexico. The FY2013 funding measure for ATF includes provisions prohibiting certain firearm transfers and importation of shotguns, as well as restrictions on U.S. Attorneys holding multiple jobs. The House Committee on Appropriations approved a similar bill with $1.153 billion for ATF. The House FY2013 funding measure for ATF includes provisions prohibiting certain firearm transfers and importation of shotguns, as well as restrictions on U.S. Attorneys holding multiple jobs. The bill also includes futurity language in long-standing prohibitions related to ATF salaries and expenses appropriations. Representative Rehberg successfully offered an amendment to prohibit ATF from requiring multiple long gun sales reports. The House passed H.R. 5326 with amendments reducing ATF funding for FY2013 to $1.151 billion, slightly less than the FY2012 appropriation. The Administration requested $1.147 billion for ATF in FY2012, which would have funded positions and included budget enhancements for law enforcement electronic surveillance capabilities. Reductions were made in various areas, including the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN). The ATF budget for FY2013 included reductions in various areas such as the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN), training opportunities for law enforcement, and the alcohol and tobacco program. The remaining reductions would be achieved through administrative efficiencies. The budget allocation for firearms compliance and investigations received the majority of funding, with arson and explosives investigations and alcohol and tobacco diversion receiving smaller percentages. The FY2012 CJS appropriations bill allocated 22% to the arson and explosives investigations unit, with ATF receiving $1.111 billion, slightly less than the FY2011 amount. Amendments were made to the bill, including one prohibiting ATF from implementing an information collection initiative for gun dealers in Southwest border states. The FY2012 CJS appropriations bill allocated $1.111 billion to ATF, slightly less than the FY2011 amount. One amendment prohibited ATF from implementing additional restrictions on certain shotguns with non-sporting features. H.R. 2596 included language of \"futurity\" in firearms-related riders, similar to provisions in the enacted appropriation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported an FY2012 CJS appropriations bill with $1.09 billion for ATF, $22.3 million less than FY2011. The Senate folded S. 1572 into a Minibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2112) with several firearms-related amendments offered but not voted upon, including amendments by Senators Mark Begich, Orrin Hatch, and Dean Heller. Senator Hatch also offered three amendments to include language of \"futurity\" into firearms-related riders accompanying the ATF appropriation. The ATF appropriation in H.R. 2112 (P.L. 112-55) provided $1.152 billion for FY2012, with a 3.5% increase from FY2011. Senator Jon Tester's amendment overturned an ATF ruling on medical marijuana prescriptions and firearms possession. The bill includes language reflecting the Cornyn amendment, prohibiting federal officers from delivering firearms to known or suspected individuals. The FY2012 ATF appropriation bill includes language prohibiting federal officers from delivering firearms to individuals connected to drug cartels and makes three annual appropriation riders permanent law. These riders prohibit the consolidation of records by federally licensed gun dealers, ATF from retrieving firearm transfer records electronically, and the FBI from charging fees for Brady background checks. Additionally, the FBI must destroy approved firearm transfer records within 24 hours. The ATF appropriation bill prohibits federal officers from delivering firearms to individuals linked to drug cartels and makes three annual appropriation riders permanent law. It includes a provision preventing ATF from imposing extra restrictions on certain shotguns and requires ATF to report annually on firearm trace requests for Mexican authorities. The House Judiciary Committee considered a bill to extend expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, with an amendment proposed to allow the Attorney General to deny firearms transfers based on national security investigations. The Senate considered amendments to exempt certain firearms records from being obtained by FBI agents during FISA national security investigations. Senator Rand Paul's amendments were not included in the enacted legislation. Issues were raised about the Tucson shooter's mental illness and drug use following the shootings. Following the Tucson shooter's mental illness and drug use, concerns were raised about banning firearms near high-level federal officials. The FBI's NICS Index contains records of individuals prohibited from possessing firearms due to mental illness or drug addiction. Congress passed the NICS Improvement Act after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007. Following the Virginia Tech mass shooting in 2007, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act to incentivize the transfer of mental defective files to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS Index. The act did not focus on drug users, prompting calls for revisiting it to include records on both categories of prohibited persons. Mayors Against Illegal Guns released a plan to prevent tragedies like Tucson, calling for full funding of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act to help agencies and states gather and make records electronically available to the FBI. Following the Virginia Tech mass shooting in 2007, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act to incentivize the transfer of mental defective files to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS Index. Senator Charles Schumer introduced a bill (S. 436) to amend the act by advancing deadlines and providing deeper cuts to federal law enforcement assistance grant programs. Representative Carolyn McCarthy introduced an identical measure (H.R. 1781) to ensure disqualifying records, including those related to drug use or addiction, are electronically provided to the FBI. This aims to safeguard the rights of individuals listed in databases queried by NICS. On November 15, 2011, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism held a hearing on the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2011 (S. 436/H.R. 1781). The Tucson shooter was armed with a 9mm Glock 19 semiautomatic pistol loaded with 31 rounds in a 33-round extended magazine. He managed to fire at least 31 shots, killing 6 people and wounding another 13, including Representative Giffords. Representative McCarthy has introduced a bill related to firearms background check procedures. Representative McCarthy has introduced a bill to reinstate a ban on magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds (H.R. 308). Senator Frank Lautenberg has a similar bill (S. 32). Representatives Richardson and King have bills (H.R. 367 and H.R. 496) to restrict carrying firearms near federal officials. These bills are similar to the Gun Free School Zone Act of 1990. The ongoing firearms-related issues include screening background checks against terrorist watch lists, combating gun trafficking, reforming regulation of gun dealers, requiring background checks for private transfers at gun shows, regulating semiautomatic assault weapons, and banning certain long-range rifles. The shooting at Fort Hood in 2009 involved a suspect with ties to al-Qaeda. The Fort Hood shootings in 2009 involved a suspect with ties to al-Qaeda, raising concerns about the U.S. government's use of terrorist watch lists for firearms background checks. If the suspect had been watch-listed, his purchase of a pistol could have alerted FBI agents to prevent the shootings. The Brady background check process does not disqualify individuals as suspected or known terrorists from firearms eligibility. The National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS) queries three FBI databases to determine eligibility: the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Interstate Identification Index (III), and the NICS index. The NICS index includes disqualifying records not found in the III or NCIC, such as dishonorably discharged individuals, those adjudicated as mentally defective, or convicted of serious immigration violations. The III contains criminal history records for felonies and serious misdemeanors, while the NCIC contains information on fugitives and individuals subject to restraining orders. The NCIC contains files on fugitives, persons with restraining orders, and the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organization File (VGTOF). Prior to 9/11, VGTOF had limited information on terrorists and gang members. NICS examiners were not initially informed of VGTOF hits, but procedures changed in 2002 to include this information. The FBI-administered Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) was established in September 2003 for terrorist identification and screening. The FBI established the Terrorist Screening Center in September 2003 to improve screening mechanisms and merge watch lists into the Terrorist Screening Database. By 2007, the database contained over 100,000 records, which later split into separate gang and terrorist files. As of 2010, the Known and Appropriately Suspected Terrorists file included 278,219 watch list records. In 2003, the FBI was directed to include terrorist watch list checks in the Brady background check process. The check process now includes a terrorist watch list check, alerting NICS staff of potential matches. If a watch list hit occurs, NICS sends a delayed response for up to three days. If no prohibiting factors are found within three days, a firearms dealer can proceed with the transaction at their discretion. FBI counterterrorism officials continue to investigate for up to 90 days after approval. When a firearms transaction is approved, all identifying information is destroyed within 24 hours. After 90 days, if no issues are reported, all records are destroyed except for the NICS Transaction Number and date. If a disqualified applicant is found after the transaction, the ATF is notified for a firearms retrieval action. The Brady Act of 1994 did not initially consider using terrorist watch lists in background checks, leading to the FBI adopting procedures for this purpose. The FBI has adopted procedures to incorporate terrorist watch list checks into Brady background checks for firearms. Approved firearms transaction records are supposed to be destroyed within 24 hours, but the FBI has been retaining records related to terrorist watch list hits for up to 90 days. Information on these checks is passed on to FBI investigators in the field. It is unclear what happens to the information generated by NICS-related terrorist watch list checks. The FBI retains records of terrorist watch list hits from Brady background checks for up to 90 days, which are passed on to FBI investigators. There is uncertainty about the fate of this information and whether the FBI should have greater access to NICS records for counterterrorism purposes. Congress may need to consider granting the FBI more authority or strengthening existing limitations on accessing and maintaining these records. Congress may need to consider granting the Attorney General explicit authority to deny firearms transfers to watch-listed persons on a case-by-case basis or prohibit all known or suspected terrorists from possessing firearms and explosives. The Department of Justice has limitations under current law in using terrorist watch lists for background checks to prevent transfers to terrorists. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales faced questioning from Congress on this issue. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales faced questioning from Congress regarding NICS procedures and terrorist watch list hits. Representative Chris Van Hollen raised concerns about individuals being able to purchase firearms despite being on the watch list. Gonzales emphasized the need to prevent terrorists from obtaining weapons but acknowledged limitations in denying them firearms under current statutes. In 2005, Gonzales directed the DOJ to review federal gun policies. In 2005, Attorney General Gonzales directed the DOJ to review federal gun laws, focusing on NICS background checks and preventing firearms transfers to known or suspected terrorists. In 2007, DOJ proposed legislation to give the Attorney General authority to deny firearm transfers to individuals involved in terrorism. Bills were introduced in the 110th and 111th Congresses to address background checks and terrorist watch list checks, but no further action was taken. In 2005, Attorney General Gonzales directed the DOJ to review federal gun laws, focusing on NICS background checks and preventing firearms transfers to known or suspected terrorists. In 2007, DOJ proposed legislation to give the Attorney General authority to deny firearm transfers to individuals involved in terrorism. Senator Lautenberg and Representative King reintroduced their bill based on the DOJ draft proposal, while Representative McCarthy reintroduced her bill allowing the Attorney General to deny firearms to persons on the TSA's No Fly terrorist watch list. Senator Lautenberg also introduced a bill to allow the Attorney General to maintain NICS records on approved transfers related to terrorist watch list hits. GAO provided updated data on NICS-related terrorist watch list hits, renewing interest in the reintroduction of the DOJ draft proposal after the November 2009 Fort Hood shootings. The GAO issued a follow-up report on NICS-related terrorist watch list hits in May 2009, revealing that out of 963 background checks resulting in matches, 90% were allowed to proceed, with only one explosives transfer. The remaining 10% were denied based on various reasons, all involving firearms. GAO recommended giving the Attorney General discretionary authority to deny firearms transfers. The GAO recommended giving the Attorney General discretionary authority to deny firearms transfers or permits based on terrorist watch list hits. Representative King and Senator Lautenberg reintroduced the proposal as bills, known as the \"Terror Gap\" proposal. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on the threat of terrorists obtaining guns and explosives. From February 2004 to February 2010, there were 1,228 positive encounters with individuals on the terrorist watch list through NICS firearms or explosives transactions. These involved 650 individuals, with 450 involved in multiple transactions. Six individuals had 10 or more transactions. In 1,119 encounters, transactions were allowed, while 109 were denied. From March 2009 to February 2009, there were 272 positive encounters, all transactions allowed, including one with explosives. Senator Joseph Lieberman highlighted firearms used in terrorist plots by Muslim extremists, such as the Fort Hood and Little Rock shootings. In the context of terrorist watch list encounters in NICS transactions, there have been instances of individuals planning attacks on U.S. servicemen at various military bases. Senator Lindsey Graham opposed the Terror Gap proposal, arguing against denying firearms transfer based on a terrorist watch list record. In the 112th Congress, Senator Lautenberg and Representative King reintroduced the Terror Gap proposal, along with four other gun trafficking bills. Several proposals addressing gun trafficking have been introduced, including H.R. 2554, S. 1973, H.R. 4190, and H.R. 6195. While no further action has been taken, Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced the Stop Gun Trafficking and Strengthen Law Enforcement Act of 2011 (H.R. 2554) to establish a new federal offense for trafficking in firearms. The proposed provision in H.R. 2554 aims to establish new federal offenses for trafficking in firearms, including penalties of fines and imprisonment for those involved in transferring firearms unlawfully. Additionally, it would be illegal to conspire to violate these provisions, with penalties of fines and imprisonment. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2011 (S. 1973) to amend the Gun Control Act of 1968, creating a new federal offense for trafficking in firearms punishable by a fine and/or up to 10 years' imprisonment. It would be unlawful to knowingly transfer two or more firearms if it violates any law punishable by more than one year in prison. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2011 (S. 1973) introduced by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand creates a new federal offense for trafficking in firearms punishable by a fine and/or up to 10 years' imprisonment. It would be unlawful to knowingly transfer two or more firearms if it violates any law punishable by more than one year in prison. Violations of the act could result in fines and/or up to 20 years' imprisonment. An affirmative defense is available if the firearm transfer was done following a background check showing the buyer was not prohibited. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2011 (S. 1973) would make it illegal to conspire to traffic firearms, with penalties of a fine and/or up to 20 years' imprisonment. The proposal includes increased penalties for offenses involving different numbers of firearms, building on existing federal sentencing guidelines. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2011 (S. 1973) aims to impose more severe sentencing for offenders involved in trafficking firearms, including penalties for corrupt gun dealers. The bill would identify FFLs at risk of diverting firearms to criminal use based on specific criteria. The Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2011 aims to impose stricter penalties for gun trafficking, including penalties for corrupt gun dealers. It would identify dealers at risk of diverting firearms to criminals based on specific criteria. Additionally, the Straw Purchase Penalty Enhancement Act would create a mandatory minimum sentence for false statements in firearms transfer records. H.R. 6195, the Detectives Nemorin and Andrews Anti-Gun Trafficking Act of 2012, proposed creating a new \"gun trafficking\" crime under the GCA with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment for transferring two or more firearms to a prohibited person with intent to conceal their identity. The proposed legislation, H.R. 6195, aims to establish a new gun trafficking crime under the Gun Control Act (GCA) with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment for transferring multiple firearms to prohibited individuals to conceal their identity. This crime involves the sale, transfer, or barter of specific firearms, one of which must be stolen or have its serial number removed, and the other must be offered to someone prohibited from possessing a firearm. The bill proposed a new gun trafficking crime under the Gun Control Act with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment. It included provisions such as increased funding for Project Safe Neighborhoods, required reports on firearms tracing, and established a national instant stolen gun check system. The AG proposed a national instant stolen gun check system and made it illegal to possess a firearm with a removed serial number. The Senate Judiciary Committee postponed hearings on the Firearms Modernization Act. The proposed bill aimed to review ATF licensing decisions, establish guidelines for investigations, and define the \"willful\" standard of intent. Proponents believe it would help address recordkeeping issues for federal firearms licensees. Opponents argue it could weaken ATF authority and efforts to regulate dealers. The bill addressed various firearms-related issues including machine guns, firearms parts, and handgun possession by minors in the presence of a parent or legal guardian. Representatives Steve King and Senator Mike Crapo reintroduced the proposal in the 112th Congress. Federal law does not specifically regulate gun shows, but it does regulate firearms transfers at these events. Federal firearms licensees are required to conduct background checks on non-licensed persons seeking to obtain firearms from them, while non-licensed persons are not required to do so. The debate over federal regulation of firearms at gun shows revolves around the issue of background checks for private firearms transfers between non-licensed individuals. Some argue that this loophole in the law needs to be closed, while others see it as maintaining the status quo of non-interference by the federal government. Congress is considering whether to expand federal regulation to include private firearms transfers at gun shows and similar venues. In the 106th Congress, Senator Lautenberg successfully proposed an amendment to the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act. Variations of the Lautenberg bill were introduced in the 107th Congress, including by Representative Conyers and former Senator Daschle. Another model was introduced in the 107th Congress by Senators McCain and Lieberman, reintroduced in the 108th Congress by Senator McCain and Representative Michael Castle. Gun show language similar to the Lautenberg bill was included in the Justice Enhancement and Domestic Security Act of 2003. In the 108th Congress, Senator McCain passed a gun show-related amendment during consideration of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The bill was pulled from further consideration by Senator Larry Craig to avoid passage with gun control and assault weapons ban provisions. In subsequent Congresses, similar gun show proposals were reintroduced by Representative Castle, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Biden. In the 111th and 112th Congress, measures were introduced requiring background checks for private firearms transfers at gun shows. In 1994, Congress banned semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices for 10 years. The ban expired in 2004. The 1994 ban on semiautomatic assault weapons included specific characteristics like folding stock, pistol grip, bayonet mount, muzzle flash suppressor, and grenade launcher. Opponents argued these features were mainly cosmetic and not more lethal than other semiautomatic firearms. During and after World War II, assault rifles were developed for lighter infantry weapons with increased capacity and rate of fire. Detachable magazines were created to increase firing capacity. These rifles could be fired in fully automatic mode or in short bursts. Assault rifles were developed for lighter infantry weapons with increased capacity and rate of fire, allowing them to be fired in fully automatic mode or in short bursts. Semiautomatic firearms, including semiautomatic assault weapons, fire one round per trigger pull. Machine guns must be registered with the federal government and assembling one with legally or illegally obtained parts is illegal. Legally owned machine guns have been frozen since 1986 and were not covered by the semiautomatic assault weapons ban. In the 108th Congress, proposals were made to extend or make permanent the assault weapons ban, with modifications to the definition of \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" and an expanded list of banned firearms. Senator Feinstein introduced measures to make the ban permanent or extend it for 10 years, while an amendment to a gun industry liability bill aimed to extend the ban for 10 years as well. In the 109th and 110th Congress, various bills were introduced to reinstate or extend the assault weapons ban, including proposals by Senator Feinstein, Representative McCarthy, Senator Lautenberg, Representative Mark Steven Kirk, and Senator Biden. Additionally, measures were introduced to prohibit the transfer of semiautomatic assault weapons with large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. In response to the Tucson shootings, legislation was introduced to regulate .50 caliber rifles, which are seen as having little sporting or recreational purpose by gun control advocates. These rifles could potentially be used for destructive purposes, but opponents argue they are rarely used in crimes and were originally developed for marksmanship competitions. The Fifty Caliber Sniper Weapons Regulation Act of 2005 aimed to regulate .50 caliber sniper rifles by amending the National Firearms Act to impose taxes on manufacturing and transfers, as well as requiring registration. Another proposal, the 50 Caliber Sniper Rifle Reduction Act, sought to freeze the availability of these weapons to private individuals and prohibit further transfers. H.R. 654 aimed to freeze the availability of .50 caliber rifles to private individuals and prohibit further transfers, potentially leading to the eventual elimination of these rifles from civilian possession. The proposal did not include compensation for rifles that would have to be destroyed or handed over to the ATF. Opponents of legislation targeting .50 caliber handguns argue that the definition is too broad and could encompass rifles not intended for long-range or sniper use. Representative Moran proposed an amendment to prohibit funding for processing licenses to export .50 caliber rifles in the FY2006 Department of Commerce appropriations bill, but it was not adopted by the House. The 111th Congress revisited issues from the previous session, including amendments to DC voting rights bills. In the 111th Congress, gun-related provisions were passed, including laws on carrying firearms on public lands, transporting firearms on Amtrak trains, and widening law enforcement concealed carry privileges. Other provisions considered but not enacted included gun rights restoration for veterans and interstate reciprocity of concealed carry. In the 111th Congress, gun-related provisions were passed, including laws on carrying firearms on public lands, transporting firearms on Amtrak trains, and widening law enforcement concealed carry privileges. Other provisions considered but not enacted included gun rights restoration for veterans and interstate reciprocity of concealed carry. Additionally, the Supreme Court ruled the DC handgun ban unconstitutional in District of Columbia v. Heller, affirming an individual's right under the Second Amendment to possess a handgun in their home for self-defense. The DC Council passed an emergency law in 2008 allowing residents to keep a handgun in their home for self-defense, with restrictions on capacity and loading. Pro-gun groups criticized the law for not fully complying with the Supreme Court's decision. The DC Council passed an emergency law in 2008 allowing residents to keep a handgun in their home for self-defense, with restrictions on capacity and loading. Several temporary laws related to the Heller decision were passed by the DC Council. Representative Mike Ross introduced a bill to restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to limit DC Council's authority on firearms regulation, remove certain firearms from the definition of \"machine gun,\" amend registration requirements, repeal restrictions on ammunition possession, and eliminate penalties for possessing unregistered firearms. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to repeal penalties for possessing unregistered firearms in DC. Representatives negotiated to consider H.R. 6691, which aimed to address restrictions on lawful firearm possession in the District. On September 15, 2008, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee reported H.R. 6842. The House later amended H.R. 6842 with the text of H.R. 6691 and passed the Childers bill. On December 16, 2008, the DC Council passed the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008. Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the FCAA into law on January 28, 2009. This law amends the DC Code to adopt the federal definition of \"machine gun\" and prohibits the possession of certain firearms. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008, signed into law by Mayor Fenty on January 28, 2009, prohibits possession of certain firearms, including assault weapons and rifles capable of firing .50 caliber BMG rounds. It also requires microstamping on firearms made after January 1, 2011, and criminalizes possession of inoperable firearms and discharge of firearms. Senator John Ensign successfully amended the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 to change the waiting period to purchase a firearm from 48 hours to 10 days. This bill aimed to overturn certain DC gun laws and prevent the District from legislating in these areas in the future. The Senate passed the bill with a yea-nay vote of 61-37, while efforts were made in April 2010 to revive the voting rights bill with potential amendments to overturn the city's gun laws. Amendments were introduced to overturn DC's gun laws, leading to the postponement of further consideration of the DC voting rights bill. Senator John McCain and Representative Travis Childers introduced stand-alone bills, while Representative Mike Ross proposed a bill to restore Second Amendment rights in DC. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago affirmed the individual right to possess firearms for self-defense under the Second Amendment, impacting state and local government's ability to prohibit. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago affirmed the individual right to possess firearms for self-defense under the Second Amendment. While the Chicago handgun ban was limited, the delineation of permissible gun laws will likely be developed in future cases. The city of Chicago has adopted handgun regulations similar to those in the District of Columbia, allowing eligible residents to register one operable handgun per household, but with restrictions on carrying it outside the home. Senator Tom Coburn successfully amended the Credit CARD Act of 2009 to allow private persons to carry firearms on public lands. Senator Tom Coburn successfully amended the Credit CARD Act of 2009 to allow private persons to carry firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on May 22, 2009. This amendment passed by a vote of 67 to 29 on May 12, 2009. Previously, in the 110th Congress, Senator Coburn offered an amendment that would have overturned federal regulations prohibiting visitors from possessing loaded firearms in parks and wildlife refuges managed by the National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service. In the 1980s, many states passed laws allowing concealed handguns for personal protection. 48 states have \"concealed carry\" laws, with 24 allowing concealed handguns in state parks. In 2008, the Department of the Interior proposed regulations to authorize loaded and concealed firearms on public lands, receiving around 90,000 comments. Final regulations allowing loaded and concealed firearms on public lands were issued on December 10, 2008, taking effect on January 9, 2009. However, a preliminary injunction was issued on March 19, 2009, in response to a lawsuit by three groups. The NRA filed a notice to appeal the injunction on March 20, and Senator Coburn introduced a bill similar to the proposed regulations. Supporters cited a rise in illegal activities and violent crime on public lands, while opponents raised concerns about the risk of violent encounters in National Parks and Wildlife areas. In the 111th Congress, measures were introduced to allow loaded and concealed handguns in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges. Senator Roger Wicker amended a bill to permit firearms in checked luggage on Amtrak trains. The amendment passed and was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. The 111th Congress passed amendments to the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) to clarify and expand eligibility. Amtrak was required to report to Congress on a \"checked firearms program\" within six months of enactment, with guidelines to be implemented within a year. Checked firearms must be in a locked container, and passengers must declare their intentions to carry firearms in their luggage. Similar requirements apply to ammunition in checked luggage. The 2010 LEOSA amendments clarified and expanded eligibility for certain law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms across state lines while off duty. Senator Leahy introduced the bill in the Senate, which was later passed and signed into law in October 2010. The amendments also included provisions for Amtrak and executive branch law enforcement officers to be eligible for concealed carry privileges. The 2010 LEOSA amendments expanded concealed carry privileges for certain law enforcement officers, reducing the service criterion from 15 to 10 years. Similar bills were introduced in previous Congresses, with provisions also included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Congress included language in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; P.L. 111-148) to prohibit data collection on gun ownership or higher premiums for gun owners under wellness program provisions. Gun Owners of America (GOA) opposed a Senate health care reform proposal, arguing that it would require doctors to provide \"gun-related health data\" to a national health information network, potentially leading to denial of firearm permits. The GOA was particularly concerned about mental health records and the possibility of insurance providers raising premiums for individuals. The Senate proposal did not include provisions for the national collection of \"gun-related health data\" despite addressing electronic data transaction standards for health information sharing. It is uncertain if the Department of Health and Human Services would have collected such data due to existing laws prohibiting firearm registry establishment. The Senate proposal did not include provisions for a database of gun-related health data or raising insurance premiums on gun owners. It did include provisions for wellness programs to reduce healthcare costs, which could potentially address risks associated with firearms ownership. The Senate included new language in their healthcare proposal, prohibiting the collection of information on lawful firearm possession, use, and storage. This language was passed as an amendment to H.R. 3590 on December 24, 2009. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 prohibits the collection of information on lawful firearm ownership, possession, use, or storage. It also prohibits health insurance providers from penalizing individuals with firearms for coverage or premiums. Individuals are not required to disclose firearm information under the act. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (P.L. 111-383) includes provisions prohibiting the collection of information on privately owned firearms by military personnel and their families off-base. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was passed to enhance firearms-related background checks following the Virginia Tech tragedy. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, signed into law on January 8, 2008, strengthens the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act by requiring federal agencies to provide relevant records for firearm eligibility checks. It also incentivizes states to share disqualifying records, such as domestic violence convictions and mental health adjudications, with the Attorney General. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 incentivizes states to share firearm disqualifying records with the Attorney General, allowing for waivers or reductions in law enforcement grants based on compliance. Introduced as H.R. 2640 by Representative McCarthy, it passed the House in 2007 and was later included in the School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2004 by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, included in S. 2084, faced divided support due to concerns over privacy, cost, and gun rights implications for veterans with PTSD. Senator Coburn placed a hold on the legislation, citing these issues. Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America raised opposition, claiming the amendments could permanently revoke gun rights for veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Under current law, veterans or other VA beneficiaries deemed mentally defective due to posing a danger to themselves or others are ineligible to possess firearms. A PTSD diagnosis alone does not disqualify individuals from gun ownership. The NICS improvement amendments allow VA beneficiaries to appeal for administrative relief to restore their gun rights if they can show they no longer have a disqualifying condition. Senator Burr successfully amended the Veterans' Medical Personnel Recruitment and Retention Act in the 110th Congress to address this issue. Senator Burr introduced the Retention Act of 2008 (S. 2969) to protect veterans, surviving spouses, and children from being deemed mentally defective under the Gun Control Act without a judicial finding of danger. He later introduced the Veterans' 2nd Amendment Protection Act (S. 3167) and reintroduced it in the 111th Congress as S. 669. Representative Jerry Moran also introduced a similar bill (H.R. 2547). In 2009, Representative Jerry Moran introduced bill H.R. 2547, similar to the Retention Act of 2008. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee approved a provision by Representative John Boozman in 2010, included in bill H.R. 6132. However, an amended version of H.R. 6132 excluded the Boozman provision. The term \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" includes a determination of danger to self or others due to mental illness or incompetency. The term \"mental defective\" includes a finding of insanity in a criminal case, incompetence to stand trial, or not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility. This definition was established by the ATF in 1997, with input from the VA regarding mental incompetence in veterans. The ATF proposed that \"mentally incompetent\" be included in the definition of \"mental defective\" to align with the 1968 Gun Control Act. The VA referred 88,898 beneficiaries to the FBI as mentally incompetent for financial management, appointing fiduciaries to handle their VA benefits. The VA referred beneficiaries to the FBI as mentally incompetent for financial management, appointing fiduciaries to handle their VA benefits. Beneficiaries were advised of their right to appeal any final rating regarding their ability to manage VA benefits, but were not always informed of the consequences on their gun rights. The Veterans Medical Administration has not submitted disqualifying records to the FBI for inclusion in NICS for medical/psychiatric reasons like PTSD. Veterans with PTSD who have been involuntarily committed to a VA medical facility are ineligible to possess firearms. The VA's decision to submit VBA records on \"mentally incompetent\" veterans to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file sparked controversy in 1999 and 2000. Critics argued that veterans were not always informed of the consequences on their Second Amendment rights when consenting to \"mentally incompetent\" determinations for fiduciary appointments. The controversy surrounding the VA's submission of records to the FBI for the NICS mental defective file resurfaced during Congress's consideration of the NICS improvement amendments. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that the VA accounted for 99.2% of mental defective files referred to the FBI by federal agencies. Some Members of Congress found it inconsistent that other agencies, like the Social Security Administration, provided few firearms disqualifying records to the FBI for mentally incapacitated beneficiaries. The controversy surrounding the VA's submission of records to the FBI for the NICS mental defective file resurfaced during Congress's consideration of the NICS improvement amendments. Some Members of Congress viewed the VA's referral of firearms-related disqualifying records on veterans with fiduciaries as an unjustified indignity, while others argued that public safety is enhanced by making those referrals. Opposition to the VA policy waned between November 1998 and the 2007 congressional debate. Opposition to the VA policy on firearms possession by veterans with mental incompetency waned between November 1998 and the 2007 congressional debate. The VA's policy aims to protect veterans and others from potential harm if firearms were acquired and misused due to mental incompetency. In the 110th Congress, a bill was passed related to public housing administration. The bill, H.R. 6216, addressed gun-related provisions in public housing administered by HUD through local PHAs. It prohibited fees for enforcing gun restrictions but allowed for lease termination if a tenant illegally used a firearm. This provision was a compromise from a previous bill, H.R. 3521, which was sent back for further consideration. In the 111th Congress, a new version of the public housing bill (H.R. 5829) was introduced without the lease termination proviso. The Financial Services Committee reported the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 3045) with an amendment preventing authorities from prohibiting firearms in public housing. Another housing bill (H.R. 4868) with a similar provision was approved in July 2010. The Senate considered an amendment (S.Amdt. 1618) for national reciprocity on concealed carry in July 2009. In the 111th Congress, an amendment for national reciprocity on concealed carry was narrowly defeated by a recorded vote of 58-39. Senator Thune introduced a similar bill, the Respecting States Rights and Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2009 (S. 845), addressing the issue of concealed carry under state law. The Thune amendment aimed to require \"may issue\" states to honor permits issued by \"shall issue\" states, potentially allowing residents of Alaska and Vermont to carry concealed firearms in other states. National concealed carry laws lack uniform eligibility criteria and training standards. The Protecting Gun Owners in Bankruptcy Act of 2010 was introduced to allow individuals to exempt a single firearm from their estate in bankruptcy, with a value limit of $3,000. In the 112th Congress, a similar measure was introduced. The 111th Congress also considered legislation regarding funding for the ATF to enforce federal laws related to firearms. The ATF is responsible for enforcing laws related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. The President's FY2011 budget request included $1.163 billion for ATF, with proposed increases for Project Gunrunner and Emergency Support Function #13. The Attorney General is responsible for ESF-13 under the National Response Framework. The Attorney General is responsible for ESF-13, which involves law enforcement planning for the US. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.163 billion for ATF in FY2011, matching the Administration's request. The 112th Congress finalized the ATF appropriation for FY2011. The 112th Congress finalized the FY2011 ATF appropriation, providing $1.113 billion. The FY2010 request included funding for Southwest border enforcement and a National Center for Explosives Training. Congress appropriated $1.121 billion for ATF in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. The FY2010 ATF appropriation bill, signed into law on December 16, 2009, included funding for Project Gunrunner, Violent Crime Impact Team program, NCETR construction, and ATF headquarters projects. Additionally, a supplemental appropriations bill in 2010 allocated funds for Southwest border gun trafficking investigations. The House introduced a new border security bill (H.R. 6080) on August 9, which was passed on August 10. It contained language from Senate-passed H.R. 5875. The Senate passed H.R. 6080 on August 12, and the President signed it into law on August 13, providing ATF with an additional $37.5 million for Project Gunrunner. Southwest border gun trafficking has increased due to drug trafficking organizations vying for control of smuggling corridors into the United States. In March 2008, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n urged the US to suppress gun trafficking into Mexico. The House passed a bill authorizing $73.5 million over three years to increase ATF resources for this purpose. Similar authorizations were included in other bills in subsequent Congresses. Representative Todd Tiahrt introduced funding restrictions on ATF and FBI in the FY2004 DOJ appropriations bill. The Tiahrt restrictions, included in the FY2004 DOJ appropriations bill, prohibit ATF from disclosing firearms trace data for purposes other than criminal investigations, restrict new regulations for licensed dealers, require next-day destruction of Brady background check records, and mandate data disclaimers for firearms tracing studies. These restrictions have been controversial, especially regarding the disclosure of firearms trace data. The Tiahrt limitations on firearms trace and multiple handgun sales report data have been a source of debate. Senator Richard Shelby amended the FY2008 CJS appropriations bill to include similar limitations, which were also included in the House-passed CJS appropriations bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. This has been contentious, with mayors advocating for access to such data to identify illegal gun traffickers. The FY2008 limitation on firearms trace data sharing was modified to allow ATF to share data with tribal and foreign law enforcement agencies for national intelligence purposes. The limitation also permits sharing data with law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, and releasing aggregate statistics on firearms traffickers. The limitation, made permanent law, prohibits the release of data for suing gun manufacturers and dealers. Congress has included similar limitations in FY2009, FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 appropriations bills. The Gun Control Act has undergone changes since 1968, including the Firearms Owners' Protection Act and the Armor Piercing Ammunition Ban. These amendments eased interstate transfer requirements for long guns, defined \"engaged in the business,\" and prohibited certain types of ammunition. The Federal Energy Management Improvement Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-615) mandates orange plugs on toy firearms. The Undetectable Firearms Act (P.L. 100-649, amended by P.L. 108-174) bans firearms undetectable by security devices. The Gun-Free School Zone Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-647) was initially ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires background checks for non-licensed firearm buyers. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned certain firearms and ammunition sales, and prohibits handgun possession by juveniles without parental consent. The Federal Domestic Violence Gun Ban disqualifies persons under court orders related to domestic abuse from possessing firearms. It also increased penalties for criminal use of firearms. The assault weapons ban expired in 2004. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act of 1999 requires federal firearms licensees to offer gun storage and safety devices and bans firearms transfers to certain individuals. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishes a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, transferring law enforcement functions to the Department of Justice. The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms, overriding state-level prohibitions. The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms, overriding state-level prohibitions. However, it does not override federal laws or state laws that permit private entities to restrict firearms possession on their property. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act prohibits certain lawsuits against firearms manufacturers and dealers related to criminal use of their products. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 authorized funding for ATF and included provisions on \"armor-piercing\" ammunition and handgun transfers. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 requires the ATF Director to be appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Disaster Recovery Personal Protection Act of 2006 amended legislation related to the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 (P.L. 109-295) amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to prohibit federal officials from seizing firearms during a disaster if not already prohibited by law. It also forbids officials from prohibiting possession of firearms not otherwise prohibited and bans restrictions on carrying firearms for those providing disaster relief under federal agencies."
