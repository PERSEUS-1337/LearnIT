After the enactment of the Act, no roads can be built in scenic areas, except for access to private lands. Timber harvest is prohibited, except for fire control and public safety. Motorized travel is not allowed.

Wildfires in the scenic area will be suppressed, and insect and disease outbreaks may be controlled to maintain scenic quality and protect private lands. The Secretary of Agriculture administers scenic areas to maintain water quality. Federally owned lands in the scenic areas are withdrawn from mining activities, subject to valid existing rights. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a trail plan for National Forest System lands to develop hiking and equestrian trails in wilderness areas and nonmotorized recreation trails in scenic areas. Within two years of enactment, a report on the implementation of the trail plan will be submitted to Congress."
