    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act\" and includes findings related to climate change. Congress finds that the average annual temperature in the United States and globally has increased by approximately 1.0 degree Fahrenheit since the start of the 20th century, with an accelerated rate of warming in the past 30 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a further 0.72 degrees Fahrenheit increase in the next 2 decades. Additionally, the United States faces new security challenges, including environmental destruction, as stated in the 2006 national security strategy report. The new security challenges highlighted in the 2006 national security strategy report include environmental destruction caused by human behavior or natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. These challenges may exceed the capacity of local authorities and national militaries, necessitating a larger international response. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a temperature increase of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius could lead to a sea level rise of 2 to 4 meters by 2100 due to melting ice sheets. The impact of climate change on human health and water availability is significant. By 2100, a temperature increase of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius could lead to a sea level rise of 2 to 4 meters due to melting ice sheets. Over 200 million people live in coastal floodplains, with $1 trillion worth of assets at risk. Additionally, 1.7 billion people live in water-scarce areas, a number projected to increase to 5.4 billion in 25 years, affecting the hydrological cycle. Environmental changes related to global climate change can exacerbate competition and conflict over resources, leading to hunger, poverty, and pressure on fragile countries. The consequences of climate change are likely to have significant impacts on societies with scarce resources and inadequate infrastructure. The consequences of global climate change, particularly in less developed countries, pose a clear danger to national security and the economy of the United States. Failure to address these impacts could have adverse effects on the country's strategic, social, political, and economic interests. SEC. 3. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. The Director of National Intelligence must submit a National Intelligence Estimate on the geopolitical effects of global climate change and its implications on US national security within 270 days of the enactment of the Act. If unable to meet this deadline, Congress must be notified with reasons and an estimated new submission date. The Director of National Intelligence is required to prepare a National Intelligence Estimate on the risks posed by global climate change for countries of strategic importance to the US or at risk of humanitarian suffering. The estimate must be based on the mid-range projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report. The National Intelligence Estimate must assess risks posed by global climate change, including conflict over resources, displacement of populations, food insecurity, and health risks. It should also evaluate countries' abilities to respond to these impacts, strategic challenges for the US, and security implications for the economy. The National Intelligence Estimate will assess the United States economy's engagement with major greenhouse gas emitters to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. Coordination with scientific, security, economic, and environmental experts is required for improved national security planning. The National Intelligence Estimate will assess the engagement of the United States economy with major greenhouse gas emitters to reduce emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. It will involve coordination with various government agencies, scientific experts, and allies to enhance national security planning. The report will be submitted in unclassified form, with key judgments included, and may have a classified annex. SEC. 4. RESPONSE TO THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the projected impact of global climate change on military installations and operations, as assessed in the National Intelligence Estimate. The National Intelligence Estimate recommends research on the military impacts of global climate change. Congress urges the Secretary of Defense to address these findings in the next Quadrennial Defense Review. The Secretary of State must report on the implications of global climate change on the Armed Forces within 270 days of the National Intelligence Estimate submission. The United States House and Senate committees request a report on the potential impacts of climate-induced migration on national security and diplomatic opportunities for policymakers. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF RESEARCH. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to conduct research on the impacts of global climate change on military operations, including war gaming, analysis of Arctic sea-ice melt, abrupt climate change, and strategic implications for defense capabilities. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to conduct research on the impacts of global climate change on military operations, including war gaming, analysis of Arctic sea-ice melt, abrupt climate change, and strategic implications for defense capabilities. This includes analyzing direct physical threats to the United States posed by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and assessing the Department of Defense's policies to protect against climate risks to US capabilities and military interests in foreign countries. A report on the results of the research and activities must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the National Intelligence Estimate submission. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Such sums as necessary are authorized to carry out this Act."
