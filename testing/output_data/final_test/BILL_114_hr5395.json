The Act, known as the \"Expanding Capacity for Health Outcomes Act\" or the \"ECHO Act,\" defines terms such as health professional shortage area, medically underserved area, medically underserved population, Secretary, and technology-enabled collaborative learning and capacity building model. The technology-enabled collaborative learning and capacity building model connects specialists with primary care providers through interactive videoconferencing for case-based learning and outcome evaluation. SEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS ON TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING AND CAPACITY BUILDING MODELS. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, will examine technology-enabled collaborative learning models to improve patient care and provider education, focusing on mental health, substance use disorders, chronic care for all ages, and complex care. The Secretary and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration will address various healthcare challenges, including complex care for vulnerable patients, primary care workforce support, specialty care shortages, public health programs, disease prevention, rural healthcare, advanced care planning, trauma-informed care, pregnancy care, and other health conditions. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, will conduct a study on technology-enabled collaborative learning models in healthcare settings, consulting with public and private stakeholders. This study will be published within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The study on technology-enabled collaborative learning models in healthcare settings will analyze the use and impact of these models on health provider retention, shortages, continuing medical education, and barriers to adoption. It will also assess the impact on local health providers and specialists. The Comptroller General of the United States will prepare a report on technology-enabled collaborative learning models in healthcare. The report will analyze the use of these models by health providers, the support provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the impact on patient care quality. The report will analyze technology-enabled collaborative learning models in healthcare, focusing on their impact on patient care quality, successful adoption reasons, barriers to adoption, cost savings, funding sources, and opportunities for increased adoption in Department of Health and Human Services agencies. The report will analyze technology-enabled collaborative learning models in healthcare to address mental health, chronic care, primary care workforce, specialty care shortages, and public health programs. The report will address disease prevention, health care in rural areas, advanced care planning, trauma-informed care, pregnancy care, and maternal health. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 18 months, detailing how the findings have been addressed and providing recommendations based on the report. The report will include recommendations to Congress based on study findings, a list of funded technology-enabled collaborative learning models, and a toolkit on best practices for implementing these models in states."
