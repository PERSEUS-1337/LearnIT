    "content": "The Act titled as the \"Comprehensive Child Health Immunization Act of 1993\" aims to improve child health through immunization. Congress finds that immunizations are cost-effective in preventing disease. While school immunization requirements have led to high immunization levels in school children, many children do not receive their basic immunizations before their second birthday. The low level of childhood immunizations has led to outbreaks of measles among inadequately immunized preschool children. The private infrastructure for immunization services has eroded due to the high cost of privately purchased vaccines, which can exceed prices in other industrialized nations by over 2500 percent. The high cost of vaccines has led to a decline in childhood immunizations, with private physicians referring patients to public clinics. Some states offer free vaccines, while others struggle to establish similar programs due to manufacturers denying discounted vaccines. The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment report supports negotiated rates for fair compensation to vaccine manufacturers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has experience in negotiating vaccine purchases. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program should be applied to additional vaccines recommended for universal use in children to ensure full immunization. The Federal Government should purchase and provide vaccines for children free of charge to remove financial barriers to immunization and facilitate the development of an immunization tracking system. The Government and States should develop linked registries to track children's immunization status and notify parents of inadequately immunized children. The national information and education outreach initiative should be sustained to provide necessary information on childhood vaccines. Health insurers should offer adequate reimbursement for vaccine administration. Community activities should promote full immunization of children. The purpose of this Act is to ensure full immunization of children in the United States against vaccine-preventable diseases at the earliest appropriate age. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program should be extended and improved, and vaccine information materials should be simplified for parents to understand the benefits and risks of vaccines. Federal Purchase of Childhood Vaccines is established under Title XXI of the Social Security Act, allowing the Secretary to purchase vaccines for children. The Secretary is required to regularly purchase recommended childhood vaccines in amounts necessary for distribution in the US, for outbreak control, and to maintain a 6-month reserve supply with minimal waste. The Secretary may consult with various stakeholders before soliciting bids for recommended childhood vaccines under this section, including State governments, vaccine delivery experts, and healthcare providers to estimate future dosage needs. States with Federal grants for immunization registries must report data to the Secretary. The Secretary shall consult with federal agencies to determine appropriate vaccines and amounts to be purchased. Consultation may involve a Vaccine Requirements Panel or other means as deemed appropriate. The Secretary negotiates reasonable prices for vaccines, considering various costs and excise tax. Manufacturers must provide cost or pricing data when responding to procurement requests. The Secretary negotiates reasonable prices for vaccines, considering various costs and excise tax. Manufacturers must provide cost or pricing data when responding to procurement requests, including research and development costs, production costs, shipping, delivery costs, marketing costs, and profit levels to encourage future investments in vaccine development. Maintaining adequate capacity for outbreaks is also a factor. The Secretary negotiates reasonable prices for vaccines, considering various costs and excise tax. Manufacturers must provide cost or pricing data when responding to procurement requests, including research and development costs, production costs, shipping, delivery costs, marketing costs, and profit levels to encourage future investments in vaccine development. Information provided to the Secretary for outbreak control shall be treated as confidential. The Secretary establishes procedures to maintain confidentiality of information provided by manufacturers to Congress. Contracts for childhood vaccines purchased under this section must include a provision prohibiting additional shipping or handling charges. The Secretary ensures confidentiality of manufacturer information provided to Congress and prohibits additional charges for shipping or handling in contracts for childhood vaccines purchased under this section. Multiple manufacturers may be contracted to ensure a reliable supply and stimulate competition. Reporting requirements are standardized for vaccine purchases. The manufacturer must report vaccine destination data to the Secretary and States at specified intervals. Funding for the program will be available from the Comprehensive Child Immunization Account. A Comprehensive Child Immunization Account will be established in the Treasury of the United States to fund activities under section 2101 of the Social Security Act. Receipts will be credited to the account as provided in Federal law. The program under section 2101 will end when Federal law provides immunization services for all children as part of a national health care reform. Requirements for child immunizations under state Medicaid programs. The text discusses amendments to the Social Security Act regarding coverage of immunizations under EPSDT and reimbursement rates for recommended childhood vaccines. Amendments to the Social Security Act include reimbursement for the administration of recommended childhood vaccines to providers. Amendments to the Social Security Act now include reimbursement for recommended childhood vaccines. The Secretary is required to create a list of recommended vaccines for children by October 1, 1994, with dosage and age recommendations. Effective dates for amendments to the Social Security Act regarding vaccine reimbursement are specified. The State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments. Failure to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session does not constitute non-compliance with the Act. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is amended to increase the fund amount and extend the authority to impose taxes for the program. The tax imposed by section 4131 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is reinstated effective April 1, 1993. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a national immunization tracking system to involve all healthcare providers once the relevant section of the Social Security Act expires."
