The \"Eva M. Clayton Fellows Program\" is established by the Secretary to provide fellowships for research and education on eradicating world hunger and malnutrition. Selected faculty members, known as Clayton Fellows, will serve for two years conducting research or education programs in this field. During the first year of service, each fellow will be placed in a specific location. During the second year of service, Clayton Fellows may serve at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations or continue serving at their qualified institution. Travel is also included during the fellowship term. A Clayton Fellow awarded a fellowship may travel for work on eradicating world hunger and malnutrition. To apply, a faculty member must submit a resume, research plans, and institution certification. The faculty member selected as a Clayton Fellow will maintain their faculty status, benefits, and position at the institution. Priority may be given to faculty members at land-grant colleges. Each Clayton Fellow must submit a report to the Secretary after completing a year of service. The Clayton Fellow must submit a report to the Secretary after a year of service, including a description of research and education programs, self-assessment of program effectiveness, evaluation of Fellow Proteges, and best practices for eradicating world hunger and malnutrition. Upon completion of the fellowship, the Clayton Fellow must submit an evaluation to the Peace Corps program. The Secretary may terminate a fellowship at any time. Each Clayton Fellow must select at least one student to assist in research and education programs on eradicating world hunger and malnutrition. The section discusses the assistance provided by a Fellow Protege to a Clayton Fellow working on eradicating world hunger and malnutrition. The Protege can travel as needed to support the Fellow in their work. Each eligible student seeking to assist a Clayton Fellow must submit an application with documentation from the Peace Corps Master's International program and proof of enrollment. The application should also explain how the student's academic work relates to the fellowship program. The selection process for Fellow Proteges involves consulting with the Secretary and may prioritize students from land-grant colleges. After completing their term, each Fellow Protege must submit a report detailing the assistance provided to a Clayton Fellow in research or education programs. The Fellow Protege must submit a report on their assistance to a Clayton Fellow, including a self-assessment, evaluation of the Fellow, best practices for eradicating world hunger, and any other required information. A Clayton Fellow can terminate the assistance term at any time. The President directs the UN to establish fellowship positions for Clayton Fellows to research and educate on eradicating world hunger. The Secretary consults with the UN on selecting Clayton Fellows. The Secretary awards grants for administration. The Secretary awards a grant to a nonprofit organization to administer the fellowship program for Clayton Fellows and Fellow Proteges. The organization must be associated with a specified institution of higher education and meet certain tax-exempt criteria. Grant funds can only be used for expenses related to the program. The Fellow Protege payment covers expenses for eradicating world hunger and malnutrition, including housing, accommodations, and travel. At the end of the term, scholarship assistance is provided either as a lump-sum payment to the institution or upon graduation. Upon completion of the term as a Fellow Protege, loan repayment assistance is provided for loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965 in the form of a lump-sum payment to the loan holder or the Secretary of Education. The fellowship program established under subsection (a) allows for loan repayment assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965, with funds administered by the organization awarded the grant submitting an annual assessment to the Secretary of Education. The organization receiving funds for the fellowship program must submit an annual assessment to the Secretary of Education, including details on funds received, effectiveness of activities, non-Federal funding, best practices, and any other required information. If the Secretary finds that a grant recipient did not follow program guidelines, they can revoke funding, accept applications from other entities, and transfer revoked funds to eligible recipients. The Secretary can revoke funding from a grant recipient for not following program guidelines and transfer the funds to an eligible entity selected through applications. Definitions include eligible faculty member, eligible student, and qualified institution. The term 'qualified institution' refers to an institution of higher education or a land-grant college or university. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2018 for this section. The first assessment under this section must be submitted within 30 days after the first fellowship awarded ends."
