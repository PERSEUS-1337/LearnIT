    "content": "Section 1201 of the Electric Reliability Act of 2005 establishes the short title. Section 1211 requires the creation of a FERC-certified electric reliability organization (ERO) to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system, including cybersecurity protection. The ERO would have the authority to impose penalties on users, owners, or operators of the bulk-power system. The Electric Reliability Act of 2005 establishes the ERO's authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system. FERC can impose penalties for violations and order compliance with standards. FERC cannot mandate construction of additional capacity but may establish a regional advisory body if requested by two-thirds of states in a region. The Electric Reliability Act of 2005 authorizes the ERO to enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system. H.R. 6 would require the ERO to be funded by utility contributions, with a limit of $50,000,000 annually through 2015. The CBO determined that these contributions would be an unfunded mandate on the private sector and local government utilities. The Electric Reliability Act of 2005 authorizes the ERO to enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system. H.R. 6 sets a $50,000,000 annual limit on funding for the ERO through 2015. This limit aims to avoid a budget resolution point of order and restricts the cost of the mandate to prevent UMRA considerations. The ERO's budget cap may apply to both U.S. and Canadian utilities' contributions. The Electric Reliability Act of 2005 authorizes the ERO to enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system with a $50,000,000 annual funding limit through 2015. The CBO estimates that complying with intergovernmental mandates could exceed thresholds due to future damage awards under the bill's safe harbor provision. Section 1211(c) authorizes up to $50 million per year for activities under the Federal amendment. The Electric Reliability Act of 2005 authorizes the ERO to enforce reliability standards for the bulk power system with a $50 million annual funding limit through 2015. The proposed legislation aims to provide federal jurisdiction over activities necessary to support the reliability of the U.S. bulk power system, with FERC having authority to establish and regulate the ERO for improved reliability. Giving FERC central jurisdiction over the ERO is seen as a way to increase accountability. Establishing central jurisdiction under FERC for reliability issues would improve accountability. FERC would enforce penalties if the ERO's measures fail. This new relationship aims to enhance coordination between market and reliability functions. Despite some opposition, giving FERC authority over bulk power system reliability could lead to uncertainty as FERC relies on the ERO's expertise. The proposed changes in institutional structure would give FERC authority over the siting of interstate electric transmission facilities. The Secretary of Energy would conduct studies on transmission congestion every three years, allowing FERC to issue construction permits in designated congested areas. Stakeholders can provide input on proposed permits, and permit holders can petition for rights-of-way through eminent domain. The new FPA Section 216(g) addresses compensation for takings of private property for transmission facilities on federal lands. It allows the Department of Energy to coordinate environmental reviews and grants them authority for rights-of-way and siting decisions on federal lands. The Department of Energy has authority for rights-of-way and siting on federal lands, allowing input into decision processes. Section 503 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act review could be streamlined using prior analyses. If a federal agency denies authorization for a transmission facility, the applicant or state can appeal to the Secretary of Energy, who must issue a decision within 90 days. States can form interstate compacts for siting transmission facilities, with the Secretary of Energy providing technical assistance. This provision does not apply to ERCOT. Third-Party Finance allows WAPA and SWPA to participate in transmission projects within their regions if designated as National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors. Projects must reduce congestion or accommodate increased demand, consistent with RTO or ISO needs. Up to $100 million from third-party financing can be used from 2006 to 2015. Under current law, power marketing administrations may face restrictions on third-party financing for transmission facilities. Section 1223 requires a study on implementing a transmission monitoring system for Eastern and Western interconnections. Section 1224 directs FERC to promote advanced transmission technologies deployment. Section 1225 of H.R. 6 in the 108th Congress mandates the Secretary of Energy to implement a program focusing on electric transmission system reliability and efficiency. Reports on the program's five-year plan and progress must be submitted to Congress within one and two years of enactment, respectively. The Secretary of Energy is also directed to establish a high-temperature superconductivity research initiative with appropriations authorized for FY2006 through FY2010. A program would be established to provide incentive payments to owners or operators of advanced power generation systems, including fuel cells, turbines, or hybrid power systems. An annual appropriation of $10 million would be authorized for FY2006 through FY2012. Additionally, an Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution would be established to improve electric transmission distribution. The Department of Energy's National Transmission Grid Study recommendations are being implemented to support federal energy policy related to electricity transmission and distribution. FERC may require unregulated transmitting utilities to charge rates comparable to what they charge themselves and have terms and conditions similar to other utilities. Currently, federal power marketing administrations, state entities, and rural electric cooperatives are not subject to FERC's ratemaking. Exemptions are established for utilities selling less than 4 million megawatt-hours of electricity per year, distribution utilities, and utilities that own transmission facilities not necessary for a nationwide interconnected system. FERC may remand transmission rates to an unregulated transmitting utility if rates do not comply. FERC cannot order unregulated utilities to join a Regional Transmission Organization. This section is known as \"FERC-lite.\" Section 1232 establishes a sense of Congress that utilities should voluntarily join regional transmission organizations. Section 1233 requires FERC to report to Congress on the progress of regional transmission organization applications within 120 days of enactment. FERC must report to Congress within 120 days of enactment on the status of all regional transmission organization applications. Federal utilities would be allowed to participate in regional transmission organizations, with a repeal of a law allowing them to study formation and operation. FERC's proposed rulemaking on standard market design would be sent back for reconsideration, with no final rulemaking allowed before October 31, 2006. FERC's proposed rulemaking on standard market design aims to establish seamless wholesale power markets by requiring transmission owners to turn over operation to an independent transmission provider. This would allow for easier transactions across transmission grid boundaries. Under the proposed rulemaking, an independent transmission provider would manage energy markets and address congestion through locational marginal pricing. The comment period for the NOPR was extended to January 10, 2003, to address various issues including market design, transmission pricing, and state participation. FERC would assert jurisdiction over all power transmission, which has been contested by commissioners from 15 states. State regulators from 22 states and the District of Columbia released a statement in support of FERC's effort to address discrimination in the transmission system for a competitive bulk power market. Industry groups have expressed concerns about the implementation of FERC's proposal, which was clarified in a White Paper issued by FERC staff in response to formal comments. FERC's White Paper clarifies changes to its proposed rule, stating utilities must join an RTO or ISO, not an Independent Transmission Provider. The final rule will not assert new FERC jurisdiction over bundled retail sales, addressing concerns from state officials. It also eliminates the requirement for a minimum level of resource adequacy and the auctioning of Firm Transmission Rights. Each RTO or ISO must have a cost recovery policy outlined in its tariff. The Department of Energy analyzed the impact of the SMD NOPR on wholesale electricity prices and the safety of generation and transmission facilities. DOE used economic models to quantify the price impacts, assuming a 1.8% annual increase in electricity demand from 2005 to 2020. The Department of Energy assumed a 1.8% annual increase in electricity demand from 2005 to 2020. In the SMD case, a 5% increase in transmission capability by 2005 was assumed, along with potential savings from factors like control area consolidation. The Department of Energy estimates a 10% savings from efficiency improvements due to the SMD, with a median cost of $760 million per year. Costs vary by region, ranging from 47 cents to 12 cents per megawatt-hour. Regions with existing RTOs incur zero additional costs. Retail rate effects of SMD depend on state regulations. The Department of Energy found that regions with cost-based rates may see increased costs from wholesale purchases, while regions with retail choice may experience lower prices due to utility revenues from exports. In areas like California, increased imports are expected to result in lower wholesale prices and consumer prices. Overall, DOE projects a net benefit of about $1 billion per year for all consumers by 2020. The Department of Energy projects a net benefit of $1 billion per year for all consumers by 2020, with varying retail price changes by region. The mid-Atlantic region expects a 4% decrease, while Illinois, Wisconsin, and Arizona anticipate a 3% increase in retail prices due to SMD. Section 1236 clarifies load-serving entity rights under the Federal Power Act, protecting existing customer service obligations. The curr_chunk discusses the language in Section 201 of the Federal Power Act, giving FERC jurisdiction over transmission of electric energy and wholesale sales. It also clarifies that reserving transmission for existing customers is not unduly discriminatory. Additionally, Section 1237 involves a study on the benefits of Economic Dispatch conducted by the Secretary of Energy in consultation with states. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with states, must report annually to Congress on the status of economic dispatch, defined as operating generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost. FERC is required to establish incentive-based transmission rates to promote reliable and efficient electric transmission and generation. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to increasing transmission capacity, recovering costs for reliability standards, and implementing incentive rate-making for utilities joining a Regional Transmission Organization. It also addresses the requirement for states to consider implementing net metering standards within three years. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of smart metering standards for electric utility customers, including time-based pricing rate schedules. It also mentions the requirement for state regulatory authorities to investigate and decide on the adoption of these standards within a specified timeframe. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary of Energy's role in consumer education on advanced metering technologies and addressing barriers to demand response programs. It also mentions FERC's requirement to assess demand response resources annually by region. Additionally, it includes a provision for real-time pricing and time-of-use metering standards. The curr_chunk discusses the repeal of the mandatory purchase requirement under PURPA for new contracts if FERC finds a competitive electricity market exists. Ownership limitations under PURPA would also be repealed. The oil embargoes of the 1970s led to the enactment of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) required utilities to purchase power from outside sources at their \"avoided cost\" to promote more efficient electricity generation. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) allowed qualifying facilities (QFs) to use natural gas and new generating technology, lowering barriers to entry into the electricity generation business. The Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) lowered the financial threshold for entering the electricity generation business and shortened lead times for constructing new plants. After FUA was repealed in 1987, nonutility generators gained a portion of the electricity supply, challenging cost-based rates. The enactment of PURPA led to FERC approving wholesale transactions based on competitive bidding, known as market-based rates, marking a shift towards a market-oriented approach to electricity supply. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) removed regulatory barriers for electricity generation, increasing competition. EPACT does not allow FERC to mandate retail wheeling, leaving it under state jurisdiction. Proponents of PURPA repeal are mainly investor-owned utilities in the Northeast and California. The PURPA repeal is supported by investor-owned utilities in the Northeast and California, arguing that the current law's mandatory purchase obligation is outdated and anti-competitive. Opponents, including independent power producers and environmental groups, argue that PURPA introduced competition in the electric generating sector and promoted the use of cleaner fuels. Opponents of PURPA repeal argue that it would decrease competition in the electric generating sector and impede the development of renewable energy. State regulators are concerned that repealing \u00a7210 would limit their jurisdiction. Each state regulatory authority and nonregulated utility should consider establishing an interconnection standard for on-site generating facilities. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 sets timelines for enactment and completion. It includes definitions for various entities and repeals the 1935 Act. Opponents of PURPA repeal fear decreased competition and hindered renewable energy development. State regulators worry about jurisdictional limitations. The Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regulates holding companies of investor-owned utilities, requiring SEC approval for mergers and financial transactions. Companies can be exempt if operations are within one state or contiguous states. The electricity industry is historically considered a natural monopoly due to cost trends, high investments, and technological barriers. The electric utility industry has evolved, with a growing belief that market forces can replace traditional economic regulatory structures. Evidence from utilities like cooperatives and publicly owned ones shows that vertical integration is not necessary for efficient service. Recent changes in regulation and technology have allowed for more competition in the industry. Recent changes in electric utility regulation and improved technologies have enabled independent firms to provide additional generating capacity instead of utilities. The Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act of 1935 established a regulatory regime for electric utilities, with specific powers given to states and the federal government. Utilities must provide electricity at regulated rates in exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory. State regulatory commissions oversee intrastate utility activities, with varying levels of authority. The state regulatory body oversees utility operations and establishes retail electric prices through an adversarial hearing process. Federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates for electric power flowing in interstate commerce to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of states to regulate interstate commerce. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has primary functions for economic regulation in the electric utility industry at the federal level, including wholesale rate regulation, transmission transactions, and ensuring reliable service. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates utilities' corporate structure and business ventures to prevent abusive practices. The electric utility industry has undergone transformation in the past two decades, with advancements in technology reducing generation costs and sizes. Advancements in technology have reduced electricity generation costs and facility sizes, leading to a shift towards small-scale production facilities. This has lowered barriers to entry and allowed non-utility entities to build profitable facilities. Electric utilities are advocating for changes to the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) to diversify their assets and improve their risk profile. Electric utilities argue that diversification under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) would help mitigate investment risks and optimize resource utilization. There has been bipartisan support for repealing parts of PUHCA, but concerns arose after Enron's collapse. The Securities and Exchange Commission has suggested that many PUHCA provisions are outdated or redundant with existing regulations. State regulators have expressed concerns about increased diversification leading to abuses like cross-subsidization, which was a major argument against exempt wholesale generators (EWGs) and further changes to PUHCA. Non-utility ventures in electric and gas companies may benefit from regulated utilities' allowed rates. Opponents fear that utilities could avoid penalties for failed ventures by increasing retail rates, leading to concerns about PUHCA repeal exacerbating market power abuses in the monopolistic industry. Consumer and environmental groups, along with state legislators, have expressed worries about the potential consequences. Federal access to books and records of holding companies and their affiliates would be provided under Section 1264. Federal officials would have to maintain confidentiality of books and records of affiliate transactions. Registered holding companies and subsidiary companies must preserve necessary records for public interest or investor protection. State commissions can request access to specific confidential books and records from holding companies. This provision does not apply to entities solely owning qualifying facilities. Under the Federal Power Act, state commissions can request access to specific confidential books and records from holding companies. This provision does not apply to entities solely owning qualifying facilities. Compliance with this section would be enforceable in U.S. District Court. The Federal Power Act allows state commissions to access confidential books and records from holding companies, excluding qualifying facilities. FERC retains authority to prevent cross-subsidization and ensure just and reasonable rates. The provision does not apply to the U.S. government, states, or foreign governmental authorities operating outside the U.S. Section 1269 states that FERC or state commissions can still protect utility customers under other applicable laws. Section 1270 gives FERC authority to enforce these provisions, while Section 1271 allows individuals to continue legal activities they are authorized to engage in. Section 1272 requires FERC to implement regulations within 12 months and recommend any necessary amendments to federal law. Section 1273 mandates the transfer of applicable books and records from the Securities and Exchange Commission to FERC. No specific timeframe for the transfer is provided. The Securities and Exchange Commission currently maintains books and records and regulates security transactions. A provision in H.R. 6 in the 108th Congress included a similar requirement. Section 1274 states that this subtitle would take effect twelve months after enactment. Section 1275 requires FERC to review and authorize cost allocations for non-power goods or services provided by an associate company. FERC must issue rules within six months to exempt companies operating in a single state. Section 1281 of the bill requires FERC to establish market transparency rules within 180 days of enactment, including an electronic system for information on wholesale electric energy and transmission services. Disclosure exemptions are allowed for information that could harm market operations or system security. FERC must ensure consumer protection in competitive markets by preventing collusion or anti-competitive behaviors due to untimely disclosure of transaction-specific information. The section does not affect the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Market transparency rules were included in the conference report of H.R. 6 in the 108th Congress. It would be unlawful to file a false report on electricity prices. It is illegal to engage in round-trip electricity trading to manipulate reported data. Laws also prohibit filing false reports on electricity prices to fraudulently affect federal agency data. Additionally, mail and wire fraud statutes apply to schemes aimed at obtaining money or property through false pretenses. The Federal Power Act would be amended to allow electric utilities to file complaints with FERC and to increase criminal and civil penalties. Criminal penalties could include a fine of up to $1 million and/or five years imprisonment, with an additional fine of $25,000. Civil penalties could reach $1 million per day per violation for certain sections of the Act. The Federal Power Act may be amended to increase penalties for violations of certain sections, including criminal penalties of up to $1 million and/or five years imprisonment, and civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. Refunds for rates would have an effective date starting at the time of complaint filing with FERC, with a deadline of five months for FERC to make a decision. If FERC does not meet this deadline, it must provide reasons for the delay. Section 1285 of the conference report of H.R. 6 in the 108th Congress outlines the refund authority of FERC for entities engaging in short-term sales of electricity. This authority applies to non-public utility entities involved in sales lasting 31 days or less, excluding electric cooperatives and entities selling less than 8 million megawatt hours annually. FERC can also oversee voluntary short-term sales by Bonneville Power Administration if rates are deemed unjust and unreasonable. Additionally, FERC has authority over power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley. FERC would have authority over power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority to order refunds for just and reasonable rates. Section 1286 of the Federal Power Act allows FERC to modify or abrogate contracts if it is in the public interest. Section 1287 authorizes the FTC to issue rules against slamming and cramming. The Federal Trade Commission would be authorized to issue rules to prohibit slamming and cramming, where an electric utility switches a customer's provider without permission or adds services and charges without consent. State regulations would apply if they offer equal or better protection than FTC regulations. Additionally, a study on FERC's merger review authority would be conducted to eliminate any unnecessary duplication within 180 days of enactment. FERC would be required to issue an annual report to Congress on merger conditions under Section 203(b) of the Federal Power Act. FERC's review authority for asset transfers over $10 million would be expanded, with notice to state commissions and governors. Currently, FERC reviews asset transfers valued at $50,000 or more under Section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act. Section 1295 of the bill amends definitions under the Federal Power Act, adding terms like electric cooperative and commission. Section 1298 directs FERC to study \"security constrained economic dispatch\" through regional boards chaired by FERC members. Within a year, FERC must submit a report to Congress on the recommendations of these boards. The curr_chunk discusses the Four Corners Transmission Line Project, which would provide grants to develop a transmission line from the Four Corners Area to southern Nevada. It also mentions the continuation of a transmission security order allowing the Cross Sound Cable to transmit electric power. Additionally, a 24-mile 330-megawatt transmission cable was installed in 2002. In 2002, a 24-mile 330-megawatt transmission cable was installed beneath Long Island Sound between Connecticut and Long Island. The cable was not buried to specified depths, leading to objections from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CDEP). Cross-Sound, the cable owners, filed a new permit application with CDEP in June 2003. In 2003, a new permit application for the transmission cable was filed with the CDEP. Governor John Rowland signed a bill extending a prohibition on permits for infrastructure crossings. An emergency order was issued by Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham to energize the cable after a widespread blackout in August 2003. The order was rescinded in May 2004, and the cable was re-energized by an agreement reached on June 25, 2004. FERC would assess the impact of exempting electric cooperatives and government-owned utilities from FERC ratemaking regulations every five years. If adverse effects on consumers or electric reliability are found, FERC would make recommendations to Congress."
