    "content": "The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" may be cited as the Act. It amends Title 17, United States Code, by adding a new chapter for the protection of vessel hull designs. The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" adds a new chapter to Title 17, United States Code, for the protection of vessel hull designs. This chapter includes definitions such as the meaning of 'vessel hull' and 'plug' for the purpose of exact duplication. The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" introduces definitions for vessel hull designs, including terms like 'mold' and 'commercially exploit'. The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" defines terms related to vessel hull designs, such as 'commercially exploit' and 'owner' of a plug or mold. An 'innocent purchaser' is also defined as a person who buys a vessel hull. The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" defines terms related to vessel hull designs, such as 'innocent purchaser,' 'notice of protection,' and 'infringing vessel hull.' It also outlines the eligibility requirements for protection of an original plug or mold fixed in a vessel hull. The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" outlines the eligibility requirements for protection of an original plug or mold fixed in a vessel hull, including conditions related to commercial exploitation in the United States or under a Presidential proclamation. The \"Boat Protection Act of 1996\" allows foreign nations to extend protection to plugs or molds owned by US nationals or domiciliaries, or those first commercially exploited, on similar terms as their own nationals. The President can also extend protection under this chapter to plugs or molds meeting certain criteria. The Boat Protection Act of 1996 allows foreign nations to protect plugs or molds owned by US nationals or domiciliaries, or those first commercially exploited in that nation. Protection is not available for non-original plugs or molds with commonplace designs, and does not extend to ideas or processes embodied in the plug or mold. Sec. 1203 of the Boat Protection Act of 1996 states that the exclusive rights in a plug or mold shall vest in the owner, and these rights can be transferred through various means. Conflicting transfers of these rights are resolved by giving priority to the transfer made for valuable consideration and without notice of previous transfers, unless the first transfer is recorded within 3 months. Sec. 1204 of the Boat Protection Act of 1996 outlines the duration of protection for plugs or molds. Protection begins when the plug or mold is commercially exploited and lasts for 10 years. Plugs or molds created by a U.S. Government employee are not protected, but the government can still receive exclusive rights if transferred under specific conditions. Sec. 1205 grants exclusive rights to the owner of a plug or mold, allowing reproduction by various means, importation or distribution of vessel hulls, and inducing others to do the same. Sec. 1206 limits these rights by allowing reverse engineering for reproduction purposes. The owner of a plug or mold can reproduce it for teaching, analyzing, or evaluating purposes. The owner of a vessel hull can sell it without permission. Innocent purchasers of infringing vessel hulls incur no liability for previous importation or distribution. The immunity from liability for innocent purchasers of infringing vessel hulls extends to subsequent purchases made directly or indirectly from an innocent purchaser. Liability for importing or distributing infringing vessel hulls after notice of protection is limited to a reasonable royalty based on wholesale cost, determined through negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or court action. Sec. 1208 of the vessel hull protection law states that the owner of a plug or mold can affix notice to the plug or mold or the vessel hull to provide reasonable notice of protection. Affixing notice is not required for protection but serves as evidence of notice. Sec. 1209 of the vessel hull protection law outlines the enforcement of exclusive rights for plug or mold owners. It states that infringers will be liable for violating these rights, and owners can take civil action against infringement. The notice required for protection includes specific details like the words 'plug or mold', the year of fixation, and the owner's name or abbreviation. The Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Postal Service will issue regulations for enforcing the right to import under section 1205. To exclude articles from the US, individuals must obtain a court order or proof that the plug or mold is protected and importation would infringe rights. The importation of articles that infringe on rights in the plug or mold under this chapter may result in seizure and forfeiture. Forfeited articles will be destroyed unless it is proven that the importer had no reasonable grounds, in which case they may be returned to the country of export. \"Secretary of the Treasury stated that importers must not have reasonable grounds to believe they were violating the law. Courts can grant injunctions to prevent infringement of exclusive rights in a plug or mold. Owners can receive actual damages and profits from infringers, with proof required only for the infringer's profits.\" The owner of the plug or mold can choose statutory damages instead of actual damages and profits. The amount awarded can be up to $250,000. The prevailing party in an infringement action may recover full costs, including attorneys' fees. The Copyright Act allows for the recovery of full costs, including attorneys' fees, for the prevailing party in an infringement action. An action for infringement must be brought within 3 years of the claim accruing. The court may order the destruction of infringing articles as part of the final judgment. This chapter does not affect rights under other laws and references to title 17 do not apply to this chapter. The provisions of this chapter preempt state laws regarding rights and remedies for plugs or molds, effective for actions filed on or after January 1, 1998. Title 28 provisions apply to exclusive rights in plugs or molds under this chapter. The table of chapters of title 17, United States Code, is amended to include protection of vessel hulls designs. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on January 1, 1997. Appropriations are authorized as necessary to carry out this Act and its amendments."
