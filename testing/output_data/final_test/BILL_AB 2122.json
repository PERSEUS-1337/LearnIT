    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Education Code in California is being amended to address the severe teacher shortage in the state. The Legislature acknowledges the need for highly qualified teachers and the growing demand for new teachers. California currently has a high pupil-to-teacher ratio and will require 60,000 additional teachers to maintain current levels. If the state were to reduce the ratio to the national average, 135,000 more teachers would be needed. To address the teacher shortage in California, 135,000 additional teachers are needed to return to a pupil-to-teacher ratio of 16 to 1. Enrollment in teacher credentialing programs dropped by 76 percent between 2002 and 2014. 40 percent of credentials in 2014 and 2015 were awarded to underprepared teachers. The teacher workforce in California lacks diversity, with 65 percent white, 20 percent Hispanic, and 15 percent other races. Classified school employees could potentially fill the shortage and are the most diverse group in the school community. Providing incentives for classified school employees to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree and become fully credentialed teachers is a proven strategy to increase the number of highly qualified teachers in California\u2019s schools. The California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program aims to support school districts or county offices of education in this endeavor. The California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program supports classified school employees in becoming fully credentialed teachers. Participants are noncertificated school employees working in public schools. Teacher training programs are offered by institutions of higher education approved by the commission. The California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program aims to recruit classified school employees for teacher training programs leading to a teaching credential for kindergarten to grade 12 instruction. The commission will issue a request for proposals to school districts and county offices of education in California to solicit applications for funding teacher training programs. Selection criteria will include the capacity to accommodate classified school employees in these programs. The applicant's recruitment program must involve local campuses of participating institutions in developing coursework. The plan should address teacher shortages in kindergarten through grade 12. Selected employees must have completed two years of college coursework and show interest in obtaining a teaching credential. The applicant's recruitment program must involve local campuses in developing coursework to address teacher shortages. Selected employees must have completed two years of college coursework and show interest in obtaining a teaching credential. Participants must pass a background check and provide verification of earning an associate degree or higher. The applicant must have earned an associate degree or higher and completed at least two years of postsecondary education. Participants must commit to graduating with a bachelor's degree, obtaining a teaching credential, and completing one year of classroom instruction for each year of assistance received. The commission will contract an independent evaluator to assess teacher training programs every five years, starting before July 1, 2021. The evaluation results will be submitted to the Governor and education committees. The commission will report annually to the Legislature on the program's status, including the number of classified school employees recruited, their academic progress, employment as teachers, meeting teacher shortage needs, and participant demographics. The report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. The Legislature intends to allocate funding each fiscal year for the California Classified School Employee Teacher Credentialing Program, providing grants for up to 1,000 new participants annually. Each participant can receive a grant of up to $4,000 per year, contingent upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act."
