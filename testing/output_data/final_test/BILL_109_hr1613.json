The Act includes provisions for formula grants to states and funding agreements. The \"Healthy Early Education Workforce Act\" establishes block grants for affordable health insurance for child care providers under Title XIX of the Public Health Service Act. A funding agreement for a grant under section 1981 specifies that the State will use the grant to provide access to affordable health benefits coverage for eligible child care providers, their staff, and potentially their spouses, domestic partners, and dependents. Permissible activities include reimbursing employers or individuals for their share of premiums or other costs for health coverage. The funding agreement for a grant under section 1981 allows states to use the grant to provide affordable health benefits coverage for eligible child care providers and their staff. This includes offsetting costs for enrolling individuals in public health benefits plans and subsidizing health benefits coverage. States can establish criteria to limit providers and staff who may receive assistance under the grant. Highest priority is given to certain individuals for the grant. The State gives highest priority to eligible child care providers and their staff who received assistance in the previous fiscal year, and second highest priority to providers designated by a State licensing authority. The State prioritizes child care providers and their staff who received assistance in the previous fiscal year or are designated by a State licensing authority for funding under section 1981 grants. Matching funds from the State are required for non-Federal contributions. Non-Federal contributions must cover at least 50% of costs, can be in cash or in kind, and cannot include Federal assistance. State funds must supplement, not replace, other public funds for activities under this part. The application for a grant under section 1981 must be submitted with required information and funding agreements, providing assurances of compliance. The amount of the allotment is determined under section 1984. The Secretary reserves a portion of funds for territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations from the amount appropriated under section 1986. The remaining funds are allotted to states in each fiscal year. The Secretary allots funds to each State based on factors like young child and school lunch factors, after reservations for territories, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. The term 'young child factor' refers to the ratio of children under 5 in the State to all States, as per Census Bureau data. The 'school lunch factor' is the ratio of children receiving free or reduced-price lunches in the State to all States. The allotment percentage for a State is determined by dividing the per capita income. The allotment percentage of a State is determined by dividing the per capita income of all individuals in the United States by the per capita income of all individuals in the State. There are limitations on the allotment percentage, with a maximum of 1.2 percent and a minimum of 0.8 percent. Per capita income is calculated at 2-year intervals for this purpose. The per capita income for determining allotment percentages is calculated every 2 years based on data from the Department of Commerce. Excess funds not allotted to States due to non-submission of applications are reallocated. Excess funds not allotted to States are reallocated among remaining States in proportion to their original allotments for the fiscal year. SEC. 1985. DEFINITIONS.
