    "content": "The largest share of federal child welfare funding (about 88%) is provided to states to support children removed from their birth families due to abuse or neglect. This includes funding for children in foster care, those transitioning to adoptive families or legal guardians, and services for youth aging out of foster care. The remaining funds (about 12%) support child welfare services for children and families, including those in their own homes or in foster care, as well as research and demonstration projects. The Title IV-E program provides funding to states for children in foster care and those leaving for permanent homes through adoption or guardianship. The federal government reimburses states for part of the cost of providing support for children meeting Title IV-E eligibility criteria. The number of children in foster care has been declining, while the number leaving for adoptive homes has been increasing. This has led to a decrease in the funding needed to support children in foster care. The funding for children in foster care has been declining, with more support now going towards children in permanent adoptive or guardianship homes. Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of children aging out of foster care without placement in a permanent family. The funding for children in foster care has remained largely unchanged, with roughly 2% of overall federal funding dedicated to services for these youth. The share of federal child welfare funds provided to all states for child welfare-related services has stayed around 9% to 10%. These services aim to prevent child abuse and neglect, support families, reunite children in foster care with their families, promote adoption, and improve monthly caseworker visits for children in foster care. The federal funding for child welfare services aims to support children in foster care, improve caseworker visits, and enhance court proceedings. Grants under various acts and programs, including CAPTA, Children's Justice Act, and Title IV-B, provide funds to states. In recent years, incentive funding for adoptions and competitive grants have increased to about 3% of all federal child welfare funding. Funds for child welfare services support adoptions from foster care through competitive grant programs authorized under various acts, including Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, Victims of Child Abuse Act, and other legislation. The share of child welfare funding for supporting children after removal from birth families remained steady across FY2004, FY2008, FY2012, and FY2013. Funding amounts shown are in nominal dollars and include budget authority for Title IV-E program. The share of federal child welfare funding for foster care decreased by 10 percentage points from 64% to 54% across FY2004, FY2008, FY2012, and FY2013. Funding for children moving to adoptive homes increased from 22% to 32%. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) was signed into law on March 26, 2013, providing full-year funding for federal programs for FY2013. The full-year funding legislation (H.R. 933) was passed on March 6, 2013, providing $7.925 billion for federal programs in FY2013. However, due to an across-the-board rescission and sequestration order, child welfare funding was reduced to $7.868 billion. Most federal child welfare programs, except for Title IV-E Foster Care and Permanency, are subject to sequestration. This includes funding for formula grants, research, evaluation, incentives, and Education and Training Vouchers for youth aging out of foster care. The total funding for these programs was reduced due to sequestration orders. The funding for child welfare programs, including foster care, adoption, and services for youth aging out of foster care, was $6.863 billion in FY2012 and $6.777 billion in FY2013. Congress did not finalize FY2013 appropriations levels before the fiscal year began, leading to temporary funding under a continuing resolution. Programs receiving discretionary funding were generally maintained at FY2012 levels. The temporary funding measure for child welfare programs expired on March 27, 2013, with programs receiving discretionary funding supported at FY2012 levels plus 0.612%. The final FY2013 funding measure was enacted on that date (P.L. 113-6). The House and Senate did not complete action on full-year Labor-HHS-Education appropriations legislation for FY2013 before the close of the 112th Congress. In the 113th Congress, the Senate considered an amendment (S.Amdt. 53) to incorporate the Senate Appropriations Committee-approved measure into the final FY2013 funding bill, but the amendment was not approved. The House passed legislation (H.R. 5326) in May 2012 for full-year funding for Department of Justice-administered programs, while the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a similar measure in April 2012. Both measures included some funding for child welfare programs authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act. In the 113th Congress, funding for child welfare programs authorized by the Victims of Child Abuse Act was included in the FY2013 budget despite the President's proposal to eliminate funding for these programs. The Obama Administration's budget request anticipated $8.175 billion in federal support for child welfare programs, with final funding totaling $7.868 billion after sequestration and spending reductions. In FY2012, Congress allocated $8.009 billion for child welfare programs, with $7.386 billion in mandatory funds and $623 million in discretionary funds. The President's FY2013 budget request closely mirrored the funding provided by Congress in FY2012. The main difference in funding between FY2012 and FY2013 was due to changes in the Administration's estimate of funds needed for foster care, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. The President's FY2013 budget included funding for child welfare programs, such as financial incentives for states to improve the system and ensuring child support payments benefit children in foster care. Legislative authorization would be needed for these proposals. Additionally, funding was proposed to continue a survey of children in the child welfare system. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) was last funded in FY2011 under Section 429 of the Social Security Act. The Administration proposed competitive grants to reduce pregnancy among foster youth by repurposing funds from abstinence education. HHS estimated funding between $12 million and $15 million for these grants. The Administration also sought an increase in funds for research to prevent commercial sexual exploitation of children, but these proposals were not included in the final FY2013 funding measure (P.L. 113-6). The President's FY2013 budget sought to eliminate funding for three child welfare programs administered by the Department of Justice, but the final FY2013 funding measure included support for them. These programs received combined funding of $24 million in FY2012. The legislative proposals included in the President's budget aim to increase, eliminate, or redirect funding for certain child welfare programs. The Obama Administration requested $2.5 billion in additional funding over 10 years for incentive payments to States to improve child welfare services. Congress needs to enact legislative authority for HHS to administer the program and appropriate funds for it. The Obama Administration requested $2.5 billion in additional funding over 10 years for incentive payments to States to improve child welfare services, aiming to help vulnerable children achieve safety, permanency, and success in life. The Administration did not propose specific legislation but expressed willingness to work with Congress on reform proposals based on creating financial incentives for states to improve key outcomes for children in the child welfare system. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for incentive payments to States to improve child welfare services, aiming to help vulnerable children achieve safety, permanency, and success in life. This includes reducing the time children stay in foster care, increasing exits to permanency, decreasing child maltreatment recurrence, and improving well-being through proper oversight of medications and therapeutic services. The focus is on effective interventions, building capacity in child welfare and mental health systems, and training staff to address trauma and mental health needs. The goal is also to reduce administrative requirements while retaining focus on key outcomes for children in the foster care system. The Obama Administration sought legislation to require states to use child support payments in the best interest of children in foster care, rather than for general revenue or to reimburse the federal government. This proposal was not approved by Congress during the 112th Congress and was not included in the final FY2013 funding measure. States are currently required to return a portion of child support collected for children receiving federal foster care support, with the remaining funds used to cover the state's costs. The Obama Administration proposed legislation to end federal \"cost recovery\" of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, increasing federal costs by $2 million in FY2013 and $34 million annually when fully implemented. This change was intended to ensure that more child support payments reach the children they are intended for. However, the proposal was not introduced in Congress during the 112th Congress. The President's FY2013 budget sought to reinstate mandatory funding for research on children at risk of abuse or neglect. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being provides data on children and families in contact with child protective services. The FY2013 budget requested $6 million to support the second phase of the NSCAW study, which collects survey data on children and caregivers in contact with child welfare agencies. Longitudinal analysis will depend on the completion of data collection and analysis by the Administration. Funding for NSCAW was provided from FY1997 to FY2011. The FY2013 budget did not include funding for the NSCAW survey, despite previous funding from FY1997 to FY2011. The budget proposed changes in funding for child welfare programs and sought to redirect funds for abstinence education. The President's budget included $31 million for Child Welfare Research, Training, and Demonstration activities, $5 million more than previously provided. The FY2013 budget included $31 million for Child Welfare Research, Training, and Demonstration activities, with an additional $5 million for competitive grants to improve coordination for young victims of domestic sex trafficking. The grants aim to train staff across various entities to better identify and serve sexually exploited children. The Administration notes that approximately 100,000 children in the U.S. are victims of domestic sex trafficking each year. The new grant program aims to prevent and address commercial sexual exploitation of children, targeting areas with elevated rates of exploitation. The Administration proposed redirecting funds to support competitive grants for state and local child welfare agencies to reduce pregnancy among youth in foster care. This initiative is based on survey data showing high rates of pregnancy among female youth transitioning out of foster care. The Administration proposed redirecting funds to support competitive grants for state and local child welfare agencies to reduce pregnancy among youth in foster care. Strategies would include developing a comprehensive plan to expand the evidence base for preventing pregnancy using both abstinence and comprehensive approaches. The Administration proposed redirecting funds from Title V Abstinence Education to support competitive grants for state and local child welfare agencies to reduce pregnancy among youth in foster care. This would involve developing proven programs and unique approaches for the foster care population. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget proposed redirecting funds from Title V Abstinence Education to support competitive grants for state and local child welfare agencies to reduce pregnancy among youth in foster care. This would involve developing proven programs and unique approaches for the foster care population. Additionally, the budget proposed to end funding for the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program, Children's Advocacy Centers, and Child Abuse Training for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners. In FY2012, the Victims of Child Abuse Act programs received $24 million in funding, which was increased to $25 million in P.L. 113-6 after sequestration. The proposed elimination of funding for these programs in the President's FY2013 budget aimed to prioritize resources for the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs to support research, evidence-based programs, and vital criminal justice programs. The Administration's proposed Children Exposed to Violence Initiative could support programs previously funded by the Victims of Child Abuse Act. Local CASA programs, which train volunteers to represent children in child welfare cases, have received federal funds for about two decades. Funding for CASA was reduced in FY2012 but increased to $5.6 million in FY2013. Federal funding for the CASA program was increased to $5.6 million in FY2013 and extended at $12 million annually for FY2014-FY2018. Funding for the Child Abuse Training of Judicial Personnel and Practitioners is authorized under the Victims of Child Abuse Act, with support provided to the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges for Model Courts initiative in 27 states and the District of Columbia. The Administration proposed reducing funding for child abuse training for judicial personnel and practitioners in FY2012. Congress decreased funding to $1.5 million in FY2012 and $1.4 million in FY2013 after sequestration. However, funding was extended at $2.3 million annually for FY2014-FY2018 under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. The federal funding for Child Advocacy Centers (CACs) is authorized at $2.3 million annually for FY2014-FY2018 to support efforts in improving the investigation and prosecution of child abuse and neglect cases. This funding is aimed at preventing re-traumatization of child abuse victims and includes support for local CACs, regional CACs, training, and technical assistance. The National Children's Alliance (NCA) receives the funding and provides subgrants to create or maintain local CACs, while also serving as an accrediting body for these centers. The federally authorized regional Child Advocacy Centers provide training and technical assistance to local CACs. Despite the expiration of funding authority, Congress has continued to provide annual funding for CACs. The Obama Administration sought to eliminate funding for CACs in FY2013, but Congress provided $18.0 million. Final FY2013 funding for Children's Advocacy Centers and related training and technical assistance is $17.7 million after sequestration. The Title IV-E program is the largest federal support for child welfare programs, providing funding for foster care, kinship guardianship, and adoption assistance. This program is authorized indefinitely and is typically funded by Congress based on Administration estimates. The Title IV-E assistance program is an open-ended entitlement with indefinite funding authorization. States and tribes with approved plans are entitled to reimbursement for eligible program costs related to providing assistance for children who meet federal criteria. Each year, the Administration estimates the necessary funds for reimbursement, which Congress typically provides as part of the annual appropriations process. The Title IV-E funding program is an open-ended entitlement with indefinite funding authorization. If Congress provides more funding than needed, the excess funds are returned to the Treasury. Conversely, if the funding falls short, HHS can access additional funds. The caseload trend is crucial for estimating the required funds. The caseload trend is crucial for estimating the required Title IV-E funds. Changes in the authorizing statute and spending amounts reflect inflation. The overall caseload grew from 367,000 children in FY1995 to nearly 608,000 in FY2010, with a slight decrease to 598,000 in FY2011. However, the number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care assistance has been steadily declining since FY1998. The number of children receiving foster care assistance has been declining, with 181,000 in FY2010 and 157,000 in FY2012. In contrast, children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance increased from 106,000 in FY1995 to 423,000 in FY2010, reaching 425,000 in FY2012. Title IV-E support for kinship guardianship assistance was authorized in FY2009, with recipients growing from 100 in FY2009 to 16,000 in FY2012. Congress allocated $2.495 billion for Title IV-E adoption assistance in FY2012, with $2.363 billion needed for claims. HHS estimated $2.369 billion would be required for FY2013 claims. The Administration's FY2013 budget request highlighted the growth in children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance, with over 423,000 children assisted monthly in FY2010. This number increased to nearly 426,000 in FY2012 and is projected to reach 439,000 in FY2013. The increase is attributed to states' success in finding adoptive homes for children in foster care and recent federal law changes expanding eligibility for adoption assistance. The number of children annually adopted with public child welfare agency involvement has been steadily increasing, reaching a high of 57,100 in FY2009 and remaining above 50,000 each year since FY2000. The growth is partly due to the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, which broadened eligibility for federal adoption assistance. This trend is expected to continue as the new eligibility criteria are phased in over nine years. The eligibility criteria for Title IV-E adoption assistance have been broadened to include any child with \"special needs\" without income or resource tests. This applies to children adopted out of foster care as of FY2018 and those in foster care for 60 continuous months. The new rules also cover siblings of eligible children. In FY2013, the criteria mainly apply to children adopted at age 10 or older, with a budget authority of $4.288 billion allocated for Title IV-E foster care in FY2012. The budget authority for Title IV-E foster care was $4.288 billion in FY2012, but only $4.180 billion was needed to cover claims. In FY2013, an estimated $4.286 billion was required for Title IV-E foster care claims. The Administration attributed the need for funding to a decrease in the foster care caseload, offset by costs from implementing changes in the law. State expenditures on Title IV-E child protection requirements, including ensuring well-being and educational stability of children in foster care, are the main reason for higher spending on foster care over adoption assistance. States can now provide Title IV-E foster care assistance to eligible youth beyond age 18. As of May 2013, 20 jurisdictions had submitted Title IV-E plan amendments to HHS/ACF to provide foster care to older youth up to age 21. Eighteen plan amendments were approved, including the District of Columbia and 17 state agencies. Despite this expansion, HHS estimates a decline in the number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care assistance to 150,000 in FY2013. The number of children receiving Title IV-E foster care assistance is expected to decline to 150,000 in FY2013, compared to over 168,000 in FY2011 and around 157,000 in FY2012. This decrease is partly due to a reduction in the overall number of children in foster care, which dropped by 29% from FY2000 to FY2011. States have achieved this decline by increasing exits from foster care to other permanent homes. Since FY2005, states have been successful in finding adoptive homes for children leaving foster care and have also reduced the number of children entering foster care. This, along with shorter lengths of time in care, has led to a decrease in the total foster care caseload. However, the share of children in foster care eligible for Title IV-E assistance has been declining, with roughly 40% eligible in FY2011 compared to 52% in FY2000. The program's income test is cited as a factor in this trend. The decline in Title IV-E eligibility for foster care children is attributed to the program's income test, which requires children to have been removed from homes that met specific income criteria. States have varying income tests, with the median state need standard being $7,740 annually for a family of three. In most states, eligibility is limited to children from homes with income less than 50% of the federal poverty guideline. The funding for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance is determined by the federal poverty guideline, with a budget authority of $80 million for FY2012. However, only $74 million was needed for claims that year, and an estimated $123 million is needed for FY2013. The request for increased funding reflects expected growth in eligible children, with close to 16,000 children receiving assistance monthly in FY2012. Close to 16,000 children received Title IV-E guardianship assistance in FY2012, with an expected increase to 20,500 for FY2013. 33 Title IV-E agencies had submitted plan amendments for federal support of guardianship assistance, with most receiving final approval from HHS/ACF. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allowed tribes to access Title IV-E funds starting in FY2010. The Port Gamble S'Klallam tribe was the first to receive approval for its Title IV-E plan. 30 state Title IV-E agencies offer kinship guardianship options. The Port Gamble S'Klallam tribe was the first to access Title IV-E funds in FY2010. The Confederated Tribes of Salish and Koonteni in Montana also received approval for their Title IV-E plan. Other tribes are expected to follow suit. This change allows tribes to govern their own child welfare services with limited federal impact. The federal funding streams for child welfare purposes were analyzed, with most programs subject to sequestration. Final funding levels for FY2010-FY2013 are shown, including Title IV-E program funding for foster care, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance."
