    "content": "In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy impacted the East Coast of the United States. The President declared major disasters for 12 states and the District of Columbia. A request for $60.4 billion in supplemental funding was submitted to Congress on December 7, 2012, to address immediate losses and damages from Hurricane Sandy and future disaster mitigation. The proposal included $47.44 billion for disaster assistance and $12.97 billion for mitigation. $55 billion was requested as emergency funding, and $5.4 billion as disaster relief under the Budget Control Act. On December 17, 2012, a bill for $60.41 billion in disaster relief was introduced as an amendment to H.R. 1 of the 112th Congress. The bill included provisions for disaster assistance and reforms to disaster assistance authorities. The Senate later replaced the amendment with a similar bill, S.Amdt. 3395, with the same overall cost. The legislation did not explicitly separate mitigation provisions from other relief appropriations. The Senate passed a $60.41 billion disaster relief bill as an amendment to H.R. 1 of the 112th Congress. The legislation included funding for disaster relief and mitigation efforts. A budget point of order removed emergency designation from part of the funding for the Army Corps of Engineers. The Senate made changes to the amendment and passed the supplemental appropriations legislation on December 28, 2012. The House did not act on the legislation before the end of the 112th Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 increased the bond limit to $6.5 million, with a potential increase to $10 million if certified necessary by a federal contracting officer. Additionally, legislation was passed to provide $9.7 billion in borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program, and $17 billion was allocated for immediate needs with an additional $33 billion for longer-term recovery efforts. The House passed legislation on January 15, 2013, including $33 billion for longer-term recovery efforts and infrastructure improvements to prevent future disasters. The Senate passed the bill unchanged on January 28, 2013, and it was signed into law as P.L. 113-2. The House passed legislation on January 15, 2013, including $33 billion for longer-term recovery efforts and infrastructure improvements. The Senate passed the bill unchanged on January 28, 2013 by a vote of 62-36, and it was signed into law as P.L. 113-2 the next day. Table 1 outlines the Administration's request for supplemental funding and mitigation funding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, along with the congressional response. The table shows the Administration's budget request, appropriations from Senate-amended H.R. 1, and funding provided in H.R. 152 for disaster response and recovery. The Budget Control Act changed how federal funding for emergencies was accounted for by Congress. The Budget Control Act changed how federal funding for emergencies was accounted for by Congress, allowing for separate treatment of disaster relief from emergency funding. Funding designated as disaster relief in future spending bills could be adjusted by the discretionary spending caps based on a 10-year rolling average. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief for FY2013 was $11.8 billion. The Administration proposed using $6.4 billion for disaster relief in its supplemental request, with the remaining resources designated as emergency funding to avoid impacting the FY2013 budget caps. Senate-passed H.R. 1 suggested $5,379 million for disaster relief under the BCA. Adjustments may be needed pending finalization of FY2013 appropriations. The Senate-passed H.R. 1 proposed $5,379 million for disaster relief under the BCA, with additional emergency funding totaling $41,669 million. One suggestion to cover extra disaster costs is through rescissions or other means to reduce the bill's budget impact. Traditionally, supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has been considered emergency spending and not counted against discretionary budget caps. Supplemental spending packages for disaster relief have sometimes been offset by rescissions or transfers to mitigate budgetary impacts. Out of 59 bills with supplemental appropriations from 1990 to 2012, only 6 were fully offset by rescissions, with one providing additional resources for the Disaster Relief Fund. The DRF has also been used as an offset for disaster assistance from other federal entities. Offset for the Administration's supplemental request was complicated due to operating under a continuing resolution without a baseline appropriation in the current fiscal year. The Administration's request for supplemental funding for disaster relief faced challenges in finding offsets due to the lack of baseline appropriation in the current fiscal year. Despite efforts to offset the funding, an amendment to make an across-the-board cut to discretionary spending failed in the House. The House failed to pass an amendment to cut discretionary spending to offset the cost of H.R. 152. The Senate also failed to offset the cost through reducing discretionary spending caps. $3,461 million in discretionary budget authority was used for Army Corps of Engineers construction, impacting the FY2013 appropriations process. Congress debated supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy relief amidst these budget constraints. Some commentators compared Hurricane Sandy to past disasters like Hurricane Irene, Katrina, and Andrew in terms of scope and magnitude. These comparisons highlighted loss of life, disruption of daily activities, and impacts on local economies. However, each disaster has unique circumstances and needs for federal assistance. The federal government provides assistance to supplement overwhelmed state, tribal, and local governments after a disaster. Decisions for federal assistance are based on the state's capability to address needs without federal help, not individual needs. The federal government provides assistance to supplement overwhelmed state, tribal, and local governments after a disaster based on the state's capability to address needs without federal help. The relative levels of federal assistance required for each disaster depend on the proportional impact to various sectors of the community, such as business districts or public facilities. Factors like population density and socioeconomic status also affect the comparability of disasters. The key factors considered for federal assistance after a disaster include the density and socioeconomic status of impacted populations, the percentage of insured properties and losses, and the number of jurisdictions affected."
