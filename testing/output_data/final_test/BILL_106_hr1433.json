    "content": "The \"Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 1999\" allows for the deduction of state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes. The \"Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 1999\" allows taxpayers to elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes for the taxable year. The \"Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 1999\" allows taxpayers to deduct state and local general sales taxes imposed at one rate on a broad range of items, including food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles. The tax does not apply to some items, but this exclusion does not affect the tax's classification as a general sales tax. The Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 1999 allows taxpayers to deduct state and local general sales taxes imposed at one rate on various items. The rate of tax on specific items being lower than the general rate does not impact the tax classification. No deduction is allowed for sales tax imposed at a rate different from the general rate, except for specific items with a lower tax rate. Compensating use taxes are considered general sales taxes for deduction purposes. Sales tax includes compensating use tax imposed on the use, storage, or consumption of items, complementary to a general sales tax. A special rule applies to motor vehicles where the general rate is used if the tax rate exceeds it. Separately stated general sales taxes are also considered for deductions. The amount of separately stated general sales tax paid by the consumer is treated as a tax imposed on the consumer. The deduction amount is determined by tables prescribed by the Secretary. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, based on average consumption by taxpayers on a State-by-State basis, taking into account filing status, dependents, adjusted gross income, and State/local sales taxation rates."
