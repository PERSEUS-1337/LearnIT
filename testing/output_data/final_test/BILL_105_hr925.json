    "content": "The \"Payoffs-for-Layoffs Corporate Welfare Elimination Act of 1997\" prohibits payments under defense contracts for restructuring costs of a defense contractor merger or acquisition. The \"Payoffs-for-Layoffs Corporate Welfare Elimination Act of 1997\" prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds for restructuring costs of a merger or acquisition by a contractor. This applies to mergers or acquisitions after the enactment of the Act, with exceptions for contracts specifying payment for such costs. Payment for merger or acquisition costs under Department of Defense contracts can be made using appropriated funds. Section 818 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 is repealed. The Secretary of Defense must now report on windfalls resulting from reduced overhead on fixed-price contracts due to defense contractor mergers. The Secretary of Defense must report on the net effect of reimbursing defense contractors for merger-related restructuring costs, including details on reduced prices of weapons systems and pending restructuring proposals submitted to the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense pays for restructuring costs from defense contractor mergers, leading to reduced tax revenues and increased federal expenditures on unemployment benefits and other assistance programs. The text discusses the impact of business combinations on federal grants, state and local tax bases, government services, and Department of Defense prices for military equipment and services. It also defines the term \"windfall\" as savings resulting from these mergers. The term 'windfall' refers to savings from defense contractor mergers by reducing overhead, impacting fixed-price contracts. 'Significant layoffs' are defined as exceeding 500 employees or being a major employer in a state or local community."
