    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hydraulic Fracturing Act\" and pertains to hydraulic fracturing. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on underground drinking water sources. The study will assess the impacts nationwide and in specific regions, states, or portions of states. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on underground drinking water sources. The study will involve various stakeholders and examine whether hydraulic fracturing endangers underground drinking water sources. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a study on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on underground drinking water sources. The study will assess specific regions, methods, and precautionary actions to prevent endangerment. An independent scientific review by the National Academy of Sciences will follow the study's completion. The National Academy of Sciences will review the conclusions of the study on hydraulic fracturing's effects on underground drinking water sources and provide recommendations for any necessary modifications. A report will be submitted to the Administrator and relevant congressional committees within 9 months of the agreement, followed by a regulatory determination within 6 months of receiving the report. The Administrator will determine the need for regulation of hydraulic fracturing to protect underground sources of drinking water after receiving the National Academy of Sciences report, based on information from the study and public input. The Administrator will publish a determination in the Federal Register with an explanation and reasons if regulation of hydraulic fracturing is deemed necessary to protect underground drinking water sources. If regulation is necessary, it will be promulgated within 6 months after public notice and comment. The Administrator will only regulate hydraulic fracturing under section 1421 if deemed necessary to protect underground drinking water sources. If regulation is unnecessary, States are relieved from regulating hydraulic fracturing as an underground injection. The term 'hydraulic fracturing' is defined as creating a fracture in a reservoir rock and injecting fluids for reservoir stimulation in oil and gas production. This definition does not limit the Administrator's authorities under section 1431."
