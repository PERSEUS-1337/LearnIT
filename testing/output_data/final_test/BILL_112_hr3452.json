    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Wasatch Range Recreation Access Enhancement Act\". Congress finds that Canyons Ski Resort, Solitude Mountain Resort, and other ski areas in Utah are interested in linking the Wasatch Range front and back through a transportation connection. The seven ski resorts in the area are currently separated by natural features, and there is no convenient transportation link between them. Wasatch Mountains Resorts have proposed a minimally invasive gondola for skiers to provide public access between the resorts. The proposed SkiLink gondola would connect The Canyons Ski Resort in Summit County to Solitude Mountain Resort in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah. Despite efforts to improve transit and carpool access, traffic congestion in the area remains high, with 8,000 to 9,000 vehicles per day on peak winter weekends. The establishment of SkiLink would reduce ski-season vehicle traffic between The Canyons Ski Resort and Solitude Mountain Resort by up to 18,000 cars per year, leading to a decrease in emissions and immediate traffic benefits. A preliminary environmental review found no impact on federally listed species. SkiLink construction plans include environmentally friendly techniques like helicopter use for concrete placement. The winter sports industry in Utah contributes significantly to the economy, with SkiLink projected to bring $50 million annually and create 500 new jobs. The SkiLink project aims to create the largest interconnected ski network in the United States, providing access to over 6,000 acres of ski terrain. The SkiLink project aims to create the largest interconnected ski network in the United States by conveying national forest system land in Salt Lake County, Utah. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to convey approximately 30 acres of National Forest System land in Utah to Canyons-SkiLink, LLC for the construction of a ski-lift or tramway. Canyons-SkiLink, LLC must pay the fair market value for the land. The Secretary must convey National Forest System land in Utah to Canyons-SkiLink, LLC for a ski-lift. Funds received will reduce the Federal deficit. The fair market value will be determined through an appraisal within 6 months. Environmental compliance is required for the conveyance."
