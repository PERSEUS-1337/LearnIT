    "content": "The \"Girls Count Act of 2015\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The findings section of the Act highlights important information. According to Congress findings, there is a significant number of unregistered births globally, with 36 percent of children under five lacking birth certificates. A nationally recognized proof of birth system is crucial for determining a child's citizenship, nationality, and parentage. The lack of birth registration among girls and women globally hinders their ability to obtain official identification, participate in economic, legal, and political sectors, and access health and education services. This can worsen their vulnerability to trafficking, child marriage, and limit their opportunities for employment, civil participation, and asset ownership. Girls in poor families undertake domestic labor such as carrying water, harvesting crops, and caring for younger children. The lack of official information on women and girls hampers accurate assessments of access to education and poverty levels. To ensure women and girls are considered in foreign assistance policies, it is crucial for girls to be counted and have access to birth certificates.
