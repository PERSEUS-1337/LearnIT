    "content": "The Rural Education Initiative Act amends Part J of title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by redesignating sections and introducing new sections, including a short title and findings. The Rural Education Initiative Act identifies issues faced by rural schools in accessing federal education funding, such as inconsistent definitions of rural schools, lack of fit with federal formula programs, inability to compete for competitive grants, and insufficient revenue for small school districts with fewer than 600 students. The Rural Education Initiative Act addresses challenges rural schools face in accessing federal education funding, including inconsistent definitions of rural schools, lack of fit with federal formula programs, inability to compete for competitive grants, and insufficient revenue for small school districts with fewer than 600 students. SEC. 10973 authorizes a formula grant program. An eligible local educational agency can use funding from the State educational agency to support education reform efforts for elementary and secondary school students. The agency must notify the State educational agency of its intention to use the funding by a specified date. Eligibility for funding is determined by the local educational agency. An eligible local educational agency can use funding from the State educational agency for education reform efforts if the total student attendance is less than 600 and all schools are in rural areas. Applicable funding includes funds from specific provisions of law, and the State educational agency disburses the funds. The State educational agency disburses applicable funding to local educational agencies for alternative uses, ensuring it supplements and does not supplant other education funds. Federal law references funds for this section. \"SEC. 10974. COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can award grants to eligible local educational agencies to support education reform efforts for elementary and secondary school students in small, rural communities. Eligibility criteria include a student population of less than 600 and schools located in specific rural areas. The Secretary awards grants to local educational agencies based on the number of children in attendance at schools served by the agency. The grant amount ranges from $20,000 to $30,000 depending on the student population size. The grant amount for local educational agencies ranges from $20,000 to $60,000 based on the number of kindergarten through grade 12 students in average daily attendance at the schools served by the agency. Each agency must conduct a census by December 1 each year to determine the student population. Each local educational agency must submit student population numbers to the Secretary by March 1 each year. If false information is knowingly submitted to gain more funds, the agency will be fined double the difference between the actual amount received and the correct amount. The Secretary disburses the awarded funds. The Secretary disburses funds to local educational agencies by July 1 each year. Agencies receiving grants under this section are ineligible for funds under certain other provisions of law. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other education funds. \"SEC. 10975. ACCOUNTABILITY.\" Each local educational agency receiving funds under section 10973 or 10974 must administer a statewide test to assess students' academic achievement, or select a test if no statewide option is available. Each State educational agency that receives funding under section 10973(c) must determine if students performed better on tests after the 5th year of participation compared to the 1st year. The legislation aims to evaluate the performance of local educational agencies on tests after 5 years of participation. Those that perform better can continue for another 5 years, while those that do not improve are prohibited from participation for the same period. Amendments are made to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to reflect these changes. In section 10952, paragraph (4) is removed and paragraph (5) is redesignated as paragraph (4). The heading for subpart 2 is changed from \"Demonstration Grants\" to \"Initiative.\" Section 10976 now includes a definition for \"rural eligible local educational agency\" based on enrollment criteria. The agency serves less than 2,500 students and is not in a metropolitan statistical area."
