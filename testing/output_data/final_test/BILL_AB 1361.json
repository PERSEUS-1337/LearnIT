    "title": "AB 1361",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 69436 of the Education Code is amended to allow California residents transferring from a community college to a qualifying baccalaureate program to receive a Cal Grant A or B award if they meet specific criteria. To be eligible for a Cal Grant A or B award, a student must submit a financial aid application by March 2, demonstrate financial need, have a 2.4 GPA, meet income and asset limits, attend a qualifying institution for a baccalaureate degree, be enrolled at least part-time, and meet general Cal Grant eligibility requirements. To be eligible for a Cal Grant A or B award, a student must meet specific criteria: be under 28 years old, graduate from a California high school after 2000, attend a California community college before the award year, and meet certain military service requirements. The award amount and type are determined based on these eligibility requirements. The award amount for Cal Grant A and B recipients is determined based on income and assets. For those meeting Cal Grant A limits, the award amount is established in Article 2. For those meeting Cal Grant B limits, the award amount is established in Article 3. A student meeting requirements for high school graduation in California, unless due to military orders, is exempt from certain article requirements. Students eligible for claims under this article include those paid prior to December 1, 2005, and those paid for the 2004-05 or 2005-06 award year between December 1, 2005, and October 15, 2006. The commission or qualifying institution will make preliminary awards to eligible applicants under this article, requiring written affirmation of meeting specific requirements. Recipients will be notified that their award is subject to an audit. The commission randomly selects 10% of new and renewal Cal Grant awards for verification. Repayment is sought for improperly disbursed funds. An annual report is submitted to the Legislature and Governor, detailing the number of awards given in the past year. In the past 12 months, the number of awards made under this article and the results of verification for new and renewal awards at various institutions are reported. Institutions cannot accept award funds under both this section and Title 38 of the United States Code for individuals over 28 years old who are current or former members of the Armed Forces."
