The cost of mechanical insulation property includes installation costs above ASHRAE standard 90.1-2007 minimums, total insulation cost for maintenance applications, and 10 percent of the cost for removal and disposal of old insulation. The Mechanical Insulation Installation Incentive Act of 2010 allows a deduction for labor costs allocated to the preparation, assembly, and installation of mechanical insulation property. This deduction does not apply to costs already accounted for under section 179D. For tax-exempt property, the primary contractor for installing mechanical insulation property is considered the taxpayer placing the property in service. Certification of energy savings is required for this deduction. The section outlines certification requirements for energy savings and termination conditions. It also amends the Code to allow deductions for capital expenditures under section 179F. Technical and clerical amendments are made to section 312(k)(3)(B) of the Code. The text proposes amending the Code to include deductions for capital expenditures under section 179F, in addition to section 179E. This involves inserting \"179F\" in various sections and headings. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after the date of enactment of this Act."
