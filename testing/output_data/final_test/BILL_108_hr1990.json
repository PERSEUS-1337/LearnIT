    "content": "The \"Family Dairy Farmer Preservation Act of 2003\" is also known as the National Counter-Cyclical Income Support Program for Dairy Producers. During the period from enactment to September 30, 2011, the Secretary will implement a program to support the income of eligible milk producers. Definitions include terms like \"Board\" for Regional Dairy Boards and classifications for different types of milk. The term \"covered processor\" refers to a milk plant in a participating State or one that distributes Class I milk products in a participating State. The term \"District\" refers to a Regional Dairy District, while an \"eligible producer\" is an individual or entity involved in milk production in a participating State. Eligible production is defined as the quantity of milk produced by an eligible producer. The term \"Trust Fund\" refers to the National Dairy Producers Trust Fund, while a \"participating State\" is a State covered by subsection (c) of the order. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the \"Secretary,\" and a \"marketing area\" is an area subject to an order issued under the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The Producers Trust Fund program includes specified participating States like Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, and others. Governors of other states can designate their state as participating by notifying the Secretary. States can withdraw from the program with the Governor's approval. The Governor of a State can withdraw from the Producers Trust Fund program by providing written notice to the Secretary, with the withdrawal taking effect either within 180 days of the enactment of the Act or one year after the notice is provided. Eligible producers in participating states may be affected by the withdrawal in terms of their eligibility for other dairy programs. The Secretary will establish five Regional Dairy Districts composed of participating States, including a Northeast District and a Southern District. Eligible producers in participating States may not receive payments under certain programs, with no further payments to be made under existing contracts. The Secretary will establish five Regional Dairy Districts: Southern District (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia), Upper Midwest District (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin), Intermountain District (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming), and Pacific District (California, Oregon, Washington). Each District will be administered by a Regional Dairy Board. The Regional Dairy Board in each District is composed of 2-3 members from each participating State, appointed by the Secretary from nominations submitted by the Governor. The Governor must nominate at least five residents, including an eligible producer and a consumer representative. Additionally, the National Dairy Producers Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States. The National Dairy Producers Trust Fund is established with payments received and made by the Secretary. Amounts in the Trust Fund are available to the Secretary for carrying out designated activities. Covered processors must make payments to the Trust Fund when the Class I mover is less than $14.25 per hundredweight. The Secretary requires compensatory payments from those selling Class I milk to equalize costs, based on the difference between $14.25 per hundredweight and the Class I mover, and the quantity of milk purchased. If the average price for Class III milk falls below $13.25 per hundredweight, the Secretary will use funds to make counter-cyclical payments to the Trust Fund. The Secretary will use Commodity Credit Corporation funds to make monthly payments to the Trust Fund based on the difference between $13.25 per hundredweight and the average price of Class III milk, multiplied by the quantity of eligible milk production. Additionally, the Trust Fund will compensate the Secretary for administrative costs. The Secretary will use Commodity Credit Corporation funds to make monthly payments to the Trust Fund for administrative costs. Payments from the Trust Fund will cover increased costs of milk in food assistance programs and compensate states for increased costs in providing milk products under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Additionally, any remaining Trust Fund amounts will be used to make monthly payments to Boards. The Secretary will use Commodity Credit Corporation funds to make monthly payments to the Trust Fund for administrative costs. Payments from the Trust Fund will cover increased costs of milk in food assistance programs and compensate states for increased costs in providing milk products under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Additionally, any remaining Trust Fund amounts will be used to make monthly payments to Boards based on eligible production ratios in Districts. Boards will then use these payments to compensate eligible producers for their milk production, with a limit of 500,000 pounds per month. The Board of a District can use payments to incentivize eligible producers to manage milk supply. The Secretary can review proposed actions. If overproduction occurs, the Commodity Credit Corporation may incur additional costs. In case of overproduction of milk in a District due to this section, the Board must reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for extra costs. The Board can impose an assessment on producers to cover these costs."
