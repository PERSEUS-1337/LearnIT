However, they face high sample complexity issues, limiting their real-world applications. On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning offers reduced sample complexity but requires careful tuning and has mainly succeeded in simple domains. This paper examines the behavior of model-based RL methods using deep neural networks for both model and policy learning. It reveals that the learned policy exploits areas with insufficient data, leading to training instability. To address this, an ensemble of models is proposed to maintain model uncertainty and regulate the learning process. Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive results in recent years, including mastering Atari games and advanced locomotion skills. Model-free RL methods are widely used but suffer from high sample complexity. A new approach, Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO), reduces sample complexity significantly compared to model-free methods. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms utilize learned models of the environment to improve sample efficiency, making them suitable for real-world tasks. However, extending these methods to deep neural network models has seen limited success so far. The standard approach for model-based reinforcement learning involves alternating between model learning and policy optimization. In the model learning stage, samples are collected and a dynamics model is fitted using supervised learning. The policy optimization stage uses the learned model to search for an improved policy. Vanilla model-based RL can work well on simple tasks but struggles on more challenging continuous control tasks due to unstable performance caused by policy optimization exploiting regions with insufficient data. The issue of model bias in reinforcement learning is exacerbated by the use of deep neural networks. To address this, an ensemble of deep neural networks is proposed to maintain model uncertainty. Differentiation is achieved through varying weight initialization and training input sequences. During policy learning, the policy updates are regularized by combining gradients from imagined stochastic roll-outs, sampled uniformly from ensemble predictions. This technique helps the policy become robust against various scenarios. Likelihood ratio methods are proposed instead of backpropagation through time to estimate gradients, reducing the risk of exploding and vanishing gradients. Model ensemble is used for early stopping policy training to avoid overfitting. In this work, Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) is proposed as a model-based algorithm that achieves high performance with a 100\u00d7 reduction in sample complexity compared to model-free algorithms. The use of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) instead of BPTT leads to more stable learning and improved final performance in challenging continuous control tasks. The model ensemble technique effectively addresses model bias in model-based reinforcement learning. The curr_chunk discusses the flaws of model-based reinforcement learning in challenging continuous control tasks, highlighting the use of simple linear models for efficient policy optimization. Nonparametric models like Gaussian are suggested as an alternative for handling complicated dynamics and high-dimensional state spaces. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of Gaussian Processes in model-based reinforcement learning due to the curse of dimensionality and computational challenges. Deep neural networks have been successful in scaling up model-free RL but have had limited success in model-based RL on complex domains. In this work, a purely model-based approach is shown to improve sample complexity compared to methods combining model-based and model-free elements. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of model-based RL algorithms using Bayesian neural networks to learn dynamics models and train policies through gradient-based optimization. Another approach involves learning a latent variable dynamic model over trajectory segments and training policies through gradient-based optimization over the latent space. These approaches have shown success on fixed datasets collected prior to the algorithm. Our approach utilizes an iterative process of model learning and policy learning, making it applicable to challenging domains. The proposed improvements are orthogonal to existing approaches and can potentially be combined for better results. The paper focuses on a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with defined state and action spaces, transition and reward functions, initial state distribution, and horizon. The curr_chunk discusses the use of a stochastic policy to maximize expected return in reinforcement learning. It contrasts model-free and model-based approaches, highlighting the use of data in training a model of the environment dynamics. This model can be used for policy training and provides gradient information. The curr_chunk describes the vanilla model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, using neural networks to represent the model and policy. The transition dynamics are modeled with a feed-forward neural network, training it to predict the change in state. The objective is to find a parameter that minimizes the L2 one-step prediction loss. The curr_chunk discusses training dataset transitions, using Adam optimizer for supervised learning, avoiding overfitting, and maximizing expected rewards in reinforcement learning with a model-based approach. The policy is updated based on an approximate MDP and represented as a conditional multivariate normal distribution. The curr_chunk discusses gradient computation using the re-parametrization trick and Monte-Carlo methods for estimating the objective function. It also mentions using backpropagation through time (BPTT), gradient clipping, and the Adam optimizer for stable learning in reinforcement learning. The policy is updated until performance no longer improves, and data is collected with respect to the real model. The policy is updated using data collected with respect to the real model until the desired performance is achieved. The learned policy may exploit regions with scarce training data, leading to overfitting issues that can be alleviated by early stopping. Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) addresses issues with early stopping and gradient problems in reinforcement learning. It combines a set of dynamics models trained via supervised learning to improve performance over long horizons. The Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) combines dynamics models trained via supervised learning to optimize policy using Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). It uses likelihood-ratio methods to estimate gradients and achieves the best results with TRPO. The models simulate trajectories by predicting the next state given the current state and action. The Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) uses a model to predict the next state based on the current state and action to avoid overfitting. Policy validation is done by monitoring performance using learned models, with the iteration continuing if the policy improves in the majority of models. If performance falls below a threshold, updates are tolerated to see if performance improves before terminating the iteration. This process is repeated until desired performance is achieved in the real environment. The Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) uses a model ensemble for policy learning, forcing the policy to perform well over various possible futures. Samples are collected from the real system and fictitious samples are used to update the policy until desired performance is reached in the real environment. The study evaluates the approach against state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample complexity and performance, identifies failure scenarios of the vanilla algorithm, and explains how their method overcomes these failures. An ablation study in Appendix D characterizes the effect of each component of the algorithm. The method is compared with TRPO, PPO, DDPG, and SVG in terms of sample complexity and performance on six standard continuous control benchmark tasks in Mujoco. The study compares model-based methods like Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Stochastic Value Gradient (SVG) with model-free methods, showing that model-free methods outperform model-based ones. The proposed method achieves similar performance to model-free approaches with significantly less data, particularly excelling in high-dimensional motor-control tasks like Humanoid. The method overcomes the failures of vanilla model-based reinforcement learning, as detailed in the experiment results in Appendix A. The study compares model-based methods like Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Stochastic Value Gradient (SVG) with model-free methods, showing that model-free methods outperform model-based ones. The proposed method achieves similar performance to model-free approaches with significantly less data, particularly excelling in high-dimensional motor-control tasks like Humanoid. Analyzing the effect of replacing BPTT with TRPO in vanilla model-based RL, the results suggest that policy gradient methods are more stable and lead to better final performance. By using model-free algorithms, less information from the learned model is needed, as it acts as a simulator. TRPO can replace BPTT for optimization, but model bias can still affect the learned policy. The policy tends to favor regions it has rarely visited, leading to erroneous predictions. Using more ensemble models improves learning regularization and performance. In this work, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm is presented that significantly reduces sample complexity while achieving the same level of performance as state-of-the-art methods. Using more models in the ensemble improves learning regularization and performance, especially in challenging environments like HalfCheetah and Ant. The algorithm is able to learn neural network policies across different domains, showing improvement when using 5, 10, and 20 models compared to a single model. The algorithm presented reduces sample complexity while maintaining performance. Using model ensemble and TRPO are crucial for success in deep model-based RL. Model uncertainty helps reduce bias. Future work includes exploring state space discrepancies and applying the algorithm to real-world robotics systems. In each outer iteration, real-world data is collected using a stochastic policy. The policy standard deviation is sampled randomly, and parameters are perturbed with Gaussian noise. Data is split for training and validation, and a neural network model is trained with specific parameters. The policy is trained with TRPO on a 2-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network with specific parameters. The training process includes validation checks and early stopping criteria for different environments. The policy is trained with TRPO on a 2-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network with specific parameters. The state in each environment consists of joint angles, velocities, and center of mass position. Contact information is not used, making the environments effectively POMDPs. Redundancies in the state space are eliminated to avoid infeasible states. The method is compared against TRPO, PPO, DDPG, and SVG in various environments using hyper-parameters detailed in the text. In the experiments, policies were trained using Proximal Policy Optimization, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and Stochastic Value Gradient methods with specific hyperparameters and neural network configurations. The dynamics model was trained with a feedforward neural network, Adam optimizer, and gradient clipping. Overoptimization was observed when using a single model instead of an ensemble. In each outer iteration, policy overoptimization occurs as estimated performance increases while real performance decreases. Different validation techniques are compared, including using real performance, average return in roll-outs, and stopping policy updates. Results show the effectiveness of each approach in FIG5. Using an oracle of real performance is over-cautious and limits exploration, resulting in a poorly trained dynamics model. Stopping the gradient after a fixed number of updates can lead to good performance if the right number is chosen, but adds an extra hyper-parameter burden. Conversely, using an ensemble of models performs well across environments without additional hyper-parameters."
