The Homeland Security Mentoring Program, established within the Department of Homeland Security, aims to address human capital deficiencies, recruitment, retention efforts, and succession planning in the Federal workforce. It will follow best practices and align with the Department's Human Capital Strategic Plan. The Homeland Security Mentoring Program within the Department aims to develop a cadre of qualified employees and future leaders by enabling sharing of expertise, skills, and resources, setting clear learning goals and feedback processes, enhancing professional relationships and networking opportunities. It complements existing mentoring and training programs. The Training Leaders Council, established by the Chief Human Capital Officer, administers the Mentoring Program and provides oversight. The Training Leaders Council oversees the Mentoring Program, establishing a framework, selecting mentors and mentees, formalizing assignments, creating development plans, and coordinating with other mentoring programs. The Mentoring Program in the Department consists of middle and senior level employees who serve as mentors for junior and entry level employees. Mentors are selected based on significant experience and are critical to Department succession plans. Target enrollment numbers are established under the human capital goals of the Department. The Mentoring Program in the Department involves mentors who understand the organization, culture, and aims of mentoring in Federal public service. Mentors should be available, empathetic, and have good communication skills to guide and support mentees. Mentees are selected based on specific criteria. Roles and responsibilities of participants in the mentoring program include mentors serving as models, motivators, and counselors to mentees. Immediate supervisors who evaluate an employee's performance cannot be mentors to that employee. The responsibilities of a mentor in a mentoring program include helping the mentee set learning objectives and career goals, understanding the organizational culture, recommending learning opportunities, providing informal education and training in various skills, and highlighting strengths. The responsibilities of the mentee in a mentoring program may include defining learning objectives and career goals, participating in learning and professional opportunities to grow and expand leadership abilities.

The Secretary must report on the status of the Mentoring Program, including mentor and mentee numbers, succession planning, and leadership development to specific committees within 180 days of its establishment. \"SEC. 845. HOMELAND SECURITY ROTATION PROGRAM.\" The Homeland Security Rotation Program, established by the Secretary, aims to broaden the knowledge of middle-level employees in the Department through exposure to different components, in accordance with the Department Human Capital Strategic Plan. The Homeland Security Rotation Program aims to expand the Department's knowledge base through rotational assignments, build professional relationships, invigorate the workforce, address human capital deficiencies, and complement existing rotational programs. The Training Leaders Council, established by the Chief Human Capital Officer, administers the Rotation Program. It provides oversight, establishes eligibility, selects participants, and sets incentives for employees. The Rotation Program incentivizes employee participation through promotions and employment preferences, offers professional education and training, develops qualified employees and future leaders, promotes interaction among Department employees, and coordinates with existing rotational programs. The Rotation Program preserves allowances, privileges, and benefits for participating employees. The Secretary must submit a report on the program's status, including details on participation, succession planning, and leadership development to specific committees.
