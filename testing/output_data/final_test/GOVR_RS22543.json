    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a grants and civil rights statute that provides federal funding for the education of children with disabilities. It requires the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) as a condition for receiving funds. Enacted in 1975, IDEA was a response to the need to educate children with disabilities and judicial decisions mandating education for them. The statute includes due process provisions, allowing parties to bring civil actions to ensure FAPE. Courts have varied in their views on whether non-attorney parents can pursue an IDEA case pro se. Jacob Winkelman, a child with autism, was at the center of a dispute between his parents and school officials over his placement in kindergarten. The Winkelmans disagreed with the school's proposed placement for their son, Jacob, who has autism. They appealed to the U.S. district court without a lawyer, then to the sixth circuit court of appeals, which required them to obtain an attorney within thirty days. The Winkelmans sought a stay from the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari on October 27, 2006. The case of Cavanaugh v. Cardinal Local School District determined that non-attorney parents of a child with a disability cannot represent their child in court under IDEA. The sixth circuit found that while federal law allows individuals to act as their own counsel, parents generally cannot represent their minor children in legal actions. The sixth circuit ruled that non-attorney parents cannot represent their child in court under IDEA, as the law focuses on the child's rights, not the parents'. Circuit courts are divided on whether non-attorney parents can proceed pro se in IDEA cases, with some requiring legal representation for substantive claims. In Maroni v. Pemi-Baker Regional School District, the first circuit held that parents have the right to proceed pro se on both procedural and substantive grounds under IDEA. The court emphasized that the rights of parents and children with disabilities are \"inextricably intertwined,\" despite some practical concerns about parents serving as advocates due to emotional involvement. The Maroni court ruled that parents can represent themselves in IDEA cases, emphasizing the importance of advocacy for children with disabilities. Other circuits have also denied parents the right to proceed pro se in similar cases. The court noted that parents cannot bring a pro se action on their child's behalf in federal court, as it may deprive children of their legal rights. In Collinsgru v. Palmyra Board of Education, parents sought special education services for their son without an attorney, but the administrative law judge found the child's difficulties were not severe enough to qualify. The administrative law judge ruled that the child's issues did not warrant special education, leading the parents to file a civil action. The district court denied the parents' request to represent their child pro se, citing that parents can only do so in administrative proceedings, not federal ones. The court of appeals in Collinsgru agreed, stating that the IDEA does not allow parents to represent their child in federal court without legal counsel. The third circuit emphasized the importance of legal representation in court proceedings, citing state interest in regulating the practice of law and the protection it provides for all parties involved. Parents in Collinsgru argued for joint substantive rights with their child under IDEA, highlighting the role of parents as advocates due to the lack of willingness from attorneys to take on IDEA cases. The court noted that attorneys are often unwilling to take IDEA cases due to their complexity and lack of significant retainers. However, IDEA provides for attorneys' fees, indicating that parents and children have different rights under the law. Parents have procedural safeguards while children have both procedural and substantive rights. Other courts have also recognized parents' procedural rights under IDEA. The court found that parents have procedural rights under IDEA, allowing a pro se suit to enforce these rights. Parents and children have different rights under the law, with parents having procedural safeguards and children having both procedural and substantive rights."
