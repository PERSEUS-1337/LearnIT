There is a growing concern about the increasing amount of man-made debris in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) that poses a threat to space activities and could have significant implications. The amount of current LEO debris is unstable and increasing, posing a threat to U.S. national interests in space. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn, III, highlighted the national security implications of interference with satellites and space capabilities. Space systems are crucial for modern warfare, providing precision strike, accurate navigation, secure communication, and clear battlefield visibility. The focus is on the threat of orbital debris, steps taken to mitigate it, and ensuring long-term sustainability of the space environment. Congress may need to consider measures to address this issue. The United States may need to focus on measures to mitigate the threat of orbital debris in Earth's orbit, caused by decades of human space flight activities. The U.S. Space Surveillance Network tracks over 23,000 objects in orbit, with only 5% being active satellites. Congress may need to address this issue to ensure the long-term sustainability of the space environment. Since 2007, two significant debris-generating events have greatly increased the amount of debris in orbit. On January 11, 2007, the Chinese government launched an interceptor missile in an anti-satellite weapon test that destroyed their decommissioned Fengyun-1C weather satellite. This intentionally caused a significant amount of debris in Earth's orbit. The Chinese ASAT test in 2007 created a severe orbital debris cloud, with over 3,000 large pieces and 150,000 smaller ones. Experts debated whether debris from this test damaged a Russian satellite in 2013, with conflicting reports from the Pentagon and other experts. On February 10, 2009, a U.S. Iridium communications satellite collided with a defunct Russian Cosmos satellite, creating roughly 2,100 new pieces of debris larger than 10 cm. Collision probability reports had predicted a \"close approach\" between the satellites, but it was not considered a major concern at the time. Following the collision between a U.S. Iridium communications satellite and a defunct Russian Cosmos satellite in 2009, the U.S. Space Surveillance Network detected debris, increasing the amount of objects in Earth orbit by one-third. This event, along with another collision, doubled the amount of cataloged fragmentation debris in orbit after 20 years of stability. The debris from ballistic missile defense tests by the United States and Russia is not considered consequential in this report. The United States conducted BMD tests in space in the late 1960s and early 1970s to validate a nuclear-tipped BMD system. Since the early 1980s, hit-to-kill BMD flight and intercept tests have been conducted outside Earth's atmosphere. In 2008, a BMD-capable Aegis cruiser successfully shot down a deteriorating U.S. surveillance satellite. The Missile Defense Agency reported that nearly 100 percent of the debris safely burned up during reentry within 48 hours. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) reported that almost all debris from a BMD test safely burned up during reentry within 48 hours. Debris modeling predicts that half of the mass would vaporize during collision, a quarter would disperse into fine particles that burn up, and the rest could reach the ground. No significant space debris events have been attributed to U.S. BMD tests. Orbital debris poses a threat to space-based resources. Orbital debris poses a threat to space-based resources by potentially causing catastrophic damage to satellites and spacecraft. Mitigating the risk of collision involves moving spacecraft out of the way, which incurs costs and may disrupt operations. Evasive maneuvers are often necessary, but many objects in space are uncontrollable, making collisions unavoidable in some cases. Orbital debris poses a significant threat to space-based resources, with the potential for catastrophic damage to satellites and spacecraft. Evasive maneuvers are often ineffective in avoiding collisions, as the debris population continues to grow exponentially, reaching a tipping point where entire orbits could become unusable. NASA's models predict a continuous increase in orbital debris despite mitigation efforts. NASA's models show that orbital debris will keep increasing due to collisions, leading to more spacecraft failures. The growth rate is highest in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), but Geosynchronous Orbit may face similar issues over time. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) reported that current mitigation measures are insufficient to stabilize the debris environment. The current population of man-made objects in LEO is reaching a critical density that will result in a cascading effect of mutual collisions. Six space agencies simulated the future space debris environment through 2209, predicting a 30% increase in debris over the next 200 years even with 90% compliance with mitigation measures. Catastrophic collisions are expected every five to nine years, driving the population growth. Mitigation measures aim to limit debris generation, with the US policy since 1988 focused on minimizing new orbital debris. NASA and DOD have requirements for spacecraft design and operation. The United States leads in developing and adopting international and industry standards to minimize orbital debris. NASA's programs are recognized as models nationally and internationally, with other federal agencies accepting components of their guidelines. Efforts are made to prevent future collisions in space, guided by the National Space Policy. The National Space Policy directs efforts to improve Space Situational Awareness by detecting, tracking, and cataloging objects in outer space. U.S. Strategic Command has signed agreements with commercial satellite owners for cooperation. The State Department supports information exchanges with foreign satellite operators to notify of potential space hazards. The United States notifies other governments and satellite operators of hazardous conjunctions between orbiting objects. The United States is actively engaging with space-faring nations and organizations to ensure the Joint Space Operations Center has up-to-date contact information for satellite operations centers. Over 1,100 notifications were provided in 2011, including to Russia and China. Bilateral \"Space Security Dialogues\" are being pursued to promote transparency and confidence-building measures in space to prevent mishaps and mistrust. The focus is on encouraging responsible actions, peaceful use of space, and building familiarity and trust among space actors through pragmatic, voluntary, near-term actions like establishing guidelines or a code of conduct. The United States is actively engaging in efforts to enhance transparency and safety in national security space policies. This includes developing voluntary best practices guidelines for space activities and promoting compliance with debris mitigation measures like the \"25-year\" rule. The international space community is urged to increase compliance with the 25-year rule for post-mission disposal to prevent future growth of orbital debris. Best practice guidelines or a code of conduct for responsible behavior in space, such as the European Union's draft Code of Conduct, are seen as beneficial for sustainability and security in space. The Stimson Center, co-founded by Michael Krepon, promotes a model Code of Conduct for space debris mitigation. The United States is working with the European Union and other nations to develop a non-legally binding International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. The code is voluntary and not legally binding, aiming to promote responsible behavior in space. Some in Congress have concerns about an international code of conduct for space, fearing it may not align with national security interests or could evolve into a formal treaty without proper oversight. The executive branch plans to consult with Congress, and their support or opposition will depend on the final agreement details. The National Space Policy allows for arms control measures if they enhance national security. State Department officials are considering more formal treaty efforts. The State Department officials have not yet seen a proposal that meets the criteria to enhance national security. The United States plans to upgrade the Space Surveillance Network with the new Air Force Space Fence, capable of detecting small objects in LEO. International compliance with common space norms is a concern. The international space community is considering more aggressive measures, such as active debris removal, to address the growing issue of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Remediation of the space environment would require significant resources, technological advances, and international cooperation. Experts recommend exploring cost-effective technologies to stabilize the future LEO environment. Active Debris Removal involves deliberate removal of debris objects from orbit to stabilize the LEO environment. NASA's long-term projection model suggests that removing at least five large objects per year over the next 100 years can stabilize the environment in 200 years, assuming 90% of launches follow mitigation guidelines. NASA's current mitigation guidelines aim to prevent further explosions or major debris releases. If international compliance with the 25-year rule falls below 90%, more intact objects may need to be removed annually. In 2009, DARPA and NASA sponsored a conference on debris removal technologies, but all options required further development and testing. Concerns exist over the dual-use nature of these technologies, which could support anti-satellite programs. DARPA's \"Catcher's Mitt\" study in 2011 highlighted the technical challenges of active debris removal. The study emphasized the need for active debris removal to reduce operational risks in space. It focused on pre-emptive removal of large debris in Low Earth Orbit and Geosynchronous Orbit. While medium-sized debris poses the greatest threat, no effective solution exists for its removal. Proposals for active debris removal mainly target large space debris objects, facing significant technical challenges. Various concepts for removing large debris were discussed in the DARPA study. The DARPA study outlined various technical approaches for capturing large space debris, including advanced rendezvous operations and grappling techniques. Proposed methods included using a net, inflatable longeron, tethered harpoon, and electrostatic/adhesive blanket. Some solutions utilized active thrust devices, while others relied on natural forces in space. Legal issues surrounding debris removal activities, such as the lack of international consensus on the definition of \"space debris,\" were highlighted. The 2010 National Space Policy limits debris removal to research and development, raising challenges for actual cleanup efforts. The legal definition of \"space debris\" is not clearly defined in current space law treaties. Ownership of space objects is governed by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which states that the launching state retains jurisdiction and control over the object. Other nations cannot interfere with or remove the object without authorization. There is no salvage right in space law, unlike in maritime law. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty governs ownership of space objects, stating the launching state retains control. International space law considers fragments as individual objects, requiring identification and consent for removal. The United States can only retrieve objects from its own registry without consent. Liability for damage caused by spacecraft is covered by the Liability Convention, holding the launching state responsible. The Liability Convention holds the launching state responsible for damage caused by its space object on Earth or to aircraft. In outer space, a fault standard is applied, with liability only if negligence is proven in spacecraft collisions. Complex fault assessments may be needed during removal operations involving multiple governments, requiring the exchange of technical information and potentially confidential data. Successful debris removal may involve negotiating licensing and nondisclosure agreements for spacecraft with U.S. content. The necessary economic, legal, political, and technical considerations for orbital debris removal have not been fully examined. Congress has addressed space debris issues in the past, acknowledging the need for a coordinated approach towards prevention and removal of orbital debris. Additional hearings from major stakeholders in various sectors may be considered to discuss proposed mitigation efforts. Possible questions for consideration in the military, intelligence, civil, and commercial sectors include the severity of the problem, adequacy of current mitigation efforts, and commitment to pursue remediation. Congress may require DOD and NASA to develop a roadmap for potential remediation programs. New resources may be needed for NASA to achieve the 2010 National Space Policy goals related to on-orbit debris research and development. If technologies for debris removal are developed, NASA's management requirements could become significant. The potential budgetary costs associated with orbital debris should be investigated by Congress, considering whether funding should come from NASA, DOD, or a combination. The threat posed by orbital debris is seen as a long-term environmental problem or a risk to U.S. security interests, particularly in satellite support for military and intelligence operations. The space debris population, especially in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), may have reached a tipping point, with catastrophic collisions driving its growth. International compliance with mitigation measures is crucial, but the threat may be worsened by accidental or intentional debris-generating events. Active debris removal is considered crucial to protect U.S. national security interests in space and ensure long-term sustainability of the space environment."
