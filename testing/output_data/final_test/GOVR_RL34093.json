The park has infrastructure for future expansion to include high-technology zones, shopping districts, and residential areas. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) in North Korea, largely developed by South Korea, serves as a symbol of engagement between the two Koreas. In 2010, the KIC accounted for $1.4 billion of the $1.9 billion total trade between the two countries. The complex has faced uncertainty due to incidents like the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel by a North Korean submarine. This report aims to analyze the role, purposes, and outcomes of the KIC, along with exploring U.S. interests and policy options. The South Korean team determined that a North Korean submarine sank a ship, leading to South Korea taking the case to the UN Security Council. President Lee Myung-bak announced restrictions on North Korean ships passing through South Korean shipping lanes, suspending North-South trade and exchanges, with exceptions for humanitarian aid. Investments in the Kaesong Industrial Complex were halted, and South Korean personnel there were reduced by 50%. North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland responded to these actions. North Korea responded to South Korea's actions by labeling them as a \"declaration of war,\" announcing the abrogation of non-aggression agreements, termination of contact with Lee's government, and halting cooperation projects. Despite threats, the Kaesong complex remained open, but South Korean workers were expelled. North Korea later fired shells onto Yeonpyeong Island, escalating tensions further. The North Korean artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island killed four South Koreans and damaged many buildings. South Korea retaliated by firing shells at North Korea, leading to increased naval exercises with the US and closer collaboration between South Korea, the US, and Japan on security matters. In a televised speech, Lee announced that South Korea would retaliate for North Korean provocations, possibly using its air force. Both Koreas hesitated to close the Kaesong Industrial Complex due to financial losses and social unrest concerns. The complex provides North Korea with a steady revenue stream and high-paying jobs for families in the area. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) is a key project for North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to pave the way for his son, Kim Jong-un. Closing the KIC could lead to significant financial hardship for South Korean companies in the park. The complex is the last remaining symbol of inter-Korean cooperation since 2000, with relations deteriorating after new developments in both Koreas. In 2007, South Korea's new conservative president Lee Myung-bak cancelled inter-Korean projects, adopted a reciprocity-based policy towards North Korea, and criticized human rights conditions. Lee's government has shown ambivalence towards the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), with the number of South Korean manufacturers in the complex nearly doubling since 2008 under his administration. Special tax breaks and support measures have been implemented for KIC companies. The Lee administration has implemented measures to support KIC companies, such as allowing them to resell their lots and reducing healthcare premiums for South Korean workers. However, plans for a major expansion of the complex have been halted, and only a small number of South Korean firms have received approval to open factories in Kaesong. Lee cancelled plans to build dormitories for North Korean workers, and it is unclear if this decision will be linked to North Korea's behavior in nuclear talks or past attacks. The Lee administration has implemented measures to support KIC companies, such as allowing them to resell their lots and reducing healthcare premiums for South Korean workers. Plans for a major expansion of the complex have been halted, and only a small number of South Korean firms have received approval to open factories in Kaesong. North Korea's behavior in nuclear talks or past attacks may influence the decision to build dormitories for North Korean workers. Kim Jong-il's reported stroke in 2008 led to a more aggressive stance by North Korea, including restrictions imposed on the KIC. The restrictions imposed on the Kaesong Industrial Complex in 2009 led to a decline in production and trapped South Korean workers. However, there was a relaxation of restrictions later that year, allowing for a possible beachhead for market reforms in North Korea. The expansion of the complex would bring in additional funds but also expose more North Koreans to outside influences. The Kaesong Industrial Complex could serve as a \"Trojan horse\" in the long term by bringing in workers from areas north of Kaesong. The United States has limited involvement in the complex, with no U.S. companies currently invested. South Korean officials aim to attract U.S. investment, but government approval is required for certain equipment shipments. The Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement includes provisions for Outward Processing Zones. The Kaesong Industrial Complex, initiated by the Hyundai Group in 1998, is located near the DMZ in North Korea. It aims to facilitate South Korean manufacturing using North Korean labor, promote economic reform in North Korea, and ease tensions. The Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement includes provisions for Outward Processing Zones like Kaesong. North Korea's Kaesong Industrial Complex, established in 1998 by Hyundai Group near the DMZ, aims to promote economic reform and ease tensions. South Korean companies in Kaesong receive incentives and rights negotiated with North Korea. The complex is a duty-free zone with no currency restrictions, visa requirements, or trials for South Korean law breakers. Corporate tax rates range from 10% to 14%, with exemptions and reductions for profitable years. The South Korean government offers low-interest loans, political risk insurance, and subsidies to companies operating in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. 25 out of 26 firms applied for loans from the Inter-Korea Cooperation Fund. Small and medium-sized firms in the KIC are eligible for state subsidies and benefits equal to those at home. Table 2 shows the master plan for the project's first three phases. The master plan for the Kaesong Industrial Complex includes three phases, with the first phase covering 800 acres and 300 South Korean firms. By the end of phase 3, the complex is expected to span 4,800 acres with 1,500 firms, employing 350,000 North Korean workers and generating $16 billion in annual production. Additionally, there will be a supporting zone with residential, commercial, and tourist facilities, as well as an Expansion Zone for future industrial use. The Kaesong Industrial Complex Master Plan includes 6,400 acres for the Industrial Zone, 6,200 acres for the Supporting Zone, 2,000 companies, 500,000 workers, and $20 billion in annual products. The aim is to attract South Korean companies seeking lower costs. By the end of 2010, 120 companies were operating in Kaesong, employing over 47,000 North Korean workers. The South Korean government provided $223 million of the initial $374 million cost for the first stage. The Kaesong Industrial Complex has various facilities such as a job training center, water supply plant, wastewater treatment plant, and electricity substation. There are plans for daily train service to connect the complex to South Korea and China, but regular service has not started yet. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea is connected to South Korea by a road with thousands of vehicles passing through checkpoints daily. In 2006, 15 companies operated in the complex, producing various products such as kitchenware, semiconductor components, apparel, footwear, and automobile parts. By 2010, the goods produced in the complex totaled $323.3 million, with textiles and clothing accounting for over half of the production. In 2010, over half of the production in the Kaesong Industrial Complex was in textiles and clothing, with electronics and metals/machinery also contributing. The complex produced a variety of products including socks, pajamas, auto parts, semiconductor parts, toner cartridges, fish nets, and motorcycle helmets. All products were shipped to South Korea for sale or export. Primary export destinations in 2010 were Australia, the European Union, Russia, and China. No local procurement of inputs or sales in North Korean markets were reported. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea primarily focuses on labor-intensive manufacturing processes using materials from South Korea for final assembly. It is unclear if South Korean companies there operate for political reasons or economic viability, as they rely on government support for infrastructure and loans. The complex offers lower labor costs, a shared language workforce, and proximity to South Korean markets, making it attractive for small and medium-sized businesses. Some companies in South Korea are using production in Kaesong as an alternative to China or elsewhere, possibly with government support. The KIC is seen as profitable for most businesses, especially for those who have struggled in China. ShinWon (clothing) is one of the early investors in Kaesong, citing advantages like lower labor costs and favorable logistics. Some South Korean companies are utilizing production in Kaesong for lower costs, favorable logistics, and to avoid nontariff barriers in China and Southeast Asia. Manufacturing 16% of clothing lines there leads to significant savings. Kaesong is considered optimal compared to factories in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Guatemala. Companies like Samduk Trading, Romanson, and Moonchang find advantages in production at the KIC, despite initial challenges with training workers and productivity levels. Woori Bank is also involved in the area. The Woori Bank in the Kaesong Industrial Complex faces challenges due to limited customer base and low demand for loans. It mainly focuses on currency exchange and offers zero interest rates on deposits. The KIC has raised concerns with U.S. policy makers regarding labor conditions, financial benefits for Pyongyang, and control of exports to Kaesong. There are questions about the conditions of North Korean workers and potential exploitation, with reports of authorities taking a portion of their wages. South Korean companies pay up to 45% of wages to Kaesong workers, but exact details are unclear. Average wages are better than in North Korea, with a minimum wage of $60.78 per month. Companies also pay a 15% social insurance fee. Minimum wage increases are capped at 5% per year, with overtime pay at 50% of the hourly rate for extended hours. In Kaesong, North Korean workers receive overtime pay at 50% for extended hours and 100% for public holidays and nighttime work. They can also earn additional pay through night shifts or weekend work. Companies may offer cash rewards as incentives, with employees typically receiving $20-$30 per month in overtime pay. Including the minimum wage, social insurance fee, and overtime payments, KIC manufacturers pay around $100 per month per employee. Workers are entitled to 14 days of vacation time and female employees receive 60 days of paid maternity leave. Labor costs in Kaesong are about 8% of those in South Korean metropolitan areas, with South Korean labor laws applying to workers in the KIC. The wages of North Korean workers in the Kaesong Industrial Complex are paid in dollars to a North Korean government agency. Despite labor laws stating wages should be paid directly to employees, the DPRK claims this is not possible due to a lack of foreign exchange centers. Deductions from the minimum monthly salary include 15% for social insurance and 30% for a socio-cultural policy fee. The remaining amount is paid to the employees. The remaining $35 of the North Korean workers' wages at the Kaesong Industrial Complex was paid in cash or chits for daily supplies. Workers verify their wages by signing a ledger or providing a pay slip. They commute to the complex by bus or bicycle provided by the management council. The workers' health has visibly improved. The health condition of workers at the KIC has improved with better nutrition. Recruitment is done by North Korea's Central Guidance Agency. South Korean hiring companies may reject recruits or hire them as trainees at reduced wages. Employers cannot freely punish or fire workers and must give instructions through North Korean managers. Labor management is challenging initially but improves as trust develops between executives and managers. A level of trust is established between South Korean executives and North Korean managers and workers at the KIC. North Korean workers lack the right to change employers, keeping labor costs stable. This practice conflicts with international workers' rights. The North Korean government earns hard currency from the project through leasing fees and worker wages. Wages are paid in dollars to a government agency, then distributed to workers in won or chits for necessities. The North Korean government earns around $2 million per month from social insurance taxes and fees collected from workers at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Hyundai Asan paid $12 million for a 50-year lease on the site, and businesses in the complex pay a commission to North Korea's job reference agency. Under an agreement on taxation, businesses in the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) are subject to a 10% to 14% corporate income tax, with exemptions for the first five years and a 50% deduction for the following three years. This tax rate is lower compared to South Korea, China, and Vietnam. The Hyundai Research Institute estimated that North Korea could gain $9.55 billion over nine years from the fully developed and successful operation of the KIC, including earnings from foreign currency, sales of industrial products, and corporate taxes. The Kaesong Industrial Complex could bring in significant gains of $9.55 billion over nine years if it progresses as planned. South Korea requested that products from the complex be considered as originating from South Korea for duty-free status under trade agreements. Various FTAs, such as with ASEAN, Singapore, and EFTA, include products from the KIC, with different levels of coverage and conditions. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in South Korea requested that products from the complex be covered by trade agreements. The 2009 EU-South Korea FTA and KORUS FTA had provisions excluding goods made in North Korea. The U.S. insisted only products from South Korea be included in the FTA. The Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement does not allow duty-free entry for products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Annex 22-B proposes a Committee on Outward Processing Zones to identify designated zones and set criteria for them. The committee will recommend zones to the governments for legislative approval. The OPZ committee, established under the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, requires \"unified consent\" for decisions, potentially giving the U.S. veto power. Criteria for designated zones include progress towards denuclearization, impact on intra-Korean relations, and adherence to environmental, labor, wage, and business standards. The committee will meet annually, and Congress has a role in deciding if products from North Korean industrial parks are included in the agreement. The OPZ Committee, established under the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, requires \"unified consent\" for decisions, potentially giving the U.S. veto power. The committee will pass decisions to the South Korean and U.S. governments for legislative approval of any amendments to the KORUS FTA. A question has arisen regarding labor standards in the KIC and whether products can be produced under conditions contrary to international norms. The KIC and the KORUS FTA raise concerns about labor standards, the origin of products, and potential cost advantages for South Korean exporters over their U.S. counterparts. There are questions about whether products made with North Korean labor can be treated as South Korean in origin under the FTA, and if intermediate products from the KIC can enter the U.S. under certain provisions. The KORUS FTA may have a marginal impact on US imports of goods with North Korean inputs. The future of KIC-made components entering the US depends more on the evolution of the KIC itself rather than the fate of the FTA. If KIC factories increase component production, South Korean and other nations' companies could use them in manufacturing final products for export. The United States maintains restrictions on business with North Korea due to its terrorism sponsor designation, requiring approval for all imports and licenses for exports and financial transactions. The Department of Commerce mandates licenses for most exports to North Korea, except for public technology and gift parcels. In FY2006, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security approved glass transmission items and software for export to the DPRK, totaling $217,519. South Korea also controls exports to the DPRK, including machinery, electronics, optics, and high-technology equipment. Personal computers require approval and must be kept secure in the KIC. The Kaesong Industrial Complex is under tight security with high-technology monitoring systems and tracking devices. North Korea agreed to improvements in operations during a summit with South Korea in 2007. The Lee government made North Korea's implementation of these improvements a precondition for funding dormitories needed for the KIC's expansion. The complex is a business venture with economic and geopolitical interests at play. The Kaesong Industrial Complex is a business venture that provides manufacturing opportunities for small and medium-sized companies in South Korea and jobs for workers in North Korea. It serves as a channel for reconciliation between the two countries and was developed as part of South Korea's sunshine policy towards the North. The Kaesong Industrial Complex serves as a bridge for communication and cultural interaction between North and South Korea, creating stakeholders with shared economic interests. It may also play a role in reforming and modernizing the North Korean economy, similar to China's experience with special economic zones in 1978. The Chinese economic system operates similarly to market capitalism. Kim Jong-il visited China to discuss economic issues and visited special economic zones. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea aims to modernize the economy but faces challenges with stalled reforms. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, unlike China's reforms, was initiated from abroad and is viewed with suspicion. Pyongyang is also trying to attract more Chinese investment in the Rason region. It is uncertain if Kaesong will succeed and have a significant impact on the North Korean economy. Geopolitically, Kaesong is part of the standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons program involving the DPRK, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia. The six-party talks address issues like North Korea's nuclear program financing, humanitarian aid, regime stability, and economic sanctions enforcement. The United States aims to halt North Korea's nuclear capabilities through a mix of sanctions and incentives in the six-party talks. Financial rewards for North Korea are contingent on progress in commitments, especially if attacks against South Korea occur. South Korea's goals towards North Korea extend beyond economic benefits. South Korea's strategy towards North Korea focuses on denuclearization, reunification, and economic reconstruction. Concerns include the cost of reunification and potential economic emigrants. The approach involves offering incentives like food and fuel, with a reliance on engagement and diplomacy. Despite North Korea's nuclear test in 2006, South Korea continued operations at the Kaesong Industrial Complex. South Korea's Kaesong Industrial Complex operations continued despite North Korea's provocations in 2010. President Lee Myung-bak plans to maintain phase 1 of the complex, aiming for economic development and potential reunification with North Korea. Beijing's economic strategy in the North, influenced by Hong Kong's return in 1997, focused on raising living standards and industrial development in Guangdong Province to prevent immigration to Hong Kong. This successful approach has even led to some immigration from Hong Kong to Guangdong. Additionally, Beijing has strengthened ties with Taiwan through various business activities. Taiwan and the east coast of China have seen growth in sectors like computer and electronics manufacturing. South Korea aims to become a hub of East Asia and is looking to connect to China, Russia, and Europe via railways passing through North Korea. As part of the KIC project, North and South Korea have reconnected a railroad line and conducted a test run. A shipment from South Korea to Hamburg, Germany would take 27 days by ship, 10 days via the Trans-Siberian Railway, and 7 days via the Trans-China Railway. The United States' three national interests are security, economic well-being, and value projection. The United States' main security concern regarding the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea is its location and potential impact on the DPRK's nuclear program and conflict with South Korea. The complex's revenue could potentially contribute to the DPRK's military capabilities, although the nuclear program likely has assured funding. Kim Jong-il's \"military first\" policy prioritizes the allocation of economic resources to the North Korean military. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea raises concerns about its revenue potentially supporting the military or nuclear program. It is unclear if any income from the complex goes directly to military purposes, but it may indirectly benefit civilian funds. The Kim regime also uses foreign exchange to maintain loyalty among elites through luxury imports. U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibit support for North Korea's military activities. Resolution 1718 and 1874 prohibit member states from funding North Korea's nuclear weapons program. The Kaesong Industrial Complex has increased engagement between North and South Korea. The border between the two countries is heavily guarded. The Kaesong Industrial Complex has facilitated engagement between North and South Korea, with limited tourist visits and family reunions. The complex has little relevance to U.S. economic interests, as U.S. companies have no investments there. However, South Korea is a significant trading partner of the United States. If progress is made in the six-party talks on denuclearization, the U.S. could potentially lift economic sanctions and re-establish diplomatic relations with North Korea. The United States may re-establish diplomatic relations with North Korea, lift economic sanctions, and grant normal trade relations status. South Korea's request to treat products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex as South Korean in origin could be a way to enable trade with the U.S. South Korean companies exporting from the complex may avoid the U.S. market due to sanctions and tariffs, giving other countries a diplomatic advantage. South Korea is likely to push for a change in U.S. policy towards the complex. South Korea may urge the United States to alter its policy on the Kaesong Industrial Complex, potentially causing tension. The KIC could serve as a model for North Koreans on market-based economies and higher labor standards. However, the current impact is limited due to the small scale of the project. The Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, while currently small in scale, has the potential to lead to economic reforms similar to China or Vietnam. This could lessen Pyongyang's control over citizens, reduce illicit trade, and integrate the country into the global economy. However, in the short term, increased revenues strengthen the regime's position. Increased revenues from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea strengthen the regime's position, making it less vulnerable to outside pressure. The commercial viability of the complex and the extent of South Korean firms' incentives are questioned. Trade between North and South Korea is government-based, unlike trade with China, potentially blunting lessons learned by Pyongyang. The United States has a mixed policy towards the complex, supporting inter-Korean projects benefiting South Korea while conditioning concessions on DPRK actions. The United States has a mixed policy towards the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, conditioning concessions on DPRK actions. Congress may express support or non-support of the exclusion of the KIC from the KORUS FTA, with disapproval likely impacting the future of the KIC with the U.S. Congressional oversight of labor conditions and reforms in the KIC may be emphasized if the FTA is approved. The United States could tighten or loosen economic sanctions on North Korea, affecting non-South Korean businesses investing in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. They could also adjust controls on technology exports to the KIC and encourage or restrict U.S. business activity there. Additionally, the U.S. government could influence other countries' decisions on including the KIC in their FTAs with South Korea and support or oppose measures for normal trading relations with North Korea. The U.S. government could impose restrictions on South Korean firms doing business in North Korea, potentially affecting the lifting of economic sanctions. Appendix A. List of Manufacturers in the Kaesong Industrial Complex."
