The Child Tax Credit Act of 1996 introduces a $500 credit per qualifying child under 18 for taxpayers who can claim a deduction for that child. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section for taxpayers with a parent or grandparent residing with them. The Child Tax Credit Act of 1996 introduces a $1000 deduction for individuals who maintain a household with parents or grandparents living with them.

Taxpayers can claim a deduction if they live with a parent or grandparent, as per the Child Tax Credit Act of 1996. The deduction is multiplied by the number of parents and grandparents.

Taxpayers residing with a parent or grandparent can claim a deduction under the Child Tax Credit Act of 1996. The deduction is multiplied by the number of parents and grandparents. Effective after December 31, 1996, the amendments apply to taxable years. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the capital gains rate for qualified principal residence gain for individuals with taxable income exceeding 15 percent. This provision applies if the taxpayer has qualified principal residence gain for the taxable year. The subsection reduces the capital gains rate for qualified principal residence gain for individuals with taxable income exceeding 15 percent. It includes 15 percent of qualified principal residence gain and additional percentages based on income brackets. The term 'qualified principal residence gain' refers to the gain from selling a qualified principal residence during the taxable year, minus any gain excluded from gross income under section 121 and any gain not recognized. The qualified principal residence gain is limited to $90,000 or the net capital gain for the taxable year. A qualified principal residence is a residence that meets the requirements of section 121(a)(2) after applying section 121(d). The amendment applies to gain from sales or exchanges of principal residences after December 31, 1996, for taxable years beginning after that date. Rules similar to section 121(d)(5) apply to property used in part as a principal residence. The net capital gain for any taxable year is reduced by the amount the taxpayer elects to take into account as investment income under section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii). SEC. 1022 introduces an adjusted basis for the principal residence in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It applies to gain from sales or exchanges of principal residences after December 31, 1996, for taxable years beginning after that date. The adjusted basis for determining gain from the sale of a principal residence is the indexed basis, which includes the adjusted basis of the residence and an applicable inflation adjustment. The gross domestic product deflator is used to calculate the percentage for determining gain from the sale of a principal residence. It is based on the difference between the deflator when the residence is sold and when it was acquired by the taxpayer. The deflator is the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product for a specific quarter. The adjusted basis of a principal residence can be increased by $1,000 or more due to improvements made during the taxable year. These improvements are treated as if they were a separate residence acquired at the end of the year, according to regulations set by the Secretary. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part II of subchapter O of chapter 1 of the Code. Sec. 1022 adjusts the basis of a principal residence. The amendments apply to residences sold after December 31, 1996, for taxable years after that date."
