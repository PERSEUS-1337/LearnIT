The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in areas such as ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and oceans. NOAA was created in 1970 to unify environmental activities and protect the environment. NOAA has evolved into five line offices: NESDIS, NMFS, NOS, NWS, and OAR. Program Support includes the NOAA Education Program, Corporate Services, Facilities, and OMAO. A budget neutral reorganization proposed establishing a Climate Service line office to bring together climate capabilities and funding from NWS, NESDIS, and OAR. The goal is to establish a Climate Service. The establishment of a Climate Service at NOAA was blocked in FY2011 and faced funding challenges in FY2012. The proposed reorganization aimed to strengthen NOAA's contributions to climate science by creating a more efficient management structure. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a lower funding level for the Climate Service line office at $161.5 million.

The FY2012 appropriation includes a provision requiring the FBI to report on the final operating capability. The OIG also found that the FBI had taken steps to respond to WMD incidents, but other DOJ components were not as prepared. Additionally, an audit in April 2010 revealed that the FBI used more resources than allocated for national security and other priorities from FY2005 to FY2009. The FBI allocated fewer resources for traditional crime matters due to national priorities like counterterrorism and cybercrime. For FY2010, $4.762 billion and 18,547 fulltime equivalent positions were allocated for counterterrorism/counterintelligence.

For FY2011 through FY2012, Congress increased direct appropriations for ATF from $1.113 billion to $1.152 billion, a 3.5% increase. Funding restrictions were made permanent law, prohibiting DOJ from consolidating gun dealer records and ATF from electronically retrieving firearm transfer records. The conference report language prohibits the FBI from charging fees for Brady background checks and requires the destruction of related records within 24 hours. ATF is directed to report annually on firearm trace requests for Mexican authorities. There is no call for an independent investigator for allegations of mishandling Southwest border gun trafficking investigations, but DOJ and ATF are urged to cooperate with congressional oversight efforts. The Senate recommended $1.09 billion for ATF in FY2012, which is less than the FY2011-enacted amount and the Administration's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $1.111 billion for ATF, also less than the FY2011-enacted amount and the Administration's FY2012 request. The act includes provisions related to firearms delivery to drug cartels and importation of shotguns, but does not prohibit ATF from collecting multiple rifle sales reports from licensed gun dealers. The FY2012 request for ATF was $34.8 million higher than the enacted FY2011 appropriation, with a $1.5 million budget enhancement for electronic surveillance capabilities. Both Senate and House marks proposed reductions in ATF services. ATF's efforts to reduce illegal gun trafficking under Project Gunrunner have sparked controversy. Licensed gun dealers in Southwest border states are required to submit multiple sales reports on certain rifles to identify possible straw purchasers and gun traffickers. ATF is alleged to have allowed firearms to be transferred to suspected straw purchasers, who then smuggled them across the border for larger investigations. Some of these firearms were used in the deaths of U.S. federal agents and seized in Mexico. DOJ OIG recommended ATF develop a reporting requirement for multiple long gun sales. The DOJ OIG recommended that ATF develop a reporting requirement for multiple long gun sales due to Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations' preference for military-style firearms. ATF was urged to focus on complex criminal conspiracies involving high-level traffickers rather than low-level straw purchasers. DOJ and ATF published an emergency notice for information collection, requesting OMB approval, which was initially denied but later approved in July 2011. ATF is set to require federal firearms licensees in Southwest border states to report multiple sales to ATF. ATF requires federal firearms licensees in Southwest border states to report multiple sales of certain rifles to ATF within a five-day period. OMB approved the initiative for a three-year period, despite opposition from some Members of Congress who argue for statutory authority similar to that for multiple handgun sales reporting. In February 2011, ATF and Project Gunrunner faced scrutiny for Operation Fast and Furious in Phoenix, AZ. Suspected straw purchasers were allowed to acquire large quantities of firearms for trafficking investigations. Some firearms \"walked\" to criminals before ATF intervened, with some possibly ending up in Mexico. Two AK-47 style rifles were found at a shootout near the U.S.-Mexico border involving U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. ATF acknowledged that 195 firearms purchased as part of Operation Fast and Furious were recovered in Mexico. Questions arose about a firearm used in the murder of U.S. ICE Special Agent Jamie Zapata, possibly linked to a Houston-based ATF Project Gunrunner investigation. Representative Issa and Senator Grassley issued a report on Operation Fast and Furious, revealing concerns of ATF supervisors witnessing illegal firearm transfers during surveillance operations. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on ATF agents witnessing illegal firearm transfers during surveillance operations. Representative Issa expressed concern about DOJ's lack of cooperation in investigating how firearms ended up at crime scenes in Mexico and the Southwest border. Representative Elijah E. Cummings issued a report and held a forum to explore issues raised by ATF line supervisors regarding the penalties for firearm straw purchases. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform discussed gun control proposals related to firearm straw purchases, gun shows, semiautomatic assault weapons, and .50-caliber sniper rifles. A follow-up hearing on Operation Fast and Furious was held on July 26, 2011, where it was found that ATF and DOJ leadership had not informed key authorities about the investigation, leading to increased concerns about illegal firearms in Mexico. Operation Fast and Furious, a controversial investigation involving both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officers, resulted in the recovery of 227 firearms in Mexico and 363 in the United States. The investigation led to indictments of 20 individuals for straw purchasing and other federal offenses, with ongoing efforts to arrest high-level traffickers. Despite initial positive results, the operation faced criticism after Border Patrol Agent Terry was killed in a firefight where firearms connected to the operation were found. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended appointing an independent investigator to conduct a thorough investigation of allegations against ATF regarding Operation Fast and Furious. They called for full cooperation from DOJ and ATF in oversight investigations. The Senate Committee emphasized that Operation Fast and Furious was just a small part of ATF's border operations. Operation Fast and Furious led to the reassignment of Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson. The Senate adopted an amendment prohibiting federal law enforcement officers from facilitating the transfer of firearms to individuals connected to drug cartels without continuous monitoring. ATF released a report on the importability of certain shotguns with specific features. The ATF released a report on the importability of shotguns with non-sporting features, leading to concerns about potential import restrictions. The House Committee on Appropriations adopted an amendment to prevent ATF from implementing new import restrictions on shotguns. The DOJ OIG reported on oversight issues related to ATF's shared jurisdiction with the FBI for explosives investigations and its efforts to fulfill ESF #13 obligations. The OIG found that coordination between ATF and FBI for explosives investigations was lacking, hindering effective response to crimes involving explosives. Additionally, ATF's concept of operations plan for ESF #13 was incomplete as of March 2010, leading to delays in appointing coordinators and providing operational training. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was established in 1930 to house federal inmates and ensure centralized administration of the federal prison system. BOP's mission is to confine offenders in safe, humane facilities and provide opportunities for self-improvement. BOP operates 117 correctional facilities and contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers (RRC) to assist inmates nearing release. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) operates Residential Re-entry Centers (RRC) to assist inmates nearing release by providing structured environments, employment counseling, job placement services, and other programs. Congress funds BOP through two accounts: Salaries and Expenses (S&E) for inmate custody and care, and Buildings and Facilities (B&F) for facility construction and maintenance. Congress appropriates funding for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) for inmate custody, care, and facility maintenance. The FY2012 budget for BOP is $6.644 billion, slightly lower than the Senate's recommendation but higher than the House committee's recommendation. This amount is also below the Administration's request but higher than the FY2011 appropriation. The FY2012 budget for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is $6.644 billion, slightly lower than the Senate's recommendation and higher than the House committee's recommendation. It is also below the Administration's request but higher than the FY2011 appropriation. The federal prison population has been growing, leading to overcrowding in BOP facilities. The number of inmates has increased from 125,560 in FY2000 to 177,934 in FY2011, with prison crowding reaching 39% over capacity. BOP predicts that by FY2018, the system will be operating at 41% over capacity. This growth has strained BOP's ability to manage and care for inmates, with the staff-to-inmate ratio increasing from 3.57 to 1 in FY1997 to 4.82 to 1 in FY2010. The growing federal prison population has required BOP to dedicate more resources to caring and providing programming for inmates. The Administration requested $256.0 million in program changes to cover costs associated with more inmates, activate new facilities, increase staffing levels, and expand substance abuse treatment and vocational education. The House committee-reported bill did not include funding for most activities, but proposed a $30.0 million increase for BOP's FY2012 appropriation. The Senate planned to increase BOP's S&E account by nearly $308 million to fill vacant correctional worker positions and meet staffing levels for managing the federal prison population. The committee included funding for BOP to meet the 90% staffing level required for federal prisons and activate prisons that have been built but not opened due to budget constraints. The FY2012 appropriation for BOP includes a $268.9 million increase for S&E account.

The House Committee recommended $1.309 billion for FY2012, 23.5% less than the Administration's request and 22.9% less than FY2011. The FY2012 requested appropriation for OJP was $1.715 billion, a 1.0% increase from FY2011. Congress debated whether to reduce funding for grant programs due to federal deficits. Controversy arose over proposals to cut DOJ grant programs, with opponents arguing for the importance of these programs in fighting crime and ensuring public safety, while proponents advocated for cuts citing state budget shortfalls. Proponents argue for cuts to DOJ grant programs due to state budget shortfalls and federal deficits. Congress reduced OJP's funding by 5.5% in FY2012, eliminating funding for some programs and consolidating others. The FY2012 appropriation for the Justice Assistance account is $113.0 million, which is significantly lower than previous recommendations and appropriations.

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to advise the President on scientific, engineering, and technological issues. The OSTP director also oversees the National Science and Technology Council and co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is part of the Executive Office of the President and advises on science and technology policy. A law prohibited OSTP from collaborating with China without specific authorization. OSTP Director John Holdren stated that certain applications of this law would infringe upon the President's authority. In October 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that OSTP's funding of its participation in U.S.-China dialogues violated a law prohibiting such activities without specific authorization. This led to obligations exceeding appropriated funds, resulting in a violation of the Antideficiency Act. The House Committee on Appropriations expects comprehensive enforcement of the law. The conference agreement provides $4.5 million for OSTP in FY2012, with restrictions on activities involving sensitive technology transfer to China. Certification is required for activities posing no risk of transfer, to be submitted to House and Senate Committees 14 days prior. The conference agreement supports OSTP efforts in developing a federal STEM education strategic plan and coordinating federal investments in neuroscience research. The Senate proposed $6.0 million for OSTP, 100.2% more than the House recommendation, 9.8% less than the Administration's request, and 9.7% less than the FY2011 amount. The House Committee on Appropriations would have provided $3.0 million, 54.9% less than the Administration's request and the FY2011 amount.
