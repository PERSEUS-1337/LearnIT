The Act also grants flexibility in furnishing telehealth services for ACOs, including remote patient monitoring and home-based video conferencing services in connection with home health services. The Secretary may revoke a waiver granted under paragraph (3) at their discretion. The Secretary shall permit an ACO to distribute internal cost savings among its participants. The ACO Improvement Act of 2016 allows Medicare beneficiaries to select their primary care ACO professional and receive information about the program. ACOs can distribute internal cost savings among participants if certain requirements are met, including no reduction in medically necessary care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The ACO Improvement Act of 2016 allows Medicare beneficiaries to select their primary care ACO professional and receive information about the program. Participation in the arrangement by providers is voluntary, transparent, and subject to audit by the Secretary. ACO participants must meet quality performance standards and payment methodology should not be based on referrals or business generated. The ACO must report methodology for distributing cost savings among participants and how the arrangement will improve quality and patient experience while achieving cost savings. The ACO must report on the methodology for distributing cost savings among participants and improving quality and patient experience while achieving cost savings. The criteria for participation in the internal cost savings sharing arrangement and a distribution plan must be included. The Secretary can waive provisions of this title and title XI as needed. The \"sharing arrangement\" among ACO participants involves distributing internal cost savings solely from collaborative efforts to improve care for Medicare beneficiaries, excluding shared savings under subsection (d)(2). The distribution of internal cost savings refers to a percentage payment. The term 'cost savings' refers to a payment of a percentage of gains or savings from an internal cost sharing arrangement to ACO participants. This amendment applies retroactively to Public Law 111-148, and providers and suppliers participating in an ACO voluntarily engage in this sharing arrangement. Enactment of section 3021 of Public Law 111-148 allows for distributions of internal cost savings under sharing arrangements for participants in accountable care organization models tested under section 1115A of the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will study the feasibility of providing electronic access to Medicare claims data for providers and suppliers. The system may be a modification of an existing database, such as the Virtual Research Data Center, to ensure security and privacy of beneficiary and provider information. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with recommendations within six months of the enactment of this Act. Additionally, Section 1899(c) of the Social Security Act is amended to consider services of non-physician practitioners in ACOs in rural or underserved areas. In the case of an ACO located in a rural or medically underserved area, the determination of minimum enrollment requirements will be based on primary care services utilization. The Secretary may allow ACOs with fewer than 5,000 participants a de minimis variation (not exceeding 100) to continue participation if it does not negatively impact the program. (e) Payments for Shared Savings.--The Secretary may increase payments by up to 10 percentage points for ACOs meeting quality standards. The increase will not affect other ACOs' payments. (f) Demonstration for Allowing Growth of HCC Scores.--The Secretary will establish a 3-yr demonstration to allow growth of HCC scores. The Secretary will establish a 3-year demonstration project to develop a methodology for growth of HCC scores for continuously enrolled ACO members. A report on the results will be submitted to Congress. Additionally, the Secretary may create incentives for ACO development by making successful pilot programs permanent and submitting recommendations to Congress."
