    "content": "To analyze deep ReLU networks, a student-teacher setting is used where an over-parameterized student network learns from a fixed teacher network with SGD. The study proves that in the interpolation setting, there is alignment between student and teacher nodes in the lowest layer, leading to generalization in unseen data. Additionally, analysis of 2-layer networks shows that strong teacher nodes are learned first, while subtle nodes are left unlearned until later stages of training, resulting in slow convergence to small-gradient critical points. Our analysis shows that over-parameterization is crucial for alignment at critical points and improves generalization by allowing student nodes to cover more teacher nodes efficiently. Experimental results support this finding, highlighting the importance of understanding how deep learning achieves strong generalization. In this paper, deep ReLU networks with a teacher-student setting are analyzed. The student network is over-realized compared to the teacher, with a larger number of nodes at each layer. This over-realization is linked to the width of networks and serves as a measure of over-parameterization. The student-teacher setting has a long history and is gaining interest in analyzing 2-layered networks. In analyzing 2-layered networks, using a teacher network can lead to better generalization. Specialization, where student nodes become correlated with teacher nodes, is crucial. When all student nodes specialize to the teacher, generalization performance improves. This phenomenon has been observed empirically in both 2-layer and multi-layer networks. However, theoretical analysis is limited due to strong assumptions. The paper discusses the limitations of theoretical analysis in neural networks due to strong assumptions. It introduces a new approach with arbitrary training distribution and finite input dimension, showing that small gradients lead to improved performance. Previous studies have focused on the student-teacher setting, analyzing the behavior of student nodes towards the teacher in 1-hidden layer cases. Recent works have made the analysis rigorous and demonstrated the effectiveness of random initialization and training with SGD. The curr_chunk discusses the specialization of student nodes in neural networks with random initialization and training with SGD. It compares previous studies on 1-hidden layer cases with new findings on deep ReLU networks without parametric assumptions. Specialization occurs around SGD critical points in the lowest layer, and local minima are global in deep linear networks. In deep ReLU networks, local minima can be global with invertible activation functions and distinct training samples. Spurious local minima can occur in GD with population or empirical loss, even in two-layered networks. The work provides a generic formulation for deep ReLU networks and discusses recovery properties in the student-teacher setting. Recent studies show global convergence of GD for multi-layer networks. Recent studies have shown global convergence of gradient descent for multi-layer networks with infinite width. Different works have demonstrated convergence in over-parameterized networks with optimal transport and mild over-realization assumptions. For deep linear networks, various studies have explored training dynamics with interesting results. In deep linear networks, training dynamics have been explored with interesting results. Lampinen & Ganguli (2019) show that weight components with large singular values are learned first. Specialization in deep ReLU networks is analyzed rigorously for the first time. The generalization property of linear networks can be studied in the teacher-student setting. In multi-layered networks with ReLU nonlinearity, activation, gating functions, and backpropagated gradients are key components. Both teacher and student networks have L layers, with different numbers of nodes in each layer. Weight matrices connect the layers, with gating functions determining the flow of gradients. In multi-layered networks with ReLU nonlinearity, activation, gating functions, and backpropagated gradients are key components. The input layer has f0(x) = x \u2208 Rn0 and m0 = n0. The teacher's outputs are denoted by * and remain constant throughout training. Gradient descent is used in both SGD and GD, with bias terms included. The objective is for student nodes to specialize to teacher nodes at the same layers. The text discusses the possibility of student nodes specializing to teacher nodes at the same layers in multi-layered networks with ReLU nonlinearity. The backpropagated gradients and mixture coefficients play a crucial role in this process, as shown by Lemma 1 and Corollary 1. The input data distribution and training set are key factors in determining the behavior of the network layers. At SGD critical points, teacher nodes align with student nodes due to ReLU node properties and subset sampling. Specialization occurs when teacher weights are recovered by students in the same layer. At SGD critical points, teacher nodes align with student nodes due to ReLU node properties and subset sampling. Specialization occurs when teacher weights are recovered by students in the same layer. Theorem 5 demonstrates alignment/specialization in noisy cases, with conditions imposed on the teacher network to avoid reconstruction issues. The teacher network must have non-co-linear weights and distinct boundaries for effective learning. The teacher network must have non-co-linear weights and distinct boundaries for effective learning. In the 2-layer case, ReLU activations can be proven to be mutually linear independent when input values are diverse. Zero gradient indicates that the summation of coefficients of co-linear ReLU nodes is zero. Alignment between teacher and student nodes is crucial for effective learning. Teacher nodes must have distinct boundaries and non-co-linear weights. Overparameterization with more student nodes increases the likelihood of alignment, leading to better generalization. If student nodes are not aligned with the teacher, they can still contribute by observing other student nodes. Theorem 3 states that unaligned student nodes with independent observers have zero contribution at the SGD critical point. With enough observers, all unaligned student nodes' contributions become zero. This analysis focuses on the critical point rather than the dynamics, contrasting with Theorem 5 which examines fan-out weights upon convergence in 2-layer networks. The text discusses the behavior of individual data points contributing to loss in a local minima of gradient descent, without imposing linear separability. It uses Lemma 1 for deep ReLU networks to analyze the lowest layer in multiple layer cases, where A1(x) and B1(x) are piece-wise constant. Theorem 4 discusses student-teacher alignment in multiple layers at SGD critical points. The text discusses student-teacher alignment in multiple layers at SGD critical points, emphasizing the bottom-up training approach in backpropagation. It highlights the alignment of activations at each layer until the student matches with the teacher across all layers. This process is consistent with previous works showing that networks are learned in a bottom-up manner. The text discusses the alignment of activations in multiple layers during SGD critical points, emphasizing a bottom-up training approach in backpropagation. It highlights the critical path from student nodes at the lowest layer to the output, accelerating convergence. The small gradient case is also considered, showing that rough specialization still occurs. The ratio of recovery for weights and biases is shown as a function of angle. The text discusses student specialization during SGD critical points, questioning if running SGD long enough is sufficient to achieve these points. Previous works show discrepancies in recovering teacher network parameters, with some showing specialization. The text discusses discrepancies in recovering teacher network parameters in deep ReLU networks, highlighting issues with student specialization and the dynamics of singular values. The text discusses the dynamics of weight magnitude in deep ReLU networks and the alignment between node activation and residual in the training procedure. It also explores the convergence of weight towards teacher nodes. The text discusses the spectrum property of the PSD matrix G kj in deep ReLU networks. It explains how the direction and magnitude of weight updates are influenced by the alignment between teacher nodes. The dynamics of weight magnitude are analyzed, considering the angle between weights and the convergence towards teacher nodes. The dynamics of weight magnitude in deep ReLU networks are analyzed, considering the alignment between teacher nodes. The residue of node k is defined as w k r k, where r k is time-varying. Different student nodes are specialized based on their correlation to teachers and fan-out weight norm. In a special case, r k = w * - k a k w k, showing a relationship between weight updates and convergence towards teacher nodes. The system provides negative feedback until the ratio between nodes remains constant. The net effect can be different for each student, leading to complicated dynamic behavior in neural network training. Symmetry breaking occurs when a small delta is added to a node, causing exponential growth in the ratio between nodes. Strong teacher nodes are learned first in this process. The system provides negative feedback until the ratio between nodes remains constant, leading to complicated dynamic behavior in neural network training. Strong teacher nodes are learned first, biasing towards the largest teacher node, followed by a shift towards weaker teacher nodes for student nodes. This process continues until convergence, with student nodes shifting focus towards the dominant teacher node. The system provides negative feedback to shift student nodes from strong to weak teacher nodes, leading to slow convergence. Over-realization with more student nodes ready for shifting accelerates convergence. Alternatively, reinitializing student nodes can also help. The theoretical findings are verified on a synthetic dataset. The input dataset is generated using N (0, \u03c3 2 I) with \u03c3 = 10, with 10k samples for training and evaluation. For deep ReLU networks, the dataset is regenerated after every epoch. The correlation between nodes is computed based on activation vectors. The study verifies Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 in a 2-layer setting, showing how student nodes correlate with different teacher nodes over time. The dataset is regenerated with the input distribution after each epoch, and the lower layer learns first. The lower layer learns first in deep ReLU networks, with nodes showing specialization at multiple hidden layers. The plot illustrates the learning progression, with over-realization impacting the matching rate between teacher and student nodes. The plot shows that stronger teacher nodes are more likely to be matched successfully with students, especially when the teacher nodes are polarized. Over-realized students can explain more teacher nodes, but weak teacher nodes are hard to capture. Training dynamics involve setting up diverse strengths of teacher nodes. The teacher polarity factor p controls energy decay across teacher nodes. Student nodes specialize with teacher polarity p = 1. Students tend to specialize to a strong teacher node first. The evolution of student correlation to teacher over iterations is shown. Many student nodes specialize to a strong teacher node initially. The student nodes specialize to a strong teacher node first, followed by weaker teacher nodes after many epochs. A teacher network is pre-trained on CIFAR-10 and pruned to keep strong teacher nodes. The student network is over-realized based on the teacher's remaining channels, leading to specialization at all layers and improved generalization on CIFAR-10 evaluation set. In this paper, a deep ReLU student network is trained with SGD in a student-teacher setting to analyze how it learns from a teacher. The teacher network is recovered in the lowest layer when the student weights are near critical points. Training dynamics show that strong teacher nodes are reconstructed first, while weak teacher nodes are reconstructed slowly, explaining why training takes long and generalization improves with more training. The next step is to extend the analysis to a finite sample case and verify insights on a large dataset like ImageNet. The insights from theoretical analysis on a large dataset like ImageNet are crucial. The mean of the max teacher correlation with student nodes in CIFAR10 shows that more over-realization leads to better student specialization and strong generalization. The condition D L (x) = I C\u00d7C holds, and for any batch, Eqn. 1 vanishes. By simple Gaussian elimination, it is proven that U = 0, leading to the theorem that U i = 0 for any i. The theorem is proven by showing that U i = 0 for any i, based on the condition D L (x) = I C\u00d7C and simple Gaussian elimination. If f l\u22121 (x;\u0174) has a bias term, then g l (x;\u0174) \u221e \u2264 . The piece-wise constant nature of V l (x) and V * l (x) for all layers l = 1, . . . L is established, leading to A l (x) and B l (x) being piece-wise constant with respect to input x. A l (x) and B l (x) are piece-wise constant with respect to input x, separating region R 0 into constant regions. Lemma 2 discusses ReLU activation functions and conditions for all c j = 0. The proof involves selecting a point x 0 and considering an -ball B x0. Lemma 3 discusses the independence of ReLU nodes in an open set R, with conditions for c j = 0. The proof involves selecting a point x 0 and considering a ball B x0. Lemma 5 discusses the alignment of data points on misalignment between hyperplanes. It proves the existence of vectors u j \u22a5w j and w j \u0169 j = sin \u03b8 jj. The conditions for nodes in an open set R with ReLU nodes are also outlined. The theorem holds if |c j | or |b j \u2212 b j | > M 2 1\u22122\u03b4 /|c j |. Lemma 4 shows that for x \u2208 \u2202E j, if w j x = \u2212q j, then a j \u2264 2q j |c j |/M K 1\u2212\u03b4. Consider a d \u2212 1-dimensional sphere B \u2286 \u2126 j with radius r, where the intersection of I j \u2229 B is bounded. If |w j x| \u2264 q j for x \u2208 \u2126 j, then I j \u2229 B = \u2205, leading to a contradiction. The theorem states that if certain conditions are met for ReLU nodes in an open set, then there exists a node satisfying specific inequalities. This is proven using a volume argument and the definition of M. The theorem states that specific conditions for ReLU nodes in an open set lead to the existence of a node satisfying certain inequalities. This is proven using a volume argument and the definition of M. In the proof, it is shown that certain points are on the same side of the boundary, leading to a contradiction. The theorem establishes conditions for ReLU nodes in an open set, leading to the existence of a node satisfying specific inequalities. This is proven using a volume argument and the definition of M. The text discusses the independence of nodes 1 and B 1 from input x, and the partitioning of teacher and student nodes based on co-linearity. The text discusses conditions for ReLU nodes in an open set, showing the existence of a node satisfying specific inequalities. It involves the partitioning of teacher and student nodes based on co-linearity, with a focus on the contribution of student nodes not aligned with any teacher nodes. In the multi-layer case, A l (x) and B l (x) are no longer constant. In a multi-layered network, A l (x) and B l (x) are piece-wise constant functions over the input R 0, which can be partitioned into different regions. The teacher network is constructed with distinct filters at each layer, with specific dimensions for both two-layered and multi-layered networks. The teacher network is constructed with distinct filters at each layer to make their boundaries visible in the dataset. Training the model involves using vanilla SGD with a learning rate of 0.01 and batch size of 16. Results on a 4-layer ReLU network show similarities, but Theorem 3 may not hold in a multi-layer setting. Testing is done on both Gaussian and uniform distributions, with 100k data points sampled in each epoch. The teacher network's normalized correlations are close to 1.0 at all layers, with large \u03b2 kk (x) values in the range of -15 to 15."
