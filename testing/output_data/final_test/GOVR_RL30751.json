    "content": "The illicit diamond trade, including conflict diamonds, poses challenges due to the large and concentrated nature of the diamond market. It is difficult to regulate and is linked to criminal activities like money laundering and arms trafficking. Regulatory proposals aim to end the trade in conflict diamonds. In 2001, the global diamond mine output was valued at $7.885 billion, with a rise in exports of rough diamonds in 2002. The De Beers Diamond Trading Company sold $5.67 billion worth of rough diamonds in 2000. U.S. market demand for diamonds remains high. The U.S. diamond market is the largest globally, with the majority of diamonds being imported. Rough diamond imports totaled $597.38 million in 2001, while worked but unmounted diamonds were valued at $9.17 billion in 1999. U.S. diamond imports support a significant retail jewelry market, with estimates placing the total U.S. retail market for diamond jewelry at $11.71 billion in 2001. The U.S. retail jewelry market was valued at $39.53 billion in 2001 and $39.8 billion in 2000. The global diamond jewelry retail market was worth $57.5 billion in 2000, with conflict diamonds estimated to make up 3.7% of world diamond production in 1999. Some sources suggest the conflict diamond trade could have comprised up to 15% of the world trade in recent years. The global diamond jewelry retail market was worth $57.5 billion in 2000, with conflict diamonds estimated to make up 3.7% of world diamond production in 1999. In 2002, it was stated that conflict diamonds account for less than 2% of world rough diamond production, possibly due to the end of wars in key sources like Angola and Sierra Leone. The current proportion of conflict-related stones in the world diamond market is difficult to estimate accurately. The reliability of conflict diamond statistics is often questionable due to the lack of credible data, especially in countries where conflict diamonds are mined. Estimates of annual diamond production and trade value vary widely, making it difficult to accurately assess the impact of conflict diamonds on the market. The difficulty in estimating the volumes and value of unreported conflict diamonds makes it challenging to differentiate them from other illicitly-traded diamonds. Despite the lack of verifiable data, advocates argue that regulating the diamond trade is necessary to address the issue. Advocates stress the volatility in regions affected by diamond-related political unrest and conflict, with many of the same actors involved in diamond extraction and marketing operations. Diamonds continue to spark localized conflicts over mining or trading rights. Bolstering states' ability to regulate the diamond trade may prevent future conflicts and enable countries to use diamond wealth for national development. Industry representatives generally support these views. The origin of diamonds is being identified to prevent illicit sellers from entering the legitimate international commerce. Three primary approaches for determining diamond origin have been proposed, including physical or \"Geo-Chemical\" identification using plasma mass spectrometry. This research aims to establish common characteristics of diamonds from similar areas or pinpoint unique characteristics of individual diamonds. Identification of diamond origin is crucial for tracking purposes, utilizing visual assessments and various scanning technologies. However, geo-chemical and automated identification methods are not yet perfected and are likely to remain expensive. Additionally, physical characteristics used for identification may be altered or destroyed during cutting and polishing, while alluvial diamonds can be carried far from their original locations. Tagging of Diamonds involves using laser and ion beam technologies to inscribe identifying information on individual diamonds, such as microscopic bar codes or unique spectral features. The costs of this technology currently limit its widespread use in the diamond industry, but prices may decrease in the future. Critics point out that identifying marks on diamonds can be physically altered or removed. The Certificate of Origin Laws aim to establish a chain of warranties from mining origin to importation or retail level, validating the legal origin of diamonds. This regulatory approach is supported by the Diamond High Council (HRD), a trade organization in the diamond industry. The Diamond High Council (HRD) in Antwerp, Belgium, works closely with the Belgian government and African governments to establish forgery-proof certificate of origin systems for diamond exports. They have assisted Angola, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Uganda in this regard. The Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs has mandated diamond imports from specific African countries to comply with these regulations since February 2, 2000. In 2000, diamond imports from several African countries required licensing under individual dealers' names. Government certificate of origin systems exist in these countries. The HRD stated that Belgian officials will investigate diamonds that may not originate from the country of export. The World Diamond Council called for a global export certification system in July 2000. The World Diamond Council called for a global export certification system in July 2000, which would establish export control mechanisms, require ethical codes of business practice, and cooperation in monitoring compliance with trade laws. This system would be underpinned by national legislation in participating countries and involve criminal penalties for illicit diamond trading. The creation of the World Diamond Council was chartered by the WFDB and IDMA under the Antwerp Resolution. The World Diamond Council, chartered by the WFDB and IDMA, held an inaugural policy planning meeting in Tel Aviv, Israel in September 2000. The WDC proposed government regulation of diamond trading, an international certification system, and ethical codes to combat conflict diamonds. They urged governments to enact legislation supporting these goals, influencing the Kimberley Process system. The World Diamond Council hired a law and lobbying firm to draft model legislation to influence proposed congressional legislation. De Beers, under the trademark initials DTC, guarantees not to purchase or sell conflict diamonds and introduced formal rules for its wholesale rough diamond buyers. In 2000, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution to end the conflict diamond trade by creating an international certification scheme for rough diamonds. This resolution was sponsored by 50 countries, including the United States, and aimed to break the link between rough diamonds and armed conflict. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2000 to create a certification scheme for rough diamonds, emphasizing transparency and international standards. The Kimberley Process was established as an intergovernmental forum to address the conflict diamond issue. The Kimberley Process was formed to prevent trade in conflict diamonds through a certification system involving industry representatives and NGOs. Its main goal is to help diamond-producing countries regulate production, commerce, and tax collection for socio-economic development. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was finalized in November 2002. The Interlaken Declaration, signed by the United States and 47 other governments, launched the Certification Scheme on January 1, 2003. This scheme aims to control and track the diamond trade to prevent the circulation of conflict diamonds and illegal exports. The U.N. Security Council endorsed the Kimberley Process and the Declaration in January 2003. The Kimberley Process originated from the Technical Forum on Diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa, sponsored by South Africa in May 2000. The Kimberley Process was established in May 2000 in South Africa to address the issue of conflict diamonds. It was determined that a reliable system for identifying the origin of diamonds did not exist, leading to the recommendation of an international export control regime with sealed parcels and certificates of origin. This system could be overseen by an inter-governmental authority and may be organized under U.N. auspices. The Kimberley Process, established in 2000 to address conflict diamonds, required legal sanctions for violations of export controls. Flexibility was needed for alluvial diamond mining and small-scale production. Participants recommended transparency and oversight in diamond operations. Early proposals like extensive compliance monitoring were rejected. The \"expanded\" Kimberley Process, known as Kimberley-Plus, continued in 2001. In 2001, the Kimberley Process, also known as Kimberley-Plus, continued with meetings in various countries to review findings and create a roadmap for future focus. A Task Force was established to coordinate the work and meetings of the Process. The formal recommendations were presented to the U.N. General Assembly, which endorsed the Process and requested a progress report for the next session. Meetings and negotiations in 2002 led to the Interlaken Declaration. The Kimberley Process in 2002 culminated in the Interlaken Declaration, bringing together various entities to negotiate key issues such as the binding nature of the scheme, defining conflict diamonds, and compiling trade statistics. Non-governmental organizations criticized the finalized scheme for lacking an adequate system for collating and disseminating production and trade statistics. The debate surrounding the Kimberley Process included discussions on compliance monitoring, standards for assessment, and the need for independent audit organizations. Non-governmental organizations expressed concerns about the lack of adequate monitoring in the Interlaken Declaration, stating that the system remained open to abuse. Additionally, questions arose about the scheme's compliance with World Trade Organization rules and other international trade agreements. Successful implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme requires signatory nations to enforce regulatory processes and legislation compliant with the scheme. The industry has proposed a self-regulation system to meet Kimberley Process requirements. The first post-implementation plenary session is scheduled in Johannesburg, South Africa. The upcoming Kimberley Process meeting in Johannesburg will address key issues such as the need for an independent monitoring system, criteria for countries to join, and concerns about applicant states meeting requirements. The upcoming Kimberley Process meeting in Johannesburg will discuss the challenges of implementing the Process, ensuring national laws are compatible, establishing a uniform system for reporting diamond trade statistics, providing technical assistance to states in need, and the history of efforts to end trade in conflict diamonds. The Clinton Administration proposed a regime to combat the trade in conflict diamonds, aiming to protect legitimate diamond-producing African states. The Kimberly Process became a key focus of US efforts in this regard, with conferences sponsored by the administration. The Clinton Administration sponsored conferences on conflict diamond-producing states, consulted with the American diamond industry, and pushed for international sanctions on illicit diamond trading. They also took unilateral actions to penalize governments involved in the trade of conflict diamonds. The Clinton Administration implemented sanctions on individuals and governments involved in supporting the Revolutionary United Front rebels in Sierra Leone through arms and diamond trafficking. They also engaged in diplomatic efforts with the Group of Eight on Illicit Trade in Diamonds to address the issue. The U.S. engaged in diplomatic efforts with the Group of Eight on Illicit Trade in Diamonds, following Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's presentation on the connection between arms and diamond trading. A White House Diamond Conference was held to discuss technologies for identification and certification of rough diamonds, with participation from policymakers, scientists, engineers, and industry representatives. The Clinton Administration encouraged diamond marketing reform and regulatory capacity development in African diamond producing countries through unilateral dialogue and joint U.S.-African policy planning exercises. Efforts aimed to assist African states in regulating their domestic diamond industries and integrating regulatory mechanisms with importing countries. Technical assistance was provided to Sierra Leone by the Office of Transition Initiatives to develop an effective certificate of origin export system. Increased transparency, competition, and participation-broadening reforms were also encouraged. Critics of Clinton Administration policy on conflict diamonds accused it of being slow to address the issue, particularly in Sierra Leone. Representative Wolf highlighted the worsening conditions due to the illicit diamond trade and criticized the Administration for not taking sufficient action despite recommendations. Critics accused the Clinton Administration of inaction on recommendations to curb the trade in conflict diamonds. Calls for more engagement were made during a Trade Subcommittee hearing, with Representative Hall noting a lack of sustained commitment. Representative McKinney emphasized the need for swift action against countries mentioned in the Fowler Report. Criticism lessened as the Kimberley Process advanced, leading to collaborative efforts in crafting legislation. The Clinton Administration responded to criticism by highlighting their efforts to curtail the conflict diamond trade through participation in international forums like the Kimberley Process and the G8. They supported U.N. sanctions and provided assistance to countries like Sierra Leone and Angola to improve their diamond trade practices. The Bush Administration has pursued policies similar to the Clinton Administration to stem the flow of conflict diamonds, participating in the Kimberley Process and supporting U.N. sanctions. They have also provided assistance to countries like Sierra Leone and Angola to improve their diamond trade practices. The Bush Administration, like the Clinton Administration, has supported efforts to control conflict diamonds and illicit arms trade in Sierra Leone and its neighbors. Ambassador James B. Cunningham emphasized the importance of ending the illicit arms-for-diamonds trade that has caused devastation in West Africa. The Administration has backed U.N. Security Council resolutions prohibiting the import of rough diamonds from Liberia. They are committed to implementing panel recommendations and dealing firmly with illegal trade and sanctions violators. The Bush Administration has supported efforts to control conflict diamonds and illicit arms trade in Sierra Leone and its neighbors. They have signed the Interlaken Declaration to end the conflict diamond trade and are committed to crafting legislative responses with Congress. U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick also expressed the Administration's commitment to this cause. The Administration signed the Interlaken Declaration to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, initiating consultations with congressional committees. Members of the 107th Congress aimed to end conflict diamond trade due to human rights abuses, threats to peace, and potential national security risks. Legislative initiatives sought to restrict rebel groups from funding armed activities through diamond sales. Allegations of diamonds financing international terrorist groups have drawn congressional attention. Hearings in both the House and Senate have addressed the conflict diamond trade, including discussions on Africa's Diamonds, Trade in African Diamonds, Conflict Diamonds, and Illicit Diamonds. The Role of U.S. Agencies in Fighting the Conflict Diamond Trade was discussed in hearings before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services. Robert Mueller, Director of the FBI, called for legislation to freeze assets linked to criminal offenses like diamonds and precious metals without strict tracing requirements. Conflict diamond hearings in the 106th and 107th Congresses addressed human rights concerns and highlighted the need for legislation consistent with World Trade Organization rules. Witnesses emphasized the importance of not penalizing legitimate diamond producers and warned of a potential decrease in market demand for all diamonds if legislation to curb the conflict diamond trade was not enacted. In the 2001 hearing before the Subcommittee on Trade of the House Committee on Ways and Means, industry and non-governmental representatives discussed the need to finalize the Kimberley Process. Several conflict diamond-related bills were introduced in the 107th Congress, with H.R. 2506 (Kolbe) being the only one signed into law. This legislation prohibited certain diamond-related projects in countries without rough diamond export and import controls. The 108th Congress showed interest in ending the conflict diamond trade with provisions in H.J.Res. 2, including restrictions on assistance to governments destabilizing Sierra Leone and limitations on funding for diamond-related projects. The 108th Congress aimed to end the conflict diamond trade by restricting funds for diamond projects in countries not implementing the Kimberley Process. They recommended allocating $2,000,000 for assistance in enforcing the Kimberley Process and developing diamond fingerprinting technology. The 108th Congress recommended allocating $2,000,000 for assistance in enforcing the Kimberley Process and developing diamond fingerprinting technology to monitor international trade in conflict diamonds. Representative Thomas and Senator Grassley announced plans to enact legislation that aligns with Kimberley Process goals and complies with WTO obligations. Senator Grassley announced plans to sponsor Kimberley Process implementing legislation, contingent on the EU not opposing a WTO waiver for the process. EU policymakers do not see the need for a waiver, which could allow them to impose trade restrictions without obtaining a waiver. Representative Thomas will not move forward with US legislation until receiving assurance from the EU. Representative Thomas will not advance US legislation to comply with a WTO ruling on export tax laws until receiving assurance from the EU. The concerns raised by Representative Thomas have been addressed with a WTO waiver for the Kimberley Process. The Campaign to Eliminate Conflict Diamonds has proposed policy issues for the 108th Congress. The Campaign advocated strong regulation of conflict diamonds and participated in the Kimberley Process. Representative Houghton introduced two bills, H.R. 1415 and H.R. 1584, to prevent conflict diamonds from entering or exiting the US. Both bills, titled the Clean Diamond Trade Act, aimed to control rough diamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Both H.R. 1415 and H.R. 1584 aimed to prevent conflict diamonds from entering or exiting the US through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. H.R. 1584 included additional reporting requirements and references to the U.S. Trade Representative in a statement of policy. It also authorized the President to direct agencies like the Bureau of Customs and Border Security to assist countries exporting rough diamonds. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 1584 on April 8, 2003, with key amendments including changes to committees of jurisdiction and reporting requirements. The bill removed references to specific agencies and expressed support for the President's policy. The Senate received the amended bill on April 9, 2003, and Senator Hatch proposed further considerations on April 10. Senator Hatch proposed a substitute amendment to H.R. 1584 in the Senate on April 10, reflecting the language of S. 760. The Senate passed the amendment unanimously, and the bill was sent to the House. The House agreed to the Senate amendment on April 11, and President Bush signed H.R. 1584 into law on April 25, 2003. When President Bush signed H.R. 1584 into law, he mentioned significant caveats regarding his discretion in carrying out the duties outlined in the law. He emphasized that he has the authority to issue regulations consistent with future changes to the KPCS but cannot be bound by changes without subsequent legislation. This raises questions about the constitutionality of certain mandatory duties imposed on the President. The Clean Diamond Trade Act, introduced by Senator Grassley, grants the President broad discretion in certifying to Congress the effectiveness of waivers or decisions. The President is not obligated to withdraw certification in response to specific events but has the discretion to determine when a certification is no longer valid. The Clean Diamond Trade Act, introduced by Senator Grassley, was reported favorably with amendments by Senator Baucus. It requires the Secretary of State to publish information on countries regulating trade in rough diamonds and amends Section 10 (c) to establish a requirement by the President. The Conflict Diamonds Resolution, introduced by Representative Watson, calls for the international diamond industry to provide development assistance to communities in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, including ex-combatants and victims of war-related violence. The Conflict Diamonds Resolution calls for an international diamond industry fund to assist ex-combatants, victims of war-related violence, amputees, and diamond industry workers in African countries. It also supports HIV/AIDS programs, economic development, and political reconciliation. The resolution emphasizes the need for a reliable chain of warranty system to support the Kimberley Process. Some groups criticize the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for not regulating polished diamonds or jewelry, which they see as a loophole for unscrupulous traders to exploit by superficially altering diamonds or setting them in temporary mountings to avoid regulations. Policy advocates call for all diamonds, including jewelry, to be accompanied by a certificate of origin to ensure legitimacy and prevent conflict-related origins. Some in the diamond trade argue against extensive certification due to costs outweighing benefits and potentially harming developing nations reliant on diamond revenues. The U.S. implemented the Kimberley Process through the Clean Diamond Trade Act to address conflict diamonds. The legislative and executive branches will evaluate its success, with reporting requirements playing a key role in oversight activities. The diamond industry argues against extensive certification due to costs, while policy advocates emphasize the social costs of not ending the conflict diamonds trade. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is subject to periodic assessment by legislative and executive policymakers. Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with World Trade Organization rules, but a draft waiver decision issued by the WTO Council for Trade in Goods in 2003 provided safeguards for the KPCS. Representative Thomas expressed intent to introduce U.S. legislation supporting the KPCS after the waiver was released. The waiver issued contained caveats that could potentially challenge the legitimacy of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme under WTO rules. It allowed WTO members to raise concerns about benefits under GATT 1994, inconsistency in KPCS application, and maintained the right to recourse to GATT 1994 articles XXII and XXIII."
