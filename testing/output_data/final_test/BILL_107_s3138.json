    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hibben Center for Archaeological Research Act of 2002\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the University of New Mexico owned land within the boundaries of Chaco Culture National Historical Park when it was established in 1907. The University conducted archaeological research in the park from the 1920s to 1947 and later conveyed its rights to the land to the United States in 1949. Since 1971, the park has been actively involved in research partnerships. Since 1971, Chaco Culture National Historical Park has collaborated with the University of New Mexico to maintain a research museum collection and archive at the University. Both entities have significant archaeological research collections stored in inadequate and cramped repositories, making research and preservation difficult. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Hibben Center, Park, Secretary, and tenant improvement, which involves finishing and installing fixtures in the Hibben Center leased by the National Park Service. The term \"University\" refers to the University of New Mexico. The Hibben Center for Archaeological Research is established at the University of New Mexico. The Secretary may construct a portion of the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research at the University in cooperation with the University. A grant may be provided to cover 37 percent of the construction costs, but not for tenant improvements. Funds for construction costs or tenant improvements must be approved before being expended. The University may offer a long-term lease to the United States for space in the Hibben Center for the National Park Service. The Secretary can provide tenant improvements and cover moving costs for the leased portion. The Secretary can also enter into cooperative agreements for collaborative management of Chacoan archaeological objects with various entities. The University may lease space in the Hibben Center to the National Park Service for curation of artifacts and research. Additionally, collaborative agreements can be made for the management and operation of the leased portion. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Federal share of construction costs and carrying out specific sections. The allocated amounts will remain available until expended, with a reversion clause if a lease is not executed within 2 years."
