A genetic algorithm enhanced with a neural network discriminator model has been developed to improve molecule diversity and optimize structure design. This algorithm outperforms other generative models in optimization tasks and increases the interpretability of genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithm for molecular design, enhanced with inverse design features, utilizes variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks to efficiently explore chemical space and accelerate material discovery. Variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN) are used to encode molecular representations into a continuous space for efficient exploration of chemical space and material discovery. Several models like CVAE, GVAE, SD-VAE, JT-VAE, and CGVAE work on molecular representations, while the GCPN model utilizes reinforcement learning for direct optimization. The GCPN model uses reinforcement learning for direct optimization on molecular graphs, while ORGAN and VJTNN employ adversarial training for training generative models. Segler et al. introduced molecule generating models based on language models and reinforcement learning, showing strong performance in the GuacaMol benchmark. Generative models are trained to mimic reference data set distributions, limiting the exploration ability of VAEs and GANs. The curr_chunk discusses optimization algorithms in literature, including genetic algorithms (GAs) for molecule generation. Some approaches pre-define mutations on a SMILES level, while others use fragment-based assembly. GAs may get trapped in local optima, leading to multiple restarts for selection of the best molecules. The models mentioned serve as baselines for numerical comparison. The generator in the GA-D architecture evaluates fitness based on molecular properties and discriminator score, with random mutations replacing inferior members. The curr_chunk discusses the role of random mutations in genetic algorithms for molecule generation. A neural network discriminator is trained on molecules generated by the GA and a reference dataset to evaluate fitness. The discriminator influences the selection of the subsequent population. Mutation is crucial for exploring the chemical space efficiently and avoiding stagnation in fitness function. The hybrid structure combines genetic algorithms with ML-based neural networks for robustness. The curr_chunk discusses the use of random mutations in genetic algorithms for molecule generation, focusing on the robustness of SELFIES for preserving validity. Additional domain-specific mutation rules are applied to accelerate exploration. The discriminator plays a key role in increasing molecular diversity by removing long-surviving molecules, preventing stagnation in fitness function. The curr_chunk proposes adding an adaptive penalty, such as a neural network based discriminator, to prevent stagnation in genetic algorithms for molecule generation. This penalty helps to increase diversity by penalizing long-surviving molecules and encouraging exploration. The curr_chunk discusses maximizing the penalized logP objective in genetic algorithms for molecule generation, using a reference dataset of commercially available molecules. The penalized logP function includes factors like water-octanol partition coefficient and synthetic accessibility. The text discusses optimizing the penalized logP objective in genetic algorithms for molecule generation, utilizing a reference dataset of commercially available molecules. The algorithm involves Bayesian optimization on the latent representation of a trained VAE, with specific parameters for molecule generation and fitness function definition. The study optimized the penalized logP objective in genetic algorithms for molecule generation, achieving high J(m) scores compared to existing models. A time-dependent adaptive penalty was used to force the genetic algorithm to propose new families of molecules. The study optimized the penalized logP objective in genetic algorithms for molecule generation, achieving high J(m) scores compared to existing models. The approach significantly outperforms previous methods in maximizing the objective J(m). The GA efficiently explores chemical space, leading to unexpected discoveries and boosting human creativity. The genetic algorithm efficiently explores chemical space, leading to unexpected discoveries and boosting human creativity in domains like solar cell design, flow battery design, and molecular beam interferometry. The algorithm generates labels for the best performing molecules using K-means clustering analysis, showing a trajectory of molecule classes over 1000 generations. The genetic algorithm explores chemical space, generating molecules with high J(m) scores. Clustering analysis helps derive design rules for molecules with high penalized logP scores, including aromatic rings, conjugated carbon chains, and linear sulfur chains. The genetic algorithm explores chemical space to generate molecules with high J(m) scores. A linear sulfur chain yields the best score compared to other models. A two-dimensional PCA analysis visualizes the explorative behavior of the GA, showing sequential exploration of different chemical families in the trajectory. The discriminator prevents repetitive searches in the same space. In the previous sections, the genetic algorithm explored chemical space to generate molecules with high J(m) scores. A linear sulfur chain yielded the best score. The algorithm prevented repetitive searches in the same space. In this section, two tasks are considered: generating molecules of specific chemical interest and modifying existing molecules to increase penalized logP scores. The fitness function was modified to minimize the difference between actual and desired properties. The approach successfully proposed desired molecules in 90.0% of cases. In this experiment, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize the penalized logP score of low-scoring molecules from the ZINC dataset. The algorithm generated molecules with high logP and QED scores, following the experimental setup proposed by You et al. (2018). The GA was initiated with a molecule from the dataset and ran for 20 generations with a population size of 500, without the discriminator. The results showed successful generation of desired molecules in 90.0% of cases. The genetic algorithm aimed to improve the penalized logP score of molecules from the ZINC dataset. Molecular similarity was calculated using Morgan Fingerprints, with a fitness modification to ensure similarity constraints were met. The algorithm successfully improved upon logP scores while maintaining similarity. Additionally, the objective function was modified to include drug-likeness scores for a drug-discovery task. The experiment demonstrated that the genetic algorithm efficiently sampled the edge of property distributions for the ZINC and GuacaMol datasets. The fitness function used a free parameter (\u03b2) to balance molecular target properties and discriminator score. Results showed that low values of \u03b2 led to higher property scores, while very high values limited the algorithm's effectiveness. Values of \u03b2 affect the algorithm's performance, with low values leading to higher property scores and very high values limiting effectiveness. A transition occurs around \u03b2 \u2248 20, where molecules shift from high property values to a distribution centered around 0, similar to the reference data set. Only at \u03b2 \u2248 18 do we see a wider distribution of intermediate property values. The hybrid GA and ML-based generative model demonstrated improved performance in molecular design compared to literature approaches. The model's effectiveness is influenced by the value of \u03b2, with a transition occurring around \u03b2 \u2248 20 leading to molecules resembling the reference data set. At \u03b2 \u2248 18, a wider distribution of intermediate property values is observed. The model generates molecules with structures and properties similar to the reference data set, outperforming previous approaches. The model outperforms literature approaches in molecular design by generating molecules with desired properties. An analysis of the data from the genetic algorithm helped interpret the model and learn rules for designing high-performing molecules. The approach is independent of domain knowledge and can be applied to design questions in various scientific disciplines. The plan is to generalize the GA-D approach to be a more general concept of generative modeling. Figure S1 displays molecules optimized in Section 4.4, showing molecular modifications resulting in increased penalized logP scores under a similarity constraint. Figures S2-S4 compare property distributions of molecules from different data sets and generated using various methods. The distributions of molecules optimized using the penalized logP objective differ significantly from others. The distributions of molecules optimized using the penalized logP objective differ significantly from the ZINC and GuacaMol data sets. When the QED score is optimized simultaneously, the generated molecules become more similar to the reference data sets. The GA can optimize both logP and QED at the same time. The GA can optimize both logP and QED simultaneously for molecules from the ZINC and GuacaMol data sets."
