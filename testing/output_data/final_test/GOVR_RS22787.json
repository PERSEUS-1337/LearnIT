Debate over Legco's functional constituencies: some call for their elimination, while others argue they are necessary for economic stability. Various proposals suggested to address this issue. The challenges facing Hong Kong's democracy include difficulties in finding a compromise for functional constituencies in Legco, the composition of the nominating committee for the Chief Executive, and proposed amendments for elections. The greatest challenge for Hong Kong's democracy is finding proposed amendments for the 2012 and 2017 elections that will receive two-thirds support from Legco. The Hong Kong government must develop legislation that balances enough democracy to gain support from various parties without losing key supporters. U.S. foreign policy has supported democratization in Hong Kong for over 15 years. The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 supports democratization in Hong Kong, with Congress potentially assisting in the progress towards universal suffrage and democracy by monitoring election process amendments and encouraging State Department assistance. Congress could also increase contact with Legco through provisions in the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act. Congress could potentially reactivate the Section 301 provision of the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, requiring an annual report on Hong Kong's status from the State Department."
