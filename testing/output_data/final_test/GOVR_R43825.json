    "content": "The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) increased contribution limits to national political party committees, including the DNC, DCCC, DSCC, RNC, and NRCC. The House and Senate passed the bill in December 2014, and it was signed into law by the President. The focus of debate has been on the increased limits for individual contributions. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 increased contribution limits to national political party committees, allowing individuals to give up to $777,600 annually or more than $1.5 million for a two-year election cycle. PACs can also make larger contributions to parties. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 increased contribution limits to national political party committees, allowing individuals to give up to $777,600 annually or more than $1.5 million for a two-year election cycle. For multicandidate PACs, contributions to a national party have increased from $45,000 to at least $360,000 annually. The impact of the proposed language will depend on agency implementation and political practice, with the FEC responsible for administering the increased limits. Donor and party decisions will determine how fundraising practices change, as it is unclear how many donors have the ability or desire to make the larger contributions now permitted. The FEC's interpretation of contribution limits and potential changes in fundraising practices by political parties remain uncertain. Before P.L. 113-235, individuals could contribute $32,400 annually to national party committees, but the new law increased these limits. The six political committees of both major parties are affected by these limits, with implications still unclear. The report will be updated as more information becomes available. The contribution limits for individuals to national party committees were increased by Division N, Section 101 of P.L. 113-235. An individual could now contribute up to $129,600 annually to a national party when counting all traditional committees plus a convention committee. The contribution limits for individuals to national party committees were increased by Division N, Section 101 of P.L. 113-235, allowing for new segregated accounts and higher maximum individual contributions. The maximum contribution increased to $777,600 for a typical party with three major committees, and up to $1,555,200 during a two-year election cycle. The 2015 base limit for individual contributions increased to $33,400 from $32,400 in 2014. The language also increases limits for political action committees (PACs) as shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Differences exist between multicandidate PACs and non-multicandidate PACs, with higher limits for the latter. It is uncertain how consequential these differences might be in practice. The increased limits in Table 3 are expected to have a greater impact than those in Table 2. The new law affects national party committees, including major parties like the DNC, DCCC, RNC, NRCC, etc. It may lead to donors redirecting funds from super PACs to parties due to increased contribution limits. Increased party-funding limits may provide another outlet for donors without redirecting existing funds. The FEC has not yet announced regulations on how the new limits will be interpreted. Supporters believe the proposed contributions would be more transparent than those given to politically active tax-exempt organizations. Opponents argue that the changes could lead to a return to the \"soft money\" era. The proposed new limits on party funding could lead to a return to the \"soft money\" era before the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. The implications of these limits are still uncertain."
