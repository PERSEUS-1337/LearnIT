    "content": "CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY. The Congress established the Alaska Natives Commission to assess the social, cultural, and economic condition of Alaska Natives since the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Commission consisted of 14 members. The Alaska Natives Commission conducted regional and statewide hearings between July 1992 and October 1993, issuing a 3-volume report in May 1994. The report highlighted a crisis of unemployment, lack of economic opportunity, and alcohol abuse among Alaska Native individuals and communities. The Alaska Natives Commission found that high unemployment and lack of economic opportunities have led to government programs becoming vital for village economies, displacing traditional social safety nets. This has undermined the self-sufficiency of Alaska Native tribes and put them at risk of long-term dependency on the Federal Government. The Alaska Natives Commission recognized the challenges faced by Alaska Natives, including high unemployment and reliance on government programs. They highlighted the importance of Alaska Natives taking responsibility for their well-being through self-examination and innovative legislation to achieve social, cultural, economic, and spiritual renewal. The Alaska Natives Commission emphasized the importance of self-reliance, self-determination, and preserving Native cultures for the well-being and empowerment of Alaska Native tribes. The Congress addresses the problems facing Alaska Natives to preserve their cultures and meet their economic, social, and cultural needs in accordance with its constitutional authority over Native affairs in Alaska. SEC. 2. ALASKA NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION STUDY. The Congress acknowledges the unresolved policy questions raised by the Alaska Natives Commission and authorizes a grant to the Alaska Federation of Natives to conduct a study and propose solutions to address these recommendations. The Alaska Federation of Natives must submit a report to specified persons and entities. A grant can only be given if they agree to abide by the requirements of the section. They are tasked with studying recommendations from the Alaska Natives Commission and exploring successful approaches from other governments. Hearings within the Alaska Native community will also be conducted. The Alaska Federation of Natives is required to conduct hearings within the Alaska Native community to explore further approaches for implementing recommendations from the Alaska Natives Commission. They must provide recommended legislation to Congress and focus on achieving recommendations at the local level with maximum local control. A report on the study must be submitted within 1 year of receiving a grant. The Alaska Federation of Natives will submit a report with recommendations to the President, Congress, Governor, and State Legislature of Alaska. The report will also be made available to Alaska Native villages and the public. $350,000 is authorized for a grant to the Department of the Interior, and Congress encourages additional state funding for the study. For the study conducted under this Act, the term \"Alaska Native\" is defined as provided in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act."
