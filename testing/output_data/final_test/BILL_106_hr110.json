    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Employees Group Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999\" amends the United States Code by adding a new chapter on Long-Term Care Insurance. The \"Federal Employees Group Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999\" introduces a new chapter on Long-Term Care Insurance in the United States Code, outlining definitions such as annuitant, employee, other eligible individual, and the Office of Personnel Management. The Office of Personnel Management may purchase group long-term care insurance policies from qualified carriers without competitive bidding, based on qualifications, price, and reasonable competition. The Office of Personnel Management may purchase group long-term care insurance policies from qualified carriers based on contractor qualifications, negotiated benefits packages, and uniform 5-year contract terms. Premium rates must reflect the cost of benefits, coverage is guaranteed renewable, and the Office may withdraw products based on participation rates or risk pool composition. Minimum standards for contractors include qualifications to be a qualified carrier under this chapter. To be a qualified carrier under this chapter, a company must be licensed as an insurance company, approved to issue group long-term care insurance in all States, comply with IRS requirements, and provide long-term care benefits meeting NAIC standards. Premiums for enrolled employees are withheld from their pay, ensuring financing for the program. The Program established by this chapter allows for the withholding of premiums from enrolled annuitants' annuity payments. Spouses' premiums can be withheld from pay or annuity. If payment is insufficient, individuals may pay the premium directly to the carrier. Carriers must keep Program funds separate. Office costs for claims disputes are covered. Under section 9008, costs related to inquiries not resulting in disputes will be reimbursed by the carrier involved. These funds will be available to the Office for chapter administration. Section 9006 states that this chapter supersedes any inconsistent state or local laws. Section 9007 requires carriers to provide necessary reports for the Office to carry out its functions. Section 9008 of the chapter allows the Office and the General Accounting Office to examine carrier records as needed. Federal agencies must keep records and provide information as required. Claims for benefits must be filed within 4 years, and disputes will be adjudicated by the Office. Benefits will be paid according to the contract terms. Benefits payable under this chapter are secondary to other benefits, except for specified programs. Claimants can file suit against the carrier of the long-term care insurance policy in the district courts of the United States. The Office will prescribe regulations for enrolling in the Program, including coverage dates and requirements. Employees cannot be excluded based on hazardous employment or part-time status. Appropriations are authorized for this chapter. Authorization of appropriations is granted for carrying out specific sections of the program. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on the date of enactment, with coverage starting on the first day of the first pay period in October following more than 1 year after enactment."
