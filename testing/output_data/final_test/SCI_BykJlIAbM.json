    "content": "The quality of machine translation systems relies on parallel corpora availability, especially for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Data sparsity is a challenge for NMT due to overfitting and lack of language diversity. This paper proposes creating parallel clusters of similar sentences to enhance language diversity. A cluster-to-cluster correspondence score is defined and used to train the model. The objective function derived from this score generalizes MLE and RAML algorithms. In a novel approach, four potential systems were developed to enhance machine translation performance using a cluster-to-cluster framework. These systems consistently outperformed baseline models in various translation tasks. Additionally, an attention mechanism was utilized to improve input information retention in the encoder-decoder neural architecture. The attention mechanism is used to improve input information retention in the encoder-decoder architecture. However, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm used for training suffers from data sparsity issues, leading to overfitting on existing language pairs. Model-Centroid Augmentation and BID13 leverage model-generated candidates to enhance learning. The curr_chunk discusses a novel cluster-to-cluster framework for pseudo learning, focusing on broadcasting both source and target sentences as clusters to enhance model understanding of diversity. The optimization objective is the cluster-to-cluster correspondence score, with a surrogate objective of KL-divergence for model training. The curr_chunk introduces a novel cluster-to-cluster framework for model training using KL-divergence as the surrogate objective. It outlines the design of four parallel systems applied to machine translation tasks and highlights the contributions of the paper, including proposing a new perspective on sequence-to-sequence learning problems. The previous algorithms addressed exposure bias and train-test loss discrepancy in sequence prediction models by using reward-weighted samples from the model distribution through a Reinforcement Learning framework. This approach improved model performance by optimizing the sequence model as a stochastic policy to maximize task-level reward and alleviate data sparsity. However, a limitation was that the input information was still limited to the dataset, hindering the model's ability to understand the source. The cluster-to-cluster framework enhances input sentences to address source language diversity in neural machine translation. Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) proposes a novel payoff distribution for data augmentation based on task-level rewards. BID11 introduces a softmax Q-Distribution to relate RAML to Bayes decision rule and suggests a sampling strategy involving n-gram replacement and importance weight computation. The approach described in the curr_chunk focuses on using a learnable payoff function to augment target-side data in neural machine translation. This method aims to improve model robustness by sampling semantically and syntactically correct candidates from a cluster distribution. Additionally, a generalized bilateral data augmentation strategy is employed to enhance the model's capability to generalize better. The curr_chunk discusses different methods for enhancing neural machine translation, including using large monolingual data, self-learning methods, and reconstruction strategies. The proposed framework differs from existing semi-supervised algorithms by not relying on additional monolingual data and training forward and backward translation models independently. The parallel cluster is defined as two groups of weighted sentences with similarities above a certain threshold. The curr_chunk discusses defining parallel clusters and designing a cluster-to-cluster correspondence score to measure translatability between clusters. The higher the correspondence score, the more likely the clusters correspond to each other. This framework enhances neural machine translation without relying on additional monolingual data. The curr_chunk introduces the cluster-to-cluster correspondence score, which measures translatability between clusters. It aims to maximize the empirical correspondence score while considering the target cluster's entropy. Jensen's inequality is applied to derive the lower bound of the objective function. The curr_chunk discusses deriving a lower bound for the cluster-to-cluster objective and defining a loss function based on this lower bound. It also explores minimizing the KL-divergence to improve the regularized cluster-to-cluster correspondence. The derivatives with respect to NMT parameters are examined in parallel sampling and NMT broadcasting modes. The curr_chunk discusses different sampling modes in NMT, including parallel sampling and translation broadcasting. Translation broadcasting incorporates NMT's knowledge to generate correspondents, while parallel sampling works like twosided RAML. Cluster distribution is designed in adaptive and inadaptive manners to concentrate around the ground truth. In the context of different sampling modes in NMT, including parallel sampling and translation broadcasting, cluster designs concentrate around the ground truth based on similarity metrics. An inadaptive cluster uses non-parametric distributions to define source and target parallel clusters, considering task-level rewards and a cutoff criterion to reject samples below a certain threshold. The generated samples in NMT models may have semantical and syntactical mistakes, impacting model performance. An adaptive cluster approach uses parametric models to ensure high similarity with ground truth and correlation between source and target clusters. This method aims to improve translation accuracy and maintain fidelity to the original text. The text discusses optimizing translation models by updating source and target clusters alternately. It proposes combining forward and backward translation directions to learn four models simultaneously. Different scenarios are explored to design four parallel systems, with System-A and B using non-parametric clusters. System-A uses inadaptive cluster with parallel sampling strategy to train the NMT model, optimizing only the two translation systems. Candidates are sampled from cluster distributions for optimization. System-B leverages translation broadcasting for derivative computation instead of parallel sampling, similar to reinforcement learning. Normalized environmental rewards guide the model's policy search. System-C utilizes adaptive cluster distributions for joint optimization of NMT and clusters during training. Translation confidence scores are leveraged from parallel sentence pairs for NMT system training. System-D leverages cluster confidence scores in training NMT, making it more abundant than task-level rewards. It adopts similar gradient formulas as system-C for updating clusters. The training algorithm for system-A, B, C, D is detailed in Algorithm 1 for cluster-to-cluster NMT evaluation. The algorithm for systems A, B, C, and D is detailed in Algorithm 1 for evaluating the cluster-to-cluster NMT framework on various translation tasks using different datasets and network architectures. Training involves using ADADELTA with specific parameters and a beam size of 8 during decoding. Our system uses a beam size of 8 for decoding and determines the threshold similarity M as 0.5 for best performance. The temperature \u03c4 is set at 0.8 to avoid excessive hyper-parameter tuning. Comparisons with RAML and RL systems show significant improvements in both directions using our cluster-to-cluster framework. Our implementation of RL and RAML shows improvements in machine translation tasks, with system-C achieving the strongest results on WMT14 EN-DE and DE-EN tasks. Our one-layer RNN model even outperforms deep multilayer RNN models. Through cluster-to-cluster framework, we observe general improvements over baseline systems and our implemented RL/RAML systems. The comparison with RAML highlights improvements in various tasks but also points out limitations in neglecting input variabilities and introducing noisy pairs. The adaptive cluster considers more semantic contexts for rational paraphrases. Comparisons with RL are also discussed. Our proposed four parallel systems, system-C and D, outperform A and B, showcasing the benefits of adaptive clusters. Unlike inadaptive clusters, adaptive clusters are more flexible and target optimized, assigning rational probabilities to sampled candidates based on sophisticated criteria. In this paper, a cluster-to-cluster learning framework is proposed and incorporated into neural machine translation. The designed systems have proven to be efficient in helping NMT models generalize on both source and target sides. The cooperation of four agents in the framework augments valuable samples, alleviates data sparsity, and achieves significant improvement compared to baseline systems.

The IWSLT2014 dataset for German-English translation contains 153K training sentences, 6,969 validation sentence pairs, and 6,750 test sentences. RNN hidden states are set to 512 length and embedding size to 256. Bidirectional encoder is used, and decoder states are initialized with the learner's last hidden state. The paper adopts different mechanisms to approximate confidence scores and probabilities for variable-length sequences in the translation system. The experimental results for IWSLT2014 German-English and English-German Translation Task are summarized in TAB5. Samples from the well-trained cluster distribution in LDC Chinese-English Translation task show that paraphrases are based on form changing, synonym replacement, and simplification. These modifications do not alter the original meaning. Expanding point-to-point correspondence into cluster-to-cluster correspondence can enhance generalization ability.
