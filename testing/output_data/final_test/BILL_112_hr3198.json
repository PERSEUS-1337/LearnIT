    "content": "The \"Supporting Colorectal Examination and Education Now Act of 2011\" or the \"SCREEN Act of 2011\" includes provisions for temporary payment rate increases for cancer screening tests, waiving Medicare cost-sharing for colorectal cancer screening, Medicare coverage for pre-screening consultations, and expansion of coverage for preventive health services under private insurance. Colon cancer is a significant cause of cancer-related deaths, with over 50,000 deaths expected this year. Early diagnosis is crucial, as the 5-year survival rate is 90% when detected early. Increasing colonoscopy screening rates by 10% could prevent around 2,000 deaths. Colonoscopies are crucial for colorectal cancer screenings and the removal of precancerous polyps to prevent cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and CDC aim for high screening rates, but only around half of Medicare beneficiaries receive screenings within recommended intervals. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services highlight the need to improve colorectal cancer screening rates among Medicare beneficiaries. A study by the Colon Cancer Alliance found that many Americans over 50 wish for more information on colonoscopies and may avoid the procedure due to fear. The National Institutes of Health identified patient awareness and fears as barriers to increasing colorectal cancer screening rates. According to studies, inadequate reimbursement for preventive care services is a constraint limiting colorectal cancer screening rates. Colonoscopy, a common procedure in ambulatory surgical centers, has been shown to reduce Medicare costs in the long-term. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY INCREASE IN PAYMENT RATE FOR CERTAIN CANCER SCREENING TESTS. During a 5-year period starting in 2013, Medicare will increase payments by 10% to providers for qualifying cancer screening tests rated 'A' by the US Preventive Services Task Force. The Secretary determines that a cancer screening test with a utilization rate of at least 75% among Medicare beneficiaries will not be considered a qualifying test. A qualifying provider for such tests must be eligible for payment under specific sections of the Social Security Act and participate in a quality improvement registry. To be eligible for payment, a provider must participate in a quality improvement registry and demonstrate that tests were conducted in accordance with accepted quality measures. Section 4 amends the Social Security Act to waive Medicare cost-sharing for colorectal cancer screening with therapeutic effect. Section 5 provides Medicare coverage for an office visit or consultation before a qualifying screening colonoscopy, effective January 1, 2013. Section 4 of the Social Security Act waives Medicare cost-sharing for colorectal cancer screening with therapeutic effect. Section 5 provides Medicare coverage for an office visit or consultation before a screening colonoscopy, effective January 1, 2013.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reduce the conversion factors for physician fee schedule and HOPD to lower expenditures for items and services furnished each year starting from 2013. The Secretary determines the gross additional expenditures and offsetting reductions under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for items and services furnished each year starting from 2013.
