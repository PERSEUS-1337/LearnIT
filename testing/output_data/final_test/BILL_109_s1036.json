    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rural Teacher Retention Act of 2005\". Congress finds that a significant number of children attend rural public schools, with a high percentage of educators teaching in these areas. Despite lower salaries, rural teachers often handle multiple subjects with limited resources, facing challenges in attracting and retaining qualified teachers. High teacher turnover in rural school districts negatively impacts student and district performance, as well as teacher qualifications. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, a \"rural local educational agency\" is a local educational agency meeting specific criteria, and the \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education.\n\nSEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. From funds appropriated under section 5, the Secretary shall allot funds to rural local educational agencies based on student attendance. Agencies must submit an application to receive funds and use them for signing bonuses. The Act provides signing bonuses to teachers in rural local educational agencies: $2,000 for new hires and $3,000 for those who work for at least 3 consecutive years. Nonconsecutive service is allowed with approved leave. The Act provides signing bonuses to teachers in rural local educational agencies in compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or due to being called to active duty. Factors considered for bonuses include teacher need, value, performance, and unique agency needs. A teacher can only receive one bonus per calendar year. The Act provides signing bonuses to teachers in rural areas for a 5-year pilot program. It does not affect eligibility or amount of assistance under other federal education programs for teachers or agencies receiving bonuses. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 and additional funds for fiscal years 2007 and 2008."
