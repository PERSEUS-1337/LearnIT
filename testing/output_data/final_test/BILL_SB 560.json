    "title": "SB 560",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 30 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require applicants to provide their federal employer identification number or social security number at the time of license issuance. By January 1, 2016, individual applicants must also provide their individual taxpayer identification number or social security number. Licensees failing to provide federal employer identification number, individual taxpayer identification number, or social security number will be reported to the Franchise Tax Board. Failure to provide this information may result in penalties. Additionally, licensing boards will not process initial license applications without the required identification numbers. Licensing boards must provide specific information about licensees to the Franchise Tax Board or Employment Development Department upon request, including name, address, identification numbers, type of license, and status. Licensee refers to individuals or entities authorized to engage in regulated professions or businesses. The definition of \"license\" includes certificates, registrations, or authorizations required for regulated professions. Licensing boards must provide necessary information to the Franchise Tax Board or Employment Development Department in a machine-readable format as per specified standards. The section specifies that certain identification numbers provided are not public records and cannot be inspected by the public. It also prohibits disclosure of this information by individuals with access to it, except as allowed by the section. The Legislature intends to use federal identification numbers for tax compliance and family code purposes, ensuring the information is only used for those specific reasons. The board may release an individual taxpayer identification number or social security number to an examination or licensing entity for verification purposes if a reciprocity agreement exists with the requesting state. For enforcement purposes, licensees must provide individual taxpayer identification numbers or social security numbers to licensing entities. This requirement applies to entities issued licenses by various boards, the State Bar, the Bureau of Real Estate, and the Department of Motor Vehicles. Additionally, Section 7011.4 of the Business and Professions Code is amended. Section 7011.4 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to create a separate enforcement division within the Contractors\u2019 State License Board to enforce laws against unlicensed activity and ensure valid workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Enforcement representatives have the authority to issue court notices but are not peace officers and cannot make arrests. The enforcement division of the Contractors\u2019 State License Board has free access to all places of labor when participating in the activities of the Joint Enforcement Strike Force on the Underground Economy. Filing a false exemption certificate or not maintaining workers\u2019 compensation coverage for employees can result in disciplinary action. Any qualifier for a license who is responsible for ensuring licensee compliance with this chapter may be charged with a misdemeanor for failing to prevent acts that warrant disciplinary action."
