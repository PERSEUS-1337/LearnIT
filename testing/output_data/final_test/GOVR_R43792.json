    "content": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), enacted in 1938, establishes the federal minimum wage for covered workers. It has been amended multiple times to expand coverage and raise the wage rate, with the most recent increase in 2007 to $7.25 per hour. States have the option to set their own minimum wage provisions. States have the option to set their own minimum wage provisions, which can differ from the FLSA or be tied to it. The report provides a summary of state minimum wage laws, rates, adjustments, and the interaction of federal and state minimum wages. It also includes detailed information on minimum wage policies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The FLSA extends minimum wage coverage to individuals meeting specific criteria, including enterprise and individual coverage. Enterprise coverage requires at least two employees and annual sales of $500,000. Retailers are covered if their annual sales meet this threshold. Non-sales businesses must use a different measure to determine coverage. For enterprises not based on sales, business done is determined differently. For example, for leasing companies, property rental payments count as business done. The FLSA applies to hospitals, schools, and government institutions regardless of business volume. All employees of a covered enterprise are considered under the FLSA, even if the enterprise is exempt from minimum wage requirements. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) covers individuals engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce. To be considered engaged in interstate commerce, employees must have a role in producing goods that will be shipped out of state, travel to other states for work, communicate with individuals in other states, handle records involved in interstate transactions, or provide services to buildings where goods are produced for shipment outside the state. Specific exemptions from the federal minimum wage include individuals with disabilities, youth workers, tipped workers, and executive, administrative, and professional workers. The FLSA established a minimum wage of $0.25 per hour in 1938. The federal minimum wage provisions of the FLSA have been amended numerous times since its establishment in 1938, with the most recent change in 2007 increasing the rate to $7.25 per hour. The real value of the minimum wage generally rose from 1938 to 1968, reaching a peak of $11.50 in inflation-adjusted terms. The real value of the minimum wage has fallen by $1.20 since 2009, currently at $7.25. State laws may set different labor standards than federal statutes, with FLSA-covered workers entitled to the higher state minimum wage in states with rates above the federal minimum. Most workers in states with minimum wages below the federal rate are likely covered by the FLSA rate. In 2019, state minimum wage rates ranged across 29 states. In 2019, state minimum wage rates vary across 29 states and the District of Columbia, with some states above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour, some below, and some with no state minimum wage requirement. Only individuals not covered by the FLSA are subject to lower rates in states with no minimum wage requirements or rates below the federal minimum wage. The Appendix provides detailed information on state minimum wage policies for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In states with minimum wage rates above the federal rate, variation occurs mainly across two dimensions: the rate and the mechanism of adjustment. State rates range from $0.25 to $6.75 above the federal rate, with most states using inflation measures. Minimum hourly rates in these states range from $7.50 to $14.00, with different states having rates above $7.25 per hour. In states with minimum wage rates above the federal rate, 29 states and the District of Columbia have rates above $7.25, representing about 61% of the total civilian labor force. Some states set rates above the federal rate, while others adjust based on inflation measures. In states with minimum wage rates above the federal rate, the adjustment of state minimum wage rates can be regulated through legislatively scheduled increases or indexing to inflation. Some states combine both methods. If a state adopts a higher minimum wage, the legislature may specify a single rate without addressing future rates. In some states, minimum wage rates are set through legislation with specified future rates, while others rely on future legislative action for rate changes. For example, Rhode Island set rates of $10.10 per hour in 2018 and $10.50 in 2019, with no further increases planned. Similarly, the federal minimum wage increased from $5.15 in 2007 to $7.25 in 2009 in three phases. Out of 29 states and D.C. with rates above the federal level, 9 have no scheduled increases beyond 2019, while others like Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Michigan have planned increases. In order to combat the erosion of minimum wage value due to inflation, several states have implemented mechanisms to index the minimum wage rate to inflation. Currently, nine states index their minimum wage to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), while another eight states and the District of Columbia plan to do so in the future. This automatic adjustment eliminates the need for annual legislative action to make changes to the minimum wage rate. Several states index their minimum wage rates to various versions of the Consumer Price Index, such as CPI-U, CPI-W, and PCE. Some states also reference the federal minimum wage rate for adjustments. This indexing mechanism eliminates the need for annual legislative action to change the minimum wage rate. In Alaska, the minimum wage is tied to the CPI-U for Anchorage, with a state law requiring it to be $1.00 higher than the federal rate. Connecticut's minimum wage must exceed the federal rate by 0.5% if it becomes higher. The District of Columbia sets its minimum wage at the higher of its statute or the federal rate plus $1.00. Starting in 2021, the District of Columbia minimum wage will be indexed to inflation and no longer tied to the federal rate. Massachusetts law mandates scheduled rate increases in the minimum wage through 2023, with a requirement that the state rate must be at least $0.50 above the federal minimum wage rate. The number of states with higher minimum wages fluctuates annually, with more states enacting higher minimum wages during periods of federal rate stability. Table 1 provides an overview of minimum wage rates in 29 states and the District of Columbia. Table 1 displays minimum wage rates in 29 states and the District of Columbia from 2018 to 2024. Figure 3 illustrates the fluctuating role of the federal minimum wage in setting a wage floor for the labor force. In periods when the federal minimum wage rate remains unchanged, there is a trend towards a lower share of the labor force covered by the federal minimum wage. Federal rate increases in 2007-2009 and earlier changes helped mitigate this trend. Prior to federal increases in 1990 and 1991, the number of states with higher minimum wages increased, reducing the share of the labor force covered by the federal rate. Following a federal increase in 1990 and 1991, the number of states with higher minimum wages decreased, making the federal rate the floor for states. In 1992, the federal minimum wage became the floor for states covering 92% of the labor force. By 1997, the federal rate increased to $5.15 per hour. The number of states with higher minimum wages decreased to 8, with the federal rate serving as the floor for 82% of the labor force. The federal minimum wage remained unchanged until 2007, during which the number of states with higher minimum wages fluctuated. By 2019, 29 states and the District of Columbia had minimum wage rates above the federal rate, representing 39% of the civilian labor force. This increase was influenced by populous states like Florida, Michigan, and New York adopting higher minimum wage rates. The federal minimum wage served as the wage floor for states covering 92% of the labor force in 1992, decreasing to 82% by 1997. In states with minimum wage rates equal to or below the federal rate, there are no mechanisms in place to increase rates above the federal rate. Some states like Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee have no provisions for state minimum wage rates. In Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee, there are no state minimum wage rates. Some states have rates below $7.25, while others have rates equal to $7.25 with no reference to the FLSA. Six states set their minimum wage equal to the FLSA rate, so when the FLSA rate changes, their state rates change accordingly. In Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, state minimum wage equals FLSA rate if FLSA is greater. Table A-1 provides detailed information on minimum wage policies in all states."
