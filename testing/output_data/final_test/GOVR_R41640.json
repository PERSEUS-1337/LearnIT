Large areas of federal and state waters were closed to fishing as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of seafood, leading to decreased fisheries landings and revenues in central Gulf fishing ports. Consumer perceptions related to the spill have likely decreased demand for Gulf seafood. The spill has also caused harm to the Gulf environment, resulting in mortality of organisms, eggs, and habitat damage. The effects of the spill are difficult to quantify, and the opening and closing of fishing areas have involved a tradeoff between public safety and fishing opportunities. Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, large areas of federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico were closed to fishing to prevent contaminated seafood from entering the market. The closures directly impacted recreational and commercial fishermen, leading to decreased fisheries landings and revenues. At the peak of the closure, nearly 37% of federal waters in the Gulf were off-limits to fishing, with varying proportions of state waters closed in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The tradeoff between public safety and fishing opportunities has been a challenge in managing the spill's impact on the fishing industry. Since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, fishing in Gulf of Mexico states like Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi was heavily impacted. Most state waters have reopened for fishing, with only 1,041 square miles of federal waters near the well-head still closed. FDA, NOAA, and coastal states have a protocol for reopening areas based on oil contamination levels. Seafood samples undergo sensory and chemical testing to ensure safety before reopening. Some critics have raised concerns about the seafood testing protocols following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Samples are tested for oil and dispersant odor and taste, with additional chemical analysis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dispersants. Both federal and state agencies collect samples, with all seafood needing to pass both sensory and chemical tests before an area can be reopened for fishing. NOAA and FDA officials have reported that all samples have passed sensory testing and chemical analyses have shown PAH levels well below the levels of concern. Chemical analyses have shown PAH levels well below the levels of concern, essentially at the same level as before the spill. Sensory analyses found no detectable oil or dispersant odors or flavors in federal waters reopened through November 15, 2010. NOAA and FDA sampling have not found contaminated seafood in commercial landing sites. Fish and shellfish from areas unaffected by the spill are considered safe to eat. The closures have impacted fishing grounds for shrimp, menhaden, and oysters, with total Gulf landings for shrimp species decreasing in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2009, total Gulf landings for all shrimp species in 2010 decreased by 35.6 million pounds (27%). Shrimp landings decreased in Louisiana by 32%, Mississippi by 60%, Alabama by 56%, and Texas by nearly 15%, while increasing by nearly 15% for the Florida west coast. Menhaden landings in Louisiana also decreased by 171 million pounds (17%). The decreases in landings resulted in lower revenues in the harvesting sector. Oyster industry harmed by efforts to protect Louisiana estuaries from oil intrusion. The freshwater releases into the Mississippi River to prevent oil from reaching Louisiana's estuaries had unintended consequences, leading to a significant mortality of oysters, affecting about 50% of Louisiana's annual oyster crop. The oyster industry is concerned about documenting the damage caused by the spill and freshwater diversion, as well as the effects on consumer perceptions and oyster markets. Some in the industry are questioning the need to retire oyster grounds and develop new areas due to the impacts of restoration efforts. The Gulf oil spill has disrupted seafood supplies, leading to market losses and concerns about buyers switching to alternative suppliers. Efforts may be needed to retire oyster grounds and develop new areas less affected by river diversions from restoration activities. The Gulf oil spill has caused a decrease in demand for Gulf seafood due to consumer concerns about safety. This has led to supply effects on prices, particularly for fresh markets near the spill area and local specialties like oysters. Consumer worries about seafood safety are putting negative pressure on prices. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has impacted Gulf seafood prices, initially increasing due to supply constraints from fishery closures. Gulf shrimp and oyster prices have risen, with Louisiana production decreasing. Some prices have since decreased as areas reopened. Factors affecting prices include availability of substitutes, consumer income, and consumer preferences. The timeline for market recovery and consumer trust remains uncertain. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has caused significant harm to marine organisms in the Gulf of Mexico, with coastal areas being especially vulnerable. The uptake of oil components is toxic to various marine life, including fish, shellfish, and plankton. Oil can also suffocate shoreline animals and plants. Scientists are concerned about the impact on plankton, fish eggs, and deep-sea organisms. Sublethal effects reduce overall health, leading to decreased growth and reproduction. The presence of oil in the environment can harm marine organisms, affecting their growth and reproduction. Coastal areas, like estuaries and wetlands, play a crucial role in the life cycle of many species, with 97% of commercial fish and shellfish landings depending on these habitats. Oil pollution can alter migration patterns, reduce food availability, and disrupt life cycles, impacting populations of shrimp, crab, and menhaden in Louisiana fisheries. The effects of oil on Louisiana fisheries, particularly shrimp, crab, and menhaden populations, are concerning due to harm on their eggs and larvae. The spill impacts not only individual fish species but also inter-related ecosystems in the Gulf, from estuaries to the open ocean. Oil has affected structure-forming organisms like marsh grasses and oysters, impacting the food web and ecological interactions. Survey teams have documented 1,053 miles of oiled shoreline, raising long-term implications for Gulf wildlife. Fisheries surveys from Dauphin Island Sea Lab have been conducted post-spill. Some fish species abundance increased after the oil spill due to fisheries closures. Concerns exist about determining the spill's direct impact on marine populations. Uncertainty surrounds the extent of spill-related damages to living resources in coastal ecosystems. Financial assistance mechanisms are available for the fishing industry affected by oil spills. Financial assistance for individuals and businesses affected by oil spills is defined by the Oil Pollution Act. Assistance can also be provided for fishery failures declared under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Additional aid is available through BP grants, the Vessels of Opportunity Program, and the Small Business Administration. Claims for damages resulting from oil spills, including lost profits and property loss, can be made to the responsible party, such as BP. If the claim is denied or not settled within 90 days, the claimant can pursue further action. BP established a claims process and multiple claims centers to address economic harm caused by the oil spill. Emergency compensation payments began on May 3, 2010, based on one month of income and adjusted with additional documentation. President Obama announced on June 16, 2010, that BP would set aside $20 billion for economic damage claims. Some members of the fishing industry criticized BP's administration of the claims process. Some fishing industry members criticized BP's slow and inadequate claims process. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) took over claims administration from BP on August 23, 2010. GCCF, funded by BP, offers an independent claims process but some argue it's not truly independent. GCCF provides information on filing claims and offers emergency payments. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) provided emergency payments equivalent to six months of lost income to fishing industry claimants until November 23, 2010, totaling approximately $751 million. Some claimants expressed concerns about transparency, lack of information, and payment adequacy. Claimants have three years to estimate damages and submit final claims, with acceptance resolving all claims against BP. Individuals and businesses receiving emergency payments are eligible for a quick payment final claim of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for businesses. The Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) provided emergency payments equivalent to six months of lost income to fishing industry claimants until November 23, 2010, totaling approximately $751 million. Claimants have three years to estimate damages and submit final claims. A quick payment final claim offers $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for businesses. Those not eligible for quick payment can submit a full review final payment claim. Alternatively, an interim payment claim can be made for past damages. Some in the fishing industry are uncertain about the extent of damages from the oil spill. Individuals and businesses face the decision of taking a final settlement or filing a lawsuit for uncertain payment size and timing. The GCCF released a draft proposal for public comment on payment options and eligibility criteria. An expert report predicts Gulf fisheries will recover by 2011, but some areas like oyster beds may take 6 to 10 years to recover fully. The BP Vessels of Opportunity Program provided local boat operators with the opportunity to assist with response activities after the oil spill. Approximately 3,500 fishing boats were employed, and $594 million was paid out for vessels and crew in Gulf states. Some critics question the assessment of Gulf fisheries recovery without considering long-term ecological impacts. The BP Vessels of Opportunity Program concluded in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi in September 2010, with a few vessels remaining active in Louisiana as of January 2011. The GCCF decided not to deduct earnings from the program from claimant payments. BP agreed to provide Louisiana with $48 million for seafood safety and marketing, with $6 million per year for three years allocated for testing seafood for oil and dispersants, and $10 million per year for three years for seafood marketing. Louisiana's proposal for $173 million for a long-term seafood testing and marketing campaign was rejected by BP. BP agreed to provide $20 million over three years for seafood inspections and marketing in Florida, and $13 million for a three-year study in Louisiana to monitor the effects of the oil spill on Gulf fisheries. Secretary of Commerce Locke determined a fishery failure in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and later added Florida due to the oil spill. The Administration requested $15 million to address the fishery failure and $5 million for economic development assistance. The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010 included a total of $28 million for the program. The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-212) allocated $28 million for fishery disaster and economic development assistance. $15 million is designated for a marketing plan and safety program for Gulf coast seafood, while $13 million will address economic impacts on fishermen and businesses. An additional $10 million is for stock assessments, $1 million for a study on oil spill effects, and the Small Business Administration offers economic injury loans. Gulf fisheries rely on healthy ecosystems. Restoration efforts for Gulf ecosystems, including fisheries habitat, are crucial for maintaining and enhancing fisheries production. The Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) and the Administration's Gulf Coast Restoration Plan focus on oil spill damages. NRDA addresses natural resource damages and restoration, with responsible parties liable for damages. Unlike financial compensation, NRDA aims at restoring and compensating for harm to public natural resources. Federal, state, tribal, and trust agencies are responsible for NRDA actions. Designated federal, state, tribal, and sometimes foreign trust agencies are responsible for acting on behalf of the public. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) directs trustees to restore injured natural resources to their baseline condition and compensate for interim losses. Restoration actions aim to return resources to their baseline level quickly and with certainty, while compensatory actions provide services of comparable value to address interim losses. Damage assessment is necessary to quantify injuries and determine the needed restoration and compensatory actions. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) directs trustees to restore injured natural resources to their baseline condition and compensate for interim losses. The process is divided into three main phases: Pre-assessment phase, Restoration planning phase, and Restoration phase. Trustees are currently in the restoration planning phase, defining the ecosystem's baseline condition and quantifying damages caused by the oil spill. The Administration committed to developing a long-term Gulf of Mexico restoration plan for post-spill recovery needs and long-term restoration, addressing a broader array of restoration needs beyond environmental damages addressed by NRDA. The Administration released a long-term recovery plan after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, emphasizing the need for collaboration among governmental, private, and non-profit organizations. The plan recommended dedicating civil penalties from responsible parties under the Clean Water Act to restore the Gulf coast and creating a Gulf Coast Recovery Council to coordinate efforts. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill recommended dedicating 80 percent of Clean Water Act penalties to Gulf restoration and establishing a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Task Force. President Obama signed Executive Order 13554 to create the task force chaired by the EPA Administrator. The Gulf Coast Ecosystem Task Force, established by Executive Order 13554, includes representatives from various government departments and Gulf state governors. Its main goal is to develop a \"Gulf of Mexico Regional Ecosystem Strategy\" to coordinate restoration efforts. The Task Force first met on November 8, 2010, and ongoing efforts include oversight of fishing industry recovery, compensation, and Gulf restoration by Congress. The ongoing efforts by federal agencies and states focus on fishing industry recovery, compensation, and Gulf restoration. Questions may arise regarding the potential settlement and restoration activities under the NRDA process. Funding and governance of the Administration's Gulf of Mexico restoration plan would require congressional action, potentially involving Clean Water Act civil penalties. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling recommended establishing a Gulf Restoration Council to coordinate restoration efforts. Several bills introduced in Congress addressed elements of the Administration's restoration plan, including the establishment of a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Fund. Funding allocation and permitted uses under the plan remain ongoing issues, particularly for Gulf states. Three bills propose establishing a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Fund, with 80% of penalties under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to be deposited into the fund. They also create a governing body to distribute funding and coordinate restoration efforts, such as a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force or a Gulf of Mexico Recovery Council. H.R. 480 includes a formula for funding allocation among Gulf states and establishes four Gulf of Mexico programs."
