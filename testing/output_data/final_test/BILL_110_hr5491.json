The Congress finds that pharmacy technicians perform various tasks such as filling prescriptions, labeling drugs, and preparing medications. There are minimal requirements for formal training or certification for pharmacy technicians at the state and federal levels. The demand for pharmacy technicians is expected to grow rapidly due to the increasing population and aging demographics, leading to a higher demand for pharmaceuticals. The demand for pharmacy technicians is expected to increase dramatically. About 7 out of 10 pharmacy technician jobs are in retail settings, while 2 out of 10 are in hospitals. Studies have shown that pharmacists fail to detect over 20% of filling errors made by pharmacy technicians, and medication errors are linked to drug names that look or sound alike. The study reviewed over 26,000 records from 2003 to 2006, nearly double the number of pairs identified in the previous report in 2004. Since 1992, the FDA has received over 20,000 voluntary reports of medication errors. SEC. 3. STATE PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNICIAN REGISTRATION PROGRAMS.

This program requires individuals to be registered by the State Board of Pharmacy, have a high school diploma or equivalent, be certified by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board, and meet other minimum requirements. Additionally, States receiving grants must report annually on pharmaceutical technician errors and may provide a transitional period for practicing technicians. The section defines terms like State Board of Pharmacy, pharmacy technician, secondary school, and Secretary. It allows a transitional period for existing pharmaceutical technicians to comply with registration requirements. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
