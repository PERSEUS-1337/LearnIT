    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Burton Greene Higher-Risk Impaired Driver Act\" and includes increased penalties. The \"Burton Greene Higher-Risk Impaired Driver Act\" adds Sec. 165 to Chapter I of title 23, US Code, defining blood alcohol concentration, driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence, and license suspension. The \"Burton Greene Higher-Risk Impaired Driver Act\" defines key terms such as license suspension as the suspension of driving privileges, motor vehicle as a vehicle for public highways, and higher-risk impaired driver law as a state law with penalties for impaired drivers. The individual, during license suspension, may need to install an alcohol ignition interlock device, impound or immobilize the vehicle for 90 days, and undergo a substance abuse assessment by a certified official. The individual may be assigned to a treatment program, imprisoned, or fined a minimum of $1,000 for alcohol abuse or impaired driving. The fine proceeds are used for prevention and enforcement programs. The court mandates offenders convicted of impaired driving to be on probation for at least 2 years, attend a 12-month treatment program for substance abuse if diagnosed, and participate in a victim impact panel if available. Restitution to crash victims is required if the arrest resulted from a crash. Offenders convicted of impaired driving must be on probation for at least 2 years, attend a substance abuse treatment program if diagnosed, and participate in a victim impact panel if available. This includes individuals convicted of repeat offenses, high blood alcohol concentration, driving while suspended due to a DUI conviction, or causing a crash. The term 'special DUI/DWI facility' refers to a facility for offenders arrested for impaired driving, allowing them to work or attend school. A 'victim impact panel' consists of impaired driving victims who aim to deter recidivism through changing attitudes and behaviors. In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, if a State does not have or enforce a higher-risk impaired driver law, the Secretary will transfer a percentage of funds to the State for impaired driving programs. In fiscal year 2008, if a State does not have or enforce a higher-risk impaired driver law, the Secretary will transfer 6 percent of funds to the State for impaired driving programs. The amount to be transferred can be derived from various apportionments under section 104(b). In fiscal year 2008, the Secretary will transfer funds to States for impaired driving programs based on apportionments under section 104(b)(3). The obligation authority for carrying out these programs will be determined by multiplying the amount of funds transferred to the State. The obligation authority for Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs is determined by a ratio of the amount distributed to the State for the fiscal year to the total apportioned sums for the programs. There is a limitation on the applicability of obligation. The limitation on the total obligations for highway safety programs under section 402 does not apply to funds transferred to a State. The Secretary can withhold funds if a State has not enacted or enforced a higher-risk impaired driver law in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The Secretary can withhold a percentage of funds for Federal-aid highways if a State has not enacted or enforced a higher-risk impaired driver law. If compliance is not met within 4 years, the apportionment for the State will be increased. If a State fails to enact or enforce a higher-risk impaired driver law, the Secretary can withhold funds for Federal-aid highways. After 4 years, if the State is still not compliant, the apportionment for the State will be increased. Any withheld funds will be transferred to impaired driving programs."
