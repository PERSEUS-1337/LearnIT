    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Direct to Consumer Prescription Drug Advertising Act of 2004\". The findings by Congress show a significant increase in spending on direct-to-consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry, surpassing research and development expenditures. This advertising strategy has proven to boost sales of prescription drugs, leading to a surge in retail sales for promoted drugs. Direct-to-consumer advertising for new prescription drugs may lead consumers to spend more money on expensive medications compared to older drugs in the same class. While these ads increase consumer awareness, they are often misleading by emphasizing benefits over risks. The FDA struggles to act on misleading ads due to delays in the review process, resulting in many consumers being exposed to false information before ads are revoked. Many consumers have already viewed misleading information despite efforts to revoke an advertisement. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will conduct research comparing the effectiveness and safety of prescription drugs in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Results of the research will not impact drug approval. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will amend regulations for prescription drug advertisements within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The regulations will require advertisements to provide a fair balance between information on drug effectiveness compared to other drugs and information on side effects and contraindications. The advertisements must also present a fair balance between aural and visual presentations. The regulations for prescription drug advertisements will require a fair balance between information on drug effectiveness, side effects, and contraindications. False or misleading advertising promoting off-label use is prohibited, and direct-to-consumer ads must include medication information in the package. The regulations for prescription drug advertisements require a medication guide explaining the benefits and risks of use in terms understandable to the general public. SEC. 5. CIVIL PENALTY. Section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include civil penalties for violations related to misbranding prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertisements. The penalty can reach up to $500,000 if the violation is not corrected within 180 days of notice from the Secretary. The civil penalties for misbranding prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer advertisements are capped at $500,000 for individuals and $5,000,000 for other entities. In a single proceeding, the total penalty cannot exceed $10,000,000. The procedure for imposing these penalties follows the same guidelines as other civil penalties under the Act. SEC. 6. REPORTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must annually report to the Senate and House committees on the total number of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements, including details on dates, times, markets, and types of advertisements. The report must also identify any advertisements that may have violated the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Secretary reports annually to Congress on direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads, detailing violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and actions taken in response. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expedite reviews of direct-to-consumer drug advertisements' legality, with exceptions for notice-and-comment rulemaking or to protect public health and safety."
