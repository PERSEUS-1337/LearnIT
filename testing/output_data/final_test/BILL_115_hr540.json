    "content": "The Act titled \"Presidential Tax Disclosure Act of 2017\" requires the disclosure of the President's federal income tax returns. The Presidential Tax Disclosure Act of 2017 mandates that the President must submit copies of their federal income tax returns to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. This includes filing returns for each taxable year during their term in office and the three most recent taxable years before assuming office. The Presidential Tax Disclosure Act of 2017 requires the President to submit federal income tax returns to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The Director must make the returns public on the internet and submit them to specific Congressional committees within 7 business days. The Act also includes special rules that all schedules, supplements, amendments, and attachments related to the tax returns must be disclosed. The Presidential Tax Disclosure Act of 2017 mandates the submission of federal income tax returns to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics for public disclosure. All schedules, supplements, amendments, and attachments must also be disclosed, with permitted redactions limited to specific information. For joint tax returns, the entire return is treated as that of the individual. If spouses file separate returns, the same rules apply as if filed by the individual. The Attorney General can enforce this through civil action in federal court. The United States district court can penalize individuals who knowingly falsify or fail to disclose required information under the Internal Revenue Code, with a civil penalty of up to $50,000. It is illegal to falsify or fail to submit required information, with fines of up to $50,000 and imprisonment for up to 6 years for violations. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics or any Committee may refer individuals to the Attorney General for violating disclosure requirements. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury can disclose the President's tax returns under certain circumstances. If a tax return required under the Presidential Tax Disclosure Act of 2017 is not submitted on time or is incomplete, the Secretary of the Treasury must disclose it to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics within 30 days. Redactions similar to those in the Act apply, with certain information being redacted before disclosure. The section and amendments apply to new Presidents after December 31, 2016, allowing redisclosure of return information by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics as per the Presidential Tax Disclosure Act of 2017."
