    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sustainable Revenue for Oregon Counties Act of 2009\". Congress finds that more than half of the land in Oregon is owned by the Federal Government, leading to counties being unable to generate revenue from property taxes on federal land. Historically, federal payments from timber harvesting have served as a substitute for property taxes. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 provided additional payments due to a decline in timber revenues. Congress extended these payments to develop a sustainable alternative, but long-term extension is uncertain due to budget concerns. Counties in Oregon, with a majority of land owned by the Federal Government, need a sustainable revenue source. Opportunities exist for sustainable activities on Federal forest land in Oregon counties, including timber harvesting, biomass removal for energy production, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services. The Federal forest land in Oregon counties offers opportunities for sustainable activities like timber harvesting, biomass removal, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services, including clean water provision and recreational activities. Consideration should be given to various revenue sources, including State and local funding, for long-term sustainability. Federal Government payments can be continued using different payment methods. SEC. 3.
