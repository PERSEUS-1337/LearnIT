    "content": "The Act titled \"Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2006\" focuses on the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines a deficient dam as one that fails to meet minimum safety standards and poses an unacceptable risk to the public. The National Dam Safety Program Act defines rehabilitation as the repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. Additionally, a program for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams is included in the Act. \"Rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams is addressed in the National Dam Safety Program Act.\" The Director will establish a program within FEMA to provide grants to States for rehabilitating publicly-owned deficient dams. Grants will be provided to States for dam rehabilitation, and project grant agreements will be entered into with each State receiving a grant. States must submit an application to the Director to receive a grant under this program. The Director, in consultation with the Board, will develop a risk-based priority system for identifying deficient dams eligible for grants. Funds allocated for grants will be distributed among states based on the number of non-Federal publicly-owned dams identified as a danger to human health. The Federal share of the cost for rehabilitating deficient dams under this section is limited to 65 percent. Authorization of appropriations includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2010 to carry out this section. Additional staff for FEMA may be funded as needed. FEMA may employ additional staff as necessary with funding of $400,000 for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2009. Within 90 days of this Act's enactment, the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response must propose rulemaking on amendments to the National Dam Safety Program Act. Within 120 days, a final rule must be issued by the same authority."
