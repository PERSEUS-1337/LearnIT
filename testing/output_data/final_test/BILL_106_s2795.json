The funds appropriated on December 19, 1979, for the Western Shoshone Indians in Docket Number 326-K will be distributed to eligible individuals meeting specific criteria. This includes those with at least 1/4 degree of Western Shoshone Blood, U.S. citizenship, and living on the date of enactment. Eligibility for per capita payments from other judgment funds awarded by various courts is also considered. The Secretary will establish the Western Shoshone Judgment Roll and determine eligibility for enrollment based on acceptable documents. Once the Roll is completed, a per capita distribution of funds will be made to each person listed. The per capita distribution of funds under this section will be paid directly to living competent adults aged 19 or older, distributed to heirs and legatees of deceased individuals, and administered for legally incompetent individuals according to regulations. Minors' shares will be held by the Secretary. The funds from supervised individual Indian money accounts will be disbursed over 4 years in payments equaling 25 percent of the principal plus interest. The first payment goes to individuals aged 18 or older who are legally competent, with subsequent payments following every 3 birthdays. All distributed funds are subject to the provisions of Public Law 93-134.
