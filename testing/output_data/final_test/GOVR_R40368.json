    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions for unemployment benefits, such as a temporary $25 weekly additional benefit for certain individuals. Unemployed railroad workers were not eligible for this supplemental benefit. The benefit was available on a temporary basis after the state entered into an agreement with the Labor Secretary. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided a temporary $25 weekly additional benefit for certain individuals on top of regular unemployment compensation. States had to sign agreements with the Labor Secretary to implement this benefit. The $25 supplement would not reduce the total benefit amount payable under state law. Individuals grandfathered into the program would continue to receive the supplemental benefit until the program's expiration date. The $25 supplemental weekly benefit for certain individuals on top of regular unemployment compensation would continue after the program expires until all entitlement to benefits is exhausted or until the last allowable date. State unemployment systems may take time to start providing the benefit after signing an agreement with the Department of Labor. Retroactive payment is made for accrued benefits starting from the week of the agreement. The EUC08 program is a federally financed program that provides additional weeks of unemployment benefits at the state level. It has two tiers, with the first providing up to 20 weeks and the second up to 13 weeks for states with high unemployment. ARRA extended the program until December 26, 2009. After expiration, no new entrants will be accepted, but current beneficiaries will receive their remaining weeks in their current tier. The EUC08 program has been extended beyond December 26, 2009, with additional benefit tiers. ARRA provides a $25 weekly benefit for unemployment compensation recipients. The EB program offers up to 13 weeks during high unemployment and up to 20 weeks in certain states with extremely high unemployment. DOL monitors state unemployment rates to trigger the EB program. The EB program provides a $25 weekly benefit for unemployment compensation recipients and can be triggered in a state based on specified conditions. ARRA temporarily expands eligibility for the EB program, allowing beneficiaries to receive benefits even after their benefit year expires. Under ARRA, states can temporarily ignore the benefit year requirement for Extended Benefits (EB) and use exhaustion of EUC08 benefits as an eligibility requirement. This allows more individuals to be eligible for EB benefits, even if their benefit year has expired before the state triggered \"on\" to the EB program. Under ARRA, states can temporarily expand eligibility for Extended Benefits (EB) by allowing more individuals to qualify, even if their benefit year has expired. While the federal financing for EB does not apply to unemployed state and local government employees, states stand to gain substantial amounts through 100% federal financing. Additionally, ARRA allows states to grandfather the change in EB eligibility for those already in the program, with benefits continuing to be federally financed until exhausted. Railroad workers can also receive an additional 13 weeks of extended benefits, totaling up to 26 weeks. Extended unemployment benefits have been increased to 26 weeks for qualifying railroad employees, regardless of years of service. This provision applied to employees who received normal unemployment benefits between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2009, with subsequent legislation extending these benefits. Individuals who received certain types of unemployment benefits in 2009 can exclude up to $2,400 in benefits from gross income. In 2009, individuals who received unemployment benefits can exclude up to $2,400 from gross income. States must sign agreements with DOL to receive $25 weekly supplemental benefits. This would reduce federal receipts by $4.7 billion. The ARRA in 2009 provided for a special transfer of up to $7 billion from the Federal Unemployment Account to State accounts as incentive payments for changing state UC laws. States do not need to enter into an agreement with the Labor Secretary for 100% federal financing of the EB program. The maximum incentive payment for a state is calculated based on the state's share of estimated federal unemployment taxes. Unemployment taxes paid by state employers in FY2008 are estimated. DOL issues guidelines for applications for the unemployment modernization incentive payment. States must enact an alternative base period to qualify for one-third of the distribution. Applications are due by August 22, 2011, with payments required before October 1, 2011. Most states use the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters as the base period to determine monetary entitlement to Unemployment Compensation (UC). If a worker fails to qualify under the regular base period, some states may use an Alternative Base Period (ABP) to assess eligibility. States must meet certain criteria to qualify for distribution of funds, including enacting an alternative base period. The law requires states to meet specific criteria to receive funds for modernizing their unemployment compensation programs, including provisions for part-time workers, voluntary separations for family reasons, extended compensation for training programs, and dependents allowances. States must apply for certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) within 30 days, and DOL will not certify any provisions with restrictions related to low balances. States must meet specific criteria to receive funds for modernizing their unemployment compensation programs. They must apply for certification from the Department of Labor within 30 days. DOL will not certify provisions with restrictions related to low balances in the state account of the UTFs. State laws do not have to be active when applying for certification, but must become active within one year to qualify. States that already met the requirements for incentive payments before ARRA need DOL certification of their existing programs. DOL maintains a record of ARRA modernization money disbursements by state. The UI modernization provisions have been controversial in some states. The ARRA UI modernization provisions have sparked controversy in some states. Economists believe that increased spending on unemployment benefits is an effective form of economic stimulus. States may face financial implications once the federal modernization funds are depleted. The ARRA allocated $500 million for the administration of state unemployment programs. The ARRA allocated funds for state unemployment programs, including federal financing for EUC08 and EB programs. The $25 weekly supplemental benefit will be 100% federally financed. The EUC08 program, federally financed since July 2008, will now be funded from general revenues due to ARRA. $7 billion in incentive payments for state unemployment program modernization will be 100% federally financed through the UTF. States must meet requirements for transfers, but do not need to repay the incentive payments. The ARRA provides $500 million transfer to states for administrative costs related to unemployment compensation programs. States will not need to repay the funds, which will be transferred within 30 days of enactment. The EB program will be 100% federally financed through the EUCA of the UTF, while states will continue to finance 100% of benefits for unemployed former state and local government employees. The federal government will cover 100% of EB administrative costs. The stimulus package under ARRA continues the temporary suspension of the waiting week requirement for federal funding until May 30, 2010. States will finance regular UC through SUTA revenues, while the federal government will cover administration costs. States are required to pay UC benefits even if insolvent, and some may borrow from the FUA within the UTF. ARRA waives interest payments on federal advances to state unemployment funds until December 31, 2010. The ARRA stimulus package suspends the waiting week requirement for federal funding until May 30, 2010. States will finance regular UC through SUTA revenues, while the federal government covers administration costs. ARRA waives interest payments on federal advances to state unemployment funds until December 31, 2010. If a state fails to repay funds or show progress, the federal tax credit to employers could be reduced, increasing the federal unemployment tax on employers in that state."
