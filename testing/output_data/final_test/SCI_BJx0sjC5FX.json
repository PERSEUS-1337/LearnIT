    "content": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can learn vector representations of sequences and sentences with linear regularities. Tensor Product Decomposition Networks (TPDNs) use tensor product representations to approximate existing vector representations, showing interpretable compositional structure in RNN autoencoder representations. TPDN experiments show that RNNs can induce structure-sensitive representations, while standard RNNs can approximate compositional sequence representations well. However, existing training tasks for sentence representation learning may not be sufficient for robust structural representations. Neural network representations in natural language processing have shown great success using continuous vector representations instead of symbolic structures. These representations encode compositional structure and display geometric regularities, supporting the hypothesis. Analogical relationships and tensor product representations are examples of methods for designing compositional vector embeddings of symbolic structures. Neural network representations in natural language processing have shown success with continuous vector representations. Symbolic structures are decomposed into filler-role bindings, with each filler and role having a vector embedding. These embeddings are combined using tensor products and summed to represent sequences, demonstrating systematicity in learned vector spaces. The Tensor Product Decomposition Network (TPDN) aims to approximate vector representations of sequences as filler-role bindings. By analyzing continuous vector representations, TPDN learns filler and role embeddings to predict vectors based on a specific hypothesis for roles. It focuses on structure-sensitive representations through tasks driven by structure, such as autoencoding sequences of meaningless symbols. TPDNs find excellent approximations that are Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) for the learned representations. The Tensor Product Decomposition Network (TPDN) aims to approximate vector representations of sequences as filler-role bindings, focusing on structure-sensitive representations. TPDNs find accurate approximations with Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) for learned representations, shedding light on neural architectures. Standard RNNs can induce compositional representations well approximated by TPRs, suggesting they are not robustly structure-sensitive. The Tensor Product Decomposition Network (TPDN) uses Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) to approximate vector encodings of sequences, showing that structured architectures and training tasks can enhance compositional capabilities. Standard sentence encoders do not learn robust structure representations, indicating a need for more structure-dependent models. The Tensor Product Decomposition Network (TPDN) utilizes Tensor Product Representations (TPRs) to approximate vector encodings of sequences. The model learns embeddings for fillers and roles to minimize distance between TPRs and existing encodings. A linear transformation M is applied before comparison, and the overall function computed is M(flatten(ir \u2297 fi)). The TPDN is effective at uncovering structural representations used by RNNs in sequence-to-sequence networks trained on an autoencoding objective. The experiment tested different sequence-to-sequence architectures (unidirectional, bidirectional, and tree-based) using digit sequences from 0 to 9. Gated recurrent units were used as recurrent units for all networks. The experiment tested various sequence-to-sequence architectures, including unidirectional, bidirectional, and tree-based models. The bidirectional encoder combines left-to-right and right-to-left unidirectional encoders, while the bidirectional decoder combines both types of decoders. The final architecture used tree-based RNNs, specifically the Tree-GRU encoder and tree decoder, which require a tree structure as part of their input. The experiment tested different sequence-to-sequence architectures, including unidirectional, bidirectional, and tree-based models. A deterministic algorithm grouped digits based on their values, and five instances of each architecture were trained with different random initializations. Six possible methods for representing the roles of digits within a sequence were considered, such as left-to-right, right-to-left, bidirectional, Wickelroles, and tree positions. The algorithm in Appendix C.6 defines tree structures for representing digits in a sequence. A bag-of-words approach is used to capture the presence and quantity of digits, disregarding their positions. RNN autoencoders are expected to learn role representations based on their architectures. Evaluation involves approximating a sequence-to-sequence network with a TPR using different role schemes without additional training. The algorithm defines tree structures for representing digits in a sequence using a bag-of-words approach. RNN autoencoders learn role representations based on their architectures. The TPDN approximates the encoder well for the decoder to handle resulting vectors, with high substitution accuracy. Seq2seq networks performed training tasks nearly perfectly, with accuracies of 0.999 and 0.989 for unidirectional and tree-based architectures, and 0.834 for bidirectional architecture. The TPDN approximation evaluated the role schemes of different architectures using substitution accuracy. Results showed that the tree-based autoencoder was best approximated by tree-position roles, while the unidirectional architecture favored bidirectional roles. The asymmetry suggests a preference for mildly bidirectional roles in the unidirectional network. The TPDN model strongly favors one direction over the other, even though it uses bidirectional roles. Certain roles with the same left-to-right position can be collapsed without much loss of accuracy. The bidirectional architecture is not well approximated by any role schemes investigated, possibly indicating a different structure-encoding scheme. The model's accuracy on the training task was relatively low. The success of TPDN with digit-sequence autoencoders is questioned when applied to models trained on naturally occurring data, using sentence representations from various models. The TPDN model was fitted to various sentence encoding models, including SNLI, Skip-thought, Stanford sentiment model, and SPINN. Pretrained word embeddings were used due to poor performance when learning filler embeddings from scratch. Fine-tuning was done with a linear transformation on top of the word embedding layer. The Wickelrole scheme was not used due to the large vocabulary size. The model was fine-tuned with a linear transformation on top of the word embedding layer. Training was done on sentence embeddings generated by the model for all SNLI premise sentences. Table 1a shows mean squared errors for different role schemes, with tree-position roles outperforming others for SST. Bag-of-words roles performed nearly as well as other schemes, in contrast to their poor performance in Section 2. The curr_chunk discusses the use of downstream tasks to evaluate tensor product approximations compared to models at four widely accepted tasks for sentence embeddings. Results show no significant difference between bag-of-words roles and other roles for all tasks except SNLI. The downstream tasks evaluated tensor product approximations compared to models for sentence embeddings. Bag-of-words roles performed similarly to other role schemes for all tasks except SNLI, where other role schemes outperformed. Tree-based models were best approximated with tree-based roles, while InferSent was better with structural roles. Skip-thought could not be well approximated with any role scheme considered. Bag-of-words roles provided a good approximation overall, with structured roles showing modest improvements. The explanation suggests that bag-of-words roles are a strong but imperfect approximation for sentence embedding models. The possibility of models using a different structural representation is considered. Sentence analogies are proposed to reveal representational details that may not be apparent in individual sentences. An analogy example is provided to illustrate the concept. The curr_chunk discusses role-diagnostic analogies and their implications for different role schemes in sentence embedding models. It presents a dataset of analogies that only hold for specific role schemes and explains the methodology used to evaluate these analogies. Results from different models are compared, showing that some models are more consistent with bidirectional roles. The curr_chunk discusses the performance of different sentence embedding models in role-diagnostic analogies. Results show that some models exhibit bidirectional roles, while others show tree-based or bidirectional roles. The bag-of-words column indicates poor performance, suggesting that these models have a weak notion of structure. However, other possible explanations for their behavior still remain. In investigating the compositionality of learned representations, the study explores how training aspects can influence it. By examining the architecture and training task, the contribution of the encoder and decoder is teased apart. Different network configurations are tested to understand their impact on learned representations. The study explores how different decoder types influence the learned roles in neural networks. Models with unidirectional decoders prefer bidirectional roles, while tree-based decoders are best approximated by tree-based roles. The encoder also plays a role, with tree-position roles performing better in certain models. This suggests that focusing on the decoder may be more effective in shaping representations. Additionally, the training task affects the learned representations, with different tasks yielding varying results. The study examines how different decoder types impact learned roles in neural networks. Training tasks like autoencoding, reversal, sorting, and interleaving influence the representations. The model shows preferences for bidirectional roles in some tasks, while bag-of-words roles perform well in sorting. The decoder type plays a significant role in shaping representations. The study explores how different decoder types affect learned roles in neural networks. Results show that for sorting tasks, bag-of-words roles perform almost as well as other schemes, indicating that RNNs only learn compositional representations when necessary. This suggests that models may ignore structural information if the training tasks do not heavily rely on it. The study examines interpreting neural network representations through probing tasks, decoding vector representations, and decomposing the vector space into filler-role bindings. The TPDN successfully decomposes sequence representations, showing that RNNs can be approximated without nonlinearities. The study shows that RNNs can be approximated without nonlinearities or recurrence, related to Levy et al. (2018) findings. BID33 also achieved good performance without recurrence, incorporating sequence position embeddings. Methods for interpreting neural networks using more interpretable architectures have been proposed before. The decomposition of vector representations into fillers and roles is related to work on separating latent variables. In face recognition, techniques like eigenfaces and TensorFaces are used to disentangle facial features. Incorporating symbolic representations into neural networks has been explored, with TPRs and filler-role representations showing promise. Internal representations play a crucial role in enabling simple sequence-to-sequence models to perform complex tasks. In heavily structure-sensitive tasks, sequence-to-sequence models learn representations approximated by tensorproduct representations (TPRs). The tensor-product decomposition network (TPDN) approximates learned representations via TPRs. Variations in architecture and task induce different types of structure-sensitivity in representations, with the decoder playing a greater role. TPDNs applied to sentence-embedding models show evidence of structure-sensitivity. The experiment provides evidence for structure-sensitivity in TPDN architecture, with a limitation being the need for pre-selected representations. Future research could focus on automatically exploring hypotheses about TPR nature. The analysis delves into how different aspects of TPDN architecture contribute to the results, using TPDNs to approximate a sequence-to-sequence network for the reversal task. The model diverges from traditional tensor product representations in certain areas. The final linear layer in our model diverges from traditional tensor product representations and is crucial for successful decomposition of learned representations, as shown in TAB3. The dimensionality of filler and role embeddings in the TPDN affects substitution accuracy. Substitution accuracy increases with role dimensionality until it plateaus at 6, indicating linear independence. Filler dimensionality also impacts accuracy, but the plateau point is less clear. Linear independence is crucial for fidelity in tensor product representations. The paper focused on using the tensor product as the operation for binding fillers to roles. Two alternatives were tested: circular convolution and elementwise product. Both require roles and fillers to have the same embedding dimension. Setting the dimension to 20 showed varying accuracy levels. The models tested were TPDNs trained to approximate a sequence-to-sequence model for reversal. Our preliminary experiments suggest that circular convolution and elementwise product show promise for binding operations but require larger embedding dimensions than tensor products. Despite this, they have fewer parameters overall due to smaller final linear layers. The algorithm generates a tree structure for digit sequences by combining the smallest element with its neighbor at each timestep. Results of experiments on training tasks, encoder, and decoder variations are summarized in two tables. The algorithm generates tree structures for digit sequences by combining elements at each timestep. Standardized parameters were used for all sequence-to-sequence models trained on digit-sequence tasks. Decoders only use the previous hidden state for computing new hidden states, without using previous outputs. Decoders are informed when to stop decoding based on sequence length or tree positions.

Decoders only use the previous hidden state for computing new hidden states, without using previous outputs. Decoders are informed when to stop decoding based on sequence length or tree positions. The architectures used a digit embedding dimensionality of 10 and a hidden layer size of 60. For bidirectional decoders, a linear layer condensed the encoding into 30 dimensions before being passed to the forward and backward decoders. The networks were trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and negative log likelihood computed over softmax probability distributions for each output. The training of TPDNs for digit-based sequence-to-sequence models used a batch size of 32 and halted training when the loss on the development set did not improve for a full epoch. Filler and role embedding dimensions were set to 20 based on successful decomposition experiments. Training regimen for TPDNs remained consistent with the rest of the models. The TPDNs were trained with mean squared error instead of negative log likelihood, using sequences of fillers, roles, embeddings, and dimensionalities. Parameters updated included filler embeddings, role embeddings, and linear transformation. Pretrained versions of sentence encoding models were used.

Parameters updated included filler embeddings, role embeddings, and linear transformation. Pretrained versions of sentence encoding models were used, with specific dimensions chosen for different models. The training regimen for the TPDNs on sentence models involved sequences of fillers, roles, embeddings, and dimensionalities. Parameters updated included role embeddings, linear transformations, and specific values for embeddings. The TPDNs were trained to approximate premise sentences from the SNLI corpus, showing better performance compared to using sentences from the WikiText-2 corpus. The TPDNs were trained on sentence models using sequences of fillers, roles, embeddings, and dimensionalities. They were evaluated on downstream tasks including Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC), and Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) for accuracy and F1 scores. The TPDNs were evaluated on downstream tasks such as Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) and SentEval, reporting accuracy and correlation coefficients. The results for TPDN approximations of sentence encoders were similar to substitution accuracy for digit encoders. Table 10 shows the downstream task performance of classifiers trained and tested on TPDNs approximating different models. The rightmost column indicates the performance of the original model without TPDN approximation."
