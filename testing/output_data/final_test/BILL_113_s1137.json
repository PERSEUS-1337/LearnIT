The Social Security Act is amended to include an annual update for the OPD fee schedule increase factor for each year starting from 2014. The Social Security Act is amended to include an annual update for the OPD fee schedule increase factor for each year starting from 2014, adjusted in accordance with clauses (iv) and (v). SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY OF QUALITY REPORTS AND APPLICATION OF VALUE-BASED PURCHASING TO ASCS. The Secretary shall make quality measures data available on Medicare.gov for ambulatory surgical centers and hospital outpatient departments to allow side-by-side comparisons in the same geographic area. The Secretary will publish comparisons of Medicare payment and beneficiary copayment amounts for procedures in ambulatory surgical centers and hospital outpatient departments in the same area. Ambulatory surgery centers and hospitals can review and submit corrections for public data before it is released. The Secretary will establish an ambulatory surgical center value-based purchasing program under which eligible centers meeting performance standards can receive incentives. The ambulatory surgical center value-based purchasing program allows eligible centers to receive shared savings for surgical services based on performance standards. The program applies to procedures starting January 1, 2015, and includes measures to determine incentives. The Secretary selects measures for the ambulatory surgical center value-based purchasing program from specified measures. Measures must be available on Medicare.gov for at least 1 year before the performance period to be used in the program. The Secretary establishes performance standards for measures selected under the ambulatory surgical center value-based purchasing program. The Secretary establishes performance standards for the ambulatory surgery center value-based purchasing program, including levels of achievement and improvement. Performance standards must be announced at least 60 days before the performance period for the calendar year. The performance period for the program will be set for each calendar year, beginning and ending before the start of the year. The Secretary will create a methodology to assess the total performance of each ambulatory surgery center. The Secretary establishes performance standards for ambulatory surgery centers in a value-based purchasing program. A methodology is created to assess each center's performance based on selected measures. Appeals process is established for centers to challenge their performance scores. The Secretary establishes performance standards for ambulatory surgery centers in a value-based purchasing program, including the calculation of performance scores and value-based incentive payments. The process ensures timely resolution of appeals. The Secretary determines value-based percentage amounts for ambulatory surgical centers based on ASC performance scores and total savings pool availability. Annual shared savings funding is calculated for incentive payments. Ambulatory surgery centers are eligible for shared savings under the Program based on estimated Medicare expenditures for surgical services. The Secretary determines the appropriate percent below the benchmark for estimated Medicare expenditures for surgical services. The Secretary calculates a benchmark for each year based on estimated Medicare expenditures for surgical services and the average annual growth. The benchmark for annual growth in Medicare expenditures is reset yearly and adjusted for enrollment changes. Payments for shared savings to ambulatory surgical centers are available if certain requirements are met. Payments for shared savings to ambulatory surgical centers are available if performance scores are met or exceeded under the Program. The Secretary estimates the total savings pool for each year of the Program based on a conversion factor determined under the payment system for covered OPD services. The estimated Medicare expenditures for surgical services furnished to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and the average annual growth in expenditures for such services are calculated for the Program. The value-based percentage amount and percent determined for Medicare expenditures on surgical services under subsection (t) in recent years do not have an effect in subsequent calendar years. The value-based percentage amount for Medicare expenditures on surgical services in recent years will not be considered in making payments to ambulatory surgery centers in subsequent calendar years. SEC. 4. Advisory Panel on Hospital Outpatient Payment Representation amended to include at least one ambulatory surgical center representative. Effective date is upon enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. Reasons for excluding additional procedures from ASC approved list. The Social Security Act is amended to require the Secretary to cite specific criteria for excluding procedures from approved lists, based on peer-reviewed research or evidence. Section 416.166 of title 42 is referenced for exclusion criteria, with a prohibition on using section 416.166(c)(7) as a basis for exclusion. The amendment made by subsection (a) will apply to lists of ambulatory surgery procedures for years after the enactment of this Act."
