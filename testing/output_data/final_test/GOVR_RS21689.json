Bush proposed a 1.5% increase in basic pay and 0.5% in locality-based payments for January 2004, unless Congress intervenes. The House and Senate approved a 4.1% pay adjustment effective January 2004, with a 2.7% ECI adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment.

The net adjustment for the Washington, DC area is 2.12%."
