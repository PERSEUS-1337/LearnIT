The \"American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007\" includes findings that highlight the importance of checks and balances in preventing government abuses and protecting individual freedoms. It emphasizes the need to maintain these checks and balances to safeguard against oppressive transgressions and ensure the safety of the nation. The text discusses the unprecedented constitutional powers claimed by the President since 9/11 for non-national security purposes. It emphasizes the importance of congressional oversight to prevent secret government and maintain checks and balances. The American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007 aims to restore the Constitution's checks and balances in response to post-9/11 challenges to prevent government abuses. The American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007 repeals the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and authorizes the President to establish military commissions for war crimes trials in active hostilities against the US. The President is prohibited from indefinitely detaining individuals as unlawful enemy combatants without substantial evidence of direct engagement in hostilities. Detained individuals have the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The American Freedom Agenda Act of 2007 addresses torture, coerced confessions, intelligence gathering, presidential signing statements, and kidnapping, detentions, and torture abroad. It prohibits the use of statements obtained through torture or coercion, restricts federal agencies from gathering foreign intelligence in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, allows Congress to challenge presidential signing statements in court, and addresses issues related to kidnapping, detentions, and torture overseas. SEC. 7 of the American Freedom Agenda Act prohibits officers or agents of the United States from kidnapping, imprisoning, or torturing individuals abroad solely based on the President's belief. However, kidnapping is allowed for prosecution or interrogation purposes before a tribunal meeting international standards. Violations are punishable by a fine or up to 2 years imprisonment. SEC. 8 states that journalists can publish information from the executive branch or Congress unless it directly harms national security. SEC. 9 prohibits the use of secret evidence by the President or executive branch to designate individuals or organizations as foreign terrorists, imposing criminal or civil sanctions."
