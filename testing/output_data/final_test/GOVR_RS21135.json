However, as it diversified into internet markets, it faced financial troubles due to high investments and debt. Enron faced financial troubles after investing heavily in markets near the peak of the dot com boom, taking on high debt. Revenue dried up from these investments during the dot com crash, leading to significant losses in foreign operations. Despite profitable energy trading businesses, Enron couldn't withstand losses in its other portfolios. The company's prospects became dire after the Internet bubble burst. Enron's dire prospects worsened due to bad investments and financial troubles. The company's response to its problems turned into a major scandal as it falsified accounts, hiding losses in unconsolidated partnerships and special purpose entities. Enron also disguised bank loans as energy trades to conceal its indebtedness. These accounting fictions were sustained for nearly 18 months before being exposed. The accounting fictions at Enron were sustained for 18 months before being exposed, leading to the collapse of the corporation and the disappearance of over 80% of reported profits since 2000. This highlighted flaws in the U.S. securities regulation system, sparking major corporate accounting scandals. Enron raised concerns about corporate fraud, accounting transparency, and investor protection. Federal securities law mandates independent auditor certification of publicly traded corporations' accounting statements. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was complicit in deceptive financial practices. The question arises whether current accounting standards allow for manipulation, posing risks to investors. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) sets accounting standards, with oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to accounting scandals like Enron, creating the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to regulate auditors of publicly traded companies and raising standards of auditor independence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 enhances corporate accountability by requiring preapproval for nonaudit services, increasing responsibility of top management and audit committees for financial accuracy, improving disclosure requirements for transactions, preventing conflicts of interest for stock analysts, providing additional funding for the SEC, and imposing stricter criminal penalties for securities fraud offenses. Enron sponsored a retirement plan for its employees, with 62% of the assets in the 401(k) plan consisting of Enron stock. The stock value plummeted from over $80/share to less than 70 cents, causing significant losses for employees. This raised concerns about laws governing retirement plans. In the 107th Congress, legislation (H.R. 3762) aimed to improve retirement plans by providing more account information to participants, allowing diversification of portfolios, and restricting executives from selling company stock while plans are \"locked down.\" Similar legislation did not progress in the 108th Congress. Corporate boards faced scrutiny post-Enron scandal. Boards of directors faced scrutiny post-Enron scandal. Sarbanes-Oxley provisions aimed to empower independent directors and audit committees to oversee management and accounting processes. Requirements include a majority of independent directors on the audit committee, hiring and overseeing outside auditors, and having a financial expert on the committee. Stock exchanges also adopted rules mandating a majority of independent directors for listed corporations. The SEC is considering a rule to facilitate shareholder nomination of directors. Analyst recommendations are crucial for companies like Enron, which relied on constant funding. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addresses conflicts of interest for analysts, issued in 2003. In 2003, the SEC fined Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase for their roles in Enron's accounting frauds, totaling $120 million and $135 million respectively. The fallout from Enron's demise involved conflicts of interest between the investment and commercial banking businesses with Enron. Several questions were raised about financial holding companies encompassing both. Several questions have been raised regarding financial holding companies, including conflicts of interest between investment and commercial banking operations, enticement or pressure on bankers to fund Enron, the Dynegy rescue plan, proper accounting for off-balance-sheet items like derivatives, and the need to fine-tune the GLBA in light of the Enron situation. Enron's core energy business involved trading in derivative contracts based on oil, gas, and electricity prices. These contracts allowed buyers to hedge risks. Limited information is available on the extent and profitability of Enron's derivatives activities due to unregulated markets and lack of reporting requirements. While trading in derivatives is high-risk, there is no evidence of speculative losses contributing to Enron's downfall. Several energy derivatives dealers engaged in deceptive accounting practices post-Enron collapse, leading to a decline in energy derivatives trading. Enron and other market participants were involved in manipulative trading practices during the California electricity crisis, such as buying electricity at a fixed price in California and selling it elsewhere at a higher market price. The evidence suggests that energy derivatives did not play a major role in manipulative trading strategies during the California electricity crisis. However, the issue of supervision of unregulated derivatives markets is raised following Enron's failure. Regulators may benefit from having more information about the portfolios and risk exposures of major derivatives dealers to prevent future disruptions in financial and commodity markets. Legislation proposed in the 107th and 108th Congress aimed to give the CFTC more authority to pursue fraud in the OTC market and increase regulatory oversight of energy derivatives markets. The Senate rejected these proposals, which could have prevented disruptions in financial and commodity markets."
