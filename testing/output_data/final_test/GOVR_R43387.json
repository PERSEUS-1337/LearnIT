    "content": "The U.S.-EU trade relationship, known as the \"transatlantic economy,\" is the largest and most important globally. Negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) aim to address barriers and enhance market access. The Obama Administration notified Congress of its intent to enter into T-TIP negotiations on March 20, 2013. Negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) between the U.S. and EU began in July 2013. The goal was to conclude the negotiations in two years, but it has been extended multiple times. The current status is uncertain due to the complexity of the negotiations and the U.S. focus on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Twelve rounds of negotiations have taken place, with progress made in many areas according to a U.S. statement. Congress has a direct interest in T-TIP negotiations as it establishes U.S. trade objectives. The report provides context, analysis, and discussion on possible trade and investment issues in the T-TIP negotiations. The negotiations are not public, and information is based on publicly available sources. Congress has a direct interest in T-TIP negotiations to advance U.S. trade objectives. The proposal for a \"Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement\" (TAFTA) dates back to 1995, aiming to prevent Europe and the United States from drifting apart post-Cold War. Critics raised concerns about the feasibility of addressing issues like agricultural subsidies and regulatory practices. Although negotiations did not proceed at that time, the idea has periodically resurfaced. The proposal for a \"Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement\" (TAFTA) has periodically resurfaced since 1995, driven by factors such as the Eurozone crisis, slow economic recovery, and increased competition from emerging markets. Interest in reducing U.S.-EU trade barriers to boost economic growth and jobs is supported by various studies, with some policymakers viewing an FTA as a \"low-cost\" tool. However, challenges in reaching agreement on long-standing differences in transatlantic trade relations are also acknowledged. The decision to launch the T-TIP negotiations followed recommendations of the U.S.-EU High-Level Working Group (HLWG) on Jobs and Growth, established to increase transatlantic trade and investment for economic growth and competitiveness. Some are skeptical of U.S. trade negotiations, expressing concerns about the impact on import-sensitive sectors of the economy and governments' ability to protect health, environmental, and labor interests. The HLWG recommended launching negotiations on a comprehensive bilateral trade and investment agreement, known as T-TIP, to enhance market access, regulatory compatibility, and cooperation between the U.S. and EU. The HLWG recommended launching negotiations on a comprehensive bilateral trade and investment agreement, known as T-TIP, to enhance market access, regulatory compatibility, and cooperation between the U.S. and EU. The negotiations include discussion on various global issues such as intellectual property rights, the environment, and labor, as well as other trade-related areas. U.S. participation in T-TIP could support overall trade policy objectives to open markets and advance rules-based trade and investment liberalization. The United States is actively engaged in various international trade agreements, including FTAs with multiple countries and participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) FTA agreement. The U.S. is also involved in negotiations within the WTO on trade in services and environmental goods. T-TIP aims to enhance market access and regulatory compatibility between the U.S. and EU, supporting overall trade policy objectives. The potential Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) between the U.S. and EU aims to reduce trade barriers and increase market access. Compared to other countries' trade agreements, U.S. FTAs are considered more comprehensive and high standard. EU trade agreements vary in content based on the economic level of the trading partner, with EU FTAs seen as more comprehensive than some other countries, like China. T-TIP offers an opportunity for the United States to pursue greater market access and enhanced rules and disciplines. T-TIP provides an opportunity for the United States and the EU to cooperate on trade issues of mutual interest, potentially leading to new globally-relevant disciplines. This partnership could address regulatory cooperation, state-owned enterprises, and barriers to digital trade. Similar to TPP, T-TIP could allow the US and EU to \"write the rules\" for the global economy together, given their common values and interests. The relationship and agreement between the United States and EU on trade and investment issues could influence global trading rules. T-TIP is significant for strengthening their trade relationship and gaining market access. The EU and Japan, as well as the EU and Canada, have negotiated bilateral FTAs in light of their existing agreements with other countries. The T-TIP agreement between the United States and the EU aims to establish new global trade rules, but differences in regulatory approaches may pose challenges. The T-TIP agreement between the United States and the EU could bring considerable influence in the global economy. Consensus may require flexibility from both sides due to their comparable economic size. The outcome of T-TIP could impact the U.S.-EU political relationship, reinforcing commitment or calling it into question based on the agreement's comprehensiveness. The U.S. is focusing on the Asia-Pacific region, but it does not mean a pivot away from Europe. The TPP negotiations could boost support for T-TIP, which is expected to bring significant economic benefits due to the size and advanced nature of the U.S. and EU economies. The proposed T-TIP would be a significant economic agreement, surpassing existing U.S. FTAs and the recently concluded TPP in terms of GDP coverage and population. It would rank as the third largest U.S. FTA in goods trade, the largest in services trade, and the third largest overall when combining goods and services. Additionally, T-TIP would greatly exceed existing U.S. FTAs and the proposed TPP in terms of investment, with U.S.-EU direct investment being more than five times that between the United States and NAFTA countries. The United States and the EU have a significant economic relationship, with total trade in goods and services amounting to $1.1 trillion in 2014. Despite the growing role of China and other emerging markets, the US and EU remain each other's largest trade and investment partners. U.S.-EU trade is heavily focused on advanced products, with flows of merchandise trade, services trade, and income totaling $1.7 trillion in 2014. Intra-industry trade and intra-firm trade play a significant role in the U.S.-EU economic relationship. Related-party trade, involving multinational companies and their affiliates, accounts for a large portion of goods traded between the two regions. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a major driver of transatlantic trade, with the U.S. and EU being each other's largest investors. In 2014, U.S. FDI in the EU totaled $2.5 trillion, highlighting the importance of the economic ties between the two entities. U.S. and EU investors collectively owned over $4 trillion in direct investment in each other's economy in 2014, spanning various sectors. U.S. trade negotiations aim to reduce barriers in goods, services, and agriculture through the T-TIP negotiations, focusing on market access issues. The T-TIP negotiations aim to reduce market access barriers between the U.S. and EU. Tariffs are already low, but further elimination could bring economic gains. Greater cooperation in regulations and standards could reduce nontariff barriers in key sectors like automobiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Regulatory cooperation is seen as a core component of T-TIP. Negotiations on rules for the T-TIP agreement cover areas such as intellectual property rights, investment, digital trade, labor, environment, and state-owned enterprises. These rules could be based on existing WTO agreements and may address issues not previously covered in U.S. FTAs or multilateral agreements. The U.S. and EU share common approaches to regulatory issues, with a focus on consumer health and safety. Both sides in the T-TIP negotiations are committed to protecting consumer health and safety through regulations, maintaining strong overall protections for investment, IPR, labor, and the environment. Certain areas, such as regulations related to the precautionary principle and rules for cultural exceptions, remain points of debate. T-TIP aims to eliminate duties on bilateral trade in goods, with a goal of substantially eliminating tariffs upon entry into force of the potential agreement. The T-TIP negotiations aim to eliminate tariffs on bilateral trade in goods, potentially leading to significant economic gains for both the U.S. and EU. Some view tariffs as \"low-hanging fruit\" in the negotiations, suggesting a focus on a more comprehensive agreement that addresses regulatory and market access issues. EU and U.S. imports currently face most-favored-nation or normal trade relations rates. According to WTO statistics, the U.S. has a simple average applied tariff rate of 3.5% ad valorem, lower than the EU's rate of 5.3%. Tariffs are higher in certain import-sensitive categories like dairy products, sugar, beverages, and textiles. EU tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports are much higher than U.S. tariffs on EU imports. U.S. firms pay about $6.4 billion in tariffs to the EU, with negotiations covering 97% of tariff lines. Negotiators have exchanged tariff offers covering 97% of tariff lines, but have not agreed on import-sensitive sectors like agriculture. Tariffs are significant for U.S. and EU intra-company trade, with U.S. firms facing $2.4 billion in duties on intra-firm imports from the EU in 2011. Nuisance tariffs add unnecessary costs to trade. The services sector includes various economic activities like banking, insurance, and tourism. Services represent a significant portion of the U.S. GDP, encompassing a wide range of economic activities such as delivery, tourism, and telecommunications. The EU is a crucial market for U.S. services exports, with the United Kingdom being the largest destination. In 2014, the U.S. had a services trade surplus with the EU, exporting $219 billion and importing $169 billion worth of services. In 2014, U.S. imports of services from the UK totaled about $50 billion, followed by Germany ($33 billion), France ($17 billion), and Ireland ($15 billion). Firms that produce services are often discussed in contrast with manufacturers that produce tangible goods. Manufacturing firms might export intellectual property in exchange for royalties and licensing fees and import or export design support, research and development, or product testing. This is important in U.S.-EU services trade due to the number of firms operating on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States and EU are signatories to the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), aiming to remove trade barriers in services. The HLWG report recommended U.S.-EU negotiations in services to focus on new market access, regulatory cooperation, and binding commitments for transparency and due process. Additionally, the U.S. and EU are negotiating services liberalization in a potential Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). The EU and the United States are negotiating services liberalization in a potential Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). Financial services are a key component of the transatlantic economic relationship, with market access issues expected to be addressed in the T-TIP negotiations. Debate continues over whether regulatory issues in the negotiations should include financial services, especially in light of ongoing reforms in response to the global financial crisis. Members of Congress, European officials, and business groups on both sides of the Atlantic are involved in the discussions. Some Members of Congress, European officials, and business groups support including financial services regulatory issues in T-TIP negotiations. Concerns exist about potential lowering of financial regulatory standards, such as consumer protections in the Dodd-Frank Act. Discussions on financial regulatory cooperation are ongoing between the United States and EU. The United States and EU are discussing financial regulatory cooperation issues in larger dialogues like the G-20 and the Financial Stability Board. They are also engaging in bilateral discussions, with the U.S. intending to negotiate with the EU on prudential measures for reinsurance. U.S. officials are hesitant to include financial regulatory cooperation in T-TIP negotiations due to concerns about interference with ongoing discussions. U.S. Trade Representative Froman suggested that market access issues should be part of the negotiations, while regulatory issues should be addressed separately. EU negotiators are pushing for the inclusion of financial services market access in the T-TIP negotiations, linking it to regulatory cooperation. Cultural exceptions, like those in France for film and television industries, are a contentious issue in the talks. Some EU member states, led by France, want to exclude audiovisual services from T-TIP negotiations. The Council of Ministers approved the negotiating mandate, excluding audiovisual services, but the European Commission could recommend their inclusion later. This decision could set a precedent for excluding other sensitive sectors. The T-TIP negotiations may also address licensing and certification for professional services providers. The T-TIP could address licensing and certification of professional services providers, including challenges with cross-border services and recognition of qualifications. It may also address the delivery of services through sending providers across borders, with potential changes in Mode 4 regulations. The T-TIP may include provisions for easier movement of business professionals across borders, as seen in the EU-Canada CETA agreement. The TiSA negotiations also discuss Mode 4 services, with specific objectives in electronic commerce and communication technology services outlined by the Obama Administration. The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPA) includes negotiating objectives in digital trade, focusing on the development of provisions for electronic commerce and cross-border data flows. The Internet plays a crucial role in trade as a delivery platform and services sector, benefiting businesses by facilitating internal communication, supply chain management, and global business transactions. Internet commerce is more effective than traditional channels in reducing international trade costs and overcoming trade barriers. The Internet plays a crucial role in trade by facilitating cross-border data flows and enabling businesses to connect, share information, and conduct global transactions. National governments sometimes restrict data flow across borders, limiting the opportunities for individuals and businesses. Some governments regulate data flow across borders to curb illegal activities like identity theft and child pornography. Rule of law issues, such as dispute settlement and contract enforcement, also drive government concerns as the Internet expands as a business platform. However, some measures may be seen as discriminatory, like requiring financial service providers to process data on-shore or imposing localization barriers to trade. Europe is the largest trading partner of the United States. The United States and Europe have a significant digital trade relationship, with data flows between them being the largest globally. Digitally-enabled services, especially in financial services, play a key role in this transatlantic trading partnership. However, barriers such as data privacy requirements and localization issues still exist. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) is not expected to address data protection standards, but the EU is open to discussing data flows within the agreement. The EU is willing to discuss data flows in the T-TIP talks but will not discuss changes to EU data protection standards. Differences in data protection approaches between the US and EU have raised concerns among Europeans, especially regarding US privacy laws and data collection practices. The unauthorized disclosure of NSA surveillance activities heightened these concerns, leading to discussions between the US and EU on privacy rights of EU citizens. EU officials are concerned about privacy rights of EU citizens in T-TIP negotiations, with U.S. companies worried about potential data flow restrictions. The NSA leaks have reignited European concerns about the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement, established in 2000 for privacy protection. The Safe Harbor Agreement, established in 2000, allowed U.S. businesses to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. in compliance with EU rules. Over 4,000 U.S. companies were certified under the program. In response to NSA disclosures, the European Commission recognized weaknesses in Safe Harbor but decided not to suspend it to avoid harming business interests. Instead, in November 2013, the commission issued recommendations to improve the program and engaged with U.S. authorities to address concerns about U.S. government access to personal data. The Safe Harbor Agreement, established in 2000, allowed U.S. businesses to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. in compliance with EU rules. In response to concerns about U.S. government access to personal data, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated Safe Harbor. This led to the EU data protection authorities enforcing the decision, potentially blocking data transfers. To address this issue, the U.S. and EU agreed to the \"EU-U.S. Privacy Shield\" framework on February 2, 2016, to enhance privacy protections for European personal data. The Privacy Shield framework, replacing Safe Harbor, will require U.S. companies to self-certify compliance with its requirements. It includes U.S. Government enforcement obligations and clear limitations on access to EU personal data for law enforcement and national security purposes. Additional avenues for EU citizens' data privacy concerns are provided, including independent dispute resolutions and a new ombudsman at the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. Department of State houses the agreement between the United States and the EU, with a focus on monitoring implementation. The Judicial Redress Act extends privacy provisions to EU citizens, aiming to address concerns about data transfers and government access to personal data. The Privacy Act provides limited rights to U.S. persons and residents in a law enforcement context. Government procurement involves purchasing goods and services for governmental activities, such as equipment, supplies, and infrastructure. The U.S. and EU government procurement market accounts for 15% - 20% of their GDPs. The HLWG final report recommends improving access to government procurement opportunities in the T-TIP agreement. The U.S. and EU are parties to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. The GPA sets legally-binding rules for government procurement, providing limited market access to 28 parties. U.S. participation in the EU procurement market is challenging to gauge due to lack of statistics. An EU directive on utilities procurement discriminates against bids with less than 50% EU content. In T-TIP negotiations, U.S. firms express concerns about transparency and bias in EU government contract awards. U.S. negotiators aim to expand market access and ensure fair rules for government procurement. EU negotiators see an opportunity for bilateral elements that could influence a multilateral GPA revision. EU firms seek more access to U.S. sub-central government entities. The Berry Amendment and Buy American Act restrict government purchases to U.S. businesses for security reasons. Access to government procurement markets at the sub-central level is also a concern in T-TIP negotiations, with a decline in U.S. states opting into government procurement agreements in recent years. The recent U.S. bilateral FTAs with Peru, Panama, and Colombia in 2012 have sparked debates on agricultural issues, particularly in market access and regulatory discussions within the T-TIP negotiations. Transatlantic trade disputes between the U.S. and EU include beef hormones, poultry treatment, BSE regulations, pesticide residues, and GMOs, highlighting regulatory differences between the two entities. The differences between the United States and EU in addressing agricultural issues have led to transatlantic trade disputes. Agriculture, particularly regarding sanitary and phytosanitary measures, is a key topic for debate in the T-TIP negotiations. The U.S. is a major exporter of agricultural products, with the EU being a significant market for U.S. food and farm exports. In recent years, U.S. agricultural exports to the EU have not kept pace with growth in other markets, resulting in a trade deficit for the United States. Major U.S. agricultural exports to the EU include tree nuts, soybeans, forest products, distilled spirits, vegetable oils, wine and beer, planting seeds, tobacco, processed fruit, and wheat. Major EU agricultural exports to the United States include wine, beer, essential oils, snack foods, processed fruits and vegetables, vegetable oils, cheese, cocoa paste/butter, live animals, nursery products, and red meats. The EU's average agricultural tariff is 30%, higher than the US's 12%. The EU has free trade agreements with over 30 countries, giving them preferential access. Removing tariffs under T-TIP could increase US agricultural exports to the EU by $5.5 billion. EU's nontariff measures on US agricultural products also pose challenges. The EU's nontariff measures on U.S. agricultural products include food safety, animal or plant health issues, technical barriers to trade, delays in biotech product reviews, prohibitions on growth hormones in beef production, complex certification requirements, and lack of a science-based focus in establishing SPS measures. These barriers, along with high EU tariffs and extensive regulations, are primary concerns for U.S. businesses, particularly for processed foods. SPS measures are a concern for businesses due to lack of science-based focus, difficulty meeting food safety standards, and inconsistent testing requirements across EU nations. USDA estimates that removing non-tariff barriers under T-TIP could increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by $4.1 billion, with gains in livestock and produce industries. EU exports to the U.S. could rise by $1.2 billion. SPS/TBT measures in agriculture and trade cover various regulations related to health, quality standards, testing, registration, certification, packaging, and labeling. These measures are addressed in multilateral trade agreements and WTO discussions, recognizing governments' rights to enforce such requirements. The WTO agreements on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Technical Barriers to Trade outline rules for applying measures based on scientific evidence to protect human, animal, or plant health. Improper use of these measures can create trade barriers. Differences exist between the US and EU in applying these measures and regulating food safety. The EU's precautionary principle allows for protective action in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence on health and environmental impacts. This has led to trade disputes with the US over SPS and TBT rules, including disputes over meat and poultry production methods like the use of beef hormones. The EU's precautionary principle has led to trade disputes with the US over SPS and TBT rules, including meat and poultry production methods like the use of beef hormones and ractopamine. Some Members of Congress hope that the T-TIP negotiations will resolve long-standing trade disputes regarding SPS rules and nontariff barriers between the two trading blocs. The report recommends negotiating provisions beyond SPS and TBT agreements, proposing \"SPS-Plus\" and \"TBT-Plus\" with goals of improved dialogue, cooperation, transparency, and convergence in regulatory approaches to reduce testing and certification requirements. The U.S. government is proposing strong regulatory provisions in the T-TIP negotiations to improve transparency, regulatory coherence, and cooperation. Efforts are being made to address various policy issues such as pesticides, chemicals, and antibiotic use in animals. The European Parliament voted to ban cloning of farm animals and sale of cloned livestock and products in September 2015, in contrast to the US FDA's stance on the safety of cloned animal products. The US and Brazil raised concerns about the EU's proposal at a WTO meeting in November 2015. Agricultural biotechnology involves genetically modifying plants and animals using recombinant DNA techniques. DNA techniques are used to genetically modify plants and animals for desired traits, such as herbicide tolerance and pest resistance. GE crops, dominant in the US, have rapidly expanded globally, with 28 countries planting GE crops on 448 million acres in 2014. GE varieties play a limited role in the EU, mainly cultivated in Spain and Portugal. GE crops have a limited role in the EU, cultivated in Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Romania, accounting for about 1% of EU crop acreage. Several EU countries have banned GE crop cultivation or have specific rules on GE seed trade. EU officials are cautious about allowing GE products in the market, with strict regulations in place. Some EU farm groups criticize bureaucratic delays in gaining approval for GE seed varieties. Very few GE varieties have been authorized for commercial cultivation in the EU. EU authorities have approved GE crops for commercial cultivation, but U.S. producer groups face limitations due to EU regulations on labeling, traceability, and slow approval processes. A WTO dispute panel found that the EU had a de facto moratorium on GE products from 1999 to 2003. Stakeholders argue that the lengthy approval process (3.5 years in the EU compared to 1.5 years in the U.S.) creates trade barriers, suggesting the need for legally prescribed timelines, transparency, and risk assessment. In January 2015, the European Parliament adopted new measures. In January 2015, the European Parliament adopted new legislation allowing member countries to ban or approve GE crops. As of October 2015, 19 member states have requested restrictions on GE cultivation. Some EU countries are calling for a GE-free agricultural model in Europe. Efforts to ban or restrict EU-approved GE products in Member territories have been rejected by the European Parliament. Geographical indications protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions. Geographical indications (GIs) are used to give certain foods recognition for their distinctiveness in the marketplace. GIs can be commercially valuable and protect consumers from deceptive labels. Examples include Parmesan cheese, Champagne, and Napa Valley wines. The use of GIs has become a contentious international trade issue, especially for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. Geographical indications (GIs) are a contentious international trade issue, particularly for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. GIs are protected intellectual property, with laws differing between the United States and EU. The WTO TRIPS Agreement ensures minimum protection for GIs, with an enhanced level for wines and spirits carrying geographical indications. EU regulations on GIs were established in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, the EU initiated regulations for Geographical Indications (GIs) covering agricultural products, wine, and spirits. Over 3,000 product names are registered and protected in the EU, including foods, wines, and spirits from Member States and other countries. Producers can qualify for a \"protected geographical indication\" (PGI), a \"protected designation of origin\" (PDO), or \"Traditional Specialties Guaranteed\" (TSG) under these regulations. The protection of GIs is a major priority for the EU due to their commercial value. In the United States, GIs are focused on brands and trademarks, protected under the U.S. Trademark law. In the United States, Geographical Indications (GIs) are protected under the U.S. Trademark Act. GIs are indications that identify a good as originating from a specific geographic region and serve as source-identifiers and guarantees of quality. Establishing a product based on its geography can be complex, involving trademarks or brand names. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) does not have a special register for GIs in the United States. Many food manufacturers in the U.S. consider common names as generic terms and may not recognize the EU's protection of GIs. The EU's protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) is seen by the United States as a way to monopolize certain food and wine terms, leading to trade concerns. The U.S. does not protect geographic terms considered generic, impacting trademark protection and market access for U.S. products. For example, \"feta\" is considered generic in the U.S. but protected as a GI in Europe. Feta cheese is protected as a Geographical Indication (GI) in Europe, preventing its export from the United States to the EU. Trade agreements between the EU and other countries may also restrict the use of GIs, impacting U.S. agricultural exporters. The EU, along with Canada and South Africa, may recognize up to 200 EU GIs for milk and dairy products. Similar GI protections are found in other trade agreements, affecting various food products and wine. These protections could limit the future sale of U.S. products bearing such names in these countries. Concerns in the U.S. wine industry regarding traditional and semi-generic names have been partly addressed in the 2006 U.S.-EU Agreement on Trade in Wine, but recent comments by European trade groups have raised new concerns. The U.S. wine industry is concerned about European trade groups wanting to renegotiate trade agreements that could restrict U.S. exports of wines with certain terms. Some Members of Congress are worried about GI protections in trade agreements like T-TIP. U.S. food producers are part of CCFN to protect common food names, while some agricultural industry groups want a similar GI system in the U.S. The American Origin Products Association (AOPA) aims to establish a system to protect American Origin Products (AOPs) from fraud and deceptive labeling, increase their value, and create a national certification system. Regulatory non-tariff barriers pertain to standards, testing, and certification procedures for health, safety, labor, and the environment. TPA objectives include transparency in regulatory development and regulations based on sound science and risk assessment. The regulatory cooperation chapter in the T-TIP negotiations aims to promote transparency, effectiveness, and a pro-competitive environment by addressing potential non-tariff barriers to trade through regulatory coherence and transparency. The EU and American Origin Products Association (AOPA) focus on establishing systems to protect products from fraud, increase their value, and create national certification systems. Regulatory non-tariff barriers involve standards, testing, and certification procedures related to health, safety, labor, and the environment. The HLWG report highlighted the potential economic gains from regulatory cooperation and compatibility between the US and EU, with estimates suggesting a 0.7% GDP gain for the EU and a 0.3% gain for the US if regulatory differences were aligned. The HLWG report emphasized the economic benefits of aligning regulatory differences between the US and EU, estimating a 0.7% GDP gain for the EU and a 0.3% gain for the US. However, stakeholders are skeptical about reaching a comprehensive agreement on regulatory issues in the T-TIP due to long-standing differences in regulatory approaches. Supporters believe breakthroughs are possible in a politically important FTA deal, but challenges remain in negotiating the more difficult issues. Both sides aim to maintain well-regulated market economies that prioritize consumer safety and welfare. Many economists argue that differing EU and U.S. regulatory approaches hinder overall consumer welfare by creating barriers to trade and increasing costs for multinational corporations. Regulatory differences stem from divergent public preferences and values, such as European consumers favoring \"naturally produced\" foods while American consumers are more accepting of GMO foods. The United States and the EU operate different risk assessment systems. In the United States, regulators work cooperatively with industry, engaging in science-based analysis and supporting technological innovation. In contrast, the EU follows a precautionary principle, leading to more stringent risk regulation. Industry representatives propose promoting transparency, stakeholder consultations, reducing unnecessary regulatory differences, and seeking regulatory cooperation mechanisms. The proposed T-TIP language aims for regulatory cooperation in addressing issues such as duplication in procedures, inconsistent product requirements, and double testing. U.S. and EU negotiators, regulators, and industry representatives are actively involved in regulatory cooperation in key sectors like automobiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and more. Discussions on sector-specific matters are progressing at varying speeds. Negotiators are discussing \"horizontal regulatory issues\" to ensure proposed regulations undergo impact assessments with transparency and stakeholder input. Finding ways for regulators to cooperate bilaterally, especially for new products like electric cars and nanotechnology, is a challenge. U.S. officials are concerned about the EU's regulatory standards development strategy, which they see as a \"strategic challenge\" to the United States. EU's approach aims to promote global regulatory standards. The 2007 European Commission strategy paper recommended promoting global regulatory convergence by adopting European standards internationally. The EU uses New Approach Directives to define essential requirements related to health, safety, and environmental issues. EU standards bodies harmonize these standards and promote them internationally through various means, causing concern for U.S. stakeholders who feel excluded from the EU standards-creating processes. U.S. stakeholders are unable to directly participate in EU standards-creating organizations and feel compelled to use EU standards for products in the EU market. The costs and uncertainty of demonstrating alternative standards can be prohibitive for U.S. exporters. The international promotion of EU standards could harm U.S. producers in other markets where the EU has ties. U.S. administering agencies receive considerable public input when proposing regulations and standards, unlike EU standards-creating processes. Federal agencies in the U.S. must adhere to various laws like the APA, FOIA, and the Government in the Sunshine Act to ensure public input, transparency, and due process in the regulatory process. Private sector-driven standards development is also common, with organizations like UL and ANSI allowing interested parties to participate. Transatlantic regulatory cooperation includes information exchanges, MRAs, and harmonization of standards between the U.S. and EU. Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) and regulatory standards harmonization have been actively pursued by U.S. and EU regulators since 1998. Efforts were reinforced through annual summits and participation in international regulatory fora. High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Forums have been established to promote better quality regulations and minimize regulatory burdens. The Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) and other regulatory cooperation groups aim to build effective mechanisms for better quality regulations and minimize divergences. Progress has been made in areas like mutual recognition decisions and collaboration on testing methods. However, more intensive regulator-to-regulator cooperation is needed to remove barriers to transatlantic trade and investment. Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) are crucial for accepting products or services from another jurisdiction under specified conditions. Mutual Recognition Arrangements (MRAs) are essential for cross-jurisdictional acceptance of products/services under specified conditions. MRAs operate on \"tested once\" criteria, where testing in one market is recognized in both markets. Negotiations for MRAs are time-consuming, requiring leadership and guidance. Regulatory cooperation involves harmonizing standards/rules across jurisdictions. U.S. and EU negotiators aim for greater standard compatibility. EU negotiators are focused on aligning standards for new technologies like electric cars and nanotechnology. Progress was made on regulatory compatibility and cooperation in the 11th T-TIP negotiating round. The US and EU have open investment environments, aiming to reduce restrictions on foreign investment and protect investor rights. The US and EU aim to reduce restrictions on foreign investment and protect investor rights in their trade agreements. The EU now has exclusive competence over negotiating investment treaties, as seen in the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) which includes investment rules. The EU and US are working on trade agreements to reduce restrictions on foreign investment and protect investor rights. The EU has exclusive competence in negotiating investment treaties, as shown in the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which includes investment rules such as fair treatment, expropriation, and ISDS. The goal is to achieve the highest levels of liberalization and protection in transatlantic investment negotiations. The current network of bilateral investment treaties governs transatlantic investment flows in the absence of a comprehensive multilateral agreement. The United States and EU are working on trade agreements to reduce restrictions on foreign investment. The US has over 40 BITs worldwide, including nine with EU members and two with EU candidates. There is no BIT between the US and the EU as a whole, but mechanisms exist for investment negotiations. A major debate in T-TIP is the treatment of ISDS and investor protections. The investor community supports ISDS for protecting investments, while some civil society groups are concerned about its impact on government regulations. Other issues include transparency in ISDS proceedings and arbitral rules. The T-TIP negotiations between the US and EU involve debates over ISDS, transparency, arbitral rules, and investor protections. Some question the need for ISDS due to existing strong protections, while others argue for common standards. The European Commission includes ISDS in its mandate, but countries like Germany and France oppose it, citing concerns over sovereignty. High-profile ISDS cases, like Vattenfall's claim against Germany, have sparked public debate. The T-TIP negotiations involve debates over ISDS, transparency, and investor protections. High-profile cases, like Vattenfall's claim against Germany, have sparked public debate. The European Commission proposed a new Investment Court System to replace the current ISDS model. TransCanada also intends to challenge the Keystone XL pipeline decision under NAFTA Chapter 11's ISDS mechanism. The European Commission proposed an Investment Court System to replace the current ISDS model, aiming to address concerns about fairness, impartiality, and transparency. The proposal followed the European Parliament's call to replace ISDS with a new system. U.S. officials are skeptical, preferring ISDS to protect investors. Businesses fear the proposal will erode investor protections, while civil society groups believe it does not resolve their concerns with the current ISDS system. The 12th round of T-TIP negotiations marked the beginning of U.S.-EU discussions on the EU's Investment Court System proposal. The EU-Vietnam free trade agreement and the finalized CETA text include elements of the Investment Court System proposed by the EU. Other investment issues of interest in T-TIP may involve liberalizing additional sectors for investment. Foreign investment in the United States and the EU is not always treated equally, with restrictions in certain sectors for national security reasons. Entry conditions for investors and safeguarding national interests are key considerations in maintaining an open investment environment. Expropriation in investment agreements allows governments to take private property under certain conditions. Direct expropriation involves nationalizing or seizing property, while indirect expropriation occurs through regulatory decisions. Compensation for expropriation is a key issue in debates over investor rights and government regulation in international investment agreements. The United States and EU navigate the balance between investor rights and government regulation in international investment agreements. They aim for free capital transfers but differ on including safeguards for capital controls. The importance of IPR protection and enforcement is emphasized for innovation and economic growth. The United States and EU prioritize intellectual property rights (IPR) in trade agreements due to its significance for innovation, economic growth, and competitiveness. They aim for \"TRIPS-plus\" provisions in their negotiations but face challenges reconciling differences in IPR obligations. Stakeholders debate the necessity of an IPR chapter in T-TIP, expressing concerns about potential controversial issues stalling progress. Debates may arise in T-TIP negotiations regarding the balance between IPR protection and public policy goals. Some argue that IPR commitments in T-TIP are crucial for addressing IPR issues globally. Certain sectors, like pharmaceuticals, see opportunities for enhancing the EU's IPR regime. The U.S. government is concerned about the effectiveness of IPR practices in some EU member states. Geographical indications (GIs) are also a topic of discussion in the negotiations. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, benefiting all producers in that area. The U.S. and EU have committed to minimum standards of GI protection under the WTO TRIPS Agreement. While the U.S. protects GIs through trademark law, the EU offers more specific protections. GIs are a major priority for the EU due to their commercial value. The EU prioritizes the protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) due to their commercial value. However, differences in approach between the EU and the US regarding GIs have raised concerns. The EU offers specific GI protections, including a register for agricultural products, foodstuffs, and wines, while the US protects GIs through trademark law. These differences are reflected in trade policies and may impact positions in the T-TIP agreement. The Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) includes measures related to Geographical Indications (GIs), causing concern for some Members of Congress and U.S. companies about market access in Canada. The proposed TPP aims to address the risk of overly protecting GIs, with provisions on administrative procedures, determining generic terms, opposing or canceling GIs, and safeguards for existing trademarks. TPP also requires transparency and other measures regarding GIs. The TPP requires transparency and measures for Geographical Indications (GIs) recognized by parties. Differences between the US and EU on GIs are seen in multilateral forums like the WTO and WIPO. Debate continues on establishing a multilateral system for GIs in wines and spirits. The US opposed the WIPO Geneva Act in 2015, expanding protection for GIs. There is debate on whether T-TIP will include GIs due to differing US and EU views. The debate continues on whether T-TIP will include Geographical Indications (GIs) due to differing US and EU views. The United States and EU have historically sought strong copyright standards in past FTAs, including additional copyright protection and IPR protections related to the digital environment. The proposed TPP also increases copyright terms to life plus 70 years. The TPP extends copyright terms to life plus 70 years and addresses the liability of ISPs for infringing content. There are differing views on increasing ISP involvement in IPR enforcement, with concerns about undue burdens and low thresholds for terminating Internet access. The treatment of copyright enforcement in TPP may impact T-TIP negotiations. The TPP extends copyright terms to life plus 70 years, addresses ISP liability for infringing content, and includes \"safe harbors\" for ISPs. It also adopts U.S.-style \"notice and takedown\" provisions for ISP liability. The debate on copyright protection includes balancing exclusive rights for copyright holders and limitations for \"fair use.\" The proposed TPP encourages countries to achieve a balance between users and rights holders in copyright systems. Both the U.S. and EU support strong patent protection while respecting the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. The U.S. and EU support strong patent protection, with some differences in approaches. For example, the U.S. offers patent term extensions for regulatory delays and examination process delays, while the EU restricts extensions to a maximum of five years in some FTAs. The EU FTA restricts patent term extensions to a maximum of five years, while the U.S. FTA has no such limits. The TPP includes mandatory patent term extensions. Both the EU and U.S. provide protection for data submitted for marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products. In the TPP, the U.S. sought a 12-year data exclusivity provision for biologic products, but the concluded TPP allows for an eight-year data exclusivity period or at least five years with additional measures. The EU FTA restricts patent term extensions to a maximum of five years, while the U.S. FTA has no such limits. The TPP includes mandatory patent term extensions. Patent linkage is the process tying regulatory approval for generic drugs to the patent status of brand name counterparts. The proposed TPP allows for a maximum 11-year protection period for new drugs, with an 8+2+1 formula for data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity. The United States has negotiated mandatory patent linkage provisions in many of its FTAs. The proposed TPP includes provisions for patent linkage, allowing notice to patent holders when a generic version is submitted for approval. In contrast, the EU Commission allows marketing authorizations without affecting patent protection. Concerns have been raised about pharmaceutical patent protections in FTAs impacting access to medicines in developing countries. In the context of public policy issues, Members of Congress are concerned about balancing innovation incentives through patents with affordable access to medicines. The debate over patents in access to medicines was active in TPP negotiations, but may not be as intense in the transatlantic context between the US and EU. Civil society groups may worry about T-TIP's impact on public health, while the US pharmaceutical industry raises concerns about market access and government. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has concerns about market access and pricing in European countries, including cost-containment measures, price competition with generics, reimbursement delays, and non-transparent policies. These issues raise questions about regulatory interests and policy goals for innovation and access to medicines. Trade secrets are a key topic in IPR discussions and T-TIP negotiations. Trade secrets, defined as valuable information not generally known and protected by reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy, are covered under the TRIPS Agreement. Member states must safeguard undisclosed information against unauthorized use, ensuring it remains confidential and has commercial value. The U.S. and some EU countries protect trade secrets to prevent theft and enhance security. Both the United States and EU are concerned about the increasing instances of trade secret theft internationally, especially due to cybercrime. China is highlighted as a major source of trade secret theft. The use of technology and data localization requirements have contributed to this trend. U.S. and European companies in global value chains are at higher risk, facing significant financial losses and threats to their competitiveness. The Obama Administration's strategy on mitigating the theft of U.S. trade secrets includes seeking new criminal remedy provisions in trade negotiations. The proposed TPP requires parties to establish criminal procedures and penalties for trade secret theft, including through cyber theft. U.S. and EU business groups have called for specific provisions in the T-TIP on trade secrets to set a prototype for international standards. The United States and EU could also address forced technology transfer requirements related to trade secrets in countries like China and India. Trade facilitation involves simplifying import and export procedures to support global supply chains and increase trade. UPS estimates that addressing trade barriers could boost trade volume and create jobs. This is a priority issue for the United States and EU. The United States and EU are prioritizing trade facilitation to create jobs and boost trade volume. They are pursuing this through various agreements and initiatives, including the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and other FTA negotiations like TPP. Efforts are being made to implement electronic systems for faster clearance of merchandise entries and customs controls. US officials are leading international efforts to implement best practices such as \"single window\" data systems. The development of a single window for clearing merchandise entries, transportation carriers, equipment, and workers was mandated by Executive Order 13659. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 requires the implementation of CBP automated programs by December 31, 2016, with a further update due by September 30, 2017. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the EU's treatment of imports. U.S. officials have long-standing concerns about the EU's treatment of imports, citing inconsistencies in customs laws interpretation and administration across member states. Discrepancies are addressed by the EU Customs Code Committee, but resolution success is limited. Legal issues are handled by individual courts in each member state. U.S. officials have raised these concerns through WTO dispute settlement. EU officials mention potential implementation of U.S. laws. The EU and U.S. have concerns about each other's customs laws and implementation. U.S. laws requiring 100% scanning of maritime cargo containers could impact EU exports. Both sides prioritize worker and environmental protections. Some worry that a potential T-TIP agreement could lead to harmful deregulation. The negotiations between the EU and U.S. for the T-TIP agreement may impact consumer protections, worker rights, and environmental regulations. Civil society groups see an opportunity to align labor and environmental protections. The EU and U.S. have different approaches to resolving differences in labor and environmental commitments in trade agreements. The HLWG recommends exploring ways to address these issues, considering work done in previous agreements. Localization barriers to trade can hinder market access. Localization measures protect domestic industries, service providers, and intellectual property at the expense of imports. These barriers include data processing requirements, technology transfers, and local content mandates. The USTR warns that such measures distort trade and hinder foreign investment. Previous trade negotiations have addressed some localization barriers. The proposed TPP prohibits local content requirements and forced data localization, with exceptions in limited circumstances. T-TIP aims to address EU localization barriers to trade. The T-TIP aims to address EU localization barriers to trade, where U.S. firms face restrictions on conducting online business in the EU. Certain EU countries mandate local content requirements, such as storing data on local servers and imposing quotas on foreign films and media content. The future regulation of audiovisual content in the EU is uncertain, and U.S. companies are concerned about potential European demands related to NSA surveillance disclosures. The disclosure of NSA surveillance activity could lead to European demands for restrictions on cross-border data flows and localization barriers. U.S.-EU commitments on localization barriers could help address similar issues with China and other emerging economies. The EU is interested in a T-TIP energy chapter to facilitate access to energy and raw materials in a transparent and sustainable manner, including access to U.S. crude oil and natural gas. The EU prioritizes energy diversification due to tension with Russia. T-TIP rules on energy could be a model for future negotiations. The US is undecided on specific provisions for energy and raw materials. Congress debates expedited processing for LNG exports and lifting restrictions on crude oil exports. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act lifts the restriction on U.S. crude oil exports, potentially impacting T-TIP negotiations. Concerns arise over anti-competitive behavior related to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and discriminatory treatment in the global economy. The United States and EU are concerned about anti-competitive behavior by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in foreign countries, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil, China, India, and Russia. They aim to address the challenges posed by state influence on commercial enterprises through shared investment principles and coordination of approaches. The U.S. has used FTAs to tackle the unfair competitive advantage of SOEs. Several U.S. FTAs address national treatment, nondiscrimination, and transparency provisions for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with the TPP having more comprehensive disciplines. The 2012 U.S. Model Bilateral Investment Treaty clarifies investment obligations for SOEs. In T-TIP negotiations, the debate on SOEs provisions may consider their wider applicability to third countries. SMEs play a significant role in U.S. international trade, especially as suppliers in supply chains for traded products, with the EU being a key trading partner for U.S. SMEs. The EU is a crucial trading partner for U.S. SMEs, accounting for a significant portion of U.S. exports and imports. SMEs face challenges in accessing information about foreign markets, connecting with buyers, and securing export financing. Barriers to the EU market include standards-related measures, trade secrets, patenting costs, logistical challenges, and industry-specific barriers. Efforts are being made to increase participation of U.S. and EU small businesses in the transatlantic market through regulatory cooperation. Efforts are being made to enhance SMEs' ability to access trading opportunities in the transatlantic market by reducing regulatory barriers, improving trade financing, and addressing IPR issues. The U.S. and EU trade agreements aim to include provisions for resolving government-to-government disputes related to their commitments. The T-TIP final agreement is expected to include government-to-government mechanisms for dispute resolution. The T-TIP agreement is expected to include government-to-government dispute settlement provisions separate from investor-state mechanisms. The goal is to establish fair and effective procedures for settling disputes related to trade and investment with the EU. Specific questions may arise regarding the scope and form of dispute settlement, including regulatory and SPS issues. Options for resolution of disputes and binding commitments are also being considered. The T-TIP negotiations involve resolving disputes through binding or consultative mechanisms. The ability to reach a comprehensive and high standard agreement depends on various factors, including offensive and defensive interests, import-sensitive sectors, and issues both sides prefer not to address. The T-TIP negotiations' progress depends on political momentum and public support. Stakeholders are concerned about the slow pace of negotiations, but the 2015 grant of TPA and conclusion of TPP inject new momentum. U.S. policymakers' focus on T-TIP may temporarily lessen as Congress considers TPP. Members of Congress are interested in T-TIP's implications for the economy. The economic challenges in the U.S. and EU are incentives for the T-TIP negotiation, seen as a low-cost economic stimulus for supporting exports, employment, and growth. The T-TIP is seen as a low-cost economic stimulus for supporting U.S. exports, employment, and economic growth. There is debate on how the economic effects may be borne by stakeholders, with benefits being diffuse and costs concentrated. Estimating the effects of T-TIP is challenging due to complexities in economic analyses and a lack of data. The T-TIP negotiations raise questions about U.S. trade policy, including how it may address U.S. trade negotiating objectives. A potential T-TIP agreement could receive expedited legislative consideration under Trade Promotion Authority if certain conditions are met. Congress is likely interested in how T-TIP may impact U.S. trade negotiations. T-TIP's potential impact on U.S. trade negotiating objectives, relationship to other trade agreements, and influence on the multilateral trading system are key areas of interest for Congress. Analysts debate how T-TIP could affect global trade dynamics and rules. T-TIP's potential impact on global trade dynamics and rules is a key area of interest for Congress. Analysts debate how T-TIP may affect multilateral trade liberalization efforts and the legitimacy of the WTO. The U.S. government has not publicly released any proposed texts in the T-TIP negotiations, raising questions about the balance between confidentiality and transparency. The U.S. government has not publicly released any proposed texts in the T-TIP negotiations. The Administration uses existing FTAs as a starting point for negotiations, such as KORUS and TPP. The USTR believes confidentiality is necessary for effective communication among negotiators, but also engages in congressional consultation and public engagement. Some observers express distrust of T-TIP negotiations due to lack of transparency. Some stakeholders distrust T-TIP negotiations due to lack of transparency in general statements. The European Commission's initiative to publish initial EU proposals for T-TIP has sparked debate on transparency. Calls for increased transparency persist, including the publication of negotiating texts. Congress may debate expanding T-TIP to include other countries, but the U.S. position is that adding partners could complicate negotiations. Countries may pursue T-TIP membership for various reasons, such as gaining access to the US and EU markets, reducing competitive pressures, implementing market-oriented reforms, and enhancing leverage in trade negotiations. Turkey, an official EU membership candidate, has shown interest in joining T-TIP discussions. Turkey is considering negotiating its own FTAs with countries like the United States to gain market access. Mexico and Canada have also expressed interest in joining T-TIP negotiations, potentially expanding the agreement. Congress may assess the strategic implications of T-TIP for the transatlantic relationship. Many in Congress support close U.S.-European ties, viewing cooperation with the EU as advancing U.S. interests. Despite concerns, the U.S. and EU collaborate on various foreign policy, security, and economic issues. The T-TIP negotiations could enhance the world's largest trading relationship, but setbacks may question the strength of the transatlantic relationship. The T-TIP negotiations may intensify sensitive issues and have economic and strategic implications. Congressional oversight could be influenced by the broader U.S. trade agenda, including consideration of TPP legislation and other international trade agreements."
