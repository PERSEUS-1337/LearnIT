Congress finds that the exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land under this Act furthers public objectives as outlined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. This includes the approval of the Blackrock Land Exchange between the United States and the J.R. Simplot Company in Idaho, following a thorough review process under the National Environmental Policy Act. The 718.56 acres of Federal land in Idaho proposed for conveyance to J.R. Simplot Company are managed by the Bureau of Land Management and align with the multiple-use mission and Pocatello Resource Management Plan. Additionally, 666.92 acres of non-Federal land owned by J.R. Simplot Company are proposed for conveyance to the United States, offering greater resources and values. The Federal land in Idaho proposed for conveyance to J.R. Simplot Company offers greater resources and values to the United States, including consolidating Federal land, gaining direct access to adjacent Federal land, and acquiring critical deer habitat. The land exchange would provide a buffer and expansion area for a possible phosphate disposal facility. The land exchange under this Act would not authorize any future phosphate disposal facility. The Bureau of Land Management determined a net loss of 52 acres of public land after consulting with the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. The Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed the Bureau of Land Management's decision. The Federal District Court found the Bureau of Land Management violated the National Environmental Policy Act. The Bureau of Land Management and the J.R. Simplot Company disagreed on the level of environmental analysis needed for the proposed land exchange authorized under the Act, leading to the possibility of ongoing federal analysis and litigation. The Act authorizes a land exchange involving Federal and non-Federal land to resolve conflicts and is deemed to be in the public interest. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Federal land\" refers to two parcels within the Pocatello Field Office totaling approximately 718.56 acres. \"Final decision record\" is the Bureau of Land Management's approval of the Blackrock Land Exchange on December 21, 2007. \"J.R. Simplot\" is the J.R. Simplot Company based in Boise, Idaho. \"Non-federal land\" is land not owned by the government. The term \"non-Federal land\" refers to 3 parcels owned by J.R. Simplot in Boise, Idaho, totaling approximately 666.92 acres. The term \"Order\" refers to a decision by the Interior Board of Land Appeals issued on June 5, 2009. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and \"State\" refers to the State of Idaho. The text chunk discusses the exchange of federal land and non-federal land. The Act requires J.R. Simplot to offer non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land within 90 days of enactment. The conveyance of non-Federal land must be by general warranty deed and conform to title approval standards. The Federal land to be conveyed under this Act will be quitclaimed by the Secretary to J.R. Simplot through an exchange deed. The Secretary will finalize maps and legal descriptions of the land to be conveyed, which will be available for public inspection. J.R. Simplot is responsible for covering all costs related to the land exchange, including survey, title, and deed preparation expenses. SEC. 4. VALUATION OF FEDERAL LAND AND NON-FEDERAL LAND. Congress finds that appraisals for the Federal land and non-Federal land have been completed and approved by the Secretary. The appraisals determined that the Federal land is valued higher than the non-Federal land by $5,000. J.R. Simplot would make a $5,000 cash payment to the Secretary to equalize the values of the land. The appraised values of Federal and non-Federal land approved by the Secretary in the Final Decision Record will be used for the land exchange under this Act, with no reappraisal required. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land under this Act is not considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act. Judicial or administrative review is not applicable, and the exchange does not affect the Order."
