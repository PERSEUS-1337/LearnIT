    "content": "The \"Conservation Investment Act of 2001\" increases the maximum number of acres allowed in the Conservation Reserve Program to 40,000,000 by 2011. It also establishes the Grassland Reserve Program under the Food Security Act of 1985. The Secretary will establish a grassland reserve program to assist owners in restoring and conserving eligible land. The program will enroll a maximum of 3,000,000 acres, with 1,500,000 acres for restored grassland and 1,500,000 acres for virgin grassland. Owners can enroll in the program with 100 contiguous acres west of the 90th meridian or 50 contiguous acres east of the 90th meridian through easements lasting 10, 15, or 20 years. The grassland reserve program allows enrollment of eligible land for easements lasting 10, 15, or 20 years. Eligible land includes natural grass or shrubland with potential ecological value for animal or plant populations. \"SEC. 1238A. EASEMENTS AND AGREEMENTS.\" To enroll land in the program, the landowner must grant an easement to the Secretary, create a deed restriction, provide consent from interested parties, show clear title to the land, comply with easement terms, retire cropland base, and allotment history. The landowner must grant an easement to the Secretary for the land under the program, allowing common grazing practices and haying, subject to certain restrictions. The Secretary can suspend or terminate the easement during war, extreme drought, or famine, with adjustments to payments. The easement granted to the Secretary allows common grazing practices and haying, with restrictions on activities that disturb the land surface, such as plowing and disking. The Secretary establishes criteria for ranking easement applications, emphasizing support for native grass, grazing operations, and biodiversity. Restoration agreements for grassland under the program are prescribed, outlining duties of the landowner and the Secretary. The Secretary may require landowners to refund payments received under easement agreements if violations occur, with periodic inspections conducted to ensure compliance. The Secretary must provide landowners with notice of inspections and cannot prevent them or their representatives from being present during inspections. \"SEC. 1238B. Duties of Secretary include providing notice of inspections to landowners and allowing them or their representatives to be present.\" In exchange for granting an easement, the Secretary will provide easement payments, Federal share of restoration payments, and technical assistance to the landowner. Easement payments are based on the grazing value of the land, and restoration payments cover up to 90% of costs for virgin grassland and 75% for restored grassland. The Secretary provides technical assistance to owners for executing easement documents and restoring grassland. The Commodity Credit Corporation reimburses the Secretary for up to 10% of acquisition costs and restoration payments. If an entitled owner is unable to receive payment, the Secretary will make the payment to the successor according to regulations. Easement payments under this subchapter are additional to other federal payments received by the owner, without affecting eligibility for other payments. SEC. 1238C. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary may allow private organizations or State agencies to hold and enforce easements for grassland conservation if certain conditions are met. Organizations must apply to the Secretary for approval under this subchapter. Private organizations or State agencies may hold and enforce easements for grassland conservation if approved by the Secretary. If an organization holding an easement terminates, the landowner must reassign the easement to another eligible organization or the Secretary. The Secretary must issue necessary regulations within 180 days of enactment. Funding for this subchapter is addressed in Section 1241(a)(2) of the Act. Funding for grassland conservation under the Act is amended to include subchapters C and D. Increase in maximum acres for Wetlands Reserve Program.
