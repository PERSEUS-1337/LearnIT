    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Juvenile Justice Accountability and Improvement Act of 2007\". Congress recognizes the differences between adult and youth offenders, as highlighted in the Supreme Court decision of Roper v. Simmons. Despite this, many youth are being sentenced to life without parole, a growing national concern. Only a few youth worldwide are serving such sentences. Research indicates that there are over 2,225 youth offenders serving life without parole in the United States, with the majority being first-time offenders. Sixteen percent of them were fifteen or younger when they committed their crimes. Denying these individuals the chance for parole is seen as cruel and counterproductive, sending a negative message to youth about rehabilitation and the effectiveness of penal institutions. Establishing a meaningful opportunity for parole for child offenders is crucial, as denying them this chance is viewed as cruel and counterproductive. Each State must have laws allowing child offenders under a life sentence to have a chance for parole, at least once every 3 years after the first 15 years of incarceration. The Attorney General will issue guidelines for implementation. A child offender under a life sentence is someone convicted of a crime committed before turning 18. Individuals who are 18 years or older and sentenced to life imprisonment or its equivalent will be affected by this section. States have up to 3 years to comply, with a possible 2-year extension for good faith efforts. Noncompliance will result in consequences after the specified period. States failing to comply with this section will lose 10 percent of allocated funds under certain programs. Funds not allocated due to noncompliance will be redistributed to compliant states. The Attorney General will establish a system for early release of child offenders serving life sentences in Federal facilities. Additionally, a grant program will be implemented to improve legal representation for children facing life in prison. The Attorney General will award grants to States to improve legal representation for child defendants facing potential life sentences. Funds will be used to provide legal counsel, investigative, expert, and other necessary services for individuals charged with offenses before turning 18 that could lead to life imprisonment. Additionally, grants will support individuals convicted of such offenses seeking appellate or collateral relief. Authorization of Appropriations: Such sums as necessary are authorized for carrying out this section, including review in the Supreme Court of the United States."
