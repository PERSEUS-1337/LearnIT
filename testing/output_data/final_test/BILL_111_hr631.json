    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Water Use Efficiency and Conservation Research Act\". It includes findings related to water use efficiency and conservation. Between 1950 and 2000, the US population increased by 90%, while water demand rose by 209%. Americans now use 100 gallons of water per person daily, straining water supplies and distribution systems. 36 states anticipate water shortages by 2013, worsened by climate change effects. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a decline in water availability due to melting glaciers and snow cover. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a decline in water availability due to melting glaciers and snow cover, affecting one-sixth of the world's population. Water conservation is essential, and the Environmental Protection Agency should support technologies for greater water efficiency through programs like WaterSense. The EPA estimates that widespread use of water-efficient appliances in US households could save billions of gallons of water and billions of dollars annually. The WaterSense program, with its network of partners, helps disseminate research on technologies for greater water efficiency. The WaterSense program, with its network of partners, disseminates research on technologies for greater water efficiency. The Assistant Administrator for Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a program promoting water efficiency and conservation, focusing on technologies for rainwater, stormwater, and greywater collection, storage, and reuse, water distribution systems, barriers to efficiency, and watershed planning for quality and supply. Research needs identified by water resource managers will be considered in program planning and implementation. The Assistant Administrator for Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a program promoting water efficiency and conservation, focusing on technologies for rainwater, stormwater, and greywater collection, storage, and reuse, water distribution systems, barriers to efficiency, and watershed planning for quality and supply. The program will address research needs identified by water resource managers and encourage participation by Minority Serving Institutions through extramural grants to institutions of higher education. SEC. 4. STRATEGIC RESEARCH PLAN. The Assistant Administrator is responsible for coordinating the development of a strategic research plan for water use efficiency and conservation. The plan outlines research goals and priorities, including developing innovative water supply processes and technologies, improving existing processes like wastewater treatment and desalinization, and identifying current Federal research efforts on water. The strategic research plan for water use efficiency and conservation includes goals such as improving water supply processes, coordinating efforts with established programs, utilizing recommendations from various entities, and undergoing Science Advisory Board review for revisions based on scientific findings and national research priorities. SEC. 5. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. The Assistant Administrator will facilitate the adoption of technology and processes to promote water efficiency and conservation, as well as collect and disseminate information on best practices and anticipated increases in efficiency. SEC. 6. ADVANCED WATER EFFICIENCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. SEC. 6. ADVANCED WATER EFFICIENCY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. The Assistant Administrator will fund 4 projects to incorporate the latest water efficiency technologies in buildings, with at least 1 for residential and 1 for commercial buildings. Designs of funded buildings will be made public for tours and educational purposes. SEC. 7. REPORT. The Assistant Administrator will provide Congress with a report every 2 years on the progress of EPA's water efficiency and conservation research, development projects, outreach activities, and plan implementation. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will conduct a study with the National Academy of Sciences on low impact and soft path strategies for water supply management. The study will compare research and technology in the US and other countries, evaluate water system approaches, and identify research needs. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will conduct a study on low impact and soft path strategies for water supply management. A report will be submitted to Congress evaluating challenges, opportunities, and recommending innovative solutions for water managers, planners, developers, scientists, engineers, and regulators. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will conduct a study on low impact and soft path strategies for water supply management, including decentralized micro-scale controls and increased efficiency of water use. $1,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010. Authorization of appropriations for the Assistant Administrator under this Act is set at $20,000,000 annually from 2010 to 2014."
