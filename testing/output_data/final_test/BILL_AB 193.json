    "title": "AB 193",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5350.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. Reasonable attempts must be made to notify family members or designated individuals of the conservatorship hearing. The person in question can request that family members not be informed if the proposed conservator is not a family member. The request will be honored by the mental health program. The proposed conservatee cannot request that the proposed conservator be kept unaware of the hearing details. Section 5352 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows for conservatorship recommendation by professionals for gravely disabled individuals with mental disorders or chronic alcoholism who refuse or cannot accept voluntary treatment. Conservatorship can be recommended even if the person is not an inpatient at the facility under certain conditions. The professional person or their designee must examine and evaluate the individual to determine if they are gravely disabled, and future inpatient examination is not necessary for this determination. If a conservatorship has been established under the Probate Code, the court may order an investigation to determine if the conservatee is gravely disabled due to a mental disorder or chronic alcoholism and unwilling or unable to accept treatment voluntarily. An evidentiary hearing with the conservatee and their counsel is required for this determination. If the conservatee cannot afford counsel, the court will appoint counsel for them in a proceeding under the Probate Code. The officer conducting a conservatorship investigation must submit a report to the court. If they agree with the recommendation for conservatorship, they will petition the court to establish it. Temporary conservatorship may be requested if needed. The officer conducting a conservatorship investigation must submit a comprehensive report to the court, including medical, psychological, financial, family, vocational, and social aspects of the person's condition. Relevant information from family, friends, social workers, and therapists should also be included. The conservator in a Probate Code proceeding must disclose records or information to aid the investigation. If the officer recommends against conservatorship, alternatives must be outlined. The report is sent to the court, the recommended conservator, and the individual proposed for conservatorship. The court can consider the report in its judgment. When a court orders a mental evaluation in a criminal case leading to a conservatorship investigation, the officer must provide a copy of the report to the defendant or their counsel. The report can also be submitted to the court, district attorney, and probation department upon request. The information in the report is confidential and cannot be disclosed without the defendant's consent. After the criminal case is resolved, all copies of the report are sealed. After the criminal case is resolved, the court seals all copies of the mental evaluation report. The defendant and their counsel may retain a copy of the mental evaluation report. If the defendant is placed on probation, the county probation department can keep a copy for supervision until probation ends. The officer conducting a conservatorship investigation will recommend whether a disability should be imposed based on professional or medical determinations. The officer conducting conservatorship investigation may recommend additional powers of a conservator if necessary. Consultation with professionals is required for making this determination. Reimbursement for mandated costs by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts."
