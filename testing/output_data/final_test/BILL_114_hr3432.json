The \"Investing in Student Success Act of 2015\" includes provisions on tax treatment and exclusion of businesses making income-share agreements from investment company treatment. SEC. 101 of the \"Investing in Student Success Act of 2015\" defines an income-share agreement as an agreement where an individual agrees to pay a percentage of their future income for a specified period in exchange for funds for postsecondary education costs. SEC. 102 addresses the tax treatment of proceeds and payments from future income. Payments made under an income-share agreement that complies with section 103 are not included in gross income. Payments of future income received by another person under such an agreement are treated according to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Payments under an income-share agreement are treated as a repayment of investment reducing the holder's basis, and then as income included in gross income. SEC. 103. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INCOME-SHARE AGREEMENT CONTRACTS. An income-share agreement must specify the percentage of future income to be paid, with exceptions for income below $18,000. It should also define the income used for payment calculations. The income-share agreement sets limits on the individual's payment obligations. The annual limitation states that the percentage of income paid cannot exceed an amount that exceeds the total payments on a comparable loan. Additionally, the aggregate limitation prohibits the agreement from requiring the individual to pay an excessive amount of future income. The income-share agreement limits the individual's payment obligations based on future income, ensuring that the total payments do not exceed a certain percentage of income. Additionally, there is a restriction on the commitment factor to prevent excessive future income payments. The commitment factor in an income-share agreement is the product of the percentage of future income required to be paid and the remaining years of the agreement. The maximum commitment factor is capped at 2.25 times the number of years in the longest allowable contract. The income-share agreement specifies a maximum period of 360 months for payment, with a possible extension equal to the years of low income. Early termination is also allowed. The income-share agreement allows for early termination of obligations before the end of the payment period specified, with adjustments for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index. Required disclosures must be provided for the agreement to comply with the section's requirements. Before entering into an income-share agreement, individuals must be provided with a written document disclosing that the agreement is not a debt instrument, the payment amount may vary, and obligations are not dischargeable under bankruptcy law except in cases of undue hardship. The individual entering into an income-share agreement must consider factors such as the duration of obligations, percentage of income committed, minimum income triggering payments, definition of income for calculation, and potential acceleration of payments. (A) the required payments under the income-share agreement based on different income levels determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, and (B) the payments under a comparable loan with a fixed 10% annual interest rate. An income-share agreement obligates the individual to pay a percentage of future income without granting rights over their actions to the contract holder. A \"comparable loan\" for an income-share agreement must have the same principal amount, term to maturity, and be fully amortized with monthly payments of principal and interest. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue regulations to implement the title, including model disclosure forms for required disclosures. Using the model form with accurate information satisfies disclosure requirements. TITLE II--TREATMENT OF INCOME-SHARE AGREEMENTS UNDER STATE LAW\n\nSEC. 201.
