    "content": "Liability of business entities providing use of facilities to nonprofit organizations. Definitions for terms used in the section include:\n- Business entity: firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, joint venture, or enterprise.\n- Facility: real property like buildings or improvements.\n- Gross negligence: voluntary conduct likely to harm another's health.\n- Intentional misconduct: conduct knowingly harmful to another's health.\n- Nonprofit organization: an organization that is not for profit. In the curr_chunk, the term \"nonprofit organization\" is defined as an organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or one organized for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. The term \"State\" includes various territories and political subdivisions. A business entity is not liable for injuries or deaths at its facility during use by a nonprofit organization if the use is outside the business scope, the incident occurs while the facility is being used by the nonprofit, and the business entity authorized the use. This limitation applies to civil liability under Federal and State law. (c) Exception for Liability.--Subsection (b) does not apply to injuries or deaths resulting from gross negligence or intentional misconduct by a business entity, including crimes of violence, acts of terrorism, hate crimes, or sexual offenses for which the defendant has been convicted. The Act preempts state laws inconsistent with it, except for those providing additional liability protection. It does not supersede federal or state health and safety laws. States can choose not to apply the Act. The Act allows states to opt out of its application for civil actions in state courts involving only state citizens by enacting a statute with specific requirements."
