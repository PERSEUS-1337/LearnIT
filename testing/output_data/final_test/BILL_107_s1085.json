    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Olympic Sports Revitalization Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act requires the USOC to ensure competent representation at the Olympic Games. Participation in athletics at US colleges has been a traditional route to the Olympics, but fewer participants are now coming from these institutions in certain sports. Between 1981 and 1999, colleges and universities discontinued teams in various Olympic sports, resulting in a net loss of teams nationwide. The largest percentage losses were in women's gymnastics (53%) and men's wrestling (40%). Despite an increase in the number of women participating in college athletics during this period, the number of men participating in 1999 was still significantly lower. In 1999, colleges and universities saw a decline in teams for Olympic sports due to student disinterest and administrative decisions. Emerging Sports for Women like team handball, synchronized swimming, and equestrian require more support to meet basic requirements. The discontinuation of Olympic sports teams by colleges and universities, which do not generate revenue, hinders athletes' amateur careers and challenges the USOC's mission. The Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act outlines additional objectives for the USOC. The Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act aims to support amateur athletic programs for athletes, especially women and minorities, to increase their participation in sports. However, a lack of public data on college athletic opportunities hinders prospective student-athletes from making informed decisions. The purpose of the Act is to promote amateur athletics and encourage amateur careers in athletics, aiming to support athletes, especially women and minorities, in participating in sports. Colleges and universities often discontinue sports teams without notice or opportunity for appeal, disrupting amateur careers. SEC. 3. Grants for support of certain amateur athletics under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act. Grants may be provided by the Secretary of Commerce to support amateur athletics, specifically encouraging participation in Olympic sports by individuals under 18 years old, with a focus on those who have had limited opportunities for involvement. The funds can be used directly or granted to national governing bodies of Olympic sports. The text chunk outlines the covered Olympic sports for participation, including women's gymnastics, fencing, field hockey, archery, badminton, team handball, synchronized swimming, and equestrian, as well as men's wrestling, tennis, gymnastics, rifle/shooting, fencing, outdoor track, swimming, skiing, ice hockey, and water polo. The text outlines authorization of appropriations for Olympic sports, including men's ice hockey, water polo, archery, and other sports determined by the Secretary of Education. Authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 is specified. The text outlines authorization of appropriations for Olympic sports, including men's ice hockey, water polo, archery, and other sports determined by the Secretary of Education. Authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 is specified. Amendments include inserting \"of Quadrennial Report\" after \"Submission\", changing \"transmit\" to \"submit\", submitting an Annual Report to the President and Congress by January 31 each year, and making conforming and clerical amendments to section headings. Section 220511 of the title is amended to read as \"Reports\". The table of sections in that chapter is updated by adding a new item for section 220511. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF OLYMPIC SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. Title XV of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 is amended to include a new part F for Olympic Sports Revitalization. This includes a section on Olympic Sports Revitalization. The Secretary of Education may provide funds to the United States Olympic Committee for distribution to institutions of higher education for students participating in intercollegiate athletic programs in Olympic sports. The Secretary of Education may provide funds to the United States Olympic Committee for distribution to institutions of higher education for students participating in intercollegiate athletic programs in Olympic sports. The distribution to the institutions must be for students in a specific intercollegiate athletic program, with a minimum of $100,000 and a maximum of $200,000 allocated equally over four years. The distribution of funds to institutions of higher education for intercollegiate athletic programs is limited to three programs at a time. If a program is canceled, no further distribution is allowed. Disbursements are made over four years with a minimum of $100,000 and a maximum of $200,000 per program. The distribution of funds for intercollegiate athletic programs must be disbursed among full-time students participating in the program, with a limit on the amount based on educational expenses. Olympic sports eligible for distribution include women's gymnastics, fencing, field hockey, and archery. The Secretary determines Olympic women's and men's sports eligible for fund distribution, including field hockey, archery, badminton, team handball, synchronized swimming, equestrian, wrestling, tennis, gymnastics, rifle/shooting, fencing, outdoor track, swimming, skiing, ice hockey, water polo, and other sports deemed eligible. The text chunk discusses the eligibility criteria for institutions of higher education to receive funding for discontinued college sports teams or emerging sports. The application process involves submitting necessary information to the US Olympic Committee or the national governing body of the sport. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 for this purpose. SEC. 5. REPORTING OF EQUITY IN ATHLETIC DISCLOSURE ACT DATA. This section amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to ensure that reports on athletic equity are disseminated to the public in an easily understandable manner, including on the Internet. Reports will now include information on 5-year trends in the data reported. $1,250,000 is authorized for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to carry out these reporting requirements. SEC. 6. TEAM TERMINATION NOTIFICATION AND APPEAL REQUIREMENT. An institution of higher education receiving assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 cannot terminate funding for any intercollegiate sport without providing a written justification to the team members and an internal appeal process."
