    "content": "Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (truncated BPTT) is a method for learning recurrent computational graphs that keeps the benefits of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) while avoiding the need for a complete backtrack through the data sequence. However, it favors short-term dependencies and has biased gradient estimates. Anticipated Reweighted Truncated Backpropagation (ARTBP) is introduced to address this issue by using variable truncation lengths and compensation factors for unbiasedness. ARTBP outperforms truncated BPTT on two tasks: a synthetic task requiring careful balancing of temporal dependencies, where ARTBP reliably converges while truncated BPTT shows unreliable performance and divergence; and on Penn Treebank character-level language modeling, where ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the standard for training recurrent neural networks but has limitations with learning from long sequences due to heavy computational load. Truncated BPTT overcomes this by splitting sequences, but loses long term dependencies. Anticipated Reweighted Truncated BackPropagation (ARTBP) is introduced to provide unbiased gradient estimates while accounting for long term dependencies. ARTBP outperforms truncated BPTT on tasks requiring balancing of temporal dependencies and character-level language modeling. ARTBP splits the training sequence into variable size subsequences and modifies the backpropagation equation for unbiased gradients, ensuring reliable convergence in stochastic gradient descent. Compared to truncated BPTT, ARTBP outperforms in cases where balancing temporal dependencies is crucial and slightly outperforms on small-scale real-world data. ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT on test cases by providing unbiased overall gradient estimates through short subsequences for quick adaptation to data while maintaining balance. Truncated BPTT faces limitations with long training sequences due to storage and computational issues, slowing down learning. Truncated BPTT solves BPTT deficiencies by chopping the initial sequence into evenly sized subsequences, but biases gradients and struggles with learning dependencies above the range of truncation. NoBackTrack and UORO provide unbiased online recurrent learning algorithms by requiring memorylessness and streaming structure, injecting noise into gradient estimates. ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT by providing unbiased overall gradient estimates through short subsequences for quick adaptation to data. ARTBP's approach to unbiased recurrent learning is distinct from Truncated BPTT, as it compensates for truncations directly in backpropagation equations without injecting artificial noise. The goal of recurrent learning algorithms is to optimize a parametric dynamical system to minimize total loss with respect to target outputs at each time step. In a standard RNN, the dynamical system involves state, inputs, parameters, and transition functions to generate output predictions. The focus is on efficiently computing \u2202L T /\u2202\u03b8 in a simple RNN through backpropagation through time (BPTT). BPTT unfolds the dynamical system through time and computes the gradient by backpropagating through it. However, BPTT requires processing the full sequence both forward and backward. Truncated BPTT is a method to alleviate the impracticality of processing very long sequences with large networks in backpropagation through time (BPTT). It involves truncating gradient flows after a fixed number of timesteps or splitting the input sequence into subsequences of fixed length to only backpropagate through those subsequences. This allows for online application and speeds up learning by dropping the recurrent term every L time steps. Truncated BPTT is a heuristic gradient estimation scheme that can lead to biased gradient estimates, even with large truncations. Undesired behavior and divergence can occur during gradient descent. ARTBP, unlike truncated BPTT, splits the sequence into uneven subsequences with lengths sampled from a specific distribution. A reweighting factor is introduced in the backpropagation equation to ensure unbiasedness. Simply sampling arbitrarily long truncation lengths does not guarantee unbiasedness. ARTBP introduces random truncations to balance gradient flows, rescaling them by their inverse probability to restore unbiasedness. At each training epoch, a random sequence of truncation points is sampled, determining where truncations occur. This approach aims to address the bias in gradient estimates seen in truncated BPTT. ARTBP introduces random truncations to balance gradient flows by reweighting factors in the backpropagation equation. Unbiasedness is achieved by modifying the backpropagation equation inside each subsequence at every time step. The choice of truncation probabilities affects the variance of gradient estimates. Unbiasedness holds for any choice of truncation probabilities, but different choices lead to different variances. ARTBP introduces random truncations to balance gradient flows by reweighting factors in the backpropagation equation. The gradient estimate obtained through ARTBP is unbiased, but introduces noise due to stochastic truncation points. This trade-off allows for a reduction in memory consumption by using larger truncation lengths, while increasing variance. ARTBP introduces random truncations to balance gradient flows by reweighting factors in the backpropagation equation. The probability of truncating at time t, denoted as ct, affects the average truncation lengths. Lower values of ct result in longer subsequences and gradients closer to the exact value, while higher values lead to shorter subsequences but larger compensation factors and noisier estimates. To mitigate exponential growth, ct should be set such that the probability of a subsequence of length L decreases like L^-\u03b1. The probability of truncating at time t, denoted as ct, affects the average truncation lengths. The variance of the lengths of the subsequences will be finite if \u03b1 > 3. The formula for ct is chosen to control the average truncation length and the regularity of the distribution of truncation lengths. The parameter \u03b1 controls the regularity of the distribution of truncation lengths. With larger \u03b1, large lengths will be less frequent. The value of \u03b4\u02dc t in backpropagation grows polynomially inside each subsequence of length L. If the system has geometrically decaying memory, \u03b4\u02dc t will stay controlled. ARTBP can be applied online for unbiased gradient estimates in recurrent networks without needing all truncation points drawn in advance. The experimental setup aims to illustrate the properties of ARTBP compared to truncated BPTT and test ARTBP on real-world data. An influence balancing experiment shows the importance of being unbiased in a simple model with agents receiving signals and diffusing their state. The training goal is to control the state of the leftmost agent. The training goal is to control the state of the leftmost agent by optimizing the quantity of drug used daily in a model where agents contribute positively or negatively with delays. The model is formalized as BID11 s t+1 = A s t + (\u03b8, . . . , \u03b8, \u2212\u03b8, . . . , \u2212\u03b8) with specific matrix values and a scalar parameter \u03b8. The loss considered is an arbitrary target on the leftmost agent s 1. The dynamics of the model involve controlling the state of the leftmost agent using a specific matrix and scalar parameter. Fixed-truncation BPTT is compared with ARTBP in an online setting, with experiments using different truncation lengths. Truncated BPTT is deterministic in this experiment, while ARTBP uses specific probabilities for truncation length and a parameter. In comparing Fixed-truncation BPTT with ARTBP, ARTBP is tested with probabilities using specific parameters and truncation lengths. ARTBP is stochastic and reliably converges, while Truncated BPTT diverges due to bias in estimating gradients. However, for a deterministic problem with a large truncation length, Truncated BPTT eventually converges faster than ARTBP. The comparison between ARTBP and truncated BPTT shows that ARTBP is stochastic and does not converge faster than O(t \u22121/2), while truncated BPTT converges geometrically like O(e \u2212\u03bbt) for deterministic problems. The study involves training an LSTM model with a softmax classifier on the character-level Penn Treebank dataset using both ARTBP and truncated BPTT. The study compares ARTBP and truncated BPTT in training an LSTM model on the Penn Treebank dataset. ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT in validation and test error, while truncated BPTT performs better in training error. The results are displayed in FIG5. In comparing ARTBP and truncated BPTT on an LSTM model trained on the Penn Treebank dataset, ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT in validation and test error. However, truncated BPTT performs better in training error. Reported test errors range from 1.38 bpc BID0 to 1.26 bpc Graves (2013). The bias introduced by truncation in backpropagation through time can be compensated by randomizing truncation points and introducing compensation factors in the backpropagation equation. The algorithm compensates for bias introduced by truncation in backpropagation through time by randomizing truncation points and introducing compensation factors. It provides proper balancing of effects of different time scales when training recurrent models.
