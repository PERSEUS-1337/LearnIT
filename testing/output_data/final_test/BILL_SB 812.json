Section 27375 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require modified limousines to have at least two rear side doors and one or two rear windows that passengers can open from the inside in case of emergency. The limousine must also have at least two rear push-out windows accessible to all passengers. The California Highway Patrol will establish regulations for limousines to have operable window exits, including push-out windows on the roof if side installation is not possible. Modified limousines before July 1, 2015, must comply by January 1, 2018, with at least two accessible rear side doors for all passengers. For modified limousines after July 1, 2015, one side door near the driver and another near the back are required. Rear side doors must meet federal safety standards. In emergencies, the driver must unlock doors for passengers to exit. Limousine owners must comply with regulations. An owner or operator of a limousine must instruct passengers on safety features, disclose if the vehicle meets safety requirements, and inform passengers if the vehicle does not meet certain safety standards for emergency escape options. Section 34501 of the Vehicle Code exempts limousines manufactured before 1970 with an active TCP number issued before August 15, 2013, unless they were modified after that date. Section 34501 of the Vehicle Code is amended to include rules and regulations for safe operation of vehicles, including controlled substances and alcohol testing, hours of service, equipment, fueling operations, inspection, maintenance, recordkeeping, accident reports, and drawbridges. These rules do not apply to schoolbuses. Local law enforcement agencies within a single county transporting inmates are exempt from certain regulations if they already maintain driver hours of service records. This exemption does not apply if the agency transports inmates outside the county and is required to maintain driving logs by existing law. The department can establish rules for commercial vehicle safety inspections based on criteria from organizations like the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance or the United States Department of Transportation to improve nationwide standards. The commissioner appoints advisory committees to assist the department in regulating industry compliance. The department is authorized to inspect vehicles and records to ensure adherence to regulations. The department will adopt regulations for transporting hazardous materials in the state to ensure highway safety. This includes rules for filling, marking, packing, labeling, and attesting to the proper condition of shipments. Inspections of bus maintenance facilities must occur at least once every 13 months, without prior notice for operations with over 100 buses. The department conducts inspections of tour bus operations without prior notice, including those with a history of noncompliance or unsatisfactory ratings. Follow-up inspections are required for operators with unsatisfactory ratings. Regulations are in place to inform users of a bus operator's safety rating. It is illegal to operate a bus without required inspections. The department can restrict or prohibit the movement of vehicles found in violation of regulations. Section 34505.1 of the Vehicle Code is amended. The department can recommend suspension, denial, or revocation of a carrier's operating authority if they fail to maintain safe vehicles or comply with regulations, or fail to enroll drivers in the pull notice system as required. The department can recommend suspension, denial, or revocation of a carrier's operating authority for noncompliance with safety regulations, including failure to comply with periodic report requirements or nonpayment of fees. The department may recommend denial of new or renewal authority based on unsatisfactory compliance with safety-related matters. The department may recommend denial of new or renewal authority if compliance with safety regulations is unsatisfactory. Records of recommendations made must be retained by carrier. The department notifies carriers of unsatisfactory safety records, which may lead to suspension or denial of operating authority. Carriers can request a review within five days to challenge the determination. The department can order a tour bus out of service if it has multiple safety violations posing a danger to public safety. The bus cannot operate with passengers until all violations are corrected and verified by the department within five days of a reinspection request. No reimbursement is required by this act under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
