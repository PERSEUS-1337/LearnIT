    "content": "The air cargo industry is a vital component of U.S. trade and commerce, with shipments consisting of time-sensitive and high-value commodities. While only a small fraction of cargo travels by air, it accounted for 25.1% of the value of commodities shipped in 2007. Examples of air cargo include machine parts, electronics, jewelry, and perishable items like flowers and fresh fish. Air cargo includes specialized freight like scientific instruments, tools, and thoroughbred horses. Outbound packages are consolidated off-airport and transported on bulk pallets or unit load devices. Shippers have no knowledge of the specific route or aircraft. Freight forwarders and airlines use logistics software to optimize cargo flow. Domestic and international air cargo movements rely on a hub-and-spoke network of airports. Most international air cargo entering the United States transits through these airports. The air cargo industry has seen rapid growth in the past 30 years due to demand for fast and efficient shipment of goods. Despite a recent decline in shipments, the FAA predicts a return to growth with 1.3% domestically and 4.7% internationally over the next 10 years. Boeing forecasts a tripling of worldwide air cargo traffic in the next 20 years, with 5.9% annual growth. FedEx and UPS are major players, with FedEx transporting over 10 billion pounds and UPS carrying over 5.5 billion pounds of cargo on domestic flights in 2009. In 2009, FedEx and UPS were the largest carriers in the U.S. air cargo industry, transporting about 83% of all domestic air cargo. Internationally, they only transported about 15% of air cargo to and from the United States, reflecting a greater diversity of carriers. Passenger aircraft play a larger role in transporting international air cargo, with one-third of cargo by weight transported on passenger planes compared to 7% in domestic markets. Cargo shipments on passenger aircraft play a significant role in international air cargo transportation, with one-third of cargo by weight transported on passenger planes. Concerns about potential security vulnerabilities exist, particularly regarding the possibility of explosive devices being placed aboard international passenger flights destined for the United States. Despite these concerns, no such attack has occurred. In 1994, a plot to bomb U.S.-bound cargo planes was allegedly pursued by individuals involved in the \"Bojinka plot.\" Khalid Sheikh Mohammed allegedly planned to bomb U.S.-bound cargo planes, but the plot was foiled when Yousef was arrested in Pakistan in 2005. The TSA's air cargo security strategy focuses on preventing the introduction of explosives on passenger aircraft and the hijacking of all-cargo planes for use as weapons of mass destruction. An incident in 1994 involving a FedEx aircraft highlighted the potential threat of a hijacked cargo plane being used in a terrorist attack. An off-duty FedEx flight engineer attempted to hijack a DC-10 aircraft to crash into the company's Memphis headquarters. The hijacker carried weapons in a guitar case but was thwarted by the flight crew. There were no screening procedures for personnel or baggage on cargo planes at the time. TSA focuses on preventing hijackings in air cargo operations. In October 2010, explosive devices were found in air cargo shipments bound for the US, originating from Yemen. The explosives were not initially detected but were discovered after a tipoff from a member of Al Qaeda. The devices, concealed in printer cartridges, were intended to detonate in flight and could bring down an aircraft. Explosive devices found in air cargo shipments from Yemen in October 2010 were capable of bringing down aircraft. The devices contained PETN, a powerful explosive, and were linked to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The United States temporarily suspended air cargo shipments from Yemen following the discovery. Following the discovery of explosive devices in air cargo shipments from Yemen in October 2010, several countries took measures to enhance cargo screening procedures and security. European countries prohibited cargo shipments from Somalia and banned large printer cartridges in passenger aircraft cabins. Germany suspended inbound passenger flights from Yemen, while the United States and TSA prohibited cargo shipments from Somalia and banned printer cartridges over one pound. Greece also temporarily suspended outbound international parcel shipments by air and airmail after an unrelated incident involving explosives addressed to European heads of state. The discovery of explosives in air cargo shipments from Yemen led to enhanced cargo screening procedures and security measures in several countries. Greece temporarily suspended outbound international parcel shipments by air and airmail following a separate incident involving explosives addressed to European heads of state. The incidents raised debates on policy responses, including the debate between a risk-based strategy and physical inspection of shipments. Proponents argue for comprehensive physical screening of shipments for security, while others advocate for risk-based approaches due to cost and time concerns. The US mandates 100% screening of cargo on passenger aircraft, but compliance may not be reached until August 2013. Interest in screening all air cargo has increased following the discovery of explosives in cargo from Yemen in 2010. Interest in requiring all air cargo, not just on passenger aircraft, to undergo physical screening has led to the introduction of the Air Cargo Security Act in Congress. This legislation aims to mandate screening for all cargo on all-cargo aircraft, including international shipments, with provisions for inspections of foreign air cargo facilities and security training programs for cargo handlers. TSA lacks direct authority to define screening requirements at foreign airports for U.S.-bound cargo, but could impose regulations on foreign carriers to meet minimum security standards. The Air Cargo Security Act aims to mandate screening for all cargo on all-cargo aircraft, including international shipments. Enforcement overseas would be up to authorities in other countries, potentially impacting foreign trade. The cost of implementing 100% screening on passenger aircraft is estimated to be $3.5 billion over six years. The estimated cost of industry-wide compliance with the 100% screening mandate for air cargo on passenger aircraft is over $700 million in the first year. The total annual cost of physically screening all air cargo could reach several billion dollars. Meeting the screening mandate poses logistical challenges and may lead to shipping delays and inefficiencies. This could become an increasing focus in the federal budget. The federal budget may focus more on air cargo security following the 2010 explosives incidents. The President's FY2011 request sought a slight decrease in funding for air cargo security measures, while the Senate-reported appropriations bill specified additional funds for hiring inspectors and expanding canine programs. There is no requirement for screening all-cargo operations, and only about 50% of international shipments to the US are screened. The TSA faces challenges in screening international cargo due to limited control over supply chains and diplomatic considerations. They have developed a risk-based rating system and agreements with the EU, Canada, and Australia for air cargo security. Collaboration with ICAO is ongoing to establish worldwide standards. TSA has deployed 10 international cargo security inspectors to key field offices. The TSA has security inspectors in Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, and Frankfurt to examine cargo operations for compliance with screening and security requirements. They also have international industrial representatives ensuring foreign air carriers comply with TSA regulations for air cargo security. The size of the TSA's international workforce may be of interest to Congress due to the volume of international air cargo and potential threats. The TSA has security inspectors in various locations to ensure compliance with air cargo security requirements. A risk-based strategy is used to evaluate the security risk of air cargo shipments, with a known shipper database vetting approved shippers for passenger aircraft. Non-listed shippers may not place cargo on passenger aircraft, including inbound international and domestic flights. The development of known shipper programs in the mid-1990s was prompted by industry experts and Congress to increase compliance with guidelines for hazardous materials shipment and deter terrorists from using cargo for explosives on aircraft. Congressional hearings on the 1996 Valujet crash in Miami also influenced this initiative. The 1996 Valujet crash in Miami led to congressional hearings emphasizing the need for comprehensive air cargo safety measures. Recommendations from the Aviation Security Advisory Committee and the Gore Commission prompted the establishment of a known shipper program by the FAA to enhance cargo security. After the 1996 Valujet crash in Miami, the FAA established a known shipper program to enhance cargo security. Following the passage of ATSA in 2001, TSA took over cargo security oversight and relied on known shipper programs for pre-screening air cargo. A key issue post-9/11 was the creation of a consolidated industry-wide known shipper database, initially voluntary but later made mandatory by regulatory action. Congress dropped a Senate-passed statutory requirement for the database from the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 directed TSA to issue final rules on air cargo security, including a known shipper database. The air cargo industry opposes mandatory 100% screening, advocating for a risk-based system with threat assessment and targeting capabilities. The air cargo industry recommends strengthening supply chain measures and increasing inspections on high-risk cargo through risk assessment and targeting capabilities, similar to TSA's former strategic plan. This includes utilizing canine explosives detection teams, enhancing supply chain security, targeting shipments based on CBP experience, and accelerating research on efficient inspection technologies for elevated-risk cargo. TSA now physically screens all domestic air cargo on passenger planes, while employing random and risk-based assessments for inbound international shipments. TSA employs risk-based assessments for screening inbound international shipments and domestic shipments on all-cargo aircraft. They use targeting strategies and vulnerability assessments to focus on high-risk cargo. TSA collaborates with international partners to achieve 100% screening on inbound international passenger flights. TSA and CBP have a joint risk assessment process, with carriers required to provide cargo manifest information to CBP four hours before arrival in the US. CBP's mission focuses on screening items entering the US, but may not effectively target shipments from an aviation security perspective. Flights from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean require manifest information before takeoff, unlike other flights. TSA's aviation security mission addresses threats to airborne aircraft before entering US airspace. The adequacy of current manifest screening requirements for detecting threats to US-bound flights is a key policy question. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of earlier transmittal of manifest information. Efforts to improve risk-based targeting of U.S.-bound air cargo shipments were stalled before the October 2010 incidents. Concerns over potential operational impacts hindered the development of more sophisticated risk profiles for vetting overnight packages. Following the incidents, TSA implemented additional screening measures for high-risk inbound international air cargo. Congress may need to evaluate the impact of earlier transmittal of manifest information on targeting capabilities. The TSA has implemented additional screening measures for high-risk inbound international air cargo, using factors like country of origin and risk scores based on sender and recipient data. Some policymakers argue for more comprehensive cargo screening to match passenger security levels, with Congress enacting laws like ATSA post-9/11 to mandate screening and inspection. The ATSA law mandated screening and inspection of all individuals, goods, and vehicles entering secured airport areas, including cargo on passenger aircraft. It also required controls over cargo shipments to prevent unauthorized items aboard passenger planes. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2005 and subsequent appropriations measures directed TSA to increase screening and inspection of air cargo on passenger aircraft, including the use of explosives detection equipment. The Department of Homeland Security was also tasked with researching and procuring new technologies for air cargo screening. The Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007 mandated 100% physical screening of air cargo on passenger aircraft by August 2010, with interim requirements to screen 50% by February 2009. Approved screening methods included X-ray systems, explosives detection systems, canine teams, and physical searches. Cargo documents and known shipper verification alone were not considered acceptable screening methods. The TSA allows airlines, freight forwarders, shippers, manufacturers, and third party screening facilities to conduct off-airport cargo screening to meet the 100% physical screening mandate. This is done through the Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP), shifting operational costs onto industry stakeholders. The costs of mandatory cargo screening for passenger airlines may pose financial challenges, potentially affecting profitability. Passenger airlines could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to all-cargo carriers if screening requirements are more stringent for passenger flights. While cargo revenues make up a small percentage of total operating revenues for passenger airlines, they can still impact profitability significantly. The TSA established the voluntary Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) to address challenges in screening air cargo for passenger aircraft. This program allows various entities in the supply chain to screen cargo at off-airport locations to meet screening requirements. Screening pallets and containers can be complex, requiring shipments to be broken down for individual item examination. The CCSP aims to minimize these complexities. The Certified Cargo Screening Program (CCSP) aims to streamline cargo screening by allowing it to be done at various off-airport locations in the supply chain. TSA must approve screening procedures and supply chain security measures to prevent tampering with shipments. Participation in CCSP is voluntary, with employers required to allow TSA to conduct security threat assessments on workers with access to air cargo. The cost for this assessment is recovered from fees charged to CCSP participants. In FY2011, TSA expects to collect $5.2 million in fees from CCSP participants to vet almost 275,000 cargo handlers and supply-chain employees. Over 1,000 facilities, including indirect air carrier facilities, independent cargo screening facilities, and shippers, have been certified under the CCSP program. TSA reported in August 2010 that 100% of cargo on domestic passenger flights undergoes approved physical screening. Expansion of the program is anticipated in FY2011. TSA has approved various technologies for screening inbound international air cargo on passenger aircraft to meet statutory requirements. However, 100% screening may not be achieved until August 2013. Current technologies are limited in screening palletized or containerized cargo, requiring screening of individual cargo items due to size constraints. Currently, air cargo screening systems have limitations in accommodating large cargo items like containers and pallets. This has led to reliance on explosives trace detection and canine teams for screening. TSA has trained over 500 law enforcement canine teams at 78 airports, with about 25% of their time devoted to air cargo screening. Additionally, TSA has its own canine teams at the 20 busiest airports focusing on screening large bulk cargo configurations. In FY2010, TSA conducted a pilot program at 18 locations to evaluate screening technologies for large bulk cargo on passenger planes. Participating facilities were reimbursed for acquiring security screening technologies and had to provide detailed reports on cargo volumes and screening effectiveness. TSA is currently assessing the performance of these technologies, but approved technologies for cargo screening still require examining individual items, leaving a gap in screening palletized cargo, which makes up 75% of all cargo on passenger planes. The air cargo industry relies on off-airport screening of cargo and supply-chain security measures to prevent tampering. Imaging systems used at seaports and border crossings are not suitable for air cargo due to limitations in threat detection capabilities. Neutron beam technologies offer a potential solution for automated explosives detection. Neutron beam technologies offer automated explosives detection for cargo. A pilot program at Houston's airport in 2005 cost $8 million. Despite high detection rates, the program was suspended in 2007 due to financial reasons. The technology is used in Singapore, Hong Kong, and El Paso, TX, but high cost and large footprint are deterrents. The high cost and large footprint of neutron beam technologies have been deterrents to their use in the air cargo industry. Without suitable technology for screening cargo at airport facilities, off-airport screening poses challenges for maintaining security in the supply chain. Various supply chain security measures, such as tamper-evident packaging and cargo tracking technologies, help prevent tampering and maintain cargo integrity. Technologies for sealing cargo shipments, like tamper-evident tapes, offer cost-effective solutions for preventing tampering during packaging. Tamper-evident technology, such as seals and locks, can deter cargo theft and prevent the introduction of contraband during shipping. Electronic seals with alarms provide immediate detection of tampering, although they have a limited transmission range. These measures can be combined with \"known shipper\" protocols to ensure security in packaging facilities. The air cargo industry relies on tracking technologies like GPS and RFID for processing and security. TSA uses identifiers to designate screened cargo for shipment on passenger aircraft, with concerns about the security and integrity of these identifiers. Measures to ensure the security of identifiers in the air cargo supply chain are crucial for maintaining package integrity. TSA-approved security programs for air cargo operators and freight forwarders include access control, surveillance, background checks, and employee training. The effectiveness of these programs in detecting counterfeit stamps beyond the screening point is a key concern for Congress. The TSA-approved security programs for air cargo operators and freight forwarders include measures such as access control, surveillance, background checks, and employee training. Major passenger airlines and all-cargo operators have specific security programs to ensure the safety of transported cargo. Other components of the air cargo network, such as shippers and third-party logistics companies, also play a role in maintaining security. In the CCSP, air cargo security options aim to prevent hijackings and bombings on cargo and passenger aircraft. In-flight measures include protecting cockpit access, arming pilots, and considering blast-resistant cargo containers. Some cargo aircraft have hardened cockpit doors, but federal funding limitations exempted them from the requirement. In 2007, legislation was introduced to require protective barriers on all air carrier aircraft, including all-cargo aircraft. The proposal left the use of the barrier to the pilot's discretion. United Airlines took the initiative to install protective barriers on some passenger aircraft in 2004. Other airlines have not followed suit. Since 9/11, there has been controversy over arming pilots to protect the cockpit from hijacking. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allowed passenger airline pilots to receive firearms training, but not all-cargo pilots. Proponents have urged Congress to allow all-cargo pilots to join the program. Congress has expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officers (FFDO) program to allow all-cargo pilots to participate in carrying firearms and using deadly force to protect against terrorist attacks. Despite specific liability protections, air carriers have been hesitant to fully embrace the program. The FFDO program allows cargo pilots to carry firearms for security, but international agreements limit its scope to domestic operations. Annual appropriations of $25 million support the program since FY2004. Congress may address concerns like training convenience and liability issues in the future. TSA has opened new retraining sites in Texas and New Jersey. The TSA established a pilot program to explore the use of blast-resistant cargo containers on passenger aircraft following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation. Incentives were provided to airlines to offset operational costs, with $2 million authorized for the pilot program. The TSA was directed to evaluate the program under the Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007. The TSA was directed in 2007 to evaluate a pilot program for blast-resistant cargo containers on passenger aircraft, but no program has been initiated. The airline industry is skeptical due to high costs and decreased payload capacity. The 9/11 Commission recommended suspicious packages be placed in hardened containers, implying a need for cargo pre-screening to assess risk. The need for risk assessment and use of hardened containers for suspicious cargo on passenger aircraft is a key policy question. Congress may debate the risks and benefits of this approach compared to offloading to all-cargo aircraft. Deploying only one hardened cargo container per aircraft would reinforce only a small fraction of available cargo space, requiring careful consideration of what cargo is placed inside. TSA is responsible for regulatory compliance. TSA conducts regulatory compliance inspections of air carriers and freight forwarders, as well as audits of entities participating in the CCSP to ensure security practices meet TSA standards. With oversight of 4,400 freight forwarders, 300 air carriers, and 1,000 CCSP facilities, TSA's 500 transportation security inspectors may be strained by the industry's size and complexity. Cargo inspectors have also assisted VIPR teams on occasion. TSA conducts regulatory compliance inspections of air carriers and freight forwarders, as well as audits of entities participating in the CCSP to ensure security practices meet TSA standards. Cargo inspectors have also assisted VIPR teams occasionally, which could impact TSA's oversight of cargo security. TSA reports conducting nearly 3,000 random security inspections monthly and completing cargo vulnerability assessments at major cargo airports. Congress may need to assess the adequacy of random site inspections and audits in identifying and correcting regulatory compliance deficiencies."
