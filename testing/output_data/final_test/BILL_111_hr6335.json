    "content": "The \"Uranium Mining Modernization Act\" is cited as the short title. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to include a new section allowing for the leasing of lands for uranium mining. The \"Uranium Mining Modernization Act\" permanently withdraws Federal lands from uranium location and entry, allowing uranium production only through leases issued under the Act. The Secretary can divide available lands into leasing tracts for uranium mining. The \"Uranium Mining Modernization Act\" allows the Secretary to lease Federal lands for uranium mining, ensuring fair market value through competitive bidding. The Secretary can lease Federal lands for uranium mining, considering public comments on fair market value. The Secretary is not required to disclose their judgment on value or received comments. Leases on lands under other agencies require consent and conditions set by the agency head. Before issuing any uranium lease, the Secretary must consider the potential impacts on the environment, agriculture, cultural resources, economic activities, and public services in the affected community. Notice of the proposed lease must be published in a local newspaper for three consecutive weeks, and lands will be leased to the highest qualified bidder in units of up to 2,560 acres. The lease under this section requires the lessee to pay a royalty of at least 12.5% of production value, and a rental fee starting at $2.50 per acre per year for the first five years, increasing to $3 per acre per year thereafter. The Secretary of the Interior can use leases for cleaning up uranium mill tailings and reclaiming abandoned mines on Federal lands. The lease term is 10 years and continues as long as uranium is produced. The Secretary may issue exploration licenses under regulations. The Secretary may issue exploration licenses under regulations for uranium exploration on lands subject to the Act. Each license is valid for up to two years with a fee, conferring no right to a lease. The Secretary can still issue uranium leases as deemed appropriate, but not on lands with existing leases. Separate licenses are required for each State, with applications identifying general areas for exploration. The exploration license for uranium exploration on lands subject to the Act is limited to specific geographic areas in each State, with conditions to protect the environment. Violation of these conditions or laws may result in license revocation. Licensees are prohibited from causing substantial disturbance to the natural land surface and from selling uranium. They can only remove a reasonable amount for analysis and study. The Secretary's license for analysis and study requires compliance with applicable rules and regulations of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands. Exploration licenses on lands under other Federal agencies may be issued with prescribed conditions for use and protection of nonmineral interests. Licensees must share all exploration data with the Secretary, who will maintain confidentiality until areas are leased or determined otherwise. Any person conducting uranium exploration without a license on lands subject to this Act may be fined up to $1,000 per day of violation. Data collected must be immediately shared with the Secretary, who will make it public when feasible. Penalties will only be imposed after notice and a hearing. The owner of a mining claim can apply to convert it to a lease for uranium exploration within two years of the enactment of the section. The Secretary of the Interior will issue a lease if the claimant demonstrates the discovery of a valuable uranium deposit on the land within one year of the application. The conversion of a mining claim to a uranium lease requires payment of a 6.25 percent royalty on uranium production until ten years after conversion. Mining claims not converted to leases or without a demonstration of discovery will expire three years after enactment."
