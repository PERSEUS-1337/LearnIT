Congress finds that access to birth control is essential for women's health and well-being, preventing unintended pregnancies and providing various benefits such as higher educational and career achievements. Affordability and timely access have been barriers for women to use birth control, leading to high unintended pregnancy rates. A national survey found that 1 in 3 women have struggled to afford birth control at some point in their lives, especially young women. Lack of health coverage is associated with reduced use of prescription contraceptive methods.

Women saved $483 million in out-of-pocket costs for birth control in 2012 compared to 2013, with an average savings of $269 per woman.

Entities developing safe and effective birth control should seek FDA approval for over-the-counter sales. The House of Representatives believes that oral birth control should be easily accessible and affordable for women.
