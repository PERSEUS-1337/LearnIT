The Electronic Funds Transfer Account Improvement and Recipient Protection Act amends Section 3332 of title 31, United States Code, to require Federal agencies making retirement or benefit payments to provide written notice to payees about electronic funds transfer options and protections. The Electronic Funds Transfer Account Improvement and Recipient Protection Act requires Federal agencies to inform payees about electronic funds transfer options for receiving Federal payments. Payees can choose to receive payments electronically to an account established by the Secretary within specific time frames each year. Federal laws protecting consumer rights for electronic payments remain applicable. The Electronic Funds Transfer Account Improvement and Recipient Protection Act ensures that electronic funds transfers for Federal payments are not affected by commingling with State payments or by State-managed transfers. Financial institutions receiving Federal payments must not charge fees exceeding the national average and must allow recipients to conduct transactions without excessive fees. The Electronic Funds Transfer Account Improvement and Recipient Protection Act allows recipients to engage in 5 transactions each month without charge. Violations will be treated as violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue regulations implementing this amendment.

The Secretary of the Treasury must report to Congress by December 31, 1998, on the impact of the year 2000 computer problem on Federal electronic funds transfer requirements. The report will cover corrections to agency computer programs, plans for addressing potential payment issues, and whether delaying electronic funds transfer requirements would aid in resolving year 2000 computer problems. The term \"2000 computer problem\" refers to any issue that hinders information technology from accurately processing date or time data related to the 20th and 21st centuries, the years 1999 and 2000, or leap year calculations.
