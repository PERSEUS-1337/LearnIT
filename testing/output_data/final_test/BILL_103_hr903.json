    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993\" aims to ensure fairness in federal purchases. The Congress found that the Government Procurement Code had high expectations for commercial benefits, with potential trade opportunities of $20-25 billion for US export sales to foreign government entities. However, since its implementation in 1981, the US has spent $18 billion in foreign source procurement annually, while US suppliers only made $4 billion in sales to overseas governments, resulting in an imbalance of $14 billion each year. The Government Procurement Code has not met expectations, with concerns about its commercial value and benefits favoring foreign suppliers. Congress is worried about inadequate monitoring of foreign government compliance, lack of enforcement of US rights, and limited assistance to US firms in accessing foreign markets. The US economy has been impacted by these issues. After 13 years of limited opportunities for US companies overseas, there is a need to address the imbalance in government procurement practices of trading partners. The focus is on enhancing opportunities for small businesses and areas with high unemployment by using federal procurement dollars to assist them and preserve jobs. The Act aims to promote fairness in Federal procurement by providing greater access to funds for small businesses and high unemployment areas during economic downturns. This policy will help reduce the imbalance in government purchases, putting domestic companies on an equal footing and addressing the United States balance of payments issue. The Buy American Act is amended to require federal agencies to increase domestic procurement and procurement from small-business concerns during economic recessions. The Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993 requires federal agencies to compare their procurement spending with foreign government sources to domestic sources and decrease spending on foreign sources if the former exceeds the latter. The Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993 mandates federal agencies to balance procurement spending between foreign and domestic sources, with a focus on increasing spending from domestic sources. Agencies must also ensure that at least 35 percent of procurement spending goes to small-business concerns. The Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993 requires federal agencies to prioritize domestic end products in procurement contracts. The offered price of a domestic product is considered unreasonable only if it exceeds the lowest acceptable foreign offer by more than 6 percent for large businesses or 15 percent for small businesses or labor surplus area concerns. These requirements cease to apply after a 36-month period from the notification date. The Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993 requires federal agencies to prioritize domestic end products in procurement contracts. The requirements cease to apply after specific notification periods if certain conditions are met. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy provides necessary information to federal agency heads for implementation. The Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993 mandates prioritizing domestic end products in federal procurement contracts. The Act specifies conditions for notification periods to cease requirements, such as an unemployment rate below 5 percent or a stable/increasing gross national product. Definitions include domestic end products as those mined or produced in the United States. The Fairness in Federal Purchases Act of 1993 prioritizes domestic end products in federal procurement contracts. A domestic end product is one produced in the United States, or an end product manufactured in the United States with over 50 percent of its components sourced domestically. Terms like 'domestic offer,' 'foreign end product,' and 'foreign government source' are defined in the Act. The Government Procurement Code defines terms like 'foreign offer,' 'Government Procurement Code,' 'labor surplus area,' and 'labor surplus area concern.' It outlines criteria for performance in labor surplus areas for contracts. The Government Procurement Code outlines criteria for contracts where manufacturing or services in labor surplus areas exceed 50 percent of the contract price. Additionally, a conforming amendment to the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 excludes the Buy American Act from certain provisions."
