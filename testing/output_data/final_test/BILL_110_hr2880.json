    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Sanctions Enhancement Act of 2007\". The Islamic Republic of Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has not fully disclosed its nuclear program and has not allowed unrestricted access to all its nuclear sites, raising concerns about its compliance with non-proliferation commitments. Iran refused economic incentives from the UNSC and Germany in 2006 for halting its uranium enrichment program. UNSC Resolution 1696 set a deadline for Iran's compliance, which Iran violated. In 2007, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Navy seized British marines as the UNSC considered sanctions in Resolution 1747. On March 24, 2007, UNSC Resolution 1747 imposed economic sanctions on Iran for non-compliance. Iran violated the resolution and continued to advance its nuclear program, including enriching uranium to weapons-grade level and expanding its enrichment program despite UNSC deadlines. Iran has markedly expanded its enrichment program. More than 40 percent of Iranian gasoline comes from imports. The Government of Iran plans to impose daily gasoline rationing. If gasoline supply to Iran is restricted, it would have a considerable impact on the economy. Diplomatic means are seen as the most effective way to defuse the crisis regarding the Iranian nuclear program. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE IRAN SANCTIONS ACT OF 1996. Expansion of Sanctions to Refined Petroleum under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 includes imposing sanctions on investments of $20,000,000 or more that contribute to Iran's petroleum development. The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 now includes sanctions on activities that enhance Iran's ability to import refined petroleum resources or develop its weapons of mass destruction. Presidential waiver provisions have been amended to reflect these changes. Reports on US efforts to curb Iran's export activities are also required. The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 has been amended to include sanctions on activities that enhance Iran's ability to import refined petroleum resources or develop weapons of mass destruction. The President is required to submit reports every six months on any person providing Iran with refined petroleum resources or activities that could enhance Iran's ability to import such resources. The reports must include descriptions of the activities and the steps taken by the United States in response."
