    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature acknowledges the disproportionate impact of drought on areas heavily reliant on groundwater. While state programs assist communities with water needs, there is a lack of support for individual homeowners with groundwater wells who cannot afford necessary improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment, including digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, or connecting to local systems. Chapter 6.6 of the Water Code establishes a Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program for this purpose. The program created by this act provides low-interest loans and grants to homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes extending service lines, paying fees for connecting to systems, closing abandoned septic tanks and wells, deepening or improving groundwater wells, and installing water treatment systems if needed. The board may adopt regulations to carry out the purposes of the chapter. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is established in the State Treasury for expenditure by the board. Moneys deposited include repayments from grants or loans and interest earned. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median and own the residence. Loan applicants must have an ownership interest in the residence, be unable to obtain financial assistance from private lenders, demonstrate an ability to repay the loan, and secure the loan with a mortgage on the residence. The loan must be repaid within 20 years with an interest rate not exceeding 1 percent. Homeowner's insurance must be maintained on the residence while the loan is outstanding. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low household income. Grant recipients must repay the grant amount if they sell the residence within five years or return any unused funds. The board may contract with a private financial institution to provide loans for eligible applicants with low household income. Grant recipients must repay any unused grant funds. $10 million is transferred to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund for providing access to safer drinking water during California's drought."
