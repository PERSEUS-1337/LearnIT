It was ratified quickly and took effect on September 25, 1804. The amendment changed the electoral process, requiring electors to cast separate ballots for President and Vice President. If no candidate receives a majority, the House votes for President from the top three candidates. The 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution changed the electoral process, requiring separate ballots for President and Vice President. In a contingent election, two-thirds of states (34) are needed to elect the President, with each state casting a single vote. If the House is unable to elect, the Vice President serves as Acting President. The Senate elects the Vice President if no candidate receives a majority, with a quorum of two-thirds (67 Senators) needed. The 12th Amendment established contingent election as a procedure when no candidate wins an electoral college majority. This could happen if multiple candidates split the vote, electors cast blank ballots, or the electoral college ties. Contingent elections have only occurred twice: for the President in 1825 and for the Vice President in 1837. The 12th Amendment provides rules for contingent election of the President. The 12th Amendment establishes rules for contingent election of the President, including the requirement for the House to choose the President immediately by secret paper ballot, with each state casting a single vote. A quorum consists of two-thirds of states, and a majority of states is needed to elect the President. If no President is chosen by January 20, the Vice President assumes the role. The 12th Amendment establishes rules for contingent election of the President, with the Vice President acting as President until a President is chosen if no decision is made by January 20. Procedures from the 1825 election could serve as a precedent for future contingent elections, but would not be binding on future Congresses. The contingent election process for choosing the President involved a two-round voting system by state delegations, with ballots cast anonymously on paper. If a candidate received a majority in the first round, the state vote was cast for them in the second round. If no majority was reached, the ballot was marked as \"divided.\" In the contingent election process for choosing the President, ballots marked \"divided\" were collected and counted by tellers in duplicate ballot boxes. The decisions made in 1825 were not prescriptive for future elections, but could serve as a reference. In a modern context, there would likely be pressure for open sessions covered by media and public disclosure of individual Members' votes in the House of Representatives. In the 1825 contingent election for President, there was debate on how individual Representatives should vote, with some advocating for choosing the national popular vote winner, while others argued for considering state or district winners. Some believed the House should weigh the merits of all candidates, while others saw the election as a separate process triggered by a lack of majority. In the 1825 contingent election for President, there was debate on how individual Representatives should vote, with some advocating for choosing the national popular vote winner, while others argued for considering state or district winners. The process was triggered by the failure to reach a majority, allowing Representatives to consider the merits of candidates without reference to earlier contests. The Senate's procedures in 1837 differed from the House's in 1825, with a simpler process of calling the roll in alphabetical order for each Senator to name their vote. The Senate Journal does not indicate the closure of the gallery during this process. President pro tempore William R. King presided over the contingent election of 1837, as the incumbent Vice President, Martin Van Buren, had \"retired\" from the Senate. The contingent election process was later modified in the 20th century by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. This change aimed to eliminate lame duck congressional sessions and shorten the period between election and inauguration of the President and Vice President by six weeks. The 20th Amendment and Presidential Succession Act of 1947 aimed to shorten the period between election and inauguration of the President and Vice President by six weeks. It also clarified the process for contingent elections and established a line of succession in case neither a President nor Vice President has qualified. The Speaker or President pro tempore would need to resign from their current positions to become Acting President if the President is unable to serve. If both decline, the head of the Department of State would assume the acting presidency, followed by other cabinet secretaries in order of seniority. The Acting President serves until a new President is qualified. The 23rd Amendment allows citizens of the District of Columbia to vote in presidential elections, but they do not participate in contingent elections. A proposed constitutional amendment suggested changing the formula for electing the President under contingent election to a per capita vote in the House of Representatives. The proposed amendment would change the contingent election process for the President by allowing each Representative to vote instead of each state casting a single vote. This would make the process more democratic by reflecting the population disparities among states. The proposed amendment aims to make the contingent election process for the President more democratic by allowing each Representative to vote instead of each state casting a single vote. This change would reflect population disparities among states. The amendment does not affect the existing vice-presidential election procedures in the Senate, which still incorporate the concept of state equality. No further action was taken on H.J.Res. 113 before the 108th Congress adjourned. A popular third party or independent candidacy has the potential of preventing an electoral vote majority in presidential elections. Contest over election results in Florida in the closely contested presidential election of 2000 raised the possibility of excluding Florida's electoral votes, leading to a contingent election. In such scenarios, the House and Senate could be called on to elect the President and Vice President as per the provisions of the 12th Amendment. The 12th Amendment governs contingent elections in the House and Senate, with precedents from past elections offering guidance but not binding. Any proposed changes to the process would require a two-thirds vote in Congress and approval by three-fourths of the states within seven years. The success of constitutional amendments depends on broad national consensus, urgency for reform, and support from congressional leadership. Contingent election procedures are likely to remain unless compelling reasons prompt large majorities in the public, Congress, and states to reform them."
