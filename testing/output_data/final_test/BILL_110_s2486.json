    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"HIV Nondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act of 2007\". Under Federal immigration law, individuals infected with HIV are prohibited from entering the United States. Testing for HIV is required for applicants seeking permanent residence or refugee status. Nonimmigrant applicants must disclose their HIV status and may be required to undergo testing. The Secretary of Homeland Security can grant waivers on a case-by-case basis to HIV-positive individuals applying for permanent admission as immigrants. Applicants seeking permanent admission as immigrants must establish minimal danger to public health and minimal possibility of infection spread. No cost can be incurred by any level of government agency without prior consent. Applicants seeking admission to the United States must meet specific criteria, including being a refugee, eligible for humanitarian purposes, or applying for a short-term nonimmigrant visa. The travel and immigration ban on HIV-positive individuals was implemented in 1987 and requires HIV screening for all persons over 14 years of age applying for a visa. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to determine which diseases are considered communicable. In 1991, the Secretary of Health and Human Services proposed ending the HIV travel and immigration ban by removing HIV from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance, but the proposal was dropped due to opposition from Congress. In 1993, Congress revoked the Secretary's authority to make public health determinations regarding HIV status for potential foreign students, tourists, refugees, and immigrants entering the United States. The United States bans travel and immigration for persons with HIV, impacting thousands of prospective HIV-positive foreign students, tourists, refugees, and immigrants. This policy may discourage some individuals from entering the country solely based on their HIV status. Foreign students, refugees, and nonpermanent residents in the United States may be at risk of HIV/AIDS infection. The United Nations and WHO oppose travel restrictions for people with HIV/AIDS. The 2006 UN guidelines state there is no public health rationale for restricting movement based on HIV status. On World AIDS Day, December 1, 2006, the President emphasized that restrictions on international travel based on HIV status are discriminatory and unjustified by public health concerns. States should not single out HIV/AIDS for longer-term residency restrictions and should prioritize humanitarian concerns over economic considerations in entry applications. The President proposed streamlining the waiver process for HIV-positive individuals entering the US on short-term visas. This proposal would not affect those seeking permanent residence or non-tourist visas. There is no scientific evidence supporting the HIV travel ban as an effective way to prevent the spread of HIV or reduce public health care costs. Amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act removes HIV infection as a reason for inadmissibility. Review of travel and immigration regulations regarding HIV is proposed. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will convene a panel of public health experts to review policies on HIV as a communicable disease for immigration purposes. This review will include analyzing previous policies and allowing for a public comment period. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will review the listing of HIV as a communicable disease for immigration purposes. A report will be submitted to Congress with the determination, rationale, public health impact, costs, panel members, and public comments, which will also be made available to the public."
