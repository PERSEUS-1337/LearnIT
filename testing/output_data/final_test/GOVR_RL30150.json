    "content": "Members of NATO contribute to the alliance primarily through funding and deploying armed forces for missions. Current members also assist prospective members in modernizing their forces. NATO activities are coordinated by the headquarters in Brussels and funded by the NATO Military Budget, NATO Civil Budget, and NATO Security Investment Program. The NATO funds, including the NATO Civil Budget, NATO Military Budget, and NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP), are maintained by direct contributions from member states. Shares of the budgets are adjusted based on GDP and per capita GDP. In 2005, new burdensharing arrangements were negotiated for all funds except for the United States. Ministers provide guidance on resource use, while separate committees manage the accounts. The funds support various activities, with the civil budget focusing on policy planning, liaison with non-alliance partners, and public diplomacy. NATO's international staff, led by the Secretary General's office, supports the North Atlantic Council and its committees. The civil budget covers administrative tasks and program activities, including public information and civil emergency planning. It also funds non-military aspects related to enlargement, such as the Partnership for Peace. The civil budget of NATO finances activities related to enlargement, such as the Partnership for Peace program and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. It is funded by all member states, with the U.S. contributing 21.7394%. In FY2010 through FY2012, the U.S. contributed $81.9 million, $79.7 million, and $82.4 million, respectively. The Obama Administration requested $68.8 million in its FY2013 budget. The Obama Administration requested $68.8 million in its FY2013 budget for NATO's military budget, which covers operational and maintenance costs of international military staff, headquarters, and commands. This budget also administers military-related activities and organizations, including the AWACS fleet operations and Maintenance and Supply Agency. The NATO military budget is reviewed and approved annually. The NATO military budget is reviewed and approved annually by the North Atlantic Council. Member state contributions are based on a cost-sharing formula negotiated by the U.S. The U.S. contributes approximately 25% of the budget, with amounts ranging from $425.3 million to $462.5 million in recent years. The budget covers operational and maintenance costs, including funding for military installations and construction projects. The NATO Security Investment Program (NSIP) was established in May 1993 to reflect the alliance's post-Cold War security policy. It focuses on crisis control, anti-terrorism, and rapid force mobility. The NSIP budget finances various NATO support functions such as command, control, communications, intelligence, logistics, training, transportation, and storage facilities. Projects are managed by the NATO Infrastructure Committee and implemented by host countries or NATO agencies. \"NATO has had to postpone long-term defense investment requirements due to fiscal constraints post-global financial crisis. The Alliance Global Hawk unmanned reconnaissance aircraft used in Afghanistan is a priority project. NSIP projects are politically sensitive and decided through a priority planning process, awarded based on competitive bidding, and undergo NATO-controlled inspection and auditing.\" The Department of Defense (DOD) has benefited from new NATO missions and the redirection of NSIP activities, with changes in funding criteria favoring U.S. requirements over European allies. NSIP supports U.S. storage facilities in Europe and American reinforcement forces for NATO. The U.S. has utilized NATO infrastructure for various military operations, and U.S. companies have been successful in bidding on NSIP contracts. The U.S. Department of Defense notes that U.S. companies have been successful in bidding on NSIP contracts. NSIP funding shortfalls were an issue in the 1990s due to reduced budget requests, but post-9/11, this has improved. NSIP supports NATO military missions in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Iraq, paying for projects that would otherwise be funded solely by the U.S. or cancelled. This program enhances U.S. credibility and allows NATO to make payments to U.S. contractors for urgently needed projects. The U.S. Department of Defense relies on appropriations to fund its share of NATO projects, with the current U.S. share at 22.2%. The U.S. contributes $264.4 million to the NSIP in FY2013, with $10.2 million expected from prior year recoupments. This funding supports NATO missions in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Iraq, benefiting U.S. contractors and enhancing U.S. credibility within the alliance. The U.S. Department of Defense contributes $264.4 million to NATO projects in FY2013, with $10.2 million from prior year recoupments. This funding supports NATO missions in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Iraq, benefiting U.S. contractors and enhancing U.S. credibility within the alliance. The majority of NATO-related expenses incurred by member states come from deploying their own armed forces, leading to a burdensharing debate focused on allies restructuring forces and acquiring new military capabilities. The national shares for NATO common accounts are determined based on each country's \"ability to pay\" and the formulae applied is both political and economic. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported on the history and apportionment of NATO common funds shares in response to requests from member states or major events. NATO decisions on burdensharing arrangements are consensus-based. NATO's burdensharing arrangements are consensus-based and have been revised based on event-driven changes, such as France's 1966 withdrawal, Spain's 1982 admission, and Canada's 1994 reduction of its contribution. The alliance periodically reviews member contributions, initially assigning shares based on economic strength and later grouping countries accordingly. In 1952, the three largest NATO member states (the United States, the United Kingdom [U.K.], and France) each paid 22.5% of the budget, while other founding members were assessed based on their GDP. NATO later based contributions on past expenditures and stopped annual reviews. France withdrew from the military structure in 1966, leading to changes in contributions. The NATO military structure underwent changes in contributions after a British-requested review and a partial French pullout. The redistribution of shares of the military budget was based on factors like members' capacity to pay, benefits of NSIP projects, economic benefits, security contributions, and political and economic factors. The rationales behind the share revisions have not been made public. The NATO alliance considers various factors like defense industries, political, and economic factors when setting cost shares for contributions. These shares are negotiated rather than based on quantifiable guidelines. In 2004, European members agreed to standardize contributions to the military budget. The US contribution to the NSIP budget in 2003 was 23.8%, slightly higher than Germany's 19.8%, taking into account the US's global security responsibilities. In 2003, the US contributed 23.8% to the NATO military budget, slightly higher than Germany's 19.8%. If contributions were based solely on GDP, the US share would have been 53.6% and Germany's 9.8%. Analysts argue that alliances save money by pooling resources. The cost of adding new members to NATO was estimated to be between $10 billion and $125 billion before the 1999 enlargement. The estimated cost of adding new members to NATO ranged from $10 billion to $125 billion, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about the financial burden on the United States. However, studies suggested that enlargement would only require $1.5 billion in common funds expenditures over 10 years, with the 2004 round of enlargement expected to cost a similar amount. The addition of 10 new contributors actually reduced the percentage shares of established members, including the United States. NATO staff estimated that the addition of new members in 2009 would not result in significant costs, with expenses mainly focused on air defense upgrades, facility improvements, and secure communications. Any other projects in new member states would be assessed and funded based on their contributions to NATO. In mid-2005, NATO's Senior Resource Board recommended a new formula for funding projects in new member states based on contributions to NATO capabilities or ongoing missions. The formula excludes the United States from calculations and adjusts contributions if new members join the alliance. The new formula is based on gross national income data. The revised cost share plan for NATO, introduced in January 2006, is based on gross national income (GNI) data and includes a two-year rolling average to smooth out fluctuations. Besides GNI, future burdensharing arrangements will consider factors like staffing for NATO activities, benefits from projects, and contributions to specified operations over the previous four years. NATO will biennially review nations' contributions and adjust shares accordingly. During the February 2010 meeting, NATO defense ministers approved measures to balance the alliance's budget and committed to injecting additional resources. In November 2010, NATO member states agreed to acquire a new ballistic missile defense capability, with an estimated cost of 200 million euros over 10 years. This is in addition to the existing ALTBMD program, expected to cost around 800 million euros over 14 years. The NATO member states agreed to acquire a new ballistic missile defense capability, with an estimated cost of approximately $1 billion over 14 years. The funding will come from the common NATO budget, with individual countries responsible for supporting their own interceptors and sensors. However, a NATO industry advisory group warned that the cost could exceed initial estimates due to the need for significant investment in a new command-and-control architecture. The focus on NATO common funds has been overshadowed by discussions on member states' contributions to alliance operations and operational restrictions. Some allies face challenges due to inadequate war-fighting equipment, leading to frustrations among countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Denmark. The 112th Congress may review new common funds burdensharing arrangements and U.S. contributions to NATO budgets in the context of Defense and State Department appropriations, reflecting the toll on the alliance's fighting capability of inadequate defense spending by some members."
