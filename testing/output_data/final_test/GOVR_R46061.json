    "content": "In recent presidential Administrations, there have been disputes between Congress and the White House over access to executive branch officials, including attempts to enforce subpoenas. Such disagreements are uncommon, as most interactions between Congress and the executive branch are voluntary. There is regular communication, data sharing, and collaboration on operations, policy, and projects between the branches. Understanding the common practice of voluntary cooperation is crucial in understanding Congress's relationship with the executive. The report focuses on voluntary testimony by the executive branch before congressional committees, outlining its origins, incentives, and key dimensions. It does not address instances of executive branch refusal to comply with congressional requests or the quality of the testimony provided. The report discusses the history of voluntary compliance with congressional requests for testimony by the executive branch, dating back to President George Washington's response to a request for information from Congress regarding a military campaign in 1791. President Washington's cabinet decided to comply fully with Congress's request for documents and testimony, establishing the concept of executive privilege while also prioritizing compliance with congressional requests. This decision set a precedent for future interactions between the executive branch and Congress. The concept of executive privilege was established by President Washington's cabinet, setting a precedent for future interactions between the executive branch and Congress. Administrations generally comply with requests from Congress due to incentives like control over department appropriations, ensuring responsiveness to testimony requests. Adverse budget actions have been taken in the past for uncooperative agencies. During the 97th Congress, the director of the Office of Policy Development, Martin Anderson, refused to appear before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, citing his role as a senior adviser to the President. The subcommittee disagreed, leading to the House Appropriations Committee zeroing out the office's budget until a legal basis for refusal was presented. Despite negotiations, the budget was still reduced from the requested $2.9 million. The House Committee on Appropriations reduced funding for the U.S. Coast Guard due to dissatisfaction with the agency's responses to Congressional direction, cutting $5,000,000 from headquarters directorates in FY2006. The Committee expressed frustration with the Coast Guard's lack of cooperation in providing timely and complete information for oversight of its programs. Congress's legislative power extends to all agency reporting to Congress, including duties, reporting requirements, and independence. It closely monitors agency execution of laws and uses tools like the Administrative Procedure Act to control operations. Congressional engagement may lead agencies to collaborate with committees or face statutory changes affecting their jurisdiction and operational rules. The executive branch's organization and the network of statutes, guidelines, and practices governing agency operations are complex. Voluntary cooperation with congressional stakeholders can influence decisions on organization and operations. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 was partly due to concerns about access to officials after the September 11 attacks. President George W. Bush appointed Tom Ridge to lead the Office of Homeland Security, leading to congressional scrutiny over Ridge's control of national security bureaucracy. The committee disagreed with Ridge's control over national security bureaucracy, leading to an agreement for an \"informal briefing.\" The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security asserted Congress's oversight authority over the executive branch, limiting resistance to congressional requests. Presidents have generally accepted Congress's investigative authority, with a body of practices and expectations developed. Presidents have historically allowed personal advisers to testify in cases of malfeasance despite claiming immunity, to manage visibility during congressional investigations. An example is the Reagan Administration's handling of the Iran-Contra affair, where support to the Contras continued despite a congressional ban. Despite the congressional ban, the Reagan Administration and the CIA provided support to the Contras using proceeds from undisclosed CIA arms sales to Iran. Reagan officials initially misled investigators but eventually cooperated with Congress. Building a positive relationship with Congress can benefit an Administration in implementing policies. President Jimmy Carter emphasized the importance of a constructive working relationship with Congress to implement his agenda, as seen in his lobbying for the authority to reorganize the executive branch. Despite initial resistance from Chairman Jack Brooks, Carter learned the value of having him on his side rather than against him. President Jimmy Carter worked closely with Chairman Jack Brooks, who initially resisted but later supported Carter's reorganization bills. Ten out of eleven bills passed Congress with Brooks' help. Committees can request executive branch officials to testify before them, with negotiations on logistics and format. Agency leaders are expected to appear during the annual appropriations process. The annual appropriations process requires agency leaders to justify their budget requests before appropriations subcommittees. The President plays a significant role in the executive branch budget process, with the Office of Management and Budget establishing guidelines for agency communications with Congress. Testimony must be submitted to OMB for review in advance of the budget. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) sets guidelines for agency communications with Congress, requiring agencies to submit testimony for review before budget hearings. Agencies must provide complete answers to questions from Congress, and all legislative proposals and communications to Congress are cleared by OMB. OMB Director Mick Mulvaney outlined the goals of the clearance process in a February 2017 memorandum. The Senate uses the confirmation process to ensure agency leaders will cooperate with Congress. Senators may ask nominees to agree to respond to congressional requests if confirmed, establishing expectations. This process allows the Senate to hold nominees accountable for their commitments. During confirmation hearings, nominees are asked to commit to appearing before congressional committees to represent departmental positions and address Congress's concerns. The executive branch may be less likely to provide public testimony in certain circumstances, such as national security, intelligence, and law enforcement matters. The executive branch may refuse to testify before committees in areas such as national security, intelligence, and law enforcement. Congress can compel officials to testify, but committees may consider limiting requests or conducting closed-door sessions. During special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress, committees allowed him to decline specific questions for various reasons, including national security concerns. Mueller's limits were accepted, and the hearings proceeded."
