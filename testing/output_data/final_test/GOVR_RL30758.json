    "content": "Since the 1970s oil crises, the US has sought alternatives to gasoline and diesel for automobiles due to environmental and security concerns. Alternative transportation fuels include electricity, natural gas, propane, ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen. Some can be used in conventional vehicles with minimal modifications, while others require completely different systems. Cost is a significant factor in the adoption of these alternative fuels. The discussion on alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) includes cost, performance, and safety factors. Despite efforts by government programs to promote alternative fuels, their adoption in the US transportation sector remains limited. The three key statutes promoting alternative fuels are the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. These laws require federal and state agencies, as well as private firms, to purchase vehicles capable of using non-petroleum fuels for their fleets. The Energy Policy Act also grants the Department of Energy the authority to enforce similar requirements on local governments and private fleets. The Energy Policy Act of 1992, along with other laws and executive orders, mandates government and private fleets to use alternative fuel vehicles to reduce petroleum consumption. Executive Orders like E.O. 12844 and E.O. 13149 further emphasize the use of AFVs and hybrid vehicles to meet environmental goals. Beginning in FY1990, the Alternative Motor Fuels Act required the federal government to acquire a maximum number of light-duty alcohol and natural gas vehicles. The act also established an Interagency Commission on Alternative Motor Fuels and a commercial demonstration program for heavy-duty trucks. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 created the Clean Fuel Fleet Program for cities with air quality issues to promote clean fuel vehicles. The Clean Fuel Fleet Program (CFFP) requires fleets of 10 or more light-duty vehicles to meet purchase requirements similar to EPAct. Vehicles must be operated on the fuel they were certified for, avoiding loopholes. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 promotes energy efficiency and alternative fuel vehicles. The AFV purchase requirements for federal, state, and alternative fuel provider fleets mandate a certain percentage of new light-duty vehicles to be fueled by alternative fuel. Law enforcement, emergency, combat, non-road, and testing vehicles are exempt. Fleet requirements were phased in between 1997 and 2001. The Energy Policy Act of 2001 mandated AFV purchase requirements for federal, state, and alternative fuel provider fleets. DOE recognizes various alternative fuels for covered vehicles. Some agencies are exceeding mandates, while others are below quota. The federal government was in compliance in 1998. The federal government was in compliance with AFV purchase requirements in 1998, mainly due to large purchases like 10,000 ethanol vehicles by the U.S. Postal Service. However, a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit in 2002 accusing 18 federal agencies of non-compliance. The court ruled in favor of the environmental groups, requiring agencies to submit reports on their non-compliance by January 31, 2003. Environmental groups have since filed a motion for contempt, citing agencies' failure to submit reports or submitting unsubstantiated reports. The EPAct fleet program has faced criticism for not necessarily supporting its goals, as it only requires the purchase of AFVs, not the use of alternative fuels. Some fleets have been able to meet requirements by using dual-fuel vehicles, which is seen as a loophole. Additionally, EPAct provides tax incentives for new AFVs, such as a 10% EV tax credit and a Clean Fuel Vehicle tax deduction. The EPAct fleet program offers tax incentives for new AFVs, including a 10% EV tax credit and a Clean Fuel Vehicle tax deduction. Vehicles purchased to meet fleet requirements are ineligible for these incentives. Executive Orders have also played a role in promoting alternative fuels policies. Executive Order 13031, issued in December 1996, expanded the Administration's policy on EPAct fleets, requiring federal agencies to comply regardless of budgets. Agencies must submit yearly progress reports to OMB and face penalties for non-compliance. Executive Order 13149, issued in April 2000, aims to reduce federal fleet petroleum consumption by 20% below FY1999 levels by FY2005. Various strategies are suggested to achieve this goal. The Executive Order 13149 aims to reduce federal fleet petroleum consumption by 20% below FY1999 levels by FY2005. Strategies include using alternative fuel vehicles and high-efficiency hybrids, with a majority of EPACT vehicles to be fueled with alternative fuels by FY2005 to close loopholes. Various alternative fuels recognized by EPAct are discussed, considering technical and market factors affecting their usability and success as petroleum-based fuel alternatives. Factors such as fuel cost, vehicle cost, performance, and infrastructure are addressed for each fuel. Table 3 summarizes various alternative fuels, including biodiesel and ethanol blends, with details on energy equivalency and infrastructure considerations. In 2002, there were approximately 4.1 million gasoline vehicles in the US. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a common alternative fuel produced as a by-product of natural gas processing. LPG must be liquefied for use in vehicles and is also used in home heating and recreational activities. LPG consumption was around 242 million gasoline equivalent gallons in 2004, making it the most commonly used alternative fuel. There were about 194,000 LPG vehicles on the road in 2004, accounting for about 0.1% of all gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles. In 2004, there were about 194,000 LPG vehicles on the road, accounting for 0.1% of all gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles. LPG vehicles are custom-made, with only a few light-duty production options available. Fuel costs for LPG are similar to gasoline but can fluctuate more in response to external factors. Additionally, there is an extra cost of $1,000 to $2,000 for modifications to the fuel system and the addition of a high-pressure fuel tank. The cost covers modifications to the fuel system and a high-pressure fuel tank. There are approximately 3,500 LPG refueling sites in the US, which could expand if demand increases. LPG is delivered through a pipeline and tanker truck system, requiring special equipment for transfer to vehicles. LPG vehicles have lower emissions than gasoline vehicles, emitting up to 33% fewer VOCs, 20% less NOx, and 60% less carbon monoxide. However, they have a slightly decreased range compared to gasoline vehicles. Larger LPG vehicles can carry a larger tank and maintain a range of 300-400 miles, but payload is reduced due to the size and weight of the tank. Safety is a key advantage of LPG as it has a higher ignition temperature than gasoline and requires greater concentrations to ignite. LPG must be stored in heavy-duty tanks and undergo rigorous testing. An odorant is added to make it detectable. Few major issues exist with LPG fuels, but expanding fueling infrastructure is necessary. LPG may not reduce petroleum dependence as it is often derived from petroleum refining. Natural gas, a fossil fuel mainly composed of methane, is another alternative fuel option. Natural gas, mainly methane, is widely used in residences and industries. It is stored as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) for vehicles. In 2004, 170 million GEG of natural gas was consumed in the US, mostly as CNG. The number of natural gas vehicles has been growing by approximately 20% per year, including popular models like Honda Civic and Toyota Camry. In 2003, the federal government operated around 18,000 CNG vehicles and 50 LNG vehicles, consuming more CNG than all other alternative fuels combined. The cost of using natural gas can significantly reduce fuel costs due to its relatively low price and lower federal excise tax rate compared to gasoline. Natural gas vehicles have lower fuel costs compared to gasoline due to the lower federal excise tax rate. Equipping a vehicle for CNG can cost between $4,000 and $6,000, with potential incentives available. There are around 900 public CNG refueling sites in the US, making the infrastructure more widely available than for other alternative fuels. The CNG refueling network in the US could be expanded due to the extensive natural gas system. Slow-fill refueling systems for home installation allow overnight vehicle fueling, reducing the need for public stations. However, training is required for users and station operators due to the technology differences. Natural gas vehicles have exceptional environmental performance, with reduced emissions compared to gasoline vehicles. The main drawback is their shorter range. The performance drawback of natural gas vehicles is their shorter range compared to gasoline vehicles, typically only 100 to 200 miles on a full tank. Natural gas vehicles are popular for use in localized areas like cities due to this limitation. Safety features of natural gas include being non-toxic, harder to ignite than gasoline, and dissipating faster. However, odorants are added to make it detectable in the air. A key safety concern is the high-pressure storage of compressed natural gas. CNG tanks undergo severe abuse tests to ensure safety due to high pressures. Natural gas vehicles can promote energy security by reducing reliance on imported fuel. Biodiesel, made from fatty feedstocks, has advantages despite being more expensive than conventional diesel. Biodiesel has advantages over conventional diesel, such as compatibility with existing diesel engines. However, it is more expensive, with pure biodiesel costing up to $1.00 more per gallon to produce. Wholesale biodiesel prices have been dropping due to process improvements and increases in production scale. In some places, where recycled oil is used, wholesale prices of pure biodiesel may be lower than for conventional diesel. Biodiesel can be used in existing diesel vehicles with little or no modification, making it a cost-effective alternative fuel option. Additionally, biodiesel can be easily integrated into the existing diesel distribution system with minimal modifications. Biodiesel is a more effective solvent than conventional diesel but can cause deterioration of rubber and polyurethane materials. Biodiesel is typically mixed with conventional diesel at the 20% level (B20) and can be used in existing diesel engines with few modifications. Higher concentrations can also be used, leading to reductions in emissions of VOCs, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. However, NOx emissions may increase with biodiesel use. Overall, there is little difference in performance between biodiesel and conventional diesel. Payload and range remain the same with biodiesel compared to conventional diesel. Maintenance costs may decrease due to lower sulfur content. Minor modifications may be needed for concentrations above 20% as biodiesel can corrode engine seals. Biodiesel has similar safety properties to conventional diesel but has a higher flash point, reducing the risk of fire. Two key issues facing biodiesel are related to tax incentives and support similar to ethanol. In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act established a $1.00 per gallon tax credit for biodiesel production from agricultural products. A 1998 amendment to EPAct grants credits to fleet owners who purchase biodiesel, allowing them to meet requirements without new vehicles or infrastructure modifications. Environmentalists argue that blending biodiesel at 20% has little impact on oil consumption or vehicle emissions. Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, is a commonly used alternative fuel in the United States, primarily produced from corn in the Midwest. It is often blended with gasoline at a ratio of 85% ethanol to make E85. Ethanol consumption includes blending at the 10% level with gasoline to make E10, or \"gasohol.\" In 2004, ethanol consumption in the United States was approximately 3.1 billion gallons, with E10 (gasohol) accounting for 90% of the blend. E85 consumption was relatively low at 22 million gallons, with around 146,000 E85 vehicles in use. Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) can use E85, gasoline, or a mixture of both. In 2003, there were approximately 4.1 million ethanol FFVs on the road, with popular models like Ford Explorer and Dodge Caravan offering E85/gasoline flexibility. The availability of FFVs may increase the market for ethanol fuel, despite most vehicles being fueled with gasoline. The cost of ethanol, with E85 retail prices ranging from $0.84 to $1.41 per gallon, is a key drawback to its use. Ethanol costs ranged from $0.84 to $1.41 between April 2000 and October 2002, with benefits from an exemption to the motor fuels excise tax when blended with gasoline. The exemption is 52 cents per gallon for E10 and 6.4 cents for E85. Fuel costs are higher for E85, but vehicle ownership and maintenance costs are similar to gasoline vehicles. Infrastructure for ethanol delivery mainly consists of tanker trucks, with 205 E85 refueling sites nationally as of December 2004. The infrastructure for ethanol delivery consists of tanker trucks and 205 E85 refueling sites nationally as of December 2004. Ethanol's key performance drawback is lower fuel economy, resulting in a 29% reduction in range. Ethanol-powered vehicles may have difficulty starting in cold weather, which is why most ethanol used is in purer forms like E85 with 15% gasoline for easier ignition. Ethanol-powered vehicles have environmental advantages such as lower emissions of ozone-forming compounds and toxic compounds like benzene and toluene. However, they emit more formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which can be controlled with advanced catalytic converters. Ethanol also has lower life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline vehicles. Ethanol-powered vehicles emit lower levels of greenhouse gases than gasoline vehicles. The growth process of ethanol feedstock results in carbon dioxide uptake, further reducing net emissions. Studies show that E85 can result in a 14% to 19% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with potential for even higher reductions with advancing technology. Ethanol fuel is also safer than gasoline, being less flammable and dissipating more quickly. The most significant issue surrounding ethanol is the exemption from the motor fuels excise tax, labeled as \"corporate welfare\" by opponents. Proponents argue it supports farmers and benefits the environment and energy security. Concerns over lower receipts to the Highway Trust Fund led to an income tax credit for ethanol blending in the American Jobs Creation Act. A possible development of a renewable fuels standard (RFS) requiring the use of renewable fuel in gasoline, likely ethanol. Methanol, derived from natural gas, coal, or biomass, is used as a blend with gasoline called M85. Methanol is commonly used as a blend with gasoline in M85 (85% methanol, 15% gasoline) or in a pure form called M100. It is primarily used in Indianapolis-type race cars. Methanol consumption is relatively low, with only 0.3 million GEG consumed in 2004. The number of methanol-powered vehicles in the US has decreased, with approximately 4,600 vehicles in 2004. The federal government operated only 70 methanol-fueled vehicles in 2003. Cost is a notable concern with methanol as it tends to be more expensive than gasoline, with prices ranging between $0.95 and $1.20 per gallon. The fuel cost can be around $1.73 to $2.10 per GEG due to its lower energy content. The incremental cost for purchasing or converting a vehicle to methanol can range from $500 to $2,000, with additional costs for replacing parts that may be corroded by alcohol. Infrastructure is also a barrier to the widespread use of methanol as a motor fuel. The lack of fueling infrastructure is a barrier to the expansion of the methanol vehicle market. Public methanol refueling stations have closed in recent years, and there are currently no public refueling sites listed by the Department of Energy. However, existing gasoline tanks and pumping equipment could be easily converted to store and deliver methanol. Most methanol is transported by tanker truck from the methanol plant to stations. Methanol is transported by tanker truck from the plant as it cannot travel through pipelines due to its properties. Methanol vehicles offer improved environmental performance over gasoline vehicles, emitting 30% to 50% less ozone-forming compounds. However, they have a drawback of reduced vehicle range by approximately 40% compared to gasoline. Increasing the fuel tank size can help mitigate this issue. Methanol fuel offers improved environmental performance over gasoline, emitting fewer ozone-forming compounds. Safety-wise, methanol is safer than gasoline as its vapors disperse quickly and require higher concentrations to ignite. Methanol has potential in fuel cell vehicles as a cleaner alternative to gasoline, with a similar fueling infrastructure. Methanol can be derived from biomass waste products and used in fuel cell vehicles, reducing emissions. Electric vehicles are powered by rechargeable batteries, producing zero emissions from the vehicle itself. Electric vehicles have low pollutant emissions compared to gasoline vehicles, but they come with cost and performance drawbacks. In 2004, 12 million GEG of electric fuel were consumed in the US by 56,000 electric vehicles, mainly in California. Popular models like the GM EV1 have been discontinued due to limited consumer acceptance. The federal government operated around 1,300 electric vehicles in 2003. Electric fuel is cheaper than gasoline. Electric vehicles have lower fuel costs compared to gasoline vehicles, with electric fuel costing 2.5 to 3.3 cents per mile versus 4 to 6 cents per mile for gasoline. However, the high cost of batteries can lead to an incremental vehicle purchase cost of up to $20,000. There are currently around 700 electric recharging sites in the US, mostly in California. While expanding the infrastructure is feasible, only a few vehicles can access a single charger in a day. EVs have good environmental performance. The environmental performance of electric vehicles is very good, with low overall levels of pollutants. Emissions can be decreased by 90% or more compared to gasoline vehicles. However, EVs have a relatively short range of 50 to 130 miles and take 3 to 8 hours to fuel. Safety issues are minimal, with no risk of spillage or inhalation during fueling. Existing recharging systems for electric vehicles eliminate the risk of electric shocks and fire/explosion hazards. However, concerns may arise from acid leaks in battery rupture incidents and increased shock potential for emergency responders due to higher electrical currents. Research on batteries, drivetrains, and lightweight materials is crucial for the development of electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. Fuel cell vehicles use chemical reactions to produce electricity for an electric motor, eliminating long recharging times. While not yet widely commercialized, some manufacturers offer fuel cell vehicles for lease. Hybrid electric vehicles combine electric motors with gasoline or diesel engines for high fuel efficiency. Hybrid electric vehicles combine electric motors with gasoline or diesel engines for high fuel efficiency and low emissions. They operate on conventional fuel, providing power to the wheels and an electric generator simultaneously. Hybrids are expected to have seven production vehicles by early 2005, with major car companies planning to introduce hybrid models in the near future. While not considered AFVs for EPAct compliance, hybrids qualify for a Clean Fuel Vehicle Tax Deduction and have attracted congressional interest for larger incentives to promote their commercialization. Hydrogen fuel is abundant in water and can be separated through hydrolysis. It can be used in fuel cells for zero-emission vehicles, offering advantages over battery-powered electric vehicles. Major car manufacturers are researching hydrogen fuel cells, with some introducing limited hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for lease in 2004. Publicly available fuel cell vehicles may soon be operational. President Bush announced a $720 million research initiative for hydrogen fuel in his 2003 State of the Union Address. The Administration planned to dedicate $1.8 billion over five years for hydrogen and fuel cells, with Congress authorizing $2.15 billion for the initiatives. $257 million was requested for FY2004, with an approved increase of $50 million over FY2003 levels. For FY2005, Congress appropriated $261 million for hydrogen fuel initiatives, slightly below the Administration's request. Hydrogen fuel consumption is currently very low, with storage and delivery being complicated due to its low density. Various storage options have drawbacks including safety, cost, and range limitations. The cost of storing hydrogen fuel on vehicles is currently high, with fuel cell systems for passenger cars being 10 times more expensive than conventional engines. However, technological advances and mass production are expected to decrease the price in the future. The infrastructure for delivering hydrogen fuel is limited and expanding it will be complicated and expensive. The infrastructure for delivering hydrogen fuel is limited, with most facilities serving small demonstration fleets. Expanding hydrogen infrastructure will be expensive. The potential environmental performance of hydrogen fuel could exceed other alternative fuels, with fuel cells being more efficient than gasoline engines. Emissions from hydrogen fuel cells are only heat and water vapor, but the production process emissions could impact its environmental performance. Depending on the primary fuel used, total emissions could be low or even zero if produced from solar energy, but could equal or exceed those of gasoline and diesel vehicles if fossil fuels are used. The safety concerns of using hydrogen fuel include its low density in air, quick dissipation in open areas, transparent flame when burning, and high reactivity. Other concerns involve high-pressure or low-temperature onboard fuel storage, safety of hydrogen stations in populated areas, and training first responders. EPAct recognizes coal-derived fuels as alternative fuels, but they have seen little commercial use. EPAct recognizes coal-derived fuels as alternative fuels, but their commercial success has been limited due to high production costs and poor environmental performance. Ongoing research supported by the Department of Energy aims to reduce costs and improve environmental impact. Despite varying levels of success, LPG and natural gas fuels are widely used, while ethanol is mainly used as an additive in gasoline. Other alternative fuels like methanol and electricity have had less commercial success but may have a significant role in the future of transportation. The use of alternative fuels in transportation is influenced by economic factors, government policies, and fuel performance. These fuels offer energy security benefits and lower emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. However, consumer acceptance is hindered by performance and cost barriers. Without significant advancements in technology or higher petroleum prices, it is unlikely that alternative fuels will replace traditional fuels soon. Policy debates on American energy security have shifted towards alternative fuels, with proponents advocating for expanded tax credits. Expanding alternative fuel tax credits and incentives is debated for promoting air quality and energy security. Opponents argue against alternative fuel programs, citing concerns of \"corporate welfare\" and suggest efficiency improvements and conservation as cost-effective alternatives. The Bush Administration and bills in the 108th Congress support alternative fuels, with proposed tax credits for alternative fuel vehicles and electric vehicles. Some bills in the 108th Congress proposed expanding tax credits and incentives for alternative fuels, including per-gallon tax credits for retail sales and grants for schools and municipalities. The Energy Policy Act of 2003 included provisions for renewable fuel use and funding for hydrogen and fuel cell research. The Energy Policy Act of 2003 proposed funding for hydrogen and fuel cell research, a tax credit for fuel cell vehicles, and modifications to vehicle purchase credits. The bill was approved by the House but rejected in the Senate. Another key piece of alternative fuel legislation in the 108th Congress was the CLEAR ACT, which aimed to expand tax credits for alternative fuel vehicles and create new credits for hybrids. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, among other provisions, replaced certain tax credits. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357, H.R. 4520) replaced the tax exemption for ethanol-blended fuel with a tax credit and established a tax credit for biodiesel fuel production and sale."
