    "content": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 by 164 members to eliminate trade barriers and create nondiscriminatory rules. It builds on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to promote international economic cooperation and stability. Today, approximately 98% of world trade is governed by the WTO. The WTO governs the majority of world trade, with 98% of trade among its members. U.S. leadership in the WTO and future agenda are of interest to Congress, as 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries under WTO agreements. Congress plays a direct role in overseeing WTO agreements and U.S. FTAs build on core WTO agreements. The USTR represents the U.S. at the WTO, but Congress holds authority over foreign commerce and trade negotiating objectives. The WTO governs world trade, with U.S. leadership and future agenda of interest to Congress. Congress oversees WTO agreements and U.S. FTAs, with USTR representing the U.S. at the WTO. Congress holds authority over foreign commerce and trade negotiating objectives. The WTO's effectiveness in trade liberalization and dispute resolution is under scrutiny, especially in issues between developed and developing countries. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have become more prominent in international commerce since the establishment of the WTO in 1995. Global supply chains and technology advancements have transformed global commerce, leading to the failure of trade rules to keep up with the pace of change. As a result, countries have turned to negotiating FTAs outside the WTO to advance trade liberalization. Plurilateral negotiations involving subsets of WTO members are also gaining popularity for addressing newer global trade issues. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations, which began in 2001, concluded with no clear path forward after the 10th Ministerial conference in 2015, leaving multiple unresolved issues. Efforts to build on current WTO agreements outside of the Doha agenda continue after the 10th Ministerial conference in 2015. Concerns arise over the use of protectionist trade policies, recent U.S. tariff actions, and escalating trade disputes between major economies. The WTO faces challenges in resolving pending disputes involving the United States and debates about the role of its Appellate Body. U.S. officials have expressed doubt over the value of the WTO institution. U.S. officials have expressed doubt over the value of the WTO institution to the U.S. economy and questioned the benefit of leadership in the organization. The Trump Administration has shown skepticism towards multilateral trade deals, including those negotiated within the WTO, with President Trump stating concerns about fairness and sovereignty. There have been threats to withdraw the United States from the WTO amid ongoing disputes and debates about the organization's Appellate Body. The Trump Administration has threatened to withdraw the United States from the WTO and is withholding approval for judge appointments to the WTO Appellate Body. Questions remain about U.S. priorities for improving the system, with growing debate over the role and future direction of the WTO. Congress may need to consider the value of U.S. membership and leadership in the WTO, new negotiating objectives, oversight hearings for WTO reforms, and the impact of potential withdrawal on U.S. economic and foreign policy interests. Following World War II, nations led by the United States aimed to establish a more open trading system to boost global economic well-being. Negotiators sought to create an International Trade Organization (ITO) to address trade barriers and related issues like employment and investment. Following World War II, nations aimed to establish a more open trading system. Unable to secure approval for a comprehensive agreement, they reached a provisional agreement on tariffs and trade rules known as the GATT in 1948. The GATT governed international trade for 47 years until the establishment of the WTO. It was not a formal treaty or organization but an agreement between governments. The GATT aimed to promote trade liberalization. The GATT, established after World War II, aimed to promote trade liberalization by setting rules for international trade. Core principles included lowering tariffs on industrial goods and applying tariffs in a nondiscriminatory manner. Members, including the United States, committed to the most-favored nation principle, extending benefits equally. Exceptions allowed for preferential trade agreements and nonreciprocal preferences for developing countries. National treatment for imports from other members was also agreed upon. The GATT aimed to promote trade liberalization by setting rules for international trade, reducing tariffs on industrial products significantly. Despite its enforcement mechanism being viewed as ineffective, it led to a substantial decrease in trade barriers and a 14-fold increase in world trade over its 47-year history. The Uruguay Round establishing the WTO in 1994 involved 123 countries and nearly $3.7 trillion in trade, with the current WTO having 164 members and trade flows totaling $22.6 trillion as of 2018. The Tokyo Round in 1947 negotiated a 20% reciprocal tariff reduction on industrial products, leading to further cuts in subsequent rounds. It aimed to reform trade rules by addressing issues that could distort international trade, resulting in plurilateral codes dealing with nontariff issues. The Uruguay Round, lasting from 1986 to 1994, established the WTO with 164 members and trade flows totaling $22.6 trillion in 2018. The Uruguay Round, lasting from 1986 to 1994, was the most comprehensive GATT trade round, lowering tariffs and liberalizing trade in various sectors. It also established the WTO as an international organization with a stronger dispute settlement mechanism and new trade agreements. The WTO, established in 1995, succeeded the GATT as a permanent organization. It operates as a member-driven organization where decisions are made by consensus, with the Ministerial Conference being the highest-level body and the General Council overseeing day-to-day operations. The General Council oversees the day-to-day operations of the WTO, consisting of a representative from each member country. The WTO administers global rules to ensure smooth and free trade flow, with key principles of nondiscrimination and gradual reduction of trade barriers. The WTO agreements promote freer trade by reducing trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and nontariff measures. Reciprocity and transparency are key principles aimed at reducing barriers to trade and ensuring trust in the global trading system. The WTO agreements promote freer trade by reducing barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and nontariff measures. Transparency commitments are included in individual agreements to ensure accountability. Members must publish trade practices and policies, notify changes to WTO committees, and undergo regular trade policy reviews. The WTO's annual trade monitoring report assesses trade measures of all members. Trade liberalization can benefit economies but may require adjustments for workers and firms, especially in least-developed countries. Trade liberalization, especially for developing countries and those transitioning to market economies, can be challenging. WTO agreements allow countries to gradually reduce trade barriers, with developing countries often given longer transition periods. The WTO provides special and differential treatment for developing countries, including trade capacity-building measures and permission for nonreciprocal trade preference programs. Countries \"bind\" their commitments to open markets further, setting ceilings on tariff rates. The Uruguay Round increased trade under binding commitments, with bound tariff rates not always reflecting applied rates. The United States had a 3.4% average MFN tariff in 2017. Lowering developing countries' high bound tariffs in the Doha Round was a key issue for the US to achieve new market access. Promising not to raise trade barriers can have a significant economic impact. The WTO promotes certainty and predictability in trade by discouraging the raising of trade barriers. This principle was crucial during the 2009 global economic downturn, as countries refrained from protectionist measures. The organization also emphasizes fair and undistorted competition, ensuring transparent and nondistorted trade practices. The WTO aims to ensure fair competition in trade through rules on subsidies, antidumping, and trade remedies. It administers agreements on agriculture, services, intellectual property, and trade-related investment measures, broadening its scope beyond the GATT. The WTO provides a negotiating forum for members to reduce trade barriers and address complex issues beyond tariff measures. Recent accomplishments include agreements on basic telecommunications, financial services, information technology products, and government procurement. The Doha Development Agenda, launched in 2001, has seen limited progress to date. The Doha Round, launched in 2001, has made limited progress due to contentious issues like reducing subsidies and opening markets. Developed countries, led by the US and EU, clashed with developing countries like China, Brazil, and India. The failure to achieve objectives raised doubts about the WTO's effectiveness as a negotiating forum. The WTO has faced challenges in negotiations, with plurilateral agreements seen as a more flexible approach. Concerns exist about potential \"free riders\" benefiting without commitments, leading to isolation for non-participating countries. The WTO aims to enforce rules and settle trade disputes through a formalized and enforceable process, unlike the informal and ad hoc approach of the GATT. The United States pushed for a stronger dispute settlement mechanism during the Uruguay Round negotiations. Under the WTO, there are strict timetables for panel proceedings, and failure to implement a ruling carries consequences. Under the WTO, there are strict timetables for panel proceedings, the defending party cannot block rulings, and rulings are enforceable. WTO adjudicative bodies can authorize retaliation for non-compliance. Emphasis is placed on resolving disputes through consultations and negotiations. U.S. membership in the WTO is based on the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act covers approval, entry into force, and relationship to U.S. laws. It includes provisions on tariff negotiations, WTO oversight, dispute settlement procedures, and objectives for extended negotiations. Specific agreements addressed are Antidumping, Subsidies, Safeguards, Government Procurement, Technical Barriers to Trade, Agriculture, and Intellectual Property Rights. U.S. priorities and objectives for the GATT/WTO are reflected in the Act. The U.S. priorities and objectives for the GATT/WTO have been reflected in various trade promotion authority legislation since 1974. Legislation like the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed U.S. negotiators to negotiate disciplines on various areas resulting in WTO agreements in the Uruguay Round. The Trade Act of 2002 provided objectives for the Doha Round, including expanding commitments on e-commerce and clarifying the WTO dispute settlement system. The 2015 TPA focused on full implementation of existing agreements, enhanced compliance by members with WTO obligations, and new negotiations for extending commitments to new areas. Section 125(b) of the URAA sets procedures for congressional disapproval of WTO. The WTO core principles are enforced through trade agreements covering goods, agriculture, services, and intellectual property rights. Congress can vote every five years on withdrawal from the WTO, but resolutions in 2000 and 2005 did not pass. The GATT/WTO system has expanded rulemaking in international trade but lacks coverage in areas like multilateral investment rules and trade-related labor. The Marrakesh Agreement established the WTO as an international organization, covering multilateral investment rules, trade-related labor, and digital trade. It contains four annexes, with commitments in Annex 1 focusing on trade in goods through the GATT 1994. The GATT 1994, including GATT 1947, amendments, protocols, and decisions, is known as the GATT-acquis. It clarifies WTO principles and contains sector-specific rules. Members have binding commitments on tariffs and quotas. Negotiating rounds have led to trade liberalization. Recent rounds aimed to address barriers beyond tariffs, such as technical barriers to trade and sanitary measures. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) aims to protect a country's rights to implement regulations and standards without discriminating against trading partners. It includes rules on market access and disciplines on agricultural support programs. Developed countries committed to cutting tariffs by an average of 36%. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) includes rules on market access, tariff cuts, and restrictions on agricultural support programs. Tariffs were reduced by an average of 36% over six years for developing countries and 24% over 10 years for developed countries. Special safeguards were allowed for temporary import restrictions in certain situations. Domestic support programs were categorized and limited based on their trade-distorting potential, with the most distortive subsidies to be reduced over 6 to 10 years. Export subsidies were also capped and subject to gradual reductions. The Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) capped export subsidies and required incremental reductions in value and quantity of exports covered. A \"peace\" clause protected compliant subsidies from challenges under other WTO agreements, expiring in 2003. Members must submit regular notifications on AoA commitments, with concerns raised about inconsistent compliance. Limited progress has been made on agricultural trade reform under the Doha Round, but in 2015, an agreement was reached to fully eliminate export subsidies. The GATT framework did not address trade and investment linkages. During the Uruguay Round, the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) was drafted to address investment measures that may restrict trade, focusing on violations of GATT disciplines like nondiscrimination. TRIMS prohibits measures such as local content requirements and allows developing countries to temporarily suspend obligations in case of balance of payment difficulties. The TRIMS agreement addresses investment measures that restrict trade by prohibiting measures like local content requirements and allowing developing countries to temporarily suspend obligations during balance of payment difficulties. Efforts under the Doha Round to establish comprehensive multilateral rules on investment have been unsuccessful, leading to new discussions on developing a multilateral framework on investment facilitation. The GATS covers services and provides a multilateral framework for government policies affecting trade in services, serving as the foundation for rules in other trade agreements on services. The services trade agenda is complex due to the characteristics of the sector, with a growing range of economic activities involved. Advances in information technology and global supply chains have reduced barriers to trade in services, but liberalizing trade in services can be more complex than for goods due to \"behind the border\" barriers within importing countries. The GATS focuses on regulating service industries to protect consumers and ensure fair market access for foreign providers. It includes principles like MFN treatment and market access obligations, with commitments based on a positive list basis. WTO members classify services into four modes of delivery to measure trade in services. The GATS classifies services into four modes of delivery to measure trade and government measures affecting trade. WTO members aim to update GATS provisions and market access commitments, but negotiations have not yielded adequate offers of improved market access. In 2013, 23 WTO members, including the United States, initiated negotiations for a services-specific plurilateral agreement called the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). TiSA talks, led by Australia and the United States, have stalled, with the Trump Administration yet to take a formal position on the agreement. The TRIPS Agreement was the first to include intellectual property rights in multilateral trade rules. The TRIPS Agreement, negotiated as part of the Uruguay Round, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and enforcement. It covers patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and geographical indications, with provisions on nondiscrimination and enforcement measures. Disputes under TRIPS are subject to WTO dispute settlement. The agreement raised debates on the balance between protecting private rights and ensuring public benefits, especially in developing countries. The TRIPS Agreement, part of the Uruguay Round, sets minimum standards for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection. It includes flexibilities for developing countries and pharmaceutical patent obligations. The 2001 WTO \"Doha Declaration\" committed members to interpret TRIPS in a way that supports public health. In 2005, an amendment allowed developing and LDC members to import generic medicines under compulsory licensing. WTO agreements uphold MFN principles but allow exceptions to binding tariffs. The WTO agreements, including the ASCM and Antidumping Agreement, allow for trade remedies like duties or quotas to address unfair trade practices. These measures aim to protect domestic industries and workers from competition. However, some argue that these actions can lead to disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the global market. Trade remedies like antidumping and countervailing duty laws in the United States provide relief to domestic industries facing adverse impacts from imported goods sold at unfair prices or subsidized by foreign governments. These actions, while conforming to WTO rules, can lead to disputes and inefficiencies in the global trading system. The Trade Act of 1974 provides relief to domestic industries facing import surges through temporary import duties and quotas, requiring presidential action for implementation. The WTO dispute settlement system is a key success of the multilateral trading system, with binding and nonbinding provisions in WTO agreements. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides a means for resolving disputes among members regarding binding provisions. The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) oversees panels composed of panelists chosen from a roster maintained by the Secretariat. Members must attempt to settle disputes through consultations before seeking resolution through the DSU. The WTO DSU allows members to settle disputes through consultations, with the option to request a panel if consultations fail. The panel recommends a decision to the DSB, which can be blocked by parties agreeing. Disputes should be resolved within a year, but often take longer. The AB reviews panel reports for legal questions only. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) allows members to settle disputes through consultations and panels. The Appellate Body (AB) makes recommendations, but timely resolutions are rare. The DSB oversees implementation of findings, with losing parties required to propose compliance within a reasonable period. Disputes over implementation may be judged by a panel formed by the DSB. The United States has raised concerns about AB practices and blocked judge appointments. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding allows members to resolve disputes through panels. If a party refuses to comply, negotiations over compensation occur. The DSB may authorize retaliation if no agreement is reached. Calls for reform aim to address procedural delays and case complexity. Filing a dispute publicly signals the need to address issues. Dispute settlement procedures deter non-compliance with WTO agreements and build case law for new regulatory regimes. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding allows members to resolve disputes through panels. If a party refuses to comply, negotiations over compensation occur. The DSB may authorize retaliation if no agreement is reached. Calls for reform aim to address procedural delays and case complexity. Filing a dispute publicly signals the need to address issues. Dispute settlement procedures deter non-compliance with WTO agreements and build case law for new regulatory regimes. The WTO has initiated nearly 580 disputes on behalf of its members and issued more than 350 rulings. If a case is brought against the United States and the panel renders an adverse decision, the United States would be expected to remove the offending measure within a reasonable period of time or face the possibility of either paying compensation to the complaining member or becoming subject to sanctions. The WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding allows members to resolve disputes through panels. The United States is an active user of the DS system, initiating 123 disputes since 1995. The US largely prevailed on \"core issues\" in 46 complaints. China and the EU are the main targets of US complaints. In 2015, the United States prevailed on \"core issues\" in 46 complaints and lost in 4. Additional cases ruled in favor of the US include disputes over India's solar energy policies and Indonesia's import licensing requirements. The US has been a respondent in 153 dispute cases since 1995, with the most disputes filed against it by the EU, followed by China. Many complaints involve U.S. trade remedies, particularly antidumping duties on imports. The United States has won on \"core issues\" in 17 cases and lost in 57 cases through 2015 in disputes over antidumping duties on U.S. imports. The WTO has ruled against the U.S. in complaints initiated by South Korea, China, Canada, and Turkey. Retaliation has been authorized in just a few cases, with South Korea being allowed to retaliate in a complaint over U.S. methodology for calculating antidumping duties on South Korean imports of large residential washers in February 2019. Several pending WTO disputes involving China's complaints are significant to the United States. Pending WTO disputes involving China's complaints over U.S. and EU market economy status, as well as challenges to Trump Administration's tariff measures under U.S. trade laws, are significant to the United States. Nine WTO members, including China, the EU, Canada, and Mexico, have initiated complaints against U.S. Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, leading to unsuccessful consultations and the establishment of panels in all nine cases. The United States is facing WTO disputes over its tariff measures, with other countries challenging the tariffs imposed by the US. The US has filed complaints against retaliatory tariffs from five countries and has invoked the national security exception in defense of its actions. All disputes have entered the panel phase by January 2019. Trade policy reviews are conducted by the Trade Policy Review Body to report on the trade policies of the membership. The Trade Policy Review Body conducts periodic reviews of trade policies of member countries to increase transparency and assess the impact on the trading system. The reviews allow for questioning of practices and may prevent future disputes. China's most recent review in July 2018 commended market access initiatives but raised concerns about the role of state-owned enterprises. China's trade policies have been under scrutiny, with concerns raised about the role of state-owned enterprises and support policies like the Made in China 2025 plan. WTO agreements can be multilateral or plurilateral, with the latter focusing on specific sectors and involving a subset of members. Plurilateral agreements must extend benefits to all WTO members on a nondiscriminatory basis. Plurilateral agreements in the WTO involve a negotiating group representing a critical mass of world trade in a specific product or sector to prevent free riders. There are two types of plurilateral agreements: unconditional MFN, like the Information Technology Agreement, and conditional-MFN, where benefits are not extended to all WTO members. Plurilateral agreements in the WTO, also known as the \"club\" approach, allow willing members to address policy issues not covered by WTO disciplines. These agreements require a waiver from the entire WTO membership to start negotiations. Some countries are hesitant to allow others to negotiate for fear of being excluded, leading to more ambitious members taking negotiations outside the WTO. An example is the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) with limited WTO membership. The GPA, with 47 WTO members including the EU and US, provides market access for nondefense government projects to contractors. Each member specifies entities and goods open to foreign firms. Negotiations to expand the GPA concluded in 2012, with China and other countries in talks to join. South Korea, Moldova, and Ukraine joined in 2016. The GPA, with 47 WTO members including the EU and US, provides market access for nondefense government projects to contractors. South Korea, Moldova, and Ukraine joined in 2016. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that a significant portion of global government expenditures is covered by the GPA or similar commitments in U.S. FTAs. The Information Technology Agreement (ITA) provides tariff-free treatment for covered IT products on an unconditional MFN basis, benefiting all WTO members. In 2015, an expanded agreement was negotiated to cover an additional 201 products and technologies valued at over $1 trillion. The Information Technology Agreement (ITA) covers 201 products and technologies valued at over $1 trillion in global exports. Tariffs are set to be reduced by 2019, with the United States and China already initiating cuts. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) aims to streamline customs processes and reduce trade costs for exporters and importers. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) aims to streamline customs processes and reduce trade costs for exporters and importers. It includes provisions for mandatory articles such as publishing information online, issuing advance rulings, and providing appeals or reviews. Special and differential treatment provisions are included for developing country and LDC members, allowing them more time and assistance to implement the agreement. Members determine their own implementation schedules, with progress linked to technical and financial capacity. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) requires donor members to provide capacity building and support for implementation. Institutional arrangements are set for administering the TFA, with WTO rules allowing for exceptions like protecting human, animal, or plant life. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) mandates capacity building and support for implementation by donor members. WTO rules allow exceptions for protecting human, animal, or plant life, or conserving natural resources, without unjustifiable discrimination or disguised trade restrictions. GATT Article XXI permits actions for essential national security interests related to fissionable materials, arms traffic, and wartime emergencies. Similar exceptions exist for trade in services and intellectual property rights. The \"enabling clause\" of the GATT allows developed countries to grant differential and more favorable treatment to developing countries. Exceptions for regional trade agreements (RTAs) permit WTO countries to depart from the MFN principle under certain conditions. The WTO allows for regional trade agreements (RTAs) under certain conditions. GATT Article XXIV applies to goods trade, GATS Article V applies to services trade, and the \"enabling clause\" allows for RTAs among developing countries in goods trade. These agreements must meet specific criteria to ensure they do not raise barriers to trade with third parties. Joining the WTO involves taking on commitments and obligations of multilateral agreements, motivating governments to expand access to foreign markets, spur domestic economic reforms, transition to market economies, and promote the rule of law. Accession process includes documenting trade regime and negotiating market access requirements. For example, Kazakhstan joined after a 20-year process, and Afghanistan became the 164th member after nearly 12 years of negotiations. Iran became the 164th WTO member on July 29, 2016, after 12 years of negotiations. The United States is unlikely to support Iran's accession due to lack of bilateral negotiations. Any single member can block a new member's accession. Prospective members must meet market access conditions through bilateral negotiations. The United States has played a key role in the accession process for countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia. China formally joined the WTO in December 2001, becoming a major player in the global economy. Its accession was a key U.S. trade objective, leading to economic reforms and making China a significant market for U.S. exporters. Despite this, China has not fully transitioned to a market economy and government intervention remains prevalent. China's accession to the WTO in 2001 led to economic reforms, but debate continues over the role of the WTO in the market economy. Negotiations for China's entry took over 15 years, with the U.S. pushing for significant reductions in trade barriers. China was required to make immediate reductions while maintaining protection for sensitive sectors. After joining the WTO, China implemented economic reforms to transition towards a market economy and increase trade openness. By 2006, concerns arose over China's more restrictive trade regime and state intervention, including industrial policies promoting indigenous innovation through forced technology transfer and IP theft. Stakeholders criticized China's mixed record in fulfilling WTO obligations, leading to dispute settlement procedures. China has been involved in numerous WTO disputes, with the United States bringing 23 cases against China on issues like IPR protection and subsidies. Despite some contested issues, China has mostly complied with WTO rulings. China has also filed 15 cases against the United States. The Trump Administration questions if WTO rules are sufficient to address China's economic challenges. USTR Robert Lighthizer has expressed concerns about China's coordinated efforts to develop its economy. The USTR views China's coordinated efforts to develop its economy, subsidize, create national champions, force technology transfer, and distort markets as a threat to the world trading system. The World Trade Organization is seen as ill-equipped to address this issue, with limited effectiveness in resolving concerns over Chinese trade practices. The USTR's latest report to Congress on China's WTO compliance highlights the inadequacy of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism in dealing with a trade regime that conflicts with the fundamental principles of the WTO system. China's harmful policies and practices, not disciplined by WTO rules, raise concerns about its claim as a developing country at the WTO. Despite being the world's second-largest economy, China asserts its developing country status based on low GDP per capita. This status grants certain rights under special and differential treatment provisions in WTO agreements. Despite being the world's second-largest economy, China claims developing country status at the WTO due to low GDP per capita. The Trump Administration has used unilateral mechanisms like Section 301 to address Chinese trade practices, leading to tariffs being imposed. The United States' actions have raised concerns about violating WTO obligations. The United States has taken action against China's trade practices through Section 301 and WTO disputes. Efforts have been made to cooperate with other countries on issues like industrial subsidies and SOEs. China is believed to be the target of these coordinated efforts. The United States has taken action against China's trade practices through Section 301 and WTO disputes, cooperating with other countries on issues like industrial subsidies and SOEs. Recent talks have focused on proposing stronger rules on industrial subsidies and addressing technology transfer concerns, with plans to draft a text by spring 2019. Some experts are concerned that U.S. tariff actions may hinder further coordination on these challenges. Another pending dispute with China could impact its treatment as a \"nonmarket economy\" under WTO rules. China has urged WTO members to stop using alternative methodologies for assessing prices on products subject to antidumping measures by December 11, 2016. The US has classified China as a nonmarket economy (NME) for trade remedy cases since 1981, resulting in higher antidumping margins on Chinese exports. The US and EU argue that the WTO language is vague and did not automatically obligate them to extend market. China requested consultations under WTO dispute settlement with the United States and EU over the failure to grant China market economy status. Panels were established in both cases, with the US supporting the EU. The WTO Ministerial Conference in 2017 aimed to make progress on multilateral trade agreements after the Doha Round. The WTO Ministerial Conference in 2017 aimed to make progress on multilateral trade agreements after the Doha Round. Members have made some progress in recent years, but remain sharply divided over unresolved and new issues on the agenda. WTO Director-General Azev\u00eado tempered expectations for major outcomes, citing significant divergences among members on substantial issues. Differences were evident in the inability to reach consensus on a draft Ministerial Declaration, primarily due to disagreements over the Doha Round mandate. The 11th WTO Ministerial Conference did not result in major breakthroughs. Members focused on ongoing talks and defining priority work areas, including reducing fisheries subsidies and addressing food security. The U.S. proposal for improved transparency did not receive enough support. Members committed to intensifying fisheries subsidies negotiations for a potential agreement at the next Ministerial. The 11th WTO Ministerial did not yield significant outcomes. Efforts are being made to adopt an agreement by the next Ministerial, with the US supporting these negotiations. Statements were issued by 60 members in favor of advancing multilateral talks on services regulations. Subsets of WTO members are committed to new work programs for potential plurilateral agreements in E-commerce, Investment facilitation, and MSMEs. The lack of concrete multilateral outcomes at the 11th Ministerial highlighted resistance to a new agenda. The 11th WTO Ministerial did not yield significant outcomes, highlighting resistance to a new agenda. EU Trade Commissioner Malmstr\u00f6m criticized the lack of progress, blaming it on procedural excuses and hostage-taking tactics. Developing countries like India blocked progress on various issues, demanding more focus on Doha issues. This difficulty in consensus among all 164 members hinders future negotiations. The United States showed limited leadership in the WTO Ministerial discussions, focusing on advocating for U.S. economic interests and supporting WTO institutional reform. USTR Lighthizer acknowledged the WTO's importance while expressing criticisms. The U.S. viewed the Ministerial outcome positively as a breakthrough, allowing like-minded countries to pursue new work in areas like e-commerce and fisheries subsidies. At the 11th WTO Ministerial meeting, countries committed to progress on fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, but talks on agriculture and environmental goods remain stalled. Multilateral solutions are seen as ideal for disciplines on agricultural subsidies, despite unresolved issues from the Doha Round. The 2015 Nairobi Ministerial agreed to eliminate export subsidies for agriculture, but public stockholding remains a challenging issue. Public stockholding, or food security programs, is a contentious issue at the WTO. Developing countries like India are pushing for resolution before new topics are addressed. The United States is concerned about transparency and compliance with subsidy notifications. Compliance with reporting requirements has been poor, with some countries significantly behind. Compliance with reporting requirements at the WTO has been lax, leading to concerns about transparency and compliance with subsidy notifications. The United States and other countries have issued new proposals to address issues such as high tariffs, trade distorting support, and non-tariff barriers. WTO members are negotiating disciplines related to fisheries subsidies with the goal of reaching an agreement by 2020 to target illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing. The United States and other WTO members are negotiating disciplines to target illegal fishing through Goal 14. Discussions include exemptions like fuel subsidies, with the US aiming to minimize exclusions. The Trump Administration supports stronger disciplines and transparency in fisheries subsidies. Digital trade has become significant in world trade, enabling services and goods trade through digital data flows. The WTO Work Program on Electronic Commerce, established in 1998, aims to address trade-related issues for e-commerce. Progress has stalled due to competing views on possible paths forward, with some developing countries questioning the moratorium on e-commerce customs duties. Various members submitted proposals for specific work agendas in e-commerce before the 2017 Ministerial meeting. The U.S. and Chinese WTO submissions focus on e-commerce, with the U.S. proposal aligning with the TPP-11 agreement. India prefers to focus on original Doha mandate issues like agriculture. The 2017 Ministerial ended with a commitment to revitalize e-commerce work. The U.S. and Chinese WTO submissions on e-commerce align with the TPP-11 agreement. The U.S. proposal includes provisions on data flows, source code, encryption, and cybersecurity. The group of 49 WTO members launched the e-commerce initiative in January 2019. In January 2019, a group of countries, including the United States, EU, China, and Brazil, agreed to start negotiations for a trade agreement with high standards. The negotiations are set to begin in March 2019, focusing on addressing trade barriers. The USTR emphasized the need for an enforceable agreement with equal obligations for all participants. Some countries saw this as a missed opportunity to revive previous plurilateral negotiations. The EGA plurilateral negotiations, initiated in mid-2014 by 14 WTO members, aim to liberalize trade in environmental goods through tariff reduction. Despite 18 rounds of talks, the agreement was not concluded in December 2016 due to disagreements, particularly with China. The future of the EGA remains uncertain, with some countries supporting a resumption of talks while the Trump Administration has not taken a public stance. The Trump Administration has not publicly stated its position on resuming talks for the agreement. WTO members have unresolved issues from the Doha Round, hindering progress. Divisions persist on trade liberalization and incorporating new issues like digital trade and global supply chains, raising concerns about the WTO's relevance in the modern economy. The viability of the \"single undertaking\" in future multilateral negotiations at the WTO is in question due to divisions on trade and environment issues. Some countries, like India, have blocked discussion of new issues, slowing progress. As a result, countries are turning to plurilateral agreements and regional trade agreements outside the WTO to advance trade liberalization. Plurilaterals have the potential to revive the WTO's relevance but may also undermine multilateralism if not extended to all members on an MFN basis. The impact of regional trade agreements on the WTO's global trade status is debated, especially regarding U.S. leadership under the Trump Administration. Concerns are rising over trade protectionist policies, U.S. tariff actions, and escalating trade disputes between major economies. Questions arise about the WTO's ability to handle challenges from emerging markets and trade tensions, with some experts warning of a potential crisis. Some WTO members are exploring areas for reform, such as the EU and Canada. The United States advocates for sectoral or plurilateral agreements as a way forward for the institution. Negotiators can achieve trade liberalizing objectives more easily through coalitions, as seen in the ITA. Sectoral agreements can help pursue new agreements and extend WTO disciplines in areas like digital trade and SOEs. Commitments to talks in e-commerce, investment facilitation, and SMEs could lead to future plurilateral negotiations. Plurilateral negotiations involve resolving divisions among developed and developing countries. Participation of developing economies like China and India is crucial for global trade agreements. Concerns exist about nonparticipating countries facing trade restrictions. Flexibility in implementation timeframes and assistance can attract more participants, as seen in the TFA. The Trump Administration's position on plurilateral trade agreements like EGA and TiSA is unclear, but new efforts on e-commerce/digital trade are being supported. Many countries have formed bilateral or regional FTAs outside the WTO, leading to an increase in the number of RTAs since 1990. FTAs offer negotiating flexibility for countries to promote trade liberalization. FTAs offer negotiating flexibility for countries to advance trade liberalization and rulemaking. The United States has 14 FTAs in force with 20 countries and prefers bilateral FTAs over multiparty agreements. Recent negotiations include the USMCA with Mexico and Canada, modifications to the US-South Korea FTA, and plans to begin trade talks with the EU, Japan, and the UK. The United States has 14 FTAs in force with 20 countries, preferring bilateral agreements. Recent negotiations include the USMCA, modifications to the US-South Korea FTA, and plans to begin trade talks with the EU, Japan, and the UK. U.S. FTAs are \"WTO-plus,\" eliminating most tariff and nontariff barriers and covering areas not addressed by the WTO. Despite this, the majority of U.S. trade relies on WTO agreements. In 2017, the U.S. traded $3.4 trillion with non-FTA partners and $1.8 trillion with FTA partners. Mega-regional trade agreements, like the CPTPP, are also being pursued. Mega-regional trade agreements, such as the CPTPP, RCEP, and T-TIP, aim to consolidate trade rules across regions and address new issues not covered by the WTO. Debate surrounds the impact of preferential FTAs on the multilateral trading system, with concerns about potential undermining and competition. Some view mega-regionals as potentially undermining the trading system, creating competing blocs, and marginalizing non-participating countries. However, others see them as a way to spur global momentum. WTO DG Azev\u00eado supports regional trade agreements as building blocks for global rules. Plurilateral agreements could bring new rules into the multilateral system, despite concerns about trade diversion and fragmented blocs. Some believe RTAs may be the only way to liberalize trade in the future. Since the founding of the WTO, global trade has evolved significantly with the rise of the commercial internet, supply chains, and trade in services. Despite limited modernization of WTO disciplines since 1995, efforts are ongoing to negotiate new trade liberalization in areas like e-commerce. Future negotiations within the WTO or plurilaterals could focus on services, competition with SOEs, investment, and labor and environment issues to enhance the organization's relevance as a negotiating body. The WTO's relevance as a negotiating body could be enhanced by focusing on labor and environment issues. Global trade in services has expanded significantly since the GATS, driven by IT advancements and global supply chains. However, the GATS has not fully captured these developments. Services negotiations under the Doha Round aimed at further liberalization but faced challenges from developing countries resisting market opening and dissatisfaction with the overall agreement. The stalled plurilateral TiSA negotiations also reflect these challenges. The WTO's relevance could be enhanced by focusing on labor and environment issues. Global trade in services has expanded significantly since the GATS, driven by IT advancements and global supply chains. The stalled TiSA talks raise questions about services reform in the WTO. Future negotiations could include transitioning to a negative list schedule of commitments and addressing new services sectors like online education and telemedicine. The issue of \"servicification\" of traditional goods industries may also be a topic for future negotiations. The WTO is considering negotiations on traditional goods industries and services facilitation. There is a need to regulate state-owned enterprises engaged in international commerce. The focus is on disciplines for designated monopolies and state trading enterprises. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are subject to regulations under GATT Article XVII, requiring them to adhere to nondiscrimination commitments and operate based on commercial considerations. Transparency obligations include reporting on the purpose, products covered, functions, and statistical information of SOEs. Free trade agreements like the TPP and USMCA have specific chapters addressing SOEs, with commitments to commercial considerations, nondiscriminatory treatment, and restrictions on noncommercial assistance. The SOE chapter in USMCA aims to regulate state support provided to SOEs, including subsidies, to prevent market-distorting behavior. The WTO ASCM covers specified subsidies granted to SOEs, with concerns raised by the United States and EU about the narrow interpretation of what qualifies as a public body. Multilateralizing these disciplines may face objections from members engaged in such practices. The United States, EU, and Japan are discussing strengthening rules on industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to address market-distorting behavior and harmful subsidy practices. They aim to maintain the effectiveness of existing WTO disciplines and negotiate more effective subsidy rules in the near future. Plans were made to finalize a proposed text on industrial subsidies by spring 2019. Rules and disciplines for international investment are not part of the WTO, with more extensive protection for investors proposed in the past but dropped due to opposition from developing countries. The OECD and multilateral attempts to negotiate investment disciplines have not been successful. Countries have instead agreed to investment protections in bilateral investment treaties and FTAs. The U.S. \"model BIT\" is often used as a basis for these agreements, especially between developed and developing countries. Developed countries are starting to diverge on the inclusion of investment provisions. Developed countries are diverging on the use of investor-state dispute settlement provisions. Incorporating investment issues more fully in the WTO could help resolve disputes between ISDS and an investment court. Developing countries may be more open to negotiating investment disciplines multilaterally. Some WTO members are pursuing multilateral development. Some WTO members are developing a multilateral framework on investment facilitation, including the EU, Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, and Russia. Labor and environmental provisions were not included in the Uruguay Round agreements, creating gaps in global trade rules. U.S. FTAs outside the WTO require adherence to labor and environmental principles. The CPTPP and proposed USMCA also address these issues. The CPTPP and proposed USMCA include provisions on fisheries subsidies, illegal trafficking, marine species, air quality, marine litter, and sustainable forestry. While labor and environmental provisions in FTAs have expanded, their scope and depth vary, with some subject to dispute settlement mechanisms. The WTO is working on disciplining fisheries subsidies, which could benefit the environment. Observers suggest the WTO needs reforms to maintain its foundational role. The WTO is in need of reforms to maintain its role as the foundation of the world trading system. Reforms are focused on institutional and negotiation reform, as well as changes to the dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body. Addressing concerns related to the dispute settlement system may take priority in the near term. Certain WTO members are exploring reform proposals to modernize the WTO and address challenges in the global economy. The United States, EU, and Japan have issued papers on strengthening WTO disciplines, while Canada organized a ministerial with like-minded countries interested in WTO reform. A group of 13 countries, including Norway, Singapore, South Korea, and Switzerland, met in Ottawa to discuss WTO reform proposals. They emphasized the need to address issues with the dispute settlement system, negotiating function, and trade policy transparency. The group aims to make significant progress before the G20 meetings in June 2019. The group of 13 countries, including Norway, Singapore, South Korea, and Switzerland, met in Ottawa to discuss WTO reform proposals and emphasized the need to address issues with the dispute settlement system, negotiating function, and trade policy transparency. Consensus decision-making is a core practice at the WTO, with voting authorized for certain activities on a one member-one vote basis. While voting is possible for some matters, consensus decision-making remains the norm to ensure actions are in the self-interest of all members. Consensus decision-making at the WTO ensures actions are in the self-interest of all members, but it has led to deadlock in negotiations. Some experts suggest alternatives like using voting procedures, a weighted voting system, or an executive committee to expedite decision-making. The \"single undertaking\" method at the WTO allows for negotiation on all issues until everything is agreed upon, preventing smaller countries from being dominated by larger economies and ensuring mutual benefits for all members. The WTO's \"single undertaking\" method aims to ensure mutual benefits for all members but has led to challenges in negotiations, such as the stalled Doha Round. Some members advocate for \"flexible multilateralism\" and monitoring compliance with agreements is a key task for the WTO. Compliance with WTO notification requirements, especially regarding government subsidy programs, is a significant concern among members like the United States. Late or non-existent submissions hinder the examination of trading partners' policies. The US and EU have proposed incentives or sanctions for noncompliance, including naming and shaming offending members and limiting their access to WTO resources. The EU and US have proposed penalties for noncompliance with WTO notification requirements, including naming and shaming, limiting access to resources, and encouraging counternotifications. In November 2018, a joint proposal was put forward by the US, EU, Japan, Argentina, and Costa Rica, which includes penalties for noncompliance and exemptions for developing countries lacking capacity. The WTO specifies exemptions for developing countries lacking capacity to fulfill notification obligations. Some countries maintain developing-country status even as their economies resemble developed countries. Developing country status allows for special treatment in existing obligations and negotiations. The WTO allows members to self-designate their development status for special treatment, which has caused frustration among developed countries like the EU and US. The US warned in January 2019 that this practice could make the WTO irrelevant, as countries like Singapore, South Korea, and China claim developing country status to avoid obligations and hinder negotiations. Several suggestions have been made to address the situation of countries claiming exemptions from trade rules, including encouraging graduation from developing country status, setting quantifiable criteria for development status, targeting special and differential treatment (SDT) on a needs-driven basis, and requiring full eventual implementation of new agreements. The dispute settlement mechanism (DSM) in the WTO is seen as essential for maintaining the institution's relevance, but is facing pressure for reform, particularly from the US. USTR Lighthizer criticizes the WTO for being too focused on litigation. The WTO is criticized for being litigation-centered and losing focus on negotiations. Concerns have been raised about procedural delays and compliance in the dispute settlement system, with calls for reform to make it fairer and more efficient. Negotiations to reform the system have been ongoing since the Doha Round, focusing on issues like third-party rights and panel composition. The US has proposed greater control, guidelines for adjudicative bodies, and more transparency in the process. Negotiations to reform the WTO dispute settlement system have not yielded results yet. Experts suggest changes like improving oversight, narrowing the scope of sensitive issues, and giving members more input. The immediate issue is the US's refusal to appoint new AB jurists due to objections over interpretations of trade laws. The Trump Administration blocked the process to appoint new Appellate Body (AB) jurists in 2017 and 2018, leaving only three remaining to hear all cases. Concerns are rising that the AB could come to a halt in 2019, leading to potential trade disputes escalating into trade wars. The United States has highlighted perceived shortcomings in the dispute settlement system in its trade policy agenda. The United States has raised concerns about the dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body (AB), not applying WTO agreements as written. The main controversy revolves around the AB's autonomy, deference to the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), and implementation of DSU provisions. While the US has been vocal in its criticisms, other WTO members share similar concerns. Specific reform proposals have been submitted by groups like G-12 and G-3 to address the impasse. The G-3 submission includes proposals criticized by the United States for deviating from WTO DS rules. Ambassador Shea proposed a deeper discussion on the Appellate Body's departures from agreed rules. The G-3 proposals were also criticized for reducing the Appellate Body's accountability. These proposals, along with others, aim to address concerns about the dispute settlement system. The G-12 and G-3 submissions propose amendments to the DSU to address concerns about the Appellate Body's operations. The G-12 submission suggests allowing parties to extend appeal deadlines with AB approval, while the G-3 submission proposes increasing the number of AB jurists for efficiency and diversity. The United States opposes unilateral extension of jurists' terms by the AB. The AB does not have the authority to unilaterally extend jurists' terms, as it lies with the DSB. Proposals include allowing outgoing AB jurists to finish pending appeals and serving until replaced, or refraining from assigning cases to jurists close to their exits. The US blocked a South Korean jurist's reappointment in 2016. The United States blocked the reappointment of a South Korean jurist to the AB in May 2016, citing concerns about \"abstract discussions\" in prior decisions. There are calls for a more formal process for reappointment, with proposals to amend the DSU to limit AB members to one term of 6-8 years. Criticisms of the AB include questions about its interpretation of WTO agreements, with the US advocating for a more restrictive view based on Article 3.2. The scope and reach of the AB's activities is a controversy for the organization, with concerns about \"judicial overreach\" and issuing advisory opinions beyond the case at hand. USTR argues that the AB should not interpret text, as that authority rests with the Ministerial Conference or General Council. The G-12 proposes amendments to address these issues. The G-12 proposes amending the DSU to require the AB to address all issues in a dispute necessary for resolution. Suggestions include remanding issues to WTO committees for negotiation and seeking authoritative interpretations through a three-fourths vote. The United States criticizes the AB for not giving due deference to initial panel findings on facts and domestic law. The G-12 submission proposes amending the DSU to clarify that a country's domestic laws are considered as fact and not reviewable by the AB. USTR argues against treating AB decisions as precedent, emphasizing the importance of WTO agreements negotiated by members. Some WTO members are concerned about \"gap-filling\" by the DS system when legal precedent is unclear. The G-12 submission proposes amending the DSU to establish a yearly meeting between the AB and the DSB for WTO members to comment on rulings made during the year, addressing concerns about \"gap-filling\" by the DS system when legal precedent is unclear. The issue of the legitimacy of precedence or gap-filling remains a contentious issue with few proposed solutions. The G-12 submission suggests amending the DSU to allow for yearly meetings between the AB and the DSB for WTO members to comment on rulings. Proposed reforms may require clarification or amendment to the Marrakesh Agreement or the DSU, which can be done through interpretation by the Ministerial Conference, General Council, or Dispute Settlement Body with a three-fourths vote. Amending decision-making provisions would require consensus at the Ministerial Conference or a two-thirds vote for amendments to the Marrakesh Agreement. The United States has been a leader in shaping GATT/WTO negotiations and rulemaking, advocating for expanding negotiations to include services and IPR. Many stakeholders in the U.S. rely on WTO rules to open markets for goods and services. The Trump Administration has expressed doubt over the WTO. The Trump Administration has expressed skepticism towards the WTO and multilateral trade agreements, preferring bilateral negotiations to address unfair trading practices. There have been reports of President Trump considering withdrawing the United States from the WTO, with the administration stating that reform of the multilateral trading system is a trade policy objective. The Trump Administration's skepticism towards the WTO has raised questions about the future of U.S. leadership in the organization. While a U.S. withdrawal from the WTO is seen as unlikely due to procedural and practical reasons, it could have economic consequences such as losing MFN status and facing trade restrictions. The Trump Administration's skepticism towards the WTO has raised questions about the future of U.S. leadership in the organization. U.S. withdrawal could lead to disadvantages for American businesses in other markets, erode the principle of nondiscrimination, and reduce U.S. influence in global trade matters. Exiting the WTO could also impact international trade relationships and cooperation on foreign policy issues. The future of U.S. leadership in the WTO is uncertain, with questions arising about the organization's viability without U.S. involvement. Other countries like the EU and China are stepping up as leaders in the global trading system. Recent high-level meetings have highlighted the importance of cooperation on WTO reform. Congressional oversight could assess the economic and political value of U.S. membership in the WTO. The value of the WTO and potential impact of withdrawal on U.S. businesses, consumers, federal agencies, laws, and foreign policy are under investigation. Congress may vote on resolutions expressing support for the WTO or disapproval of U.S. membership. The GATT and WTO were established to maintain a rules-based trading system to prevent a return to nationalistic trade policies. Upholding WTO rules has costs and benefits for the U.S. and other countries, promoting international competition and market access for companies. Certain actions by the Trump Administration and other countries have raised questions about respect for the rules-based trading system, potentially weakening the credibility of the WTO. Recent U.S. actions to raise tariffs and obstruct the dispute settlement system have prompted concerns that the institution's effectiveness and credibility may be undermined. The ongoing dispute cases at the WTO, initiated by several countries over U.S. tariffs, could impact the credibility of the global trading system. U.S. actions are seen as protectionist and may encourage other countries to do the same, weakening respect for the rules. This could hinder U.S. efforts to use the WTO for enforcement purposes. China's industrial state policies, including IPR violations and forced technology transfer practices, damage the credibility of the multilateral trading system based on respect for consensus-based rules. The perceived inability of the WTO to address certain Chinese policies led to the United States resorting to Section 301 actions. Other countries' pursuit of industrial policy or discriminatory measures in the name of national or economic security questions the viability of the WTO rules-based system. USTR under the Trump Administration emphasizes \"preserving national sovereignty\" in the U.S. trade policy agenda. The URAA withdrawal procedures addressed concerns about WTO infringing on U.S. sovereignty. Congress debated creating extra review mechanisms for WTO dispute settlement, emphasizing only Congress can change U.S. laws. Trump Administration uses unilateral action to defend U.S. interests, including national security, outside the WTO. Disagreements at the WTO on national security issues may be challenging to resolve through existing dispute settlement procedures. Disagreements over national sovereignty and the WTO AB make resolving disputes challenging. Article XXI of the GATT allows members to protect security interests, but its scope is unclear. The U.S. and other parties argue for sole judgment on security matters, creating uncertainty on how a WTO panel would evaluate such disputes. The broadened membership of the WTO has integrated emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The inability of WTO members to reach compromise is attributed to differing priorities among developed and emerging countries. The question arises whether countries like China will take on a greater leadership role in advancing the global trade agenda and facilitating compromise. China has expressed support for the multilateral trading system and globalization but has hindered progress in certain initiatives like the WTO plurilateral Environmental Goods Agreement. Analysts argue that China follows WTO rules but favors domestic industries with its industrial policies. Some analysts argue that China follows WTO rules but favors domestic industries, raising concerns about its willingness to take on more leadership responsibility in the WTO. The United States and other members are also concerned about the use of developing country status by large emerging markets to ensure flexibility in future liberalization commitments. Suggestions include setting specific criteria to clarify developing country qualification and offering incentives for countries to graduate from developing status. The Administration has included reform of the multilateral trading system in its trade policy objectives. The U.S. Administration has included reform of the multilateral trading system in its trade policy objectives for 2018. Congress may hold oversight hearings to inquire about specific plans for WTO reforms, updating agreements to address trade barriers, and increasing U.S. engagement in reform negotiations. They could consider endorsing trilateral negotiations with the EU and Japan to address nonmarket practices, reviewing reports on potential areas for greater trade integration, and establishing new negotiating objectives for multilateral trade. Congress may consider establishing specific or enhanced new negotiating objectives for multilateral trade agreement negotiations, including addressing digital trade. Concerns exist that recent U.S. tariff actions may hinder future negotiations and the proliferation of preferential FTAs could have discriminatory effects. The future outlook of the multilateral trading system is a subject of growing debate. The future outlook of the multilateral trading system is debated due to serious challenges, with some experts seeing potential crisis while others remain optimistic for reforms. There is a consensus that the current state is unsustainable, urging improvements and compromises for the WTO to remain relevant. Recent proposals for reforms and new rules have sparked new ideas, but concrete solutions are yet to be agreed upon. Several upcoming events could drive progress in resolving differences within the WTO. The dispute settlement system may face challenges if new appointments are not approved by late 2019. The biennial Ministerial Conference in June 2020 could mark the completion of negotiations on fisheries subsidies and other priorities. Outside the WTO, initiatives like the CPTPP are seen as potential models for future trade liberalization."
