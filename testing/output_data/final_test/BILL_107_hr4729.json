    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002\" aims to delay the onset of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 aims to provide Medicare coverage for qualified chronic kidney disease patients, allowing them benefits under part A and eligibility for part B of title XVIII, while prohibiting enrollment under part C. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 provides coverage for qualified chronic kidney disease patients under part A and eligibility for part B of title XVIII, excluding enrollment under part C. A qualified chronic kidney disease patient is defined as an individual diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, likely needing dialysis or a kidney transplant within two years, may benefit from pre-ESRD services, and does not have health insurance coverage. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 provides coverage for qualified chronic kidney disease patients under part A and eligibility for part B of title XVIII, excluding enrollment under part C. The amendments made by this subsection shall take effect on January 1, 2004, including coverage of pre-ESRD services for individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 offers coverage for chronic kidney disease patients who will likely need dialysis within two years and may benefit from pre-ESRD services. This amendment to the Social Security Act will take effect on January 1, 2004. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 provides coverage for chronic kidney disease patients who may benefit from pre-ESRD services, effective January 1, 2004. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 covers pre-ESRD services, including nutritional counseling and comprehensive information on managing comorbidities and kidney disease treatment options. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 covers modalities of treatment for kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, such as organ transplantation, dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis), counseling for organ transplantation preparation, vascular access preparation for dialysis, and other services determined appropriate by the Secretary in consultation with relevant organizations. The Secretary will establish criteria for qualifications required for individuals providing these services. The Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2002 establishes qualifications for individuals providing pre-ESRD services and sets the payment amount at 80 percent of the fee schedule determined under section 1834(e) of the Social Security Act. The Secretary shall establish a fee schedule for payment for pre-ESRD services, considering efficient care delivery, service definitions, regional differences, and payment rate adjustments for inflation. The Secretary shall consult with national organizations and may require a coding system for pre-ESRD services. Dialysis facilities can bill for these services as defined in the amendment. The facility can submit a claim for payment for pre-ESRD services without needing a separate provider number."
