    "content": "Congress has established regulatory exclusivities to encourage activities in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. These exclusivities protect approved drugs from competition for a period of time, enforced by the FDA through various exclusivity types such as Biologics Exclusivity, Transitional Exclusivity, Orphan Drug Exclusivity, New Chemical Entity Exclusivity, Enantiomer Exclusivity, and others. The U.S. government regulates pharmaceutical marketing for public health. Developers must prove safety and efficacy through preclinical and clinical investigations in a New Drug Application (NDA) for FDA approval. Various regulatory exclusivities protect approved drugs from competition, including exclusivities like Biologics Exclusivity and Orphan Drug Exclusivity. Legislation in the 115th Congress addresses these exclusivities. The FDA evaluates test data submitted in a New Drug Application (NDA) confidentially to prevent competitors from using it to avoid development costs. Before 1984, generic drug manufacturers had to file their own NDAs to market their drugs, relying on published studies for safety and efficacy. Some generic manufacturers faced challenges in obtaining FDA approval for their drugs, even though they were chemically identical to approved drugs. Critics argued that the approval process for generic drugs was costly and time-consuming, hindering the introduction of more affordable alternatives. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, created the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for generic drug approval. ANDAs allow generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the original drug, avoiding costs and delays associated with a full NDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act introduced the section 505(b)(2) application, which is a hybrid between an ANDA and a full NDA. This application requires full reports of investigations on safety and efficacy, but allows reliance on studies not conducted by the applicant. A section 505(b)(2) NDA is different from a regular NDA as it relies on data not developed by the applicant. The Hatch-Waxman Act limits generic competitors from selling their versions of brand-name drugs by imposing regulatory exclusivities. These exclusivities cover various aspects such as new chemical entities, orphan drugs, and biologics. Regulatory exclusivities are not standardized in terminology. Regulatory exclusivity refers to FDA-administered proprietary rights, divided into data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity. Data exclusivity protects safety and efficacy information submitted by brand-name firms from use by generic firms. Marketing exclusivity provides a different scope of protection. Data exclusivity protects safety and efficacy information submitted by brand-name firms from use by generic firms for a period of years. Marketing exclusivity prevents competing firms from obtaining FDA approval without generating their own data. The distinction between data and marketing exclusivity is more significant for firms that can afford to generate their own data packages for FDA submission. The Hatch-Waxman Act established a five-year data exclusivity for new chemical entities. NCE exclusivity encourages innovative drug development by protecting new chemical entities from generic competition for five years after marketing approval. This exclusivity applies to drugs with entirely new active ingredients not previously approved by the FDA. During this period, generic companies cannot rely on the data submitted by the innovative drug company for approval. NCE exclusivity prohibits generic competition for new chemical entities for five years after approval, regardless of use or form. It acts as data exclusivity, allowing early generic filing under certain patent circumstances. The NCE exclusivity provides protection for new chemical entities for either four or five years, in addition to the FDA review time for generic applications. Unlike other FDA exclusivities, NCE exclusivity allows the FDA to accept generic applications but delays their approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act also includes a three-year clinical investigation exclusivity period to encourage drug improvements. The FDA grants clinical investigation exclusivity for changes like new dosage forms, indications, or switching from prescription to over-the-counter status. To qualify, the study must be new, conducted on humans, sponsored by the applicant, and essential for approval. \"Essential to approval\" means no other data can support the application. Clinical investigation exclusivity, like NCE exclusivity, acts as data exclusivity and does not prevent FDA approval of a full NDA. It does not bar the acceptance of a generic application. If clinical investigation exclusivity delays marketing approval, the FDA may issue tentative approval for the generic product. Investigation exclusivity applies to specific uses supported by clinical trials. It does not prevent FDA approval of generic drugs for other indications or dosage forms. A drug can have both NCE and clinical investigation exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act encourages firms to conduct additional trials for new uses. The Orphan Drug Act, enacted in 1982, incentivizes firms to develop pharmaceuticals for rare diseases. It offers benefits such as FDA protocol assistance, tax breaks, and a clinical trial grants program. The Act also provides a seven-year marketing exclusivity period, starting from FDA approval date, for both patented and unpatented drugs. This exclusivity blocks competitors from obtaining FDA approval. Orphan drug exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act blocks competitors from obtaining FDA approval for the same drug, but only applies to the approved indication. The Act defines an orphan drug as one that treats a rare disease affecting less than 200,000 people in the US. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 introduced new regulatory exclusivities for biologics, which are biologically derived preparations like vaccines and therapeutic serums. This Act allows drug sponsors to avoid showing unprofitability if the target population is fewer than 200,000 people. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established regulatory exclusivities for brand-name biologics, with durations of 4 and 12 years. There is debate on whether the 12-year exclusivity period is for data or marketing. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 established regulatory exclusivities for brand-name biologics, with durations of 4 and 12 years. The 12-year exclusivity period is debated to be either data or marketing exclusivity. Members of Congress clarified that it provides data exclusivity, not market exclusivity, prohibiting reliance on FDA's prior findings for a limited time. The 12-year regulatory exclusivity for brand-name biologics protects FDA data, allowing manufacturers to develop their own data for FDA approval. Members of Congress and FDA guidance align on this interpretation. Brand-name firms may receive six-month pediatric exclusivity after completing studies on drug effects on children. Pediatric regulatory exclusivity extends the patent protection on innovator drugs to improve pediatric labeling availability. Congress established this exclusivity to address concerns about the lack of clinical testing on children for FDA-approved drugs. The FDA issues written requests to drug companies for pediatric studies to address the lack of testing on children. This exclusivity aims to improve pediatric labeling availability for FDA-approved drugs. The FDA awards six-month regulatory exclusivity to innovative drug companies that submit satisfactory reports, regardless of study success in demonstrating safety and effectiveness in children. Pediatric exclusivity incentivizes research submission to the FDA, extending existing regulatory exclusivity or patent protection by 6 months. For orphan drugs, this results in 7 years and 6 months of marketing exclusivity, for NCE exclusivity, 5 years and 6 months of data protection. The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act allows the FDA to designate a drug as a \"qualified infectious disease product\" (QIDP) for serious infections. It adds five years to the term of exclusivity for drugs addressing drug-resistant tuberculosis, gram negative bacteria, and Staphylococcus aureus. The GAIN Act provides incentives for innovative antibiotics by adding five years to exclusivities for QIDPs. Enantiomers are mirror image molecules, with only one often being pharmacologically active. The term \"racemate\" refers to a compound with equal amounts of enantiomers. The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 changed the view on enantiomers of previously approved racemates, allowing for new chemical entity exclusivity if the applicant elects. Enantiomer exclusivity applies when seeking approval for a different therapeutic class and requires different studies for approval. Labeling of the non-racemic drug must state it is not approved for any condition. The FDAAA limits enantiomer exclusivity for drug applications submitted between September 27, 2007, and October 1, 2017. Antibiotics are drugs containing substances that inhibit or destroy microorganisms. Before 1997, antibiotic drug applications were reviewed under a different section of the FFDCA. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 brought antibiotics into mainstream pharmaceutical regulation by repealing a distinct statute and requiring their review under section 505 of the FFDCA. It considered the impact on intellectual property rights for \"old antibiotics\" subject to marketing approval applications before November 20, 1997, exempting them from certain patent listing and regulatory exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. The QI Program Supplemental Funding Act of 2008 introduced changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as rules regarding patents and regulatory exclusivities for antibiotics. It clarified that antibiotics approved before November 21, 1997, may obtain a three-year exclusivity for a new condition of use. Marketing approval applications for antibiotics submitted before November 21, 1997, but not yet approved, may elect for three-year clinical investigation exclusivity, five-year NCE exclusivity, or a patent term extension under section 156 of the Patent Act. If this election is made, the features of the Hatch-Waxman Act, such as its patent dispute resolution system, apply to the \"old antibiotic.\" The Hatch-Waxman Act and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act establish regulatory exclusivities to encourage generic and follow-on firms to market their products. Generic firms can obtain 180-day generic exclusivity by challenging brand-name patents. The BPCIA provides exclusivity for follow-on biologics. The FDA grants exclusivity periods to products, with follow-on exclusivity ending after a certain period post-approval or post-litigation. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows the first generic drug company to challenge patents and obtain 180-day exclusivity. The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 addressed concerns about generic companies competing with off-patent drugs. The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established a 180-day \"competitive generic therapy\" exclusivity period in cases of \"inadequate generic competition\" for off-patent drugs. This exclusivity blocks competing generic applications for 180 days and is forfeited if the generic drug is not marketed within 75 days of FDA approval. Legislation introduced in the 115th Congress aims to modify the system of regulatory exclusivities for drug approvals. The Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act, known as H.R. 1776 and S. 771, would change the exclusivity period for new chemical entities (NCE). Currently, the FDA cannot accept generic drug applications for a brand-name drug under NCE exclusivity for five years, which can be reduced to four years if patents are challenged. The proposed legislation would allow generic drug applications for the brand-name product three years after approval. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1776 and S. 771, aims to reduce the waiting period for generic drug applications for brand-name products under NCE exclusivity from five years to three years. Additionally, the legislation would decrease the regulatory exclusivity period for biologics from 12 to 7 years. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1776 and S. 771, aims to reduce the waiting period for generic drug applications under NCE exclusivity from five years to three years. It would also decrease the regulatory exclusivity period for biologics from 12 to 7 years. The legislation would limit the award of three-year clinical investigation exclusivity to drugs showing a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1776 and S. 771, aims to reduce waiting periods for generic drug applications and decrease regulatory exclusivity periods for biologics. Concerns have been raised about brand-name firms obtaining multiple awards for three-year clinical investigation exclusivity to hinder generic competition. The Abuse-Deterrent Opioids Plan for Tomorrow Act of 2017, H.R. 2025, would limit exclusivity for abuse-deterrent opioids. Firms use the 505(b)(2) pathway to obtain FDA approval for abuse-deterrent opioids by relying on safety studies of old opioids and conducting additional trials. Critics question the three-year exclusivity for abuse-deterrent labeling, suggesting it may be overly generous. Company A files a 505(b)(2) application for an old opioid in a nasal abuse deterrence formulation, relying on old safety data and conducting new clinical trials. FDA grants three-year exclusivity for nasal abuse deterrence labeling. Company B later files a similar application, using old data and conducting its own trials, but FDA has already approved Company A's application. H.R. 2025 aims to prevent Company B's application from being blocked by Company A's three-year clinical investigation exclusivity for nasal abuse deterrence labeling, even if the technologies differ and Company B did not reference Company A's application. The OPEN ACT of 2017 aims to extend exclusivity periods for approved drugs addressing rare diseases, encouraging drug companies to repurpose existing medications. This would apply to 505(b)(2) applications filed on or after January 1, 2017. The OPEN ACT of 2017 aims to extend exclusivity periods for approved drugs addressing rare diseases, encouraging drug companies to repurpose existing medications. The six-month extension would be cumulative with other regulatory exclusivities, clarifying that orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent approval of new, clinically superior drugs for the same disease. The OPEN ACT of 2017 aims to extend exclusivity periods for approved drugs addressing rare diseases, encouraging drug companies to repurpose existing medications. Congress placed limitations on the three-year exclusivity for drugs used in pediatric populations, allowing generic drugs to omit pediatric labeling protected by patents or exclusivity. Generic drugs must indicate they are not approved for pediatric use and provide necessary warnings. The OPEN ACT, S. 1509, proposes extending exclusivity periods for drugs, including pediatric indications, to encourage drug development. This shift towards regulatory exclusivities has implications for innovation and public health policy, as the FDA now administers intellectual property rights in addition to ensuring food and drug safety. The landscape of proprietary rights in pharmaceuticals and biologics has become more complex with numerous intellectual property rights. Regulatory exclusivities, such as orphan and pediatric drug exclusivity, have been successful in encouraging the discovery and availability of new medicines. However, newer exclusivities like those for enantiomers and qualified infectious disease products have not garnered as much industry interest. Congressional monitoring is essential to ensure that regulatory exclusivities continue to incentivize innovation in public health."
