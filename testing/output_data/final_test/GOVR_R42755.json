    "content": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been providing educational assistance benefits to veterans since 1944 through the GI Bill. The newest version, the Post-9/11 GI Bill, was enacted in 2008 and has accounted for the majority of participation and spending since FY2013. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, enacted in 2008, benefits almost 800,000 individuals and expends over $12 billion in FY2018. It was created to provide enhanced educational assistance benefits to veterans and servicemembers, meeting four main objectives including comprehensive educational benefits and improving military retention through transferability of benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational benefits to veterans and servicemembers, including Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, and DOD assistance. Congress aimed to address military recruiting challenges and high veteran unemployment rates. There were concerns about the impact of increasing benefits on retention in the Armed Forces. Transferability of benefits to dependents was considered crucial by the DOD. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, codified under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 33, rewards Armed Forces members for service since September 11, 2001. It aims to assist with educational needs, recognize military service, and aid in readjusting to civilian life. The bill provides aid for tuition, fees, housing, and books for approved education programs. President George W. Bush advocated for transferability of benefits to dependents in a State of the Union address. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides assistance for education-related expenses for participants in approved programs. Several laws have been enacted to amend aspects of the program, including the creation of the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship and amendments through the Post-9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010. The GI Bill Fairness Act of 2011 temporarily reverses an amendment for individuals attending private institutions in seven states. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 requires annual reports on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the DEA program. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 expands eligibility for certain Coast Guard Reserve members. The Veterans' Access to Care Act of 2014 expands eligibility and reduces tuition charges. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 also impacts veterans' benefits. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (P.L. 114-92) prohibits concurrent receipt of unemployment insurance and Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits. The Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-315) extends benefit availability and streamlines claim processing. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48), known as the Forever GI Bill, eliminates time limitations on benefits, expands eligibility, and modifies benefit amounts. This report provides a detailed description of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, including participant eligibility criteria and entitlement to benefits. The curr_chunk describes the entitlement to benefits, eligible programs of education, benefit payments, and eligibility criteria for servicemembers and veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. It also explains the need for individuals to make an irrevocable election to receive benefits and limited authority for former REAP participants to achieve eligibility. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, veterans and servicemembers from various branches, including reserve components and commissioned officers of PHS and NOAA, may be eligible if they meet specific criteria related to active duty service after September 10, 2001. Reservists and National Guard members have specific qualifying active duty requirements to access benefits. The active duty service period for National Guard members under the Post-9/11 GI Bill includes full-time service for organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard, and responding to national emergencies. It excludes certain types of service periods to qualify for benefits. The active duty service period for National Guard members under the Post-9/11 GI Bill includes full-time service for organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard, and responding to national emergencies. Excludes service terminated due to a defective enlistment, induction, or to meet a student loan repayment obligation. After meeting the active duty service period, individuals must continue on active duty or be discharged with an honorable discharge, placed on the retired list, transferred to the Fleet Reserve, or further service in a reserve component. The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship Program (Fry Scholarship) allows spouses and children of individuals who die in the line of duty after September 11, 2001, while serving on active duty in the Armed Forces to be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Children can be unmarried or married, including those born outside of marriage, legally adopted, or stepchildren in the household of eligible individuals. The Post-9/11 GI Bill allows servicemembers to transfer benefits to family members, with specific eligibility criteria. Qualifying individuals must have completed six years of service and agree to serve four additional years. As of July 12, 2019, they must not have completed more than 16 years of service and must be able to serve four more years. Individuals eligible to transfer benefits must be current members of the Armed Forces or active duty members of the Commissioned Corps of the PHS and NOAA. Retired or separated individuals are generally ineligible to transfer benefits, with exceptions for deceased transferees. Benefits can be transferred to children, spouses, or a combination of both. The Post-9/11 GI Bill allows eligible individuals to transfer benefits to family members enrolled in DEERS and eligible for DOD benefits. Qualifying individuals can revoke the transfer at any time. Other veterans' educational assistance programs include REAP, DEA, MGIB-AD, MGIB-SR, and professional military education under Chapter 107 of Title 10 U.S.C. Individuals with a single qualifying active duty service period must choose one program to receive benefits from. Beginning January 1, 2017, individuals eligible for the Fry Scholarship and DEA must choose between the programs to receive benefits. The VA may make an irrevocable election decision for those who fail to choose, with a 30-day window to change the election. Some individuals who lost REAP eligibility may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, with active duty service credited towards eligibility. REAP-qualifying active duty service can be credited towards Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility, providing educational assistance measured in months and days. The entitlement period is typically 36 months, with payments reducing the entitlement period based on the amount received. Transferees may have less than or equal to 36 months of entitlement, which can be distributed to themselves, a child, a spouse, or a combination of them. The qualifying individual can transfer entitlement to a child, spouse, or themselves, with the ability to modify or revoke the designation. As dependents use the benefit, entitlement periods for both the dependents and the qualifying individual are reduced. Entitlement may be extended or modified in certain situations. Any entitlement used for incomplete courses or programs, lost training time due to institution closure, or disapproved necessary courses is restored. No entitlement is charged for interim housing allowance following closure or disapproval. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance to veterans and servicemembers for a limited period, with entitlement not reduced for certain circumstances. Reservists and active duty personnel qualify based on specific criteria. Once entitlement is exhausted, assistance may continue until the end of the academic term or a 12-week period. Some individuals have a delimiting date for benefits, especially those discharged before January 1, 2013. For individuals discharged before January 1, 2013, benefits must be used within 15 years of discharge. Spouses and children using transferred benefits have specific age limits. Fry Scholarship recipients have age limits based on eligibility date. Those discharged after January 1, 2013, have no delimiting date for benefits. Spouses and children using transferred benefits have specific age limits. Spouses can start using benefits after the servicemember completes six years of service. Divorced spouses can still use benefits unless revoked by the qualifying individual. Children must meet education or age requirements before using transferred benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits can be used by qualifying individuals who have completed at least 10 years of service. Recipients of the Fry Scholarship can also use the benefits, with children needing to be at least 18 years old. The benefits can support students in approved education programs at various institutions, including higher learning establishments. Programs must be approved by a state agency or the VA to be eligible for benefits. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, various benefit payments are available for tuition, fees, housing, books, tutorial assistance, test fees, and relocation/travel assistance. Participants must be charged no more than in-state tuition and fees. Covered individuals include members of the Armed Forces on active duty for more than 30 days in the state where the institution is located, as well as their spouse and dependent children. Children receive payments as if not on active duty, while spouses receive payments based on the qualifying individual's current status. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, qualifying individuals discharged from active duty within three years of enrollment, including recipients of specific scholarships, may be eligible for in-state tuition at public IHLs. Continuous enrollment ensures eligibility for in-state tuition and fee charges. Maximum payment levels for tuition, fees, housing, and books are outlined in Table 1. The housing allowance is based on the DOD-determined monthly basic allowance for housing (BAH) for a member of the Armed Forces with dependents in pay grade E-5. Many individuals may receive lower payments due to various factors such as length of active duty service, enrollment rate, actual charges, and receipt of DOD Tuition Assistance. Military branches provide tuition and expenses for education and training through TA. Eligible individuals pursuing a degree at an IHL may receive assistance if enrolled more than half-time. Individuals enrolled more than half-time at an IHL for a degree program may receive payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies. Payments are based on the actual net cost for in-state tuition and fees for public IHLs, and the lesser of the private school maximum or actual net cost for tuition and fees for private or foreign IHLs. Payments are reduced based on the length of time served on active duty and other financial assistance received. The housing allowance and tuition and fees benefits for individuals enrolled in an IHL are based on actual costs and are reduced based on active duty service length. The housing allowance is paid monthly and the tuition and fees benefit is paid directly to the IHL each academic term. The monthly housing allowance for individuals enrolled in an IHL is based on enrollment rate and active duty service length. For foreign institutions, the allowance is the national average of E-5 with dependents BAH. Distance learning students receive 50% of the national average BAH. Additionally, individuals receive a $1,000 yearly stipend for books and educational expenses. The stipend for educational expenses is paid monthly based on credit hours enrolled, worth $41.67 per credit hour. It does not reduce entitlement period or other benefit payments. Individuals on active duty enrolled more than half-time may receive payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies. The tuition and fees benefit is paid directly to the IHL on behalf of eligible individuals for each academic term.

Individuals enrolled in flight training programs may receive payments for tuition, fees, housing, and books. Individuals in flight training receive a tuition and fees benefit based on time served on active duty or the actual net cost for in-state tuition. They are not eligible for a housing allowance or books and supplies stipend. Correspondence training involves receiving lessons in the mail and completing them within a specified time frame. Individuals enrolled in correspondence training programs may receive payments for tuition and fees based on active duty service, with a maximum benefit determined by the program's cost. They do not qualify for a housing allowance but may receive a books and supplies stipend. Individuals enrolled more than half-time in programs of education not leading to a degree can receive payments for tuition and fees, housing, and books and supplies.

Books-and-supplies stipend is $83 per month for individuals enrolled more than half-time in programs not leading to a degree. Individuals enrolled half-time or less in any program of education may receive payments for tuition and fees, but are ineligible for a housing allowance. They may also receive a books-and-supplies stipend that is a percentage of the maximum stipend of $1,000 per year. The Yellow Ribbon Program allows IHLs to match a percentage of tuition and fees not covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill, benefiting participants at private IHLs and out-of-state students at public IHLs. The program is a voluntary agreement between IHLs and the VA, with payments split equally between them. The Yellow Ribbon Program allows IHLs to match a certain amount of tuition and fees not covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill for eligible individuals. IHLs can specify their support by college, student status, and the program is only available to those at the 100% benefit level. The Ribbon Program provides tutorial assistance up to $100 monthly and $1,200 total for individuals admitted under the program. Additionally, up to $2,000 may be reimbursed for licensing or certification tests. This benefit is available regardless of test results and does not reduce other entitlements. For AY2017-2018 and earlier, the entitlement charge for tests is one month for each payment equaling the monthly rate of $1,902.61. For AY2018-2019 and beyond, the charge is prorated based on the test fee in relation to the monthly rate. The benefit does not depend on the length of active duty service and covers national tests for admission, course credit, and prior learning. The maximum benefit for a test is the remaining Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement.

Individuals in rural counties relocating for education may receive up to $500 without affecting entitlement or other benefits. An advance payment of the housing allowance is available to individuals planning to enroll more than half-time, sent to the educational institution for disbursal within 30 days of the academic term start. VA guidance indicates advance payments are not available under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Military branches offer incentives like cash bonuses, enlistment kickers, affiliation kickers, and reenlistment kickers based on skill criticality or service commitment length. The GI Bill benefits are deposited into the DOD Educational Benefits Trust Fund until individuals use them, at which point the benefit amount is transferred to the VA for payment. Additional assistance of $150-$950 is added to the monthly housing allowance. Those enrolled half-time or less or serving on active duty are not eligible for the housing allowance. The amount may be reduced based on time served on active duty or if individuals choose Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits over other options. The Tuition Assistance Top-Up program allows Post-9/11 GI Bill-eligible servicemembers to receive additional benefits to cover tuition and fees not covered by TA.

Effective October 1, 2013, DEA-eligible individuals can combine programs to receive up to 81 months of entitlement. Making an irrevocable election for the Post-9/11 GI Bill after using other entitlement programs will result in equal entitlement to the remaining months. The Post-9/11 GI Bill allows individuals to receive up to 48 months of benefits, with the option to extend it by 12 months if they exhaust benefits under another program. Benefits cannot be received concurrently under multiple programs. Veterans in the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program may also be eligible for a subsistence allowance based on various factors.
