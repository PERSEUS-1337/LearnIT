    "title": "AB 163",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 44262.5 of the Education Code in California is amended to allow the commission to issue an American Indian language-culture credential upon recommendation of a federally recognized Indian tribe. Candidates must demonstrate fluency in the tribe's language and knowledge of the tribe's culture through assessments developed by the tribe. Candidates meeting both requirements will receive authorizations in both language and culture. The American Indian language-culture credential allows teaching of language or culture in California public schools from preschool to adult education. Holders must pass a background check, submit an application through a federally recognized tribe, and cannot teach subjects other than the language or culture without a valid teaching credential. The American Indian language-culture credential is initially issued for two years and can be renewed for three years with tribal government recommendation. After three years, the holder can apply for a clear teaching credential for that language. Tribes are encouraged to develop assessments for credential applicants, including dialects and standardized writing systems. In developing the culture assessment, an Indian tribe should determine the candidate's understanding of the tribe's culture, including ceremonies, traditions, social institutions, holidays, health practices, work patterns, and culinary traditions. This includes standards for knowledge required for an American Indian culture authorization and effective teaching methods in the classroom. Standards for effective teaching methods in the classroom should be evaluated, and assessments should be conducted at a suitable location for the Indian tribe members. The tribe recommending a candidate for an American Indian language-culture credential shall develop and administer a technical assistance program based on California Standards for Teaching. The program, led by experienced teachers, may include classroom observation, instructional planning, and support to enhance the teacher's professional development in American Indian language or culture. (g) Public school personnel evaluating teachers with American Indian language-culture credentials must inform them about the evaluation process and California Standards for Teaching. For existing credential holders, the recommending tribe decides on adding the culture authorization or reapplying for it. The Legislature acknowledges the importance of these provisions. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of teaching American Indian language and culture for the education of American Indian children and preserving it as part of our national heritage."
