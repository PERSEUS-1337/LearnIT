    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior conveyed mineral rights in coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana. Development of these tracts and other energy resources in the area generate significant public revenues for the State, aiding in addressing development impacts. The Northern Cheyenne tribal community faces economic challenges and lacks public services despite surrounding energy development. The tribe has limited revenue sources to address development impacts and sued the Secretary in 2002 over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts, citing violations of Federal laws and trust responsibilities. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe withdrew a lawsuit with prejudice, based on commitments that legislation would be introduced to address coal development impacts. The Tribe retains claims against the United States for failing to acquire mineral rights when the Reservation was expanded in 1900. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe will waive legal claims against the United States for mineral rights owned by Great Northern Properties on Reservation land if mineral rights conveyances are carried out under the Act. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the State within the boundaries of the Reservation, as depicted on a specific map dated April 7, 2010. The term \"Federal tracts\" refers to unleased land outside the Reservation boundaries in the State, totaling approximately 5,000 acres as shown on a map dated March 18, 2011. The \"Federal Coal Land Conveyance\" dated March 18, 2011, includes specific land locations in various townships and ranges. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" is defined within this context. The term \"Great Northern Properties\" refers to a Delaware limited partnership and any successor owning coal or iron under the Cheyenne tracts. Other defined terms include \"Reservation\" for the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, \"Secretary\" for the Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" for Montana, and \"Tribe\" for the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. SEC. 4. MINERAL RIGHTS CONVEYANCES.\n\nGreat Northern Properties will convey mineral interests to the Tribe, and in return, the Secretary will convey coal rights to Great Northern Properties. The mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe will be exempt from State taxation.\n\nSEC. 5. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MINERAL CONVEYANCES. The Tribe will waive legal claims in exchange for mineral conveyances. A formula for revenue sharing must be agreed upon for coal production. The conveyance of Federal coal rights will proceed despite other laws or regulations. The conveyance of Federal coal rights must be completed within 90 days of notification. If any mineral conveyances are invalidated by a court, they can be rescinded by the Secretary or Great Northern Properties. Rescinding a conveyance will result in the Tribe's waiver being rescinded as well. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS. No benefits provided to the Tribe under this Act shall affect any Federal services, benefits, or programs the Tribe or its members are entitled to as a federally recognized Indian tribe or tribal members."
