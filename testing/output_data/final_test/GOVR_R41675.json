    "content": "Almost 30 years ago, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) to address concerns about managing the nation's nuclear waste. The NWPA requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to collect spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste from commercial nuclear power plants for safe disposal in a permanent geologic repository or interim storage facility. This was done to establish a statutory basis for the DOE to handle the nation's most radioactive waste. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) established a multi-stage statutory process for selecting a permanent geologic repository for the nation's nuclear waste. The process involves site recommendation, site characterization, site approval, and construction authorization, with funding coming from nuclear power providers through the Nuclear Waste Fund. The NWPA established a process for selecting a nuclear waste repository, involving site recommendation, characterization, approval, and construction authorization. The Secretary recommended Deaf Smith County, Texas; Hanford, Washington, and Yucca Mountain, Nevada as candidate sites in 1986. Congress amended the process in 1987, designating Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate site and terminating activities at other sites. In 1987, Yucca Mountain was approved as the sole candidate site for a nuclear waste repository despite safety concerns raised by Nevada. President George W. Bush endorsed the site the following day, in line with the NWPA framework. The NWPA process for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository included the approval stage where Congress overrode Nevada's objection, leading to the submission of a license application to the NRC in June 2008. The NWPA directed the submission of a license application for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository to the NRC. The NRC was reviewing the 8,600 page application when the Obama Administration changed policy, stating Yucca Mountain was not suitable for the repository. Obama and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu have opposed Yucca Mountain as a permanent nuclear waste storage site. Obama supported Nevada's opposition to the repository during his 2008 campaign. In his first year in office, funds were allocated only for NRC license proceedings, halting repository development. In his second year, the Administration's budget eliminated all Yucca Mountain project funding. A Blue Ribbon Commission was established to explore alternative options. The Obama Administration, along with Secretary Chu, defunded and terminated the Yucca Mountain program, seeking alternative nuclear waste disposal solutions. Funding for the Yucca Mountain facility steadily decreased over the years, with the FY2011 budget proposal requesting no funds for the project. The FY2011 DOE budget request faced resistance from House and Senate appropriators, with attempts to restore funding for the Yucca Mountain facility being rejected. Congress passed continuing resolutions to extend appropriations based on FY2010 levels. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010 defunded the Yucca Mountain program and recommended closing the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The OCRWM officially closed on September 30, 2010, with responsibilities shifted to the Office of Nuclear Energy. Some Members of Congress questioned the legality of the Administration's decision. The Administration's decision to eliminate the statutorily established OCRWM raised concerns about legality. DOE argues that the Secretary of Energy has broad authority to reorganize within the department. Congress holds the power to structure administrative bureaucracy, limiting agencies' ability to direct functions without specific statutory authority. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to establish, alter, consolidate, or discontinue organizational units as deemed necessary. The Administration's proposal is to \"terminate\" the OCRWM and transfer its responsibilities to the Office of Nuclear Energy. The FY2012 budget requested no funding for the Yucca Mountain program, but the House included $25 million in an appropriations bill. Ultimately, no funding for the program was included in the final budget. The Yucca Mountain program did not receive funding in the FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act, leading to its shutdown. The House of Representatives attempted to allocate $25 million for the program, but the Senate did not include this funding in their version of the bill. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations Act did not provide funding for the Yucca Mountain program. Instead, a pilot program for consolidated storage facilities was directed by the DOE. The President established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternatives for the permanent storage of nuclear waste. The Commission, co-chaired by Lee Hamilton and Brent Scowcroft, aims to provide recommendations for managing the nation's nuclear waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, co-chaired by Lee Hamilton and Brent Scowcroft, was tasked with producing interim and final reports on alternatives to Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste disposal. Secretary Chu emphasized that Yucca Mountain should not be considered as a viable solution, urging the Commission to explore better options. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future issued its final report on January 26, 2012, recommending a new \"consent-based approach\" for nuclear waste disposal, moving beyond the stalemate over Yucca Mountain. The Commission emphasized the need for incentives to encourage communities to volunteer as potential host sites for a repository. The future of the Yucca Mountain project remains uncertain, but the Commission's findings may influence nuclear waste disposal in the future. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended deep geologic disposal as the most promising method for nuclear waste disposal. They suggested creating a new organization to oversee the process and emphasized the need for new institutional leadership in the nation's nuclear waste program. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended deep geologic disposal for nuclear waste and proposed a federal corporation to oversee the process. Congress has not acted on the recommendations, and the DOE's attempt to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application has been controversial. The DOE cited policy considerations and advancements in storage and recycling technologies as reasons for seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain. The DOE filed a motion to dismiss the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" on March 3, 2010, indicating they do not plan to refile for a permanent geologic repository. The NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board rejected the withdrawal but suspended license review due to budget constraints. The DOE filed a motion to dismiss the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" on March 3, 2010, indicating they do not plan to refile for a permanent geologic repository. This triggered strong opposition from concerned parties, including states like Washington and South Carolina, who are challenging the license withdrawal in legal proceedings. The legal battle over the Secretary's authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application hinges on specific statutory language within the NWPA. Section 114 outlines the process for obtaining site approval and construction authorization, providing the statutory foundation for ongoing litigation. The NRC must consider the application within 3 years of submission. DOE argues for deference in withdrawing the license application, citing broad discretion under the NWPA for establishing a geologic repository. The Secretary has broad discretion under the NWPA to terminate the Yucca Mountain program if the site is deemed unsuitable. The question of whether this discretion extends to the license application phase is yet to be resolved by the NRC and the D.C. Circuit. DOE argues that the NWPA incorporates NRC regulations allowing for withdrawal of a license application, suggesting that the Secretary's submission requirement should be interpreted in conjunction with NRC regulations. This interpretation aligns with Congress's intent for license proceedings to follow existing NRC procedural regulations. DOE argues that the Secretary's submission of the license application satisfies statutory obligations, and the Secretary's actions post-submission are not restricted by Section 114. Challengers oppose DOE's authority to withdraw the application, citing the plain language of the NWPA. The challengers argue that the NWPA mandates DOE to initiate the licensing proceeding by filing the application, after which the NRC takes over to reach a final decision within three years. This process includes reporting obligations and leads to a final decision. The challengers argue that the Board, an independent adjudicatory body, reviews the Yucca Mountain license application and consists of both legal and technical judges. Technical judges are required to have substantial experience in nuclear engineering. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, which was initially questioned by the Board. The Board decided to suspend consideration of the motion pending guidance from the D.C. Circuit. The NRC overturned the Board's decision, asserting its expertise in the ongoing legal dispute. The NRC remanded the Yucca Mountain license application case back to the Board to resolve the matter expeditiously, questioning the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction in the process. The NRC emphasized its expertise in interpreting relevant laws and regulations to inform the court's consideration of DOE's motion to withdraw. The D.C. Circuit court delays consideration of Yucca Mountain claims until the NRC completes its evaluation of DOE's motion, allowing the agency to establish a factual record for potential appeal. The Board ruled that Secretary Chu did not have the authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, as the NWPA mandates progress towards a decision and establishes a detailed procedure controlled by Congress, not the Secretary. The Board denied the Secretary's authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, stating that it goes against Congress's intent for the licensing process to be free from political influence. They also rejected DOE's argument regarding NRC procedural regulations. The Board denied the Secretary's authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, emphasizing Congress's intent for a politically unbiased licensing process. They disagreed with DOE's argument on NRC procedural regulations, stating that vague terms cannot alter fundamental aspects of the NWPA's licensing scheme. The Board also considered Congress's 2002 decision to override Nevada's objection to Yucca Mountain as a significant factor in their conclusion. The NWPA authorized Nevada to veto the Yucca Mountain site designation, but Congress overrode the state's objection in P.L. 107-200. The Board concluded that Congress had the ultimate decision on moving forward with the project, despite DOE's denied motion to withdraw the application. The dismissal should not be granted \"with prejudice.\" The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) allowed withdrawal of the application, but insisted that any dismissal should be \"without prejudice.\" The Board emphasized that no merits-based decision had been reached on the license application. They also expressed concerns about the long-term implications of tying the hands of future administrations regarding Yucca Mountain. The NRC later invited parties to file briefs on whether the Commission should review the Board's decision. A final order from the NRC was imminent after all briefs were filed and Commissioners had cast their votes. The NRC decision on the Yucca Mountain license application was delayed until September 2011, with accusations of Chairman Jaczko footdragging. Commissioners needed a majority position before issuing a final order, despite preliminary votes and a draft order since November 2010. In October 2010, NRC Chairman Jaczko directed staff to use funds to close down the review of the Yucca Mountain license application, amidst controversy and ongoing delays in reaching a majority decision on the issue. The NRC's FY2011 budget guidance directed staff to follow the agency's budget request, anticipating DOE's attempt to withdraw the license application. The Board initially denied a DOE motion to stay the licensing proceedings and expressed a desire to move forward expeditiously. The NRC's FY2011 budget guidance directed staff to begin an orderly closure of the Yucca Mountain licensing review after DOE's attempt to withdraw the license application. Two NRC commissioners opposed the chairman's budget guidance, arguing that it was inconsistent with the Continuing Resolution. The NRC's FY2011 budget guidance directed staff to begin an orderly closure of the Yucca Mountain licensing review after DOE's attempt to withdraw the license application. Congress approved the NRC's budget proposal, providing funds for the termination of the license review, effectively sanctioning Chairman Jaczko's decision. The NRC's FY2011 budget guidance allowed for the shutdown of Yucca Mountain license review activities, but debate continues over the validity of using FY2011 CR funds for this purpose. The ambiguity stems from questions about whether the NRC was bound by FY2010 enacted appropriations and if those funds could be used to close down the review. The CR allowed for funds to close down the Yucca Mountain license review, but there was ambiguity over using FY2010 funds for this purpose. The Senate's Energy and Water appropriations bill did not mention the review, leading to uncertainty about continued funding. The CR did not provide continued funds for the Yucca Mountain license review, as the Senate did not express intent to fund it in the future. However, Congress had not expressly defunded the review, leaving uncertainty about the NRC's obligations under its FY2010 appropriations. The NRC budget request and House report allocated funds for the review, but the Senate and Conference reports were silent on the matter. The House report expressed Congress's intent to appropriate funds for the Yucca Mountain license review, but the Senate and Conference reports were silent on the matter. Chairman Jaczko argued that there was no express direction on how to expend the funds for Yucca Mountain activities. Lump-sum appropriations restrictions in the agency's budget request or legislative history are not legally binding unless specified. The budget request or legislative history is not legally binding on the department or agency unless incorporated into the statutory language of the appropriation act. Agencies can only use appropriated funds for their intended purposes, as stated in 31 U.S.C. Section 1301(a). Due to the nature of lump-sum appropriations, it is challenging to determine the specific purposes for which funds were allocated. Allocating lump-sum appropriations gives agencies flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and meet statutory responsibilities effectively. While there was no specific appropriation for the NRC's review of the Yucca Mountain license application in FY2010, agencies cannot use funds meant for mandatory programs to terminate them. Appropriated funds can only be used to terminate non-mandatory programs. The recent decision by the Board could be read as interpreting the NRC's review of the Yucca Mountain license as mandatory, impacting the NRC's use of funds. The NRC Inspector General conducted an investigation into Chairman Jaczko's termination of the review, questioning if he exceeded his authority. The Inspector General's report concluded that the chairman's actions in terminating the NRC's review of the Yucca Mountain license application were supported by authority and consistent with budget decisions. However, the chairman was criticized for not being transparent with all Commissioners about the close-out activities. The NRC released an order on September 9, 2011, stating that the Commission was evenly divided on whether to proceed with closure. The NRC released an order on September 9, 2011, stating that the Commission was evenly divided on whether to overturn or uphold the Board's decision regarding the Yucca Mountain proceedings. Due to budgetary limitations, the Board was directed to complete all necessary case management activities by the end of the fiscal year. On September 30, 2011, the Board officially announced the suspension of the proceedings due to uncertainty regarding future funding and staffing. The NRC terminated the Yucca Mountain proceedings due to budgetary constraints, not by actions of DOE or the Obama Administration. The license for Yucca Mountain has not been withdrawn, as the Board's decision to deny DOE's motion stands. South Carolina and Washington have filed cases in federal court to prevent the termination of the program, which have been consolidated in the D.C. Circuit. The DOE's Hanford Nuclear Reservation and Savannah River Site house large amounts of defense-related nuclear waste. Parties have filed complaints to block the withdrawal of the Yucca Mountain license, citing violations of the NWPA, NEPA, and APA. Petitioners argue that the NWPA mandates the submission and review of the application, and any withdrawal would violate site selection provisions. The petitioners argue that DOE's decision to abandon the Yucca Mountain facility violates NEPA, which requires an assessment of environmental impact for major federal actions. They also claim that closing Yucca Mountain must be preceded by a NEPA assessment or a justification for why it won't significantly impact the environment. Additionally, they argue that terminating the project without a rational explanation is arbitrary and unlawful under the APA. The D.C. Circuit has expedited proceedings and scheduled oral arguments. The D.C. Circuit expedited proceedings and scheduled oral arguments for the Yucca Mountain facility case. The court initially ordered a stay pending NRC proceedings but later lifted it due to delays and controversy. Ultimately, the court dismissed the parties' claims on July 1, 2011. The D.C. Circuit dismissed the parties' claims on July 1, 2011, stating that challenges to the ongoing administrative process were premature. The court did not reach the merits of the issue, ruling that the petitioners' challenge to DOE's attempt to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application was not yet ripe for review. The court emphasized the importance of ripeness to prevent premature adjudication and judicial interference in administrative decisions. The D.C. Circuit dismissed the parties' claims on July 1, 2011, stating that challenges to the ongoing administrative process were premature. The court did not reach the merits of the issue, ruling that the petitioners' challenge to DOE's attempt to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application was not yet ripe for review. The court emphasized the importance of ripeness to prevent premature adjudication and judicial interference in administrative decisions. The court reasoned that until the Board either grants or denies the license application, or the NRC reaches a decision overturning the Board's decision denying the license withdrawal, there is no concrete agency action to challenge. The court also held that the petitioners' challenge to the Administration's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain repository process was not reviewable. The D.C. Circuit dismissed claims regarding DOE's attempt to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application as premature. The court emphasized the importance of ripeness to prevent premature adjudication and judicial interference in administrative decisions. Review of any proposed decision to abandon the facility was deemed premature due to lack of finality in the administrative process. The court noted that continued delay by NRC in reaching a decision on the license withdrawal would not \"insulate\" the agency's inaction from judicial review. The D.C. Circuit emphasized the three-year time frame under the NWPA for agency action on the Yucca Mountain license. The court noted that NRC has a statutory duty to continue the review, and failure to act may lead to reconsideration of the issue. The court emphasized the NWPA's three-year time frame for NRC action on the Yucca Mountain license. NRC's duty to review the application was highlighted, with concerns raised about potential consequences of not acting. The plaintiffs filed new claims against the NRC for delaying the license application review, seeking a final decision within 30 days. Oral arguments in the case focused on the implications of the court compelling NRC to resume its review activities. The appeals court ordered the NRC to resume reviewing the Yucca Mountain license application, questioning if the shutdown was due to policy or budget reasons. The Department of Justice was asked to provide input on issuing a writ of mandamus. The court dismissed a case by NARUC and NEI related to Yucca Mountain. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and NARUC filed a claim against Secretary Chu to conduct the required annual assessment of the Nuclear Waste Fund fee. Providers pay $750 million annually to the fund, which has a balance of $24 billion. The DOE can enter contracts with providers for nuclear waste disposal, with the Secretary required to review the fee adequacy annually. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and NARUC filed a claim against Secretary Chu for a fee adjustment to ensure full cost recovery from the Nuclear Waste Fund. DOE had not assessed the fee since FY2008, leading to uncertainty about covering future costs. The court dismissed the initial claim as moot but later ruled that DOE had failed to perform a valid evaluation as required by the NWPA. The court found the Secretary's evaluation of the necessity of the Nuclear Waste Fund fee to be \"legally defective\" and remanded the case to DOE for reevaluation. Congress has not restored funding for the Yucca Mountain facility or the NRC's review of the license application, despite attempts by the House of Representatives to prevent the program's termination. The House passed an appropriations bill in July 2011 to restore funding for the Yucca Mountain repository, but the Senate did not provide any funds for the program. In conference, the funding was removed, but DOE was directed to continue working on a solution for nuclear waste. The conference report directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop a strategy for managing spent nuclear fuel and other waste within 6 months. DOE was also instructed to focus on developing models for potential partnerships and characterizing potential geologic repository media. Additionally, DOE was directed to preserve all documentation related to Yucca Mountain. The House Appropriations Committee approved $25 million for DOE to proceed with the Yucca Mountain license application. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include similar funding but directed DOE to establish a pilot program for a consolidated storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The NRC's delay in making a final decision on the license application withdrawal and halting the review has sparked congressional criticism, particularly towards Chairman Jaczko. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staff investigated NRC decision-making, finding Chairman Jaczko's management style eroded the agency's values. Concern was expressed by ranking Members of various House committees over Jaczko's unilateral decision to halt the Yucca Mountain license review. They criticized his budget guidance based on FY2011 requests instead of FY2010 appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee members warned Chairman Jaczko that his actions could harm the NRC's relationship with the subcommittee. They threatened increased oversight and reconsideration of the NRC's independence if he continued to shut down the Yucca Mountain project. Other Members of Congress requested a formal investigation into Jaczko's actions. The NRC Inspector General released a report on the investigation on June 6, 2011. The NRC Inspector General released a report on June 6, 2011, regarding the chairman's decision to terminate Yucca Mountain license review activities. The report found no illegal actions but highlighted concerns about the chairman's management style and control of information distribution. The report raised concerns about the NRC Chairman's control of information and decision-making process, leading to uncertainty among other commissioners. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 imposed restrictions on the chairman's authority to terminate programs without majority approval. Congressional hearings have focused on the Yucca Mountain controversy and the final report of the Blue Ribbon Commission. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have held hearings on the NRC's actions and Chairman's decision-making process. Concerns have been raised about Commissioner Jaczko's unilateral decisions and frustration among some Commissioners and staff. Resistance to the NRC's shutdown has been mainly from South Carolina and Washington delegations. A growing number of Members have expressed opposition to the Obama Administration's plans to shut down the Yucca Mountain facility. In July 2010, 91 Members of Congress signed a letter asking DOE to halt dismantling operations until the license dispute is resolved. Resolutions in the House support Yucca Mountain as the primary nuclear waste storage site and condemn DOE's motion to withdraw the license application. A Resolution of Inquiry has been introduced to question the President and Secretary. A Resolution of Inquiry has been introduced to request documents from the President and Secretary of Energy regarding the proposed termination of the Yucca Mountain program. Other bills aim to limit DOE's ability to collect NWF fees. House Republicans are strongly opposed to abandoning the Yucca Mountain repository, which could impact the program's fate. Leading committees have voiced their opposition as well. Several influential committees and key figures in the House, including the House Budget Committee, House Committee on Appropriations, House Natural Resources Committee, and House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, oppose the Administration's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain project. Representative Darrell Issa and Speaker of the House John Boehner also oppose the termination, citing the significant investment already made in the storage facility. The dispute over Yucca Mountain will unfold legally before the NRC and in the D.C. Circuit, as well as politically through appropriations disputes, investigations, and oversight hearings. After Gregory Jaczko's resignation as chairman of the NRC, Allison Macfarlane was nominated by President Obama to succeed him. Macfarlane, a critic of the Yucca Mountain facility, is expected to undergo a joint confirmation hearing with Commissioner Svinicki in the Senate. This change in leadership may impact the future of Yucca Mountain politically and in terms of oversight."
