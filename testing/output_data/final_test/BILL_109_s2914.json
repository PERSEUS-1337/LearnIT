    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"DMZ War Veterans Recognition Act of 2006\". The Korean War, also known as the \"Forgotten War\", ended in 1953 with the Korean War Armistice. A later conflict in Korea, referred to as the \"Unknown War\" or \"DMZ War\", took place after the armistice. In 1966, North Korea declared war against the United States, aiming to disperse U.S. forces in Asia. The 124th Special Forces unit of North Korea was trained to target U.S. camps and civilians. Since the Armistice, there have been over 40,000 violations involving US troops in Korea, including confrontations at the Demilitarized Zone and incidents like the capture of the USS Pueblo. Since the end of the Korean War, many US soldiers have died or been wounded in Korea due to hostile fire. Some Korean veterans suffer from exposure to Agent Orange, used around the DMZ in 1968-1969. The hazardous properties of Agent Orange last for at least 100 years, exposing US soldiers serving in the Demilitarized Zone long after its use stopped. US military personnel who served in the Korean War from 1966-1969 received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. Some soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War have been recognized. Some soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War have been nominated posthumously for the Congressional Medal of Honor, awarded the Silver Star or Bronze Star for valor in combat, and received the Purple Heart for being wounded in combat. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Defines \"plaque\" as the one at the Korean War Veterans Memorial and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. PLACEMENT OF COMMEMORATIVE PLAQUE. The Secretary is required to place a plaque at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., to honor those who served in the defense of the Republic of Korea since 1953. The plaque acknowledges the sacrifices made by soldiers from the United States and the Republic of Korea, highlighting their role in the development of South Korea. It also mentions over 40,000 Armistice violation incidents since 1953, resulting in the deaths of over 100 U.S. soldiers and injuries to hundreds more. The soldiers of the United States and the Republic of Korea fought and won the 'DMZ War' between November 1966 and December 1969, causing the majority of Armistice casualties. Their service, sacrifice, and valor are remembered on the 40th anniversary of the war."
