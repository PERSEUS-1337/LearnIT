    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Shelter, Land, and Urban Management (SLUM) Assistance Act of 2011\". Congress finds that over half of the world's population resides in cities, generating most of the global economic output. Additionally, around one billion individuals live in slums, with a projected doubling of this number by 2030. Slums are characterized by poor living conditions such as inadequate access to water and sanitation, overcrowding, and insecure property ownership. Unsafe water and sanitation are major contributors to disease in developing countries. Almost 50 percent of people in developing countries suffer health problems due to water and sanitation deficits. Over 1.1 billion lack access to safe water and nearly 2.5 billion lack sanitation services. The costs of diseases and productivity losses linked to water and sanitation in less developed countries amount to two percent of GDP and up to five percent in sub-Saharan Africa. Insecure property ownership tenure in slums leads to arbitrary rents, forced evictions, and harassment. In 2007, about five million people faced forced evictions, with projections showing an increase to 40-70 million in the next 20 years. Insecurity of tenure hinders economic development, limits investment incentives, and affects families' access to shelter. Women, who make up 66% of the workforce, own less than 15% of global property. Gender discrimination leads to women being disproportionately affected by forced evictions and insecure tenure, making them more vulnerable to poverty and violence. The 2006 National Security Strategy emphasizes assisting the world's poor citizens and integrating them into the global economy. Goal 7 Target 11 of the Millennium Development Goals aims to improve the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers by 2020. The United States used to provide significant overseas development assistance for shelter and affordable housing, but this has decreased in recent years. The statement of policy is outlined in Section 3. The policy of the United States is to prioritize urban development assistance in developing countries, improve urban management, increase property security, and expand access to shelter and essential services for the poor. This includes allocating more bilateral assistance for these programs to prevent waste and duplication. The United States aims to enhance urban development assistance in developing countries by fostering relations with foreign governments, organizations, and businesses supporting similar programs. They seek innovative international mechanisms to improve coordination in sustainable urban development policies and programs. Assistance is provided for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries. Assistance under this section aims to support sustainable urban growth, development, and poverty reduction in densely populated urban areas in developing countries by improving access to basic shelter, affordable housing, safe water, sanitation, and communal infrastructure. Assistance under this section supports sustainable urban growth in developing countries by improving access to basic shelter, affordable housing, safe water, sanitation, and communal infrastructure, including roads, public lighting, and land ownership rights. It also aims to enhance the capacity of developing country governments to plan and manage urban growth effectively and transparently. Assistance under this section aims to support sustainable urban growth in developing countries by improving access to basic shelter, affordable housing, water, sanitation, and infrastructure. This includes promoting functional housing markets, expanding access to investment capital, and strengthening national and municipal financing mechanisms. Supporting institutional, legal, and procedural reforms to enhance rights and access to shelter, urban infrastructure, and property ownership for vulnerable groups, including women, children, the poor, and those in urban slums. Prioritizing cross-sectoral projects that advance these objectives. To support institutional reforms for vulnerable groups, the President is authorized to provide technical and financial assistance to developing countries through various means like public-private partnerships, grants, loans, and investment insurance. This assistance can be provided through existing US Government programs in fiscal year 2012. The United States Government can provide technical and financial assistance for urban development and housing in foreign countries through existing programs and agencies like the United States Agency for International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and other relevant government agencies. The United States Government aims to enhance its operational capabilities and capacities in foreign countries to further urban development and housing initiatives. This includes increasing manpower, expertise diversity, funding levels, and improving coordination among relevant government programs and organizations. The United States Government aims to enhance its operational capabilities and capacities in foreign countries to further urban development and housing initiatives. This includes increasing manpower, expertise diversity, funding levels, and improving coordination among relevant government programs and organizations. Additionally, there is a focus on affordable housing and sustainable urban development strategy. The President, through the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, will develop a strategy for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries. This strategy will involve consultation with relevant government agencies and international organizations to draw upon successful models of urban development. The strategy required for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries includes a review of past programs, assessment of grassroots efforts, and defining short- and long-term objectives with performance measures. The strategy for affordable housing and sustainable urban development in developing countries includes measures to improve existing programs, enhance foreign assistance strategies, develop operational plans, integrate objectives into broader foreign assistance plans, and provide long-term support for sustainable growth initiatives. The strategy involves coordination between US Government agencies, including USAID, HUD, Treasury, and OPIC, as well as collaboration with US-based professionals and organizations like mayors, foundations, and UN agencies for sustainable urban development in developing countries. The Secretary of State must report to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment. Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress detailing the strategy required for sustainable urban development in developing countries. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2012 and beyond to carry out the Act."
