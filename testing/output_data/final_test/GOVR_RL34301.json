    "content": "The U.S. housing market slowdown since early 2006 has caused a rise in late mortgage payments, foreclosures, and bankruptcies. High unemployment worsens the situation, with forecasts of 4.9 million foreclosures between 2009 and 2011. Efforts like the Making Home Affordable Program aim to help struggling homeowners. Mortgage servicers face obstacles in offering loan modifications to help borrowers avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. One major barrier is how servicers are paid, as they rely on a fixed percentage of monthly payments and may not have ownership of the mortgage. This hinders successful loan modifications. Loss mitigation and foreclosure proceedings are often performed simultaneously by mortgage servicers when borrowers become delinquent. Foreclosure proceedings are more streamlined than loss mitigation efforts, which are tailored to individual borrower characteristics. Without structured programs like Making Home Affordable, servicers may not receive compensation for engaging in loss mitigation, which can be more costly and time-consuming. Additionally, servicers may be contractually obligated to advance principal and interest under certain circumstances. Servicers are contractually obligated to advance payments to secondary market participants when borrowers are delinquent. They only receive payment when borrowers resume monthly payments, leading to decreased compensation. However, servicers can recoup fees during foreclosure, often receiving more compensation through foreclosure than loss mitigation. Some argue that voluntary modification programs have not been effective enough. The Attorneys General of 22 states and the District of Columbia urged mortgage servicers to avoid unnecessary foreclosures by modifying unaffordable loans. Despite some major lenders implementing loan modifications, many servicers and investors are still unwilling to act, causing a continued paralysis in the decision-making process. Proponents of amending the Bankruptcy Code believe allowing strip down of primary residences would encourage voluntary modification of mortgages before default, reducing foreclosures and helping families stay in their homes. Senator Durbin emphasized the benefits of this proposal during a Senate Committee hearing. Allowing mortgage modification in bankruptcy can reduce foreclosures and help families stay in their homes. Professor Adam Levitin explained that lenders would prefer modifying loans over foreclosure in a well-functioning market. However, voluntary modification is not happening on a large scale due to various obstacles. Modifying distressed mortgages in bankruptcy could provide a solution. Allowing bankruptcy to serve as a forum for distressed homeowners to restructure their mortgage debts is the most moderate and effective method for resolving the foreclosure crisis and stabilizing mortgage markets. It would provide a way to bypass inefficiencies and give homeowners the option to force a workout of the mortgage, encouraging voluntary modifications from lenders. This approach offers immediate relief and can help foster private solutions to the mortgage crisis. Bankruptcy modification offers immediate relief, solves market problems created by securitization, addresses payment reset shock and negative equity, screens out speculators, spreads burdens between borrowers and lenders, and avoids costs and moral hazard of a government bailout. However, amending the Bankruptcy Code alone may not promote voluntary modifications outside of bankruptcy due to payment, tax, accounting, and litigation concerns. Proposed reforms could potentially increase bankruptcy-filing rates and push millions of borrowers into bankruptcy. Proposed reforms in bankruptcy laws could potentially push millions of borrowers into bankruptcy, causing delays in resolving the current crisis. Some experts believe that allowing modifications of mortgages in bankruptcy may reduce market stability. Professor Mark S. Scarberry and David G. Kittle express concerns about the impact of allowing strip down of primary residence mortgages and bankruptcy \"cramdown\" for home mortgages. Proposed bankruptcy reforms could lead to a surge in bankruptcies, causing financial industry losses and hindering the housing market recovery. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to amend the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including S. 61, H.R. 200, H.R. 1106, and H.R. 225. An unsuccessful amendment, S.Amdt. 1014, aimed to allow judicial modification of mortgages in bankruptcy. The proposed bankruptcy reforms, including bills like S. 61, H.R. 200, H.R. 1106, and H.R. 225, have faced challenges in Congress. Amendments such as S.Amdt. 1014 aimed to allow mortgage modifications in bankruptcy but were not successful. Legislation like S. 896 and H.R. 4173 have also addressed mortgage issues in bankruptcy, with varying outcomes. Bankruptcy provides relief from debts, with Chapter 13 governing reorganizations for individuals. Debtors and creditors can modify contractual obligations outside of bankruptcy, using Chapter 13 as a baseline for negotiations. If parties cannot agree, terms may be adjusted according to the bankruptcy Code if the debtor qualifies. Chapter 13 allows qualified debtors to file for individual reorganization if they cannot meet obligations or negotiate with creditors. Credit counseling is usually required before filing, and a proposed reorganization plan must be submitted to the court. The plan must meet the requirements of Section 1322 of the Bankruptcy Code, and disputes are settled by a bankruptcy judge. The bankruptcy judge has the authority to adjust the value of certain debts, including reducing or discharging unsecured debts and \"strip down\" secured debts to the collateral's fair market value. However, secured debts by the debtor's principal residence cannot be stripped down under Chapter 13. Other real property liens can be modified in bankruptcy reorganizations. Real property liens can be modified in bankruptcy reorganizations, with a real property lien protected as a nondischargeable secured debt up to the collateral's market value. Indebtedness exceeding the collateral's value can be treated as unsecured and potentially dischargeable. While the Code allows modification of mortgages on vacation homes, investment homes, and family farms, it prohibits stripping down claims on mortgages secured by the debtor's primary residence. The 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision overruled the prohibition on modifying liens for primary residences in the Bankruptcy Code. This exception aims to encourage capital flow into the home lending market. Debtors filing for chapter 13 protection can halt foreclosure on their primary residence through the automatic stay. They can also repay mortgage arrearages over three to five years in addition to regular monthly payments. Debtors in Chapter 13 bankruptcy can save their homes by repaying mortgage arrearages over time, in addition to regular payments. Two types of debtors likely to benefit are those with high unsecured debts that can be reduced, allowing more income for mortgage payments, and those who defaulted due to temporary income loss, such as job loss or medical conditions. Homeowners must have sufficient income at the time of filing to meet future obligations. The Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act of 2009 aims to assist families in meeting future mortgage payments and living expenses during bankruptcy. Allowing modifications of debts secured by the primary residence could benefit some homeowners but may also have negative consequences. The foreclosure process varies by state, with some states having a quick process from start to finish. The foreclosure process varies by state, with some states having a quick process from start to finish. Requiring a foreclosure notice before a debtor can utilize bankruptcy strip down may limit effectiveness. Debtors may need to consult a bankruptcy attorney to make an informed decision. If a qualified debtor's mortgage meets requirements, Chapter 13 reorganization plan can modify mortgage debt terms. The Chapter 13 reorganization plan can modify mortgage debt terms in several ways. It may strip down secured claims to fair market value, address changes in variable interest rates, and allow for extended repayment of qualifying mortgage debt. This provision does not affect the payment of other debts beyond the normal three- to five-year term of repayment plans. The bill allows for repayment of modified primary residence debts over 40 or more years, while other debts would not have their repayment period changed. Requiring debtors to pay off a large debt like a primary residence mortgage in five years or less could be difficult. This provision is important as it clarifies the repayment requirements for non-primary residence mortgages. Plans may offer fixed interest rates based on prevailing rates, allowing for reductions to levels consistent with current market conditions. The bill aims to align fixed interest rates with current market conditions for mortgages and may waive prepayment penalties. It also allows for the elimination of credit counseling requirements in cases of foreclosure. H.R. 200 was reported by the House Judiciary Committee in 2009. The House Judiciary Committee reported H.R. 200 in 2009, which aimed to align fixed interest rates with current market conditions for mortgages. The bill made changes to qualifying debts entered into before its enactment date, allowed modification of debts secured by a primary residence, and adjusted the calculation of fixed rates for modified mortgages. H.R. 200 proposed changes to how fixed rates for modified mortgages are calculated, shifting from Treasury securities to an index of average prime rates published by FFIEC. The bill also included a profit-sharing provision for debtors who sell their homes within four years of modification in bankruptcy, requiring them to share proceeds with creditors. The bill includes a profit-sharing provision for debtors selling their homes within four years of modification in bankruptcy. Debtors would pay creditors a percentage of the net proceeds from the sale, with decreasing percentages over the years. The provision aims to limit quick profits from stripped-down mortgages and benefit both creditors and debtors in a stabilized housing market. The extent of secondary mortgage holders' participation in the profit-sharing is unclear. Debtors must attempt loan modification before filing for bankruptcy to modify debts secured by their primary residence. Creditors' response is not required for debtors to benefit from the changes in the Bankruptcy Code. Modifications are not available for debtors who received mortgage credit refinancing, extension, or renewal. The bill would prevent debtors who obtained mortgage credit through misrepresentation or fraud from benefiting from refinancing, extension, or renewal. It clarifies that changes in the Bankruptcy Code would not affect federal mortgage insurance programs. H.R. 1106 differs from H.R. 200 in various ways relevant to the report. H.R. 1106 clarifies profit sharing provisions in bankruptcy, extends sharing for additional years with increasing percentages, and imposes requirements for modifying debts secured by primary residence. H.R. 1106 imposes requirements for modifying debts secured by primary residence, including certifications for loan modifications meeting Obama Plan requirements and restrictions for debtors convicted of mortgage fraud. The bill imposes requirements for modifying debts secured by primary residence, including assessing if modifications are in good faith and allowing interest rate reduction without reducing mortgage principal. The bill applies to bankruptcy cases initiated after enactment, pending on appeal, or appealable at enactment. It allows FHA, VA, and USDA Secretaries to pay claims on modified insured mortgages. Debtors receiving a foreclosure notice on their principal residence must undergo credit counseling within 30 days of filing for bankruptcy. S.Amdt. 1014, similar to H.R. 1106, aimed to allow judicial modification of certain mortgages in bankruptcy. It differed by limiting eligibility based on income levels and offers from lenders. The amendment would only apply to mortgages originated before January 1, 2009, with a principal balance below $729,750, and at least 60 days delinquent. The debtor's eligibility for mortgage modification in bankruptcy was based on income levels, delinquency status, foreclosure notice, and seeking qualified loan offers. Income above 80% of the area median or DTI above 31% would disqualify them. The profit sharing provision of S.Amdt. 1014 required debtors with modified mortgages in bankruptcy to share proceeds with creditors if the home was sold during the case. H.R. 225 mirrored S. 61 terms, but modifications were limited to debts before the bill's enactment."
