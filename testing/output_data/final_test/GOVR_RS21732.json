    "content": "Foreign nationals in the United States are classified as resident or nonresident aliens for federal tax purposes, regardless of their immigration status. This classification determines tax obligations, rates, and eligibility for tax treaties. An individual is considered a resident alien if they meet the Green card test by being a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. during the current year. The substantial presence test determines if an individual is a resident alien in the United States based on presence for at least 31 days in the current year and 183 days in the current year and previous two years. Certain exceptions exist for nonresident alien classification, such as closer ties to a foreign country or being in the U.S. for fewer than 183 days. An individual in the United States under certain visas may be treated as a nonresident alien if they comply with visa requirements. Exceptions to the substantial presence test for nonresident alien classification include employees of foreign governments, regular commuters from Canada or Mexico, and athletes in charitable sporting events. Residency definitions in income tax treaties override these rules, making individuals nonresident aliens for U.S. tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Code treats individuals in the United States without authorization the same as other foreign nationals for tax purposes. Unauthorized individuals are classified as resident or nonresident aliens based on the \"substantial presence\" test. This classification does not impact immigration status. Those ineligible for a Social Security number file tax returns using an individual taxpayer identifier. Individuals ineligible for an SSN use an ITIN to file tax returns, making them unable to claim the EITC. Legislation has been introduced to require an SSN for claiming certain tax credits. The SSN requirement for claiming tax credits may be imprecise, as it could affect resident aliens with legal SSNs who are not currently present in the US. This requirement may also impact families with members lacking an SSN. Congress exempted military members from this requirement in the past. Resident aliens are subject to the same federal income tax laws as US citizens. Resident aliens, like U.S. citizens, are taxed on all income earned in the United States and abroad. They file taxes using Form 1040, can claim deductions and credits, and are taxed at the same rates as U.S. citizens. Nonresident aliens are taxed on U.S. source income, with different rates for income connected to a U.S. trade or business. Nonresident aliens with certain visas are considered engaged in a trade or business in the United States. Income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business is taxed similarly to U.S. citizens' income. Non-effectively connected income is taxed at a flat rate of 30%. Nonresident aliens file taxes using Form 1040NR and are subject to withholding on certain types of income. Nonresident aliens may have U.S. source income exempt from taxation under certain circumstances, such as interest income not connected to a U.S. trade or business. Compensation for services performed in the U.S. for a foreign employer, limited stay duration, and income below $3000 may also be exempt. Certain visa holders, employees of foreign governments, and crew members of foreign vessels or aircraft may qualify for tax exemptions. Income may also be exempt under a treaty. Tax treaties provide benefits to nonresident and resident aliens, including reducing the flat rate on U.S. source income and exempting gain from the sale of personal property. Treaties may also exempt personal service compensation if the alien is in the U.S. for a specified period or if the compensation is below a certain amount. Aliens leaving the U.S. must obtain a sailing permit from the IRS to show compliance with income tax laws, or face examination and potential tax payment at departure. Tax treaties exempt personal service compensation for aliens in the U.S. for a specified period or if the compensation is below a certain amount. The U.S. has treaties with various countries including Armenia, Australia, Austria, and many others. Nonresident aliens working in the United States are subject to FICA taxes on compensation but not SECA taxes. Certain services are exempt from these taxes, including those performed by foreign workers in specific visa categories and employees of foreign governments or international organizations. The United States has totalization agreements with many countries to avoid double coverage and taxation for individuals working in two countries. These agreements generally state that individuals are only covered by the social security program in the country where they work. Self-employed individuals pay social security taxes in the country where they reside. The United States has totalization agreements with several countries to prevent double coverage and taxation for individuals working in multiple countries. These agreements typically specify that individuals are covered by the social security program in the country where they work. Self-employed individuals pay social security taxes in their country of residence. Additionally, the United States has signed agreements with various countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. There is also a controversial agreement with Mexico that has not yet been approved by Congress. Legislation such as the Loophole Elimination and Verification Enforcement Act (LEAVE Act) has been introduced to address these issues. The Loophole Elimination and Verification Enforcement Act (LEAVE Act) aims to address issues with the U.S.-Mexico totalization agreement. Another bill, the Social Security Totalization Agreement Reform Act of 2011 (STAR Act), seeks to fix the legislative veto problem in the approval process for totalization agreements."
