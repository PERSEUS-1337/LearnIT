King Cove, Alaska, located 625 air miles from Anchorage on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula, is one of the most geographically isolated areas in the state. Traveling in and out of King Cove directly by air is often dangerous and impractical due to adverse weather and physical topography. The area is the homeland of the Aleut people, federally recognized as indigenous peoples of the United States, who have lived in King Cove for over 4,000 years. The King Cove community, known as \"Agdaagux,\" is recognized by the Agdaagux Tribal Council as the descendants of the original Aleut inhabitants. The Cold Bay Airport, located 25 miles north of King Cove, is crucial for the residents' life, safety, and health needs, but there is no surface access between the two locations. The land between King Cove and Cold Bay is owned by the Federal Government as part of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge and managed as wilderness. The Agdaagux Tribal Council claims they were not consulted before the designation, despite notice being sent to people in the US, Canada, and Europe in 1969 and 1970. The Agdaagux Tribal Council claims they were not consulted by the Federal Government before designating the land between King Cove and Cold Bay as part of the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. They believe this lack of consultation has led to serious health consequences for King Cove residents who cannot reach timely medical assistance in Anchorage, Alaska. The Agdaagux Tribal Council supports the construction of a road between King Cove and Cold Bay Airport to provide timely medical assistance for residents and express self-determination for the Aleut people. The Agdaagux Tribal Council supports the construction of a road between King Cove and Cold Bay Airport to provide timely medical assistance for residents and express self-determination for the Aleut people.
