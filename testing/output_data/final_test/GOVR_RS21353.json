It aims to reduce poverty and increase economic growth in Africa by improving policy-making capacities. NEPAD has gained support from African leaders, regional organizations, and international multilateral organizations. NEPAD aims to spur economic growth in Africa by increasing capital flows through private sector investment, development assistance, debt relief, and market access. It also focuses on improving governance, economic policy-making, infrastructure investments, social services, education, poverty eradication, and promoting peace and human rights. Sectoral investment targets include agriculture, energy, environment, infrastructure, and institutions. NEPAD aims to increase economic diversification and trade, strengthen linkages among African countries, and integrate Africa's economy with other regions. It seeks to protect Africa from negative effects of globalization while critics warn of potential problems with increased integration with global markets. Critics fear that Africa's natural resource extraction may lead to environmental degradation and exploitation by global economic actors. They also argue that Africa's lack of industrial capacity hinders its potential for value-added processing of export commodities. NEPAD aims to promote good governance, democratization, and public sector reforms to attract foreign investment and aid flows to Africa. NEPAD is a major policy vehicle for African Union, promoting market-oriented economic and governance reforms for socio-economic policy success and political stability in Africa. It emphasizes that policies should be implemented and monitored by African states themselves, not foreign actors. The African Peer Review Mechanism is a key means of implementing NEPAD's governance goals. The AU summit of heads of state is the supreme decision-making body for NEPAD, with the Implementation Committee reporting annually to the summit. The Committee was enlarged in 2002 to include additional representatives from AU sub-regions. The NEPAD Steering Committee coordinates relations with lenders and donors, supported by a Secretariat overseeing marketing, communication, finance, and administrative functions. NEPAD includes a Secretariat overseeing marketing, communication, finance, and administrative functions. It also has a private component, the NEPAD Business Group, which coordinates relations with private firms for trade and investment opportunities in Africa. The U.S. Corporate Council on Africa is a member of the NEPAD Business Group and provides support for NEPAD in the United States. NEPAD aims to reduce poverty in Africa by filling a resource gap of 12% of GDP, requiring $64 billion annually. It calls for a $10 billion increase in public health funding and emphasizes the need for external resources like debt reduction and overseas development assistance. Private capital flows are also seen as important for achieving NEPAD goals. The NEPAD Implementation Committee was expanded in 2002 to broaden support and accommodate new leaders. Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi advocated for African integration but emphasized political autonomy and rejected donor conditions on development assistance. He initiated the OAU reform process leading to the AU's formation. Al-Qadhafi initiated OAU reform leading to AU formation but criticized NEPAD as a project of former colonisers. Despite initial differences, Libya accepted NEPAD and joined the Implementation Committee. NEPAD is viewed as state-centric, lacking input from opposition parties or civil society. Public engagement is seen as crucial for NEPAD's success, a concern acknowledged by NEPAD architects like President Mbeki. The African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) is a voluntary monitoring system for African states to adhere to governance goals outlined in the NEPAD Declaration. Despite assurances that it is not punitive, critics fear it may lead to donor-imposed reforms on NEPAD. President Mbeki and other architects support public engagement for NEPAD's success. The APRM, part of NEPAD, faced scrutiny over its effectiveness and purpose after President Mbeki's remarks. Despite concerns, the APRM will assess economic performance, governance, and human rights. Implementation activities for NEPAD focus on creating reforms tied to aid conditions. NEPAD implementation activities focus on creating organizational structures and coordinating policy with the African Union. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa and the African Development Bank are technical coordinating institutions. Public outreach efforts target diverse forums and African countries. Meetings refine priorities and set guidelines, workshops coordinate roles, and conferences highlight private sector and civil society contributions. Sector-focused program assessments reports have been undertaken. The 6th NEPAD Heads of State Implementation Summit in March 2003 considered sector-focused program assessments reports. Donor governments and international financial institutions have expressed support for NEPAD and may provide assistance. The G-8 Group summit in June 2002 endorsed the broad thrust of NEPAD, with a focus on partnerships with African countries reflecting NEPAD commitments. The NEPAD commitments focus on countries demonstrating good governance, rule of law, investment in people, economic growth, and poverty alleviation. Efforts will be matched with a commitment to promote peace, security, expertise, trade, investment, and development assistance in Africa. Some analysts question the feasibility of increased capital flows to Africa and view the $64 billion figure as a negotiation target rather than a set NEPAD requirement. The G-8 Kananaskis summit statement on NEPAD emphasizes the need for additional resources to support Africa's development. G8 leaders proposed allocating half of new development assistance announced at Monterrey to Africa, totaling US$6 billion per year by 2006. NEPAD advocates stress that the initiative is African-led despite the importance of external financing. NEPAD advocates emphasize African control and reject policy conditions for external financing. Donor governments, including the US, stress the need for political reform in NEPAD. The Bush Administration supports NEPAD as an African initiative but has not provided specific assistance, citing existing development aid to Africa. Development assistance and policy reforms in Africa are supported by the US through existing and upcoming assistance programs. Congressional reactions to NEPAD have been mixed, with some members urging support for NEPAD and its economic development goals, while others have offered more qualified views. NEPAD is seen as relevant in light of the Bush Administration's Millennium Challenge Account, with a need to understand how these initiatives complement each other. Calls for greater development aid, whether from Africa or domestically, must address the fact that past aid efforts in Africa have often yielded minimal results. Some policymakers have expressed concerns about future U.S. support for NEPAD, emphasizing the need for African leaders to take concrete actions against undemocratic member states. Specifically, the reluctance of African leaders to criticize Zimbabwe's government for human rights abuses has been highlighted as a point of contention."
