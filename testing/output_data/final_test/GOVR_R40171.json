    "content": "Title II of WRERA includes provisions to protect individuals and retirement plans from stock market declines and economic challenges. This includes a temporary waiver of required minimum distributions and relief from funding rules for single and multi-employer plans. These provisions allow for a delay in distributions and meeting pension funding obligations to give plans more time to recover from investment losses. Required minimum distributions are necessary for retirement accounts to maintain their tax-favorable status. They must start by age 70 \u00bd or retirement for employer-sponsored plans, and by age 70 \u00bd for traditional IRAs. Beneficiaries face alternative minimum distribution requirements if the account holder passes away. Failure to make a required distribution incurs a 50% excise tax. Section 201 of WRERA suspends minimum distribution requirements for defined contribution arrangements, including IRAs, for calendar year 2009. This allows plan participants and beneficiaries to choose whether or not to take required minimum distributions for 2009, but distributions for other years are not waived. The Internal Revenue Code also sets minimum funding standards for defined benefit plans. The PPA introduced stricter funding standards for single-employer plans, requiring plan assets to equal 100% of plan liabilities. If assets fall below the funding target, the minimum required contribution includes the target normal cost and a shortfall amortization base. A special exemption applies if assets meet or exceed the funding target, resulting in a zero shortfall amortization amount. The PPA introduced stricter funding standards for single-employer plans, requiring assets to equal 100% of liabilities. A transition rule allowed plans to gradually increase assets over three years (2008-2010) to avoid establishing a shortfall amortization base. The rule applied if assets were 92% funded in 2008, 94% in 2009, and 96% in 2010. The transition rule would not apply after 2008 if the shortfall amortization base was zero. Section 202 of WRERA allows plans to follow the transition rule even if the plan's shortfall amortization base was not zero in the preceding year. This provision gives plans additional time to reach 100 percent funding, which may be challenging due to market declines. Underfunded single-employer defined benefit plans may face restrictions on benefits if their AFTAP is less than 60 percent. Section 203 of WRERA allows plans to use the previous year's AFTAP to determine benefit accrual restrictions for the first plan year starting from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. This provision helps plans with lower funding levels to continue providing future benefit accruals. Plans with higher funding levels for the current year are not affected by this rule. Under section 432 of the Internal Revenue Code, multiemployer plans failing to meet funding levels may face additional obligations and benefit restrictions based on whether they are in \"endangered\" or \"critical\" status. Endangered plans, less than 80% funded, must adopt a funding improvement plan to increase funding percentage and avoid deficiencies. Plans in critical status are less than 65% funded. Plans in critical status, less than 65% funded, must develop a rehabilitation plan to improve funding levels over a 10-year period. This plan may include reducing expenditures and future benefit accruals, with employers potentially facing surcharges. An actuary must certify the plan's status annually. Under section 204 of WRERA, a sponsor of a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan may elect to maintain the plan's certified status from the previous year, avoiding additional funding requirements if the plan was not in endangered or critical status. Plans in critical status must still meet certain requirements despite the freezing of certification status. Section 432 of the Internal Revenue Code states that multiemployer plans in endangered or critical status must meet additional funding requirements. Endangered plans need a funding improvement plan, while critical plans require a rehabilitation plan. Plans have a 10-year period to meet funding percentage targets, with seriously endangered plans given 15 years. Section 205 of WRERA allows plan sponsors to extend the funding improvement or rehabilitation period by three years, giving plans more time to meet obligations. Plans in seriously endangered status have an 18-year funding improvement period. The WRERA made technical corrections to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, allowing plans to extend their funding improvement or rehabilitation period by three years. One of the corrections included the ability for non-spouse beneficiaries to rollover distributions from retirement plans tax-free. Certain tax-qualified plans, like a 401(k), can offer a direct rollover of distributions to nonspouse beneficiaries such as siblings, parents, or domestic partners. The rollover must go to an inherited IRA, not included in the beneficiary's income for that year. The WRERA clarifies that nonspouse beneficiaries can make these rollovers, and plans must provide notices for qualification. The WRERA requires rollover notices for plan qualification, effective from January 1, 2010. Employers terminating fully funded defined benefit plans must comply with requirements for missing participants. An annuity can be purchased or benefits transferred to the PBGC for missing participants. The missing participant requirements now apply to multiemployer plans, defined contribution plans, and plans without PBGC termination insurance. WRERA specifies that the requirements apply to plans without employer contributions. The WRERA requires rollover notices for plan qualification and narrows missing participant requirements to defined contribution plans. It also imposes funding rules for single-employer defined benefit plans below certain levels, preventing prohibited payments if funding is less than 60 percent. Consent is needed for vested benefits over $5,000, exempt if below that amount. Section 101 of WRERA amends the definition of \"prohibited payment\" to exclude benefits that can be distributed without participant consent, allowing underfunded plans to make lump sum payments of $5,000 or less. This applies to plan years starting in 2008. ERISA requires extensive notice and reporting for pension plans, including disclosures for terminating single-employer defined benefit plans. Section 105 of WRERA clarifies requirements for distress terminations. In order for a plan to terminate in a distress termination, the plan administrator must provide specific information to affected parties, including certification by an enrolled actuary regarding plan assets and benefit liabilities. Confidentiality provisions exist in involuntary terminations to protect the identity of affected parties. Section 105 of WRERA extends this confidentiality protection. The WRERA extends confidentiality protection for disclosure of information by the PBGC. Roth IRAs allow for non-deductible contributions with tax-free distributions. Section 125 of WRERA allows qualified airline employees to transfer payments to a Roth IRA within 180 days. This can result in tax benefits as qualified distributions from Roth IRAs are not included in gross income. The former employee may benefit from transferring payments to a Roth IRA, as qualified distributions are tax-free. The value of plan assets must be determined to calculate the minimum required contribution to a defined benefit plan. The Internal Revenue Code allows plans to average fair market values of assets for funding rules, with certain limitations. The averaging method for determining plan asset values under Section 121 of WRERA can help plan sponsors by adjusting for contributions, distributions, and expected investment earnings. This provision may lead to smaller underfunded amounts and required contributions. The PPA also offers relaxed funding requirements for defined benefit plans in the airline industry, allowing sponsors to amortize unfunded liabilities over a 10-year period. The PPA allows plan sponsors to amortize unfunded liabilities over 10 years or 17 years under special rules. Sponsors choosing the 17-year option must freeze some benefits and comply with accrual requirements. The value of plan assets is determined by fair market value or averaging method as per WRERA Section 126. The value of plan assets is determined by fair market value or averaging method as per WRERA Section 126."
