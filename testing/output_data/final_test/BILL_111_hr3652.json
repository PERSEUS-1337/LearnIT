    "content": "The \"Consistency, Accuracy, Responsibility, and Excellence in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy Act of 2009\" aims to enhance healthcare quality by improving the safety and precision of medical imaging and radiation therapy, reducing duplication of services, and lowering costs. It amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. Effective January 1, 2013, personnel performing medical imaging or radiation therapy procedures must be qualified by possessing certification in the relevant modality or state licensure. State licensure, certification, or registration requirements must meet or exceed standards set by the Secretary, without diminishing State authority to define these requirements or scope of practice. The Secretary cannot mandate State licensure. The section outlines licensure requirements for individuals performing medical imaging examinations or radiation therapy procedures, with exemptions for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The Secretary, in consultation with experts, establishes minimum standards for compliance.

The Secretary will determine factors for certification organizations in medical imaging or radiation therapy services, including education requirements, fees, accreditation of exams, and timely application review. Additionally, the Secretary will establish a method for recognizing individuals with equivalent education, training, and experience, which expires seven years after enactment. Individuals must meet specific criteria to be recognized. Prior to enactment of this section, individuals performing or planning the technical component of medical imaging or radiation therapy treatments are ineligible to take the licensure or certification examination for that discipline. The Secretary will promulgate regulations for designating certification organizations by July 1, 2012, and make determinations regarding all certification organizations by January 1, 2013. The Secretary will periodically review and revise the list of certification organizations designated under regulations, considering established factors.
