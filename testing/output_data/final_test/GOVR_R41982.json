    "content": "President Obama signed H.R. 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, which included $39,600 million for DHS, a reduction from the President's base request. He also signed H.R. 3672, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012, providing $6,400 million for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The government passed multiple short-term continuing resolutions (CRs) to fund operations at reduced rates in order to comply with budget caps. These CRs included funding to replenish the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and temporarily replaced the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill on September 7. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its version of the FY2012 DHS Appropriations bill on September 7, 2011, with a net discretionary appropriation of $41,000 million for DHS for FY2012, excluding funding for the global war on terrorism and FEMA disaster relief. The Senate-reported bill was $2,533 million below the Administration's request and $667 million below the amount provided under P.L. 112-10. After floor action, the House bill carried a net discretionary appropriation of $40,592 million for DHS for FY2012. Increases proposed above the committee-recommended level for DHS activities included $320 million for grant programs for firefighters and $10 million for CBP to improve cellular communications along the southern border. An amendment added $1,000 million in emergency funding for disaster relief, offset by transferring $1,000 million and rescinding $500 million in unspent funds from a Department of Energy program. The Administration requested a net appropriation of $45,015 million for the automotive advanced technology program in FY2012, a 3.7% increase from FY2011. Total budget authority for DHS in FY2012 is $57,079 million compared to $55,783 million in FY2011. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, DHS Expenditure Plan for FY2011, and S.Rept.112-74. Information on FY2012 request is from President's Budget Documents, FY2012 DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, and FY2012 DHS Budget in Brief. House and Senate bill information is from H.R. 2017. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles. Total budget authority for DHS in FY2012 is $57,079 million. Data sources include President's Budget Documents and Congressional reports. Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 contains appropriations for various offices and agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. Title III includes appropriations for the National Protection and Programs Directorate, Office of Health Affairs, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Title IV covers U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Science and Technology Directorate, and Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Title V contains general provisions providing congressional direction to the department. The bill's structure may differ between the House and Senate. The bill's structure is not always symmetrical between House and Senate versions. Additional titles may be added to address specific issues, such as emergency appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund. Federal government spending involves a multi-step process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and payment. Budget authority is determined through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, setting the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized. Budget authority enacted by Congress dictates federal agencies' spending limits. It can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year, with obligations incurred through personnel employment, contracts, and services. Outlays represent actual funds spent in a fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up gross budget authority, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts, excluding entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority provided in laws other than appropriation acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds collected by the federal government are not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. The DHS net discretionary budget authority is determined by subtracting fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset agency discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending, such as entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not annually appropriated by Congress. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among the appropriations committees for enactment in annual appropriations. The congressional budget process involves two stages: first, overall spending totals are set in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, then appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds to subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These allocations, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. The FY2012 appropriations bills are the first affected by the Budget Control Act, which established spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets separate caps for security and non-security spending in FY2012, with adjustments allowed for certain circumstances like overseas contingency operations and disaster relief. The report discusses adjustments to budget authority provided in appropriations proposals to align with the Budget Control Act caps. DHS's budget has been influenced by emergency spending and overseas contingency operations. Adjustments for disaster relief are determined by OMB using a specific formula based on past spending. The fiscal year includes a rolling average of disaster relief spending over the last ten years, along with the unused amount of the potential adjustment from the previous year. OMB determined a $11,252 million allowable adjustment for disaster relief in FY2012, with $10,453 million already exercised. DHS Appropriations from FY2003 to FY2012 are presented in Table 3, showing enacted amounts in current dollars. Table 4 summarizes enacted totals for FY2010 and FY2011 compared to the FY2012 appropriations. It includes net budget authority, emergency spending, and general administrative expenses of DHS. This covers various offices under Title I, such as OSEM, USM, OCAO, OCHCO, OCPO, OCFO, and OCIO. Later tables will detail fees and mandatory spending. Table 5 displays appropriations for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 for various DHS offices, including OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. P.L. 112-74 allocated $677 million for departmental management in Title I, representing a 7.4% decrease from the President's request. The conference report for P.L. 112-74 allocates $215 million for headquarters consolidation in Title V of the bill. Funds are withheld from the Office of the Secretary until a plan for implementing biometric exit is submitted to Congress. The Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement is only funded to continue operations during its termination, with funds possibly transferred to the Office of Policy. The termination of CNE aims to streamline Executive Branch efforts for counternarcotics enforcement. The conference report allocates funds for headquarters consolidation and withholds funds from the Office of the Secretary until a plan for implementing biometric exit is submitted. The Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement may have its funds transferred to the Office of Policy to streamline counternarcotics enforcement efforts. The Chief Administrative Officer receives $5 million for facility improvements and relocation costs. Expenditure plans for FY2012 for agencies under OSEM must be submitted by March 30, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security is criticized for the lack of timeliness in submitting required expenditure plans and quarterly reports to Congress. They are urged to prioritize these programs and adhere to specified deadlines. Additionally, DHS is required to review and propose changes to reception and representation expenses for alignment with missions and responsibilities. The Privacy Officer must report to Congress within 30 days to implement recommendations for fixing problems with the Department's FOIA activities. $3.4 million is allocated to enhance the department's acquisition capabilities. Components are encouraged to use existing funds to hire and train qualified acquisition personnel. The conference report directs the FY 2013 budget justifications to include a Future Years Homeland Security Program budget accessible to the public. It mentions an $11 million reduction to the OCFO due to the cancellation of the TASC project. The report emphasizes keeping the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations informed about financial management improvement plans. The conference report directs the OCFO's Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation to evaluate the department's approach to acquiring technology and systems for its nuclear detection mission. General provisions in P.L. 112-74 related to departmental management and operations include CFO reports on budget execution and staffing, an appropriation of $70 million for data center migration, and requirements for the CIO to provide updates to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Senate-reported bill for departmental management in Title I would have provided appropriations for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO, with reductions compared to the President's request. No funding was recommended for DHS Headquarters Consolidation under Title I, but $56 million was provided in Title V, totaling $692 million for departmental management. The Senate-reported bill proposed a decrease of $40 million, or 5.5%, from the President's request for DHS funding, excluding the DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths. $35 million of the appropriation was designated to be withheld until DHS submits a plan for biometric tracking of foreign visitors leaving the country by air in FY2012. Funding was allocated to enhance the acquisition workforce and add cost analysts to oversee large-scale procurements in DHS' major components. The OCAO received $5 million for its operations. The OCAO received $5 million for maintenance and upgrades at the Nebraska Avenue Complex. The OCIO recommended appropriation of $268 million includes $106 million for salaries and expenses and $162 million for technology investments. The Senate committee report directs various offices within the Department of Homeland Security to provide briefings and reports on different topics, including immigration enforcement programs, REAL ID implementation, and resources in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Senate committee report directs DHS components to provide updates on user fee collections, leverage Science and Technology Directorate expertise, and evaluate establishing a National Guard cybersecurity team. The report discusses the recommended command hierarchy, organizational responsibilities, and critical relationships for cybersecurity. The House-passed bill would provide reduced appropriations compared to the President's request, with a total funding of $342 million for management activities. No funding was recommended for DHS headquarters consolidation. The House Appropriations committee-approved version of H.R. 2017 recommended $330 million more than the house finally approved for management accounts, with funding decreases across various departments compared to the President's request. No funding was recommended for DHS Headquarters Consolidation. Total funding recommended for management activities was $674 million, a decrease of $58 million from the President's request. The Secretary is directed to submit the National Preparedness Goal and System to the House under the OSEM appropriation. The House Appropriations committee-approved version of H.R. 2017 recommended $330 million more than the house finally approved for management accounts, with funding decreases across various departments compared to the President's request. No funding was recommended for DHS Headquarters Consolidation. The Secretary is directed to submit the National Preparedness Goal and System to the House under the OSEM appropriation. H.R. 2017 as reported and passed by the House provided that $63 million of the appropriation could not be obligated until the committees received the two submissions and the Secretary's determination on implementation of biometric air exit. Under the USM appropriation, $5 million would have been available until September 30, 2016, for the alteration and improvement of facilities, tenant improvements, and relocation costs to consolidate the department's headquarters operations at the Nebraska Avenue Complex and $17 million would have been available until September 30, 2014, for the Human Resources Information. The House committee report includes directives for the Human Resources Information Technology program, emphasizing the need for complete explanations and justifications for proposed legislative language. The report also questions the hypothetical nature of $645 million in new fee revenue to be raised through TSA. The House committee report questions the hypothetical nature of new fee revenue to be raised through TSA, as the fee increases have not been authorized. The Committee disagrees with the Administration's revenue estimates and is compelled to fill the budgetary hole without cutting funding for critical homeland security missions. They will reject funding proposals based on hypothetical scenarios and legislation not yet enacted into law. $72.3 million would have been available until September 30 under the CIO appropriation. Under the CIO appropriation, $72.3 million would have been available until September 30, 2014, for development and acquisition of information technology equipment and services. The CIO would have been required to submit an expenditure plan for all IT projects funded under the Office of the CIO or by multiple components of the department within 60 days of enactment. The plan would include project details, funding sources, costs, and projected savings. The Secretary was directed to submit a report by December 1, 2011, listing efficiencies to be achieved. The House committee directs the department to submit a report by December 1, 2011, detailing efficiencies being implemented, positions to be converted from contractors to Federal positions, additional oversight personnel needed, and reforms in the headquarters structure. An independent evaluation of the efficiency review is also required, with results to be provided within 30 days. The OCIO is directed to brief the Committees on Appropriations on these matters. OCIO is directed to brief the Committees on Appropriations within 60 days on Department-wide efforts to combat insider threats in the cyber domain, including monitoring unauthorized removal of sensitive material, changes post-security breaches, restrictions on access to databases, and plans to enhance information security at DHS. DHS is encouraged to seek direct hiring authority for intelligence analyst vacancies to prevent delays in the hiring process. The FY2012 budget request showed increases in funding for OSEM, USM, and OCFO, while there was a decrease in funding for OCIO. The total request for departmental management activities in FY2012 was $732 million. The OCIO requested $278 million to enhance cyber security capabilities. The Office of Accessible Systems and Technology within the OCIO account requested $1 million and three FTEs to support technical assistance and accessibility helpdesk services for DHS employees with disabilities. The OCFO requested $62 million and 232 total FTEs for improvements to the financial process at the headquarters. The department plans to convert contractor positions to DHS positions as part of a balanced workforce strategy. The OCFO requested $640,000 and three FTEs to establish a system for protecting sensitive information. The OCHCO manages human resources at DHS and provides oversight and guidance for various functions under human capital management. The OCHCO oversees human resources at DHS, implementing the Human Capital Operational Plan with a focus on talent management, performance culture, learning and development, and service excellence. The HRIT program aims to modernize DHS HRIT infrastructure for flexibility and management information. Funding details for the OCHCO are provided for FY2011 and FY2012. The OCHCO appropriation for FY2012 is $39 million, $6 million less than the President's request. $25 million is for salaries and expenses, and $14 million is for human resources. $688,000 is allocated to enhance the Balanced Workforce Program office, workforce training, and leadership development. The USM and CHCO are directed to brief the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by February 15, 2012, on the Secretary's Efficiency Review and the Balanced Workforce Initiative. The curr_chunk discusses the efficiencies identified and progress in implementing them, additional oversight personnel required for specific procurements, reforms in headquarters structure improving support for field operations, status of the Balanced Workforce Initiative, conversion of contractor positions to Federal positions, estimated savings, and independent evaluation of efficiency review. This information is in line with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations' directives. Title V of Division D of P.L. 112-74 includes provisions related to personnel, such as prohibiting the use of funds for reorganization authority, requiring new hires to be verified through the E-Verify Program, and prohibiting first-class travel and adverse personnel actions for employees using protective equipment. Officials must report or certify to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations without delegating authority unless authorized. Section 554 of the legislation allows administrative law judges to serve on an arbitration panel for FEMA's Public Assistance program. The Senate report provides directions to DHS, including briefing on human resources services provided by FLETC instead of OCHCO. Beginning in FY2012, FLETC will provide the department's human resources services instead of OCHCO. DHS is directed to review overtime limitations for law enforcement personnel for FY2013 budget adjustments. The FY2012 budget requested $45 million and 163 FTEs for OCHCO, with a $3 million increase in funding from FY2011. HRIT funding for FY2012 was $17 million with an increase of 8 FTEs. OCHCO requested funds for a leadership program and workforce training programs. The DHS justification includes $2 million and seven FTEs for workforce training programs to address skill gaps in critical occupations, implement career paths, rotational assignments, and provide training in foreign languages and employee preparedness. OCHCO initiatives involve identifying executive resource requirements, reforming hiring processes, and establishing a department-wide drug testing program for sensitive positions. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the Washington, DC area, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. To address this, a $3.4 billion master plan was approved in 2006 to create a new unified DHS headquarters. The $3.4 billion master plan for a new DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia is the largest federal office construction project since the Pentagon. $1.4 billion will be funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the GSA. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is nearing completion with funding from Congress. Not all DHS functions in the DC area will move to the new facility, as the completed St. Elizabeths campus will house headquarters functions and command facilities, but not the entire department. The Administration has sought funding for consolidation of offices to save money on lease costs. P.L. 112-74 provides $56 million for headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths. Questions remain over whether the budget for the General Services Administration will be adequate to support necessary infrastructure for the Coast Guard headquarters building. Funding is provided in the general provisions of the DHS appropriations act, prioritizing the completion of Phase 1 of the project. The Senate recommended $56 million for the Coast Guard headquarters facility, well below the President's request. They also required DHS to provide an expenditure plan within 60 days. The House did not recommend funding for the St. Elizabeths project. The Committee expressed concerns about costs and schedule control for the project. In 2010, it was evident that cost controls were crucial for the project, but costs increased to $3.6 billion due to the General Services Administration's share. The Committee highlighted the need for coordination between funding and management, noting that the proposed DHS request may not align with necessary GSA funding. Delays are already being considered in the Department's planning, with work on the FEMA section of the facility being postponed. Minority views expressed concern over the lack of funding for the new DHS headquarters and consolidation of leased property, deeming it a shortsighted decision. The decision to deny additional funding for the DHS headquarters project will result in higher costs and delays in the construction timeline. The cost of the project has already increased by $200 million, from $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. The Administration requested $215 million for headquarters consolidation, including $160 million for new construction at St. Elizabeths. The Administration proposed a programmatic increase in Title I funding by $138 million. Additionally, $217 million was requested for the General Services Administration budget for a project including highway alterations. Changes have been made to the DHS intelligence mission and organization, with the establishment of the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. The IAIP Directorate has 19 functions, including analyzing law enforcement and intelligence information to identify terrorist threats, develop a national plan for securing critical infrastructure, and improve information sharing policies within the government. Former Secretary Chertoff's Second Stage Review reorganized the DHS intelligence structure in 2005, disbanding IAIP and placing the Office of Infrastructure Protection within the National Protection and Programs Directorate. The Office of Information Analysis was renamed the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, with the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Analysis becoming the Chief Intelligence Officer. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 was amended in 2007 to codify the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Infrastructure Protection. The DHS reorganization in 2005 under Secretary Chertoff established the Office of Intelligence and Analysis as the department's Chief Intelligence Officer. In 2008, the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning was created to support crisis and contingency planning. Funds in this account support both intelligence analysis and operations coordination. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and sharing intelligence information within DHS and with homeland security partners. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning manages the National Operations Center for domestic incident management. Congress allocated $338 million for the Analysis and Operations account, a slight increase from the previous year. The budget request for the Analysis and Operations (AOO) account was decreased by $9 million (-2.6%) from the House-passed version of H.R. 2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $339 million for the AOO account, which was an increase of $5 million (+1.5%) over the enacted FY2011 amount and a decrease of $16 million (-5%) from the budget request. The committee denied a request for the C2 Gap Filler Technology initiative due to insufficient justification and required the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2012 within 60 days. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer must submit an expenditure plan for FY2012 within 60 days of enactment. Quarterly briefings on placing intelligence professionals in state and local fusion centers are required. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $344 million for the Analysis and Operations (AOO) account, $11 million below the President's FY2012 request. The committee denied funding for the C2 Gap Filler Technology initiative due to insufficient justification. The FY2012 request for the AOO account was $355 million, a $20 million increase from FY2011. The OIG receives $117 million in appropriations, $27 million less than the President's request, with a $24 million transfer from the FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The appropriation includes no less than $4 million for integrity investigations, and the IG must submit a plan for integrity oversight funds within 30 days of enactment. The OIG receives $117 million in appropriations, with a $24 million transfer from the FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The IG must submit a plan for integrity oversight funds. In the Senate-reported version of the bill, the OIG would have received $125 million in direct appropriations, plus a $16 million transfer from the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund. The Administration requested a funding level of $144 million and 676 FTE, an increase of $30 million over FY2011. The Office of Emergency Management Oversight, within the OIG, plans to complete 15 management reviews of FEMA programs and operations and 75 reviews of FEMA grants in FY2012. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry along the border, with a priority mission of preventing terrorism. CBP is responsible for inspecting people and goods at ports of entry to prevent terrorism and intercept illegal items. It enforces over 400 laws and regulations on behalf of multiple government agencies. CBP is comprised of various inspection functions and agencies, including the U.S. Border Patrol. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides funding for CBP. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74) provides $10,155 million for CBP in FY2012, with estimated fee collections of $1,496 million. The funding level reflects the passage of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 112-42), which is expected to generate $83 million in additional revenue. The FY2012 net funding level represents a 2.8% increase over FY2011 and a 2.1% decrease below the Administration's requested level. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed an appropriation of $10,242 million for CBP in FY2012, with estimated fee collections of $1,413 million. This recommendation amounted to a 3.6% increase over the FY2011 appropriated level. The FY2012 budget for CBP was set at $10,155 million, with an additional $1,496 million in estimated fee collections. This represented a 2.8% increase over FY2011 levels and a 2.1% decrease from the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $10,338 million for CBP, a 4.6% increase over FY2011 levels. The Administration requested $11,840 million in gross budget authority, a 5.3% increase from FY2011. The FY2012 budget for CBP was set at $10,372 million, with various increases in funding for frontline officers, border projects, technology pilots, new officers and canine assets, tactical communications, data center consolidation, integrity programs, targeting center, Automated Commercial Environment, and hiring additional officers for the Immigration Advisory Program in Paris. The FY2012 budget for CBP was set at $10,372 million, with increases in funding for frontline officers, border projects, technology pilots, new officers, canine assets, tactical communications, data center consolidation, integrity programs, targeting center, and hiring additional officers for the Immigration Advisory Program in Paris, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Amman. Congress considered CBP staffing, fencing, efforts to combat transnational threats, and cargo security. Border patrol agents and CBP officers have been subjects of congressional interest, with calls for increased staffing. The Administration's FY2012 budget request supported 21,370 border patrol agents. The Administration's FY2012 budget request included funding for increased staffing levels for border patrol agents and CBP officers at ports of entry, with the highest staffing levels ever in these categories. This included additional agents and officers at the northern border, funding for new canine inspection teams, and full funding recommended by the House and Senate Appropriation Committee reports. The House committee expressed skepticism about the Administration's methodology for calculating CBP officer staffing demands and recommended strategies for reducing staffing at POEs. Some Members of Congress see current Border Patrol staffing levels as too low for achieving border security goals and facilitating trade and legal migration. The Administration requested $528 million for tactical infrastructure and surveillance technology, a decrease of $45 million from the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $500 million, a decrease of $73 million from the previous year and $28 million from the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $500 million for tactical infrastructure and surveillance technology, a decrease of $73 million from the previous year and $28 million from the Administration's request. H.Amdt. 354 added $10 million to improve cell phone communications along the southern border, bringing the total to $510 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $400 million for fencing and surveillance technology, with the conference committee adopting this funding level for FY2012. DHS has received about $4.4 billion in appropriations for border enforcement since FY2006. The Boeing Company was contracted to provide Border Patrol command centers with integrated imagery and data to enhance situational awareness and operational capabilities. The SBInet program faced delays and cost overruns, leading to the termination of Boeing's contract in 2011. DHS plans to deploy a mix of surveillance systems under the Alternative (Southwest) Border Technology program, including Remote Video Surveillance systems, Mobile Surveillance Systems, hand-held equipment, and existing SBInet integrated towers. The Administration's budget request includes $244 million for the Alternative (Southwest) Border Technology program to deploy Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) Systems in Arizona. Questions have been raised about the cost-effectiveness of some elements of the plan, including the deployment of SBInet Integrated Fixed Towers. Congress is concerned about the delay in purchasing and upgrading Remote Video Surveillance systems. There is also interest in the amount of fencing and tactical infrastructure along the southwest border. Some Members of Congress argue for longer stretches of fencing along the southwest border, while others question the cost-effectiveness of additional fencing. Concerns have also been raised about securing the northern border and wait times for trade and tourism. The Administration's budget request includes $45 million for technology investments in security. The Administration's budget request includes $45 million for investments in technology systems addressing security needs for the Northern Border maritime and cold weather environment, pilot programs, and stand-alone technology deployment. Congress is interested in CBP's efforts to combat criminal organizations, prevent illegal movement of money, arms, and illicit goods, and guard against spillover violence in the United States through the Border Patrol's Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats (ACTT) program. The Border Patrol's Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats (ACTT) program involves joint enforcement operations with Mexico's Customs agency and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. CBP plans to increase permanent Border Patrol agents in the Tucson Sector in FY2011 for sustained ACTT operations. House and Senate appropriators requested briefings on metrics used to assess violence in border communities. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband and dangerous materials. CBP manages cargo security through programs like the Secure Freight Initiative and Container Security Initiative, which target risky cargo and screen it at overseas ports. The security benefits of enhanced screening must be balanced against costs and paperwork burdens for U.S. importers. Ongoing discussions focus on funding levels and specific screening requirements for U.S.-bound cargo, with the Administration seeking reductions to the SFI and CSI programs. The Administration has requested reductions to the SFI and CSI programs in the last two funding cycles, including a 44% reduction for FY2012. The SFI program screens 100% of cargo at certain foreign ports through radiation portal monitors and nonintrusive inspection imaging systems. SFI screening operated in two ports in 2011 and planned to focus on a single port in 2012. The CSI stations CBP officers in foreign ports to target high-risk containers for inspection before they are loaded on U.S.-bound ships. The Administration proposes to remove CBP officers from most foreign ports and rely more on remote risk-based targeting and reciprocal inspections. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increased funding for SFI, CSI, and Automated Targeting Systems, with the Senate also supporting additional spending on Automated Targeting Systems and the National Targeting Center. The Conference Committee report allocated $75 million for SFI and CSI, $41 million for Automated Targeting Systems, and $52 million for other programs. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry, investigating violations such as alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring, locating and removing overstayed or deportable aliens. They also combat terrorist financing, money laundering, enforce export laws, and address issues like smuggling, fraud, forced labor, and cargo theft. Funding details can be found in Table 8 for agency-level and Table 10 for ICE appropriations in FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012. P.L. 112-74 provided $5,551. P.L. 112-74 provided $5,551 million in net budget authority for ICE appropriations in FY2012, with slight increases over the FY2011 enacted level and the Administration's request. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees recommended slightly different funding amounts for ICE in FY2012. The House approved a recommendation for ICE appropriations in FY2012, with a slight increase over the Administration's request. The budget request included increases for detention beds, Secure Communities interoperability deployment, data center migration, detention and removal operations, and the acquisitions workforce. There were also reductions in Enforcement and Removal Operations Fugitive. ICE's FY2012 appropriations process involves debates on resource allocation for various operations, including detaining and removing aliens. Reductions of $27 million in Enforcement and Removal Operations and $15 million for headquarters infrastructure were made. The agency's mission includes locating and removing deportable aliens, leading to discussions on detention space and prioritizing removal of aliens. ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) faces challenges in detaining aliens, with concerns raised about limited detention space. Prioritizing removal of criminal aliens is debated, balancing with other responsibilities like counterterrorism efforts and worksite enforcement. ERO manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings and ensures their departure from the United States. ICE faces challenges in detaining aliens due to limited space, leading to concerns about inequities in detention conditions. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and proportional treatment. ICE maintained 33,400 detention bed spaces in FY2011, with a proposed increase to 34,000 beds in FY2012. The budget requested an increase of $158 million to maintain bed space, with the House Appropriations Committee proposing an additional $27 million for ICE's detention budget. ICE was required to increase the number of detention beds to 34,000 in FY2012, which was included in the final conference agreement. House and Senate appropriators supported consolidating funding for detention beds in the Custody Operations sub-account. Concerns were raised about the accuracy of ICE's record-keeping on alien removals and the lack of comprehensive statistics on encounters with inadmissible and deportable aliens. The report directs ICE, CBP, and USCIS to collect and report information on encounters with aliens on a quarterly basis. The Administration requested $184 million for Secure Communities to expand the program nationally. ICE expects to confirm the identification of 282,000 more removable aliens in FY2012. In FY2012, ICE identified 282,000 more removable aliens, including 73,000 Level 1 offenders. The debate over state and local law enforcement's role in immigration enforcement continues, with concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Despite these concerns, some argue that utilizing state and local entities is necessary due to federal government resource limitations. House and Senate appropriators support the expansion of Secure Communities. The House adopted H.Amdt. 351 to increase funding for ICE by $1 million for \u00a7287(g) agreements with local law enforcement. The conference report allocated an additional $5 million for digitizing fingerprint records in the IDENT database used by ICE. TSA, created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is tasked with protecting the aviation system from terrorist threats and violence through passenger and baggage screening, detection systems, and security technologies. TSA also assesses risks for nonaviation transportation assets, issues security regulations, and enforces them to ensure protection. Additionally, TSA serves as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The TSA budget for FY2012 is $7,841 million, $274 million less than the President's request. The Transportation Security Administration's budget for FY2012 is $7,841 million, $274 million less than the President's request. Aviation security appropriations total $5,254 million with $966 million provided for the Federal Air Marshals Service. The appropriations act includes rescissions of about $72 million from unobligated prior year funding. Specific allocations include $205 million for checkpoint support, $223 million for checked baggage explosives detection systems, and $3,026 million for passenger and baggage screening. The appropriation for passenger and baggage screening in FY2012 is $3,026 million, close to the Senate-reported amount and slightly below the requested amount. The budget also includes funding for air cargo security, international security enhancements, and surface transportation security. TSA is required to report every six months on compliance with air cargo screening mandates. Additionally, funding is allocated for transportation threat assessment and credentialing. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2017 allocated $7,906 billion for threat assessment and credentialing, $292 million less than requested. For aviation security, $5,294 million was specified, $108 million less than requested. The bill included 275 whole-body scanners but did not fund additional explosives trace detection units. TSA was directed to submit budget estimates and strategic plans for passenger screening technologies. An additional $23 million was recommended for multimodal security measures. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2017 recommended additional funding for various security measures, including Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams, canine teams, international air cargo initiatives, and surface transportation security. However, there was a $50 million reduction for explosives detection systems for checked baggage. The House-passed bill allocated $7,823 million for TSA, $293 million below the FY2012 request, with limitations on TSA's expenditures for personnel and benefits. The House limited TSA's expenditures for screener personnel, compensation, and benefits to $2,761 million, $269 million below the recommended amount. Despite the limitation, the difference would still be available for screening operations. The bill also included reduced funding for checkpoint support, checked baggage explosives detection systems, federal air marshals, and Transportation Security Support. The committee projected $2,030 million in offsetting aviation security user fees, $682 million less than the estimate. The committee projected only $2,030 million in offsetting aviation security user fees, $682 million less than the estimate provided in the President's request. This lower revenue projection reflects an anticipated continuation of the downward trend in air travel. The committee sharply criticized the inclusion of \"hypothetical revenue\" in the President's request, noting that these \"unrealistic assumptions\" compelled spending reductions on support functions to maintain funding for critical homeland security missions. The President's request included a total of $8,115 million for TSA, with specified amounts for aviation security and the Federal Air Marshals Service. The President's request included $250 million for the Aviation Security Capital Fund to finance baggage explosives detection equipment. $224 million was designated for Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing, a 37% increase from the previous year. The request also included funding for Surface Transportation Security and Transportation Security Support. The Mica amendment limited spending on screener PC&B to $2,761 million. TSA issues in the appropriations debate included proposed expansion of security measures. The appropriations debate on TSA issues included the proposed expansion of the screener workforce, acquisition costs of screening technologies, and the President's proposal to raise the passenger security fee. The President's budget aimed to support the expansion of the TSA screener workforce to nearly 50,000 FTE positions, but the FY2011 appropriations act capped it at 46,000 FTEs. The FY2012 justification proposed an increase of over 2,000 FTE screeners and 175 FTE behavior detection officers. The GAO previously noted the TSA's lack of metrics to assess behavior detection effectiveness. The TSA lacked metrics to assess the behavior detection program's effectiveness, and the Senate Appropriations Committee in FY2011 did not support its expansion without a complete assessment. The proposed expansion of the TSA screener workforce was a key issue during FY2012 appropriations debate, with concerns over costs and investments in technology. The House-passed bill aimed to limit the screener workforce to 46,000 FTEs, rejecting a request for additional screeners and supervisors for advanced imaging technology. The House rejected a request for additional screeners and supervisors for advanced imaging technology passenger screening. An amendment sought to cap FY2012 spending on screener personnel, compensation, and benefits. The amendment passed, leading to concerns over potential layoffs. The Senate-reported bill did not include a cap on the number of TSA screeners. The committee report expressed concern about screener staffing levels at large airports, especially those with high security breach rates. The report questioned if current screener levels are enough to prevent breaches and keep wait times under 10 minutes. Funding was allocated for 145 new behavioral detection officers. TSA is required to address recommendations on behavioral detection training. The President's budget included $144 million for the Screening Partnership Program. The budget allocated $144 million for the Screening Partnership Program (SPP), which funds private screening contractors at airports opting out of TSA screening. TSA halted program expansion in 2011 due to lack of clear advantage. Reviews show no performance or cost differences between SPP and TSA screening. Some Congress members support SPP, preferring a contract model with TSA focusing on regulation. Future of SPP debated during FY2012 appropriations process. House committee expressed concerns over airports. During the FY2012 appropriations process, the House committee recommended that TSA provide airports with reasons for denial in the Screening Partnership Program (SPP) and allow them to reapply. Both House and Senate funding amounts for privatized screening remain at $144 million, with the possibility of reprogramming if the SPP expands or contracts. The conference report emphasizes fair consideration for airports applying to join the SPP. The TSA considers cost effectiveness and security levels when airports apply for the Screening Partnership Program (SPP). They plan to fund the transition to private screening with appropriated funds. The TSA's budget includes costs for labor, technology acquisition, and maintenance. Controversy surrounds the use of advanced imaging technology (AIT) machines due to privacy and health concerns. The TSA aims to address privacy issues by implementing automated threat recognition capabilities. The TSA is facing increasing costs for maintaining screening technologies like AIT machines, baggage explosives screening systems, metal detectors, and x-ray machines. Retrofitting deployed systems will add to future costs, with a focus on reducing maintenance expenses through renegotiated contracts. Despite efforts to cut costs, the budget for screening technology maintenance has increased to $332 million in FY2012. The escalating costs of maintenance and sustainment may be a concern for appropriators. The House and Senate committees supported the FY2012 request for screening technology maintenance and utilities, with a focus on negotiating two-year warranty contracts for cost savings. P.L. 112-74 allocated $320 million, $12 million less than requested, due to lower maintenance warranty estimates. The President's request included $58 million for the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization system, aimed at modernizing TSA's vetting and credentialing functions. The House committee recommended funding the continued development of TIM as requested, but noted concerns over program delays. It directed the TSA to advise the committees of any impacts to project schedule or the regulatory process that might significantly delay achieving initial operating capacity in 2013, incorporating universal fees, and becoming fully operational by 2015. The Senate committee recommended $28 million for TIM, $30 million less than requested, due to schedule delays resulting in unobligated balances. TSA would need to brief the committee quarterly on TIM development. The President's budget proposed increasing the passenger security fee to $4.00 per segment. The Senate committee recommended $28 million for TIM, $30 million less than requested, due to schedule delays resulting in unobligated balances. TSA would need to brief the committee quarterly on TIM development. The President's budget proposed increasing the passenger security fee to $4.00 per segment, not to exceed $8.00 per one-way flight or $16.00 for a round trip ticket. Airlines have opposed fee increases, and there is no mechanism to adjust fees for inflation. The House committee criticized the administration for basing its budget on the assumption of higher revenues. Senate-reported H.R. 2017 proposed temporarily increasing passenger security fees to $4.00 per enplanement in FY2012. The appropriations committee did not approve the request to permanently change the fee structure but recommended further consideration. Fees collected would be allocated only for aviation security purposes. The Senate bill proposes allocating collected fees for aviation security, with an estimated total appropriation not exceeding $2,984 million. This includes passenger and airline fees, with any excess fees going towards aviation security functions in FY2013. CBO estimates FY2012 fee collections at $2,560 million, including a proposed passenger fee increase. P.L. 112-74 does not address passenger security fee rates but estimates offsetting collections from aviation security fees at $2,030 million in FY2012. The Coast Guard, under DHS since 2003, is responsible for maritime security, search and rescue, environmental protection, and more. Congress allocated $10,333 million in FY2012, with $7,051 million for operating expenses and $1,404 million for acquisition and construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10,351 million for the Coast Guard, $234 million more than the President requested. This total included $7,078 million for operating expenses and $1,392 million for the capital account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $10,080 million for the Coast Guard, $185 million less than last year and $37 million less than the President requested. This total included $7,071 million for operating expenses and $1,152 million for the capital account. The President requested $6,820 million for operating expenses and $1,422 million for the capital account, with changes from the previous year. There were adjustments in funding for various accounts, including research and development, environmental compliance, and restoration. The Coast Guard faces increased duties in maritime security, leading to concerns from some Members of Congress about operational responses. The Coast Guard is responding to demands by replacing aging vessels and aircraft. Congress is concerned about the replacement of the Deepwater fleet. The President requested funds for new vessels and aircraft in FY2012. The House and Senate committees made adjustments to the funding for various vessels and aircraft. The budget requested $39 million for polar icebreaker vessels, with plans to transfer the inactive Polar Sea to the Maritime Administration National Defense Reserve Fleet for dismantling. The request also included funds to transition the crew to the reactivated icebreaker Polar Star. The President's request included a substantial increase for shore facilities, such as replacing a pier at Cape May, NJ. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the President's request by $78 million for shore facilities and aids to navigation, citing a lack of adequate justification. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the President's request but requested a more detailed justification. Congress enacted a total of $181 million for various projects, including renovating a barracks at the Coast Guard Academy and modifying a maritime patrol aircraft hangar at Corpus Christi, TX. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 highlighted the Coast Guard's role in marine safety and environmental protection, overseeing offshore oil platform safety and responding to oil spills. The Coast Guard's ability to oversee oil rig safety and respond to oil spills has been questioned due to outdated regulations and slow rulemaking processes. The President's request included $11 million to enhance the Coast Guard's marine safety mission by adding 105 personnel. In response to concerns about the Coast Guard's management of the Rescue 21 program, Congress approved additional funding for marine safety and environmental response. This included adding personnel for safety inspections and creating an Incident Management and Assist Team. The Coast Guard plans to complete deployment of Rescue-21 in various sectors with a requested budget of $65 million. The Coast Guard's Rescue-21 program is operational on the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast, covering 36,985 miles of coastline. The U.S. Secret Service has two main missions: criminal investigations and protection, including safeguarding the President, Vice President, their families, and other designated individuals. The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for protecting designated individuals, such as the President and visiting foreign dignitaries, as well as providing security at National Special Security Events (NSSE). The agency has the authority to coordinate security arrangements with various law enforcement units and received an appropriation of $1,667 million in P.L. 112-74, which was $32 million below the Administration's request but $152 million more than in FY2011. The Senate-reported version of the DHS appropriations bill for FY2012 recommended an appropriation of $1,676 million. The Senate recommended an appropriation of $1,676 million for the U.S. Secret Service in FY2012, which was $23 million less than the President's request but $3 million above the House-passed funding level. The Senate made reductions in funding for White House mail screening and protection of persons and facilities, but provided $62 million of the requested increase. Overall, the Senate provided $161 million more than was appropriated for the USSS in FY2011. The House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended an appropriation of $1,673 million, reflecting a decrease in the Headquarters Management and Administration activity. The House-passed versions of the bill provide $158 million more than the FY2011 appropriation for the USSS. The Administration requested $1,699 million for the USSS in FY2012, $183 million more than FY2011. The increase is mainly for Secret Service protection for Presidential candidates. Congress is interested in balancing the investigative and protective missions of the USSS, with the protection mission receiving more resources and congressional attention. The Service's role in investigating financial crimes, such as combating counterfeiting, and addressing potential terrorist attacks and threats to the President has increased the need for protection activities. Advocates argue that protection is enhanced through better threat investigation efforts. The conference report reorganized the account structure for the USSS to improve transparency, creating a separate line for information technology investments and directing the USSS to provide a budget that breaks out protective infrastructure costs. Title III of the \"Protection of Persons and Facilities\" activity includes appropriations for FEMA, NPPD, and OHA. Congress expanded FEMA's authorities post-Katrina and created NPPD to house functions not transferred to FEMA. OHA was established for the Office of the Chief Medical Officer. NPPD includes the Office of the Under Secretary and administrative support functions. The Office of the Under Secretary and administrative support functions, Office of Risk Management and Analysis, Office of Infrastructure Protection, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, US-VISIT, and Federal Protective Service have their own programs supported by various management and administration programs. The Directorate Administration Program/Project Activity supports the Office of Risk Management and Analysis in developing a common risk management framework. Projects include the Risk Assessment Process for Informed Decision-making and Homeland Security National Risk Assessment. $51 million was appropriated for the Management and Administration Program, with $7 million allocated for management, planning, and administration. The conference report allocates $7 million and $5 million for management activities in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications. An additional $4 million is designated to transfer the Office of Risk Management to the Office of Policy for improved oversight. The Office of Policy is required to submit a funding plan and address recommendations from a NAS study. This move elevates the function within the department for better department-wide oversight. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $38 million for NPPD Management. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $38 million for NPPD Management and Administration, with $34 million for Directorate Management and $4 million for the Office of Risk Management and Assessment (RMA). The committee suggested terminating the RMA due to concerns raised by the National Research Council and transferring its capabilities to other Directorate functions. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $43 million for NPPD Management and Administration for FY2012, which included less than the requested amount for data center migration in the Directorate Management account. The RMA was funded at the FY2011 level, and the National Academy of Sciences highlighted shortcomings in the department's risk assessment framework developed by RMA. The Academy report recommended that the DHS framework integrate a more sophisticated analysis of threat probabilities and develop a strategic plan to improve risk analysis skills. The President's budget requested funding for NPPD Management and Administration, Directorate Administration, and the Office of Risk Management and Analysis. The committee required DHS to brief it on its plans to implement the Academy's recommendations within 90 days. No changes were made to the NPPD provisions through House floor action. The Directorate Administration requested a $12 million increase for data migration to DHS Data Centers. The Risk Assessment Process for Informed Decision-making (RAPID) is being developed to support budget setting. Congress may oversee RAPID's impact on the budget process following recommendations from the NAS report questioning the all-hazards approach in addressing critical infrastructure. The NAS report suggests that combining terrorist threats with natural events for risk determination is impractical. Congress should balance these policy objectives. The funding plan must justify specific risk modeling and analysis functions for the Department and its components, including the Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program supporting OIP, NCSD, NCS, and OEC. OIP coordinates efforts to reduce risks to critical infrastructure. The federal government collaborates with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as the private sector, to identify vulnerabilities in the nation's critical infrastructure and mitigate potential losses from terrorist attacks or natural disasters. The NCSD focuses on information networks, while the NCS focuses on communication systems, including those used during national emergencies. The OEC promotes the ability of emergency response providers to effectively respond to crises. The IPIS program is responsible for enhancing communication among emergency response providers through interoperable equipment. The budget includes various Program/Project Activities (PPAs) under different organizations. Congress allocated $888 million for the program in FY2012, with reductions in certain areas compared to the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for various cybersecurity programs, with some amounts above the President's request and others below. The largest reduction was in the Federal Network Security PPA, with reductions also in Next Generation Networks, Sector Management and Governance, and Infrastructure Analysis and Planning. The committee recommended allocating $918 million for the IPIS program, $18 million less than requested but $27 million more than approved by the House. The Senate report recommended funding cuts for various cybersecurity programs, including Federal Network Security, Next Generation Networks, Sector Management and Governance, and Infrastructure Analysis and Planning. The committee expressed support for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center and the cyber education initiative. Concern was raised about the lack of personnel for regulating chemical facilities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $891 million for the IPIS program, $45 million below the President's request. The Senate report recommended funding cuts for cybersecurity programs, including Compliance and Assurance in the National Cyber Security Division and Infrastructure Security Compliance in the IP Program/Project Activity. The reductions were due to slow fund obligation rates and concerns about regulatory compliance enforcement. The committee declined several Administration requests related to the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate, as well as requests for the National Computer Forensic Institute and funding for cybersecurity initiatives. They required a multi-year investment plan for the EINSTEIN program but provided requested amounts for the National Communication Systems and Office of Emergency Communications. The President's budget proposed restructuring the IPIS program. The President's budget for FY2012 included renaming and restructuring Program/Project Activities, consolidating cybersecurity-related PPAs, and creating a new PPA for the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications. The total budget request for IPIS was $936 million, a $37 million increase from FY2010 and a $98 million increase from FY2011. Funding for Infrastructure Protection (IP) was slightly less than FY2011, with new funds requested for cybersecurity initiatives. The FY2012 budget requested new funds for consolidating IP personnel and activities in fewer locations, increasing funding for Protective Security Advisors and Interagency Security Committee support positions. The budget also included additional funds for the National Cyber Security Division, totaling $97 million more than FY2011. The FY2012 budget requested funding to support the increased data analysis for the EINSTEIN program and DHS's expanded role in enforcing FISMA requirements. This included increasing validations and vulnerability assessments on agency networks, funding for the National Initiative in Cybersecurity Education, and transferring the National Computer Forensic Institute. Funding for the National Communication System and Office of Emergency Communications remained stable. The House and Senate reduced the Administration's request to expand the NCSD's Federal Network Security PPA, which supports efforts to strengthen FISMA implementation. Pending legislation may expand DHS's role in protecting federal information networks and critical infrastructure. Congress will need to balance these responsibilities within the IPIS budget. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) under the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is responsible for protecting federal property and personnel. FPS operations focus on security measures to reduce criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. FPS also assists other federal agencies like the U.S. Secret Service at National Special Security Events. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers and administrative personnel. The budget for FPS for FY2012 is $1,262 million, with funding fully offset by security fees. Legislation requires FPS to maintain a minimum staff level and number of police officers, inspectors, area commanders, and special agents. The Senate committee recommended $1,115 million for FPS for FY2012, $146 million less than the House-passed H.R. 2017 and the President's FY2012 request. They also recommended a 121 FTE increase in FY2012. The House committee approved $1,261 million for FPS for FY2012, the same as the President's request. The President's FY2012 request was 1,371 FTEs and $1,261 million for FPS to be collected in security fees. The requested funding for security fees in FY2012 includes $247 million for basic security operations, $501 million for building-specific security operations, and $513 million for Security Work Authorizations. There is a proposal to increase the basic security fee by $0.08 per square foot to cover costs for additional staff. Congress is concerned about FPS's ability to fulfill its mission and suggests improving training for contract guards, federalizing them, setting standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating with the Interagency Security Committee for building security standards. Legislation was introduced in the House and Senate to improve federal building security and strengthen FPS's ability to protect federal employees and the visiting public. The US-VISIT program tracks foreign visitors entering and exiting the US by collecting biographic and biometric information, shared with various government agencies to identify potential risks. US-VISIT stores travelers' biographic data in the ADIS database and collects biometric data like fingerprints and photographs from international travelers at visa-issuing posts. The US-VISIT program collects biometric data like fingerprints and photographs from international travelers to help immigration officers apprehend individuals for law enforcement actions and determine eligibility for visas or immigration benefits. The program has undergone changes in leadership and organizational structure, including proposals to place it within a Screening Coordination Office that was never funded. In FY2008, US-VISIT was transferred to the National Protection Programs Directorate for program coordination and oversight. $307 million was allocated for US-VISIT in P.L. 112-74, with additional funds directed towards implementing a biometric air exit program and improving entry-exit matching capabilities. No funding was provided for \"US-VISIT 1.0,\" instead focusing on modernizing the IDENT database. US-VISIT is continuing planning efforts for modernizing the IDENT database. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2017 would allocate $297 million for US-VISIT, $5 million less than requested by the Administration and $37 million less than in FY2011. The Senate fully funded the Administration's request for \"US-VISIT 1.0\" and provided $20 million for collaboration with ICE to identify visa overstayers. The House-passed version of H.R. 2017 also allocated $297 million for US-VISIT, with $108 million for Business Support Services and $128 million for other purposes. The House committee allocated $297 million for US-VISIT, with $108 million for Business Support Services, $128 million for Operations and Maintenance, $33 million for Identity Management and Screening Services, and $29 million for Unique Identity/Interoperability. They did not support funding for the Acquisition Workforce Initiative or \"US-VISIT 1.0.\" $25 million was reallocated for eliminating a backlog of ''unvetted'' overstay records. The committee urged the department to develop a plan for biometric exit data collection and restricted funds until a decision is made on implementing biometric data collection at air exits. No changes were made to the US-VISIT provisions through House floor action. The Administration requested $302 million for US-VISIT in FY2012, a decrease of $33 million from the previous year. The request included program changes such as identity management, data center migration, and US-VISIT 1.0. Cuts were assumed to come from administrative savings and technical adjustments. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act requires the development of a comprehensive entry-exit data system. The implementation of an entry-exit data system in the United States, known as US-VISIT, has faced delays and criticism for not having an exit system at ports of entry. Without verifying the identity of travelers leaving the country, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has limited ability to identify visa overstays. Currently, DHS uses biographical information to match entry and exit data. The implementation of biometric exit systems in the US has faced delays and funding challenges. DHS officials considered enhanced collection of biographic exit data as an alternative. Congress may explore alternatives due to technology limitations and budget constraints. The Office of Health Affairs coordinates DHS programs with a public health or medical component, including the BioWatch program. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) administers various programs and received $140 million in FY2011 appropriations. For FY2012, OHA was provided with $167 million, including funding for BioWatch and NBIS programs. A portion of the funding can be used for specified activities until September 30, 2013. The Assistant Secretary for OHA must submit an expenditure plan within 60 days of enactment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $159 million for OHA for FY2012. The Committee recommended $159 million for OHA for FY2012, $20 million more than FY2011 and $1 million less than the President's request. They recommended various amounts for different programs, including half the requested amount for NBIC and more than double for the Chemical Defense Program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $166 million for OHA for FY2012, $26 million more than FY2011 and $5 million more than the President's request. They recommended the amounts requested by the President for several programs. The President requested $161 million for OHA for FY2012, $21 million more than FY2011, with funding allocated for BioWatch program, Salaries and Expenses, Planning and Coordination, NBIC, and the Chemical Defense Program. The BioWatch program deploys sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens for early medication distribution. The BioWatch program, a significant part of OHA's budget, aims to deploy more advanced sensors to detect airborne pathogens quickly. The National Biosurveillance and Integration System (NBIS) collaborates with partners to collect and analyze biosurveillance information. However, concerns have been raised about the cost and effectiveness of the Gen-3 sensors and NBIC in meeting biosurveillance goals. The effectiveness of the National Biosurveillance and Integration System (NBIS) in meeting biosurveillance goals has been questioned by House and Senate appropriators. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes challenges in obtaining data from federal agencies. Assistant Secretary Garza mentioned that NBIC reporting systems are being piloted in four states, with more work needed for a national capability. FEMA leads the nation's preparedness efforts through a comprehensive emergency management system. FEMA executes its mission through various activities to reduce loss of life and property from natural disasters, accidents, and terrorism. It provides assistance through programs like the Disaster Relief Fund and Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund, as well as managing programs for state, local, and tribal governments. In FY2010 and FY2011, FEMA received appropriations, with a $895 million budget for Salaries and Expenses in FY2012. Congress provided $1,349 million for State and Local programs, including $50 million for Operation Stonegarden and $232 million for training and other programs. The Emergency Food and Shelter program received $120 million, while the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant program received $35 million. The Emergency Management Performance Grants received $350 million, and the Assistance to Firefighters grants received $675 million. Congress allocated $700 million for the Disaster Relief Fund, $1,100 below the Administration's initial request. The Administration requested an additional $4,600 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and $500 million in supplemental appropriations for FY2011. Congress provided $2,650 million in continuing resolutions and $6,400 million in a supplemental appropriations bill (P.L. 112-77) for disaster relief. The Senate committee recommended $1,038 million for FEMA's Management and Administration account, an increase of 4% above the Administration's request. The Senate committee recommended adjustments to FEMA's funding, including $6,000 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and $16 million for disaster relief oversight. They also proposed $1,477 million for State and Local programs, a reduction from the Administration's request. The House committee recommended funding adjustments for FEMA, including $983 million for Management and Administration, $2,650 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) with transfers to other accounts, and $1,000 million for State and Local Programs, a significant reduction from previous funding levels. The House Appropriations Committee recommended level-funding the EFS program and added $1,000 million in emergency funding for the DRF, bringing the total contribution to $3,528 million. H.Amdt. 349 provided $135 million for firefighter grants and $185 million for SAFER grants, with cuts to DHS management accounts. H.Amdt. 383 broadened eligibility for SAFER grants by eliminating hiring restrictions. The Administration proposed funding decreases for FEMA in FY2012, including a $504 million decrease compared to the FY2011 request. The DRF saw a proposed decrease of over $800 million compared to the previous year. Additionally, there were changes to eligibility for Urban Area Security Initiative grants and SAFER grants. The Administration proposed $3,845 million for State and Local Programs, a $464 million increase from FY2011. There were reductions in funding for the Flood Map Modernization Fund and Emergency Food and Shelter. Significant issues in the FY2012 appropriation process included DRF appropriations, preparedness measures, program consolidation, and funding reductions for various programs. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides emergency and disaster assistance to states, local governments, nonprofits, and individuals affected by disasters. It is funded annually through regular appropriations but often requires supplemental funds due to ongoing recovery efforts from past hurricanes. Multiple emergency supplemental appropriations have been enacted since 2005, with the most recent providing an additional $5,100 million in FY2010. The average monthly expenditures for the DRF are $383 million, with varying recommendations for funding amounts from different entities. The Senate recommended $6,000 million for disaster relief. The Office of Management and Budget proposed an amendment for an additional $500 million in FY2011 and $4,600 million in FY2012, bringing the total request to $6,400 million. $3,600 million would be used for previous incidents, while $1,500 million would go towards Hurricane Irene. Short-term continuing resolutions provided $2,650 million to replenish the Disaster Relief Fund. The Budget Control Act (BCA) aims to limit federal spending on disaster relief by setting caps and triggering sequestration if exceeded. The Office of Budget and Management calculates allowable adjustments based on a 10-year average of disaster relief expenditures. The impact of these adjustments on future disaster relief funding remains uncertain. Some argue that this approach will increase transparency and potentially reduce federal expenditures on disaster relief. The Budget Control Act sets caps on disaster relief spending, with adjustments based on past expenditures. This may limit future funding and prompt Congress to reconsider funding terms. FEMA's State and Local Programs support first responders in preparing for and responding to disasters. The FY2012 budget proposed $3,845 million for these programs, an increase from FY2011. The proposed FY2012 funding levels for State and Local Programs included significant increases for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative, while funding for Firefighters Assistance Grants and Training programs decreased. Several programs were eliminated, potentially impacting emergency response capabilities. The FY2012 House committee mark sought to reform State and Local Programs by reducing appropriations, reorganizing programs, giving discretion to the DHS Secretary to prioritize needs and risks, mandating a plan to drawdown unexpended balances, and withholding funding until submission of National Preparedness Goal. The House proposed $1 billion for state and local programs, with allocations for Operation Stonegarden, training, and various grant programs at the discretion of the DHS Secretary. The Senate proposed $430 million for the State Homeland Security Grant Program. The Senate proposed $50 million for Operation Stonegarden and $400 million for the Urban Area Security Initiative, with $10 million allocated for nonprofit entities. Both the House and Senate authorized the DHS Secretary to fund various activities previously funded under different grant programs at their discretion, with specific time-frames set for grant fund distribution. The House and Senate set specific timeframes for the distribution of various security grant program funds, including Urban Area Security Initiative and Public Transportation Security Assistance. FEMA Administrator must act on applications within specified timeframes after receipt. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012 allocated $1,118 million for State and Local Programs, with $50 million for Operation Stonegarden and $232 million for training and other programs. Specific timeframes were set for grant distribution, with guidance to be issued within 60 days of enactment, applications to be received within 80 days, and FEMA to act within 65 days after receipt. Congress directed the DHS Secretary to allocate funds to twelve activities based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence, including programs like State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and Port Security Grants. The EFS Program, authorized by Title III of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, allows social service providers to offer emergency assistance to individuals and families in need. FEMA chairs a national board with representatives from various organizations to oversee the program. The EFS Program, authorized by Title III of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, allows social service providers to offer emergency assistance to individuals and families in need. After national allocations, funding decisions are made at the local level by an EFS Local Board. The Administration proposed cutting the program's budget by $20 million in FY2012 to focus on FEMA's primary mission. The program has been hosted at FEMA for over 25 years and plays a significant role in communities during times of high unemployment. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, funded at $120 million in FY2011, provides federal grants to mitigate property damage and loss of life due to disasters. The program's national board consists of agencies that partner with FEMA in disaster response. Despite suggested cut-backs, the program has been historically augmented during economic downturns. The FY2012 budget request of $100 million represented a reduction to the program, but funding remained consistent with previous years. Eligibility for the PDM program does not require a Stafford Act disaster declaration. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program was re-authorized for an additional three years with funding of $180 million for FY2011 and $200 million per year for the following two years. The FY2011 appropriation provided $50 million for the program, the lowest level since FY2006. The FY2012 budget requested $85 million, with the House-passed bill funding the program at $40 million, the lowest level since authorization. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $42.5 million for the program. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program has over $173 million in unobligated funds from previous years. These funds can stretch out over several years for existing projects facing environmental, cultural, or historic preservation issues. The flood map modernization program involves updating and digitizing maps for easier access. Funding in this area has decreased as projects are completed, but there is interest in the accuracy of the maps and FEMA's methodology. The Administration requested $102 million for FY2012, with the House recommending $103 million and the Senate recommending $102 million. The House and Senate recommended different funding amounts for the flood hazard mapping program in FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $98 million, below the Administration's request. FEMA was directed to allocate at least 20% of the funds for map updates by Cooperating Technical Partners. The Administration proposed a $670 million budget for firefighter assistance, a 17% cut from the previous year. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $250 million for AFG, a 38% decrease from FY2011, and $420 million for SAFER, a 4% increase. The request for AFG would be the lowest since FY2001, funding 2,200 firefighter positions and 5,000 grants. The House proposed $350 million for firefighter assistance, with $200 million for AFG and $150 million for SAFER, constituting a 51% cut for AFG and a 63% cut for SAFER compared to FY2011. On June 1, 2011, an amendment was passed to increase funding for AFG by $135 million and SAFER by $185 million, totaling $670 million. The Senate proposed $750 million for firefighter assistance, with $375 million each for AFG and SAFER. P.L. 112-74 provided $675 million for firefighter assistance, split evenly between AFG and SAFER. FEMA was directed to fund applications based on local and USFA priorities. Title IV of P.L. 112-74 includes appropriations for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). USCIS focuses on adjudicating immigration petitions and naturalization. USCIS is responsible for processing immigration petitions, naturalization applications, refugee and asylum claims, and citizenship benefits. The agency is funded mainly through fees from immigration applications and petitions. Annual appropriations have been directed towards specific projects like backlog reduction. P.L. 112-74 allocates $102 million to USCIS, $267 million less than requested by the Administration. P.L. 112-74 appropriates $102 million for USCIS, $267 million less than requested. The funding is designated for E-Verify, Immigrant Integration Grants, and digital record conversion. USCIS operations funded by fees, such as refugee and asylum claims, SAVE, and immigrant integration, should continue to be funded that way. No additional appropriations will be available for these costs. The Senate-reported H.R. 2017 proposed $121 million for USCIS, $267 million less than requested. Funding was allocated for E-Verify, Data Development Center, and Immigrant Integration Initiative. The Committee directed that no appropriations be used for the Office of Citizenship Services. The total decline in funding was due to the belief that certain programs should be funded through fee revenue rather than appropriations. The committee recommended that the SAVE program be funded through fee revenue instead of appropriations. No funding was provided for military naturalizations, as requested in the Department of Defense budget. $91 million from the H and L Fund for fraud investigations was carried over into FY2011. The House-reported H.R. 2017 proposed $132 million for USCIS, $237 million less than requested, with $102 million for E-Verify and $30 million for the SAVE program. The reduction in funding was due to the belief that asylum claims and refugee applications should be processed at a lower cost. The committee recommended funding asylum claims and refugee applications through fee revenue, not appropriations. No funding was provided for military naturalizations, which the committee believed should be funded by the Department of Defense. USCIS was directed to spend $29 million on digital conversion of immigration records from fee revenue. Grants for immigrant integration should also be paid from fee revenue. The requested gross budget authority for USCIS in FY2012 was $2,907 million, with $369 million from appropriations and $2,537 million from fee collections. The USCIS FY2012 budget request of $369 million includes funding for various programs such as E-Verify, data center development, and the Immigrant Integration Initiative. Additionally, $30 million was requested for the SAVE Program to determine eligibility for public benefits. Asylum, refugee applications, and military naturalizations were proposed to be funded with a direct appropriation of $203 million, with the remaining budget authority expected to be funded by fee collections. Issues for Congress include declines in immigrant and nonimmigrant applications, use of fee-generated funding, and USCIS request for appropriations to process refugee, asylee, and military naturalization applications. USCIS must accurately project application numbers to avoid backlogs or over-budgeting. Criticized for unpreparedness in the past, USCIS now aims to better forecast application volume. Recent economic downturn raised concerns about declining application volume and agency revenue, potentially requiring additional Congressional appropriations. USCIS may need to adjust fee structure to address funding challenges. USCIS may need to adjust its fee structure and seek direct appropriations to fund applications for refugees, asylum-seekers, and military naturalizations. Congress has allocated funds for these programs, but USCIS is facing funding challenges due to declining budgets for certain programs. The House committee proposed that costs for processing applications for refugees and asylum seekers be paid through USCIS fee revenue, and military naturalizations be paid for by the Department of Defense. The Senate concurred and urged USCIS to enter into a memorandum of understanding with DOD for future military naturalization costs. Apart from military naturalizations, P.L. 112-74 appropriated no funds for USCIS activities except E-Verify, to be paid for with user fees. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides law enforcement instruction for federal entities, state and local law enforcement, and international law enforcement. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training to state, local, and international law enforcement agencies. FLETC administers four training sites in the US and employs around 1,000 personnel. Funding for FLETC in P.L. 112-74 was $271 million, slightly less than requested but equal to FY2011 levels. The Senate-reported version of H.R. 2017 allocated $272 million for FLETC, a slight increase from FY2011 but less than the Administration's request. The Senate bill allocated $272 million for FLETC, slightly less than the Administration's request. The House bill included $274 million, a decrease from the FY2011 levels but an increase from the FY2012 request. The reduction in funding was taken from the appropriation for acquisitions, construction, improvements, and related expenses. Both bills emphasized the need for FLETC facilities to operate at maximum capacity before entering into new agreements. The Senate bill allocated $272 million for FLETC, slightly less than the Administration's request. The final appropriation for the S&T Directorate was $668 million, which was 43% less than the Administration had requested. The Senate-reported bill provided $800 million for the S&T Directorate, with $440 million allocated for Research, Development, and Innovation, which is 33% less than the Administration's request. The House-passed bill provided $539 million for the S&T Directorate, with $106 million allocated for Research, Development, and Innovation, which is 84% less than the Administration's request. The funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) construction was denied in both bills, with the Senate committee requesting an updated cost schedule for the project. The committee report rejected the proposed transfer from DNDO and emphasized the need for S&T to make focused, high-return investment decisions. The Administration requested $1,176 million, including funding for NBAF construction and nuclear activities. S&T announced a reorganization and released a new strategic plan in late 2010. The new strategy and organization at DHS include changes in budget structure, with two main categories: Research, Development, and Innovation, and Acquisition and Operations Support. The House and Senate committee reports criticized the new budget structure for being too large, vague, and reducing transparency and accountability. The new Research, Development, and Innovation category aims to allow for quicker resource allocation between research activities. The DHS directed S&T to provide detailed reports on RDI projects for accountability. The construction of NBAF will lead to increased congressional oversight. Congress authorized DHS to use Plum Island sale receipts to offset NBAF construction costs. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for DHS nuclear detection efforts, with a budget of $290 million from P.L. 112-74. Congress denied the Administration's proposal to transfer the Transformational R&D program to the S&T Directorate, providing only $40 million for the program. Systems Acquisition received $38 million, including funds for radiation portal monitors and the Securing the Cities program, with $2 million allocated for program expansion to a new city. The Senate-reported bill provided $268 million for DNDO, transferring the Transformational R&D program to the S&T Directorate. It allocated $40 million for Systems Acquisition, with $22 million for Securing the Cities, including $2 million for expansion to a new city. The House-passed bill provided $337 million for DNDO, rejecting the transfer of Transformational R&D to the S&T Directorate and allocating $52 million for Systems Acquisition. The Administration requested $332 million, a 1% decrease from the FY2011 appropriation. The request for DNDO in FY2012 was $206 million, a decrease from the FY2011 appropriation of $342 million. It included $27 million for the Securing the Cities program, proposing expansion to an additional city. Congressional attention focused on testing and analysis for Advanced Spectroscopic Portals procurement. DHS decided to no longer pursue the use of ASPs for primary screening but will continue developing them for secondary screening. DNDO will deploy 13 ASPs for secondary screening and end the ASP program. The House committee expects DNDO not to deploy ASPs without certification, while the Senate denied the request to procure and deploy 44 ASPs. The decision to procure and deploy 44 ASPs has been denied, with the conference report omitting the requirement for ASP certification. DHS is directed to notify appropriations committees if a successor program is initiated. The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO remains a congressional interest, with programs in place for development and assessment in various mission areas. The Senate bill required DNDO to submit a strategic plan for implementing DHS responsibilities under the global nuclear detection architecture, with specific items to be included. The SAFE Port Act established DNDO as the primary federal entity for developing a domestic system for detecting nuclear and radiological devices. Congress may need to review the transfer of DNDO's research activities to the S&T Directorate and consider the acquisition aspect of DNDO's mission. Funding for Systems Acquisition was reduced in FY2010, shifting the responsibility for radiation detection equipment funding to end users. The FY2012 request for Systems Acquisition included funding. Since FY2010, funding for Systems Acquisition has shifted to end users, with the FY2012 request including funding for ASPs operated by various agencies. The reasons for this change in policy were not explained in budget justifications. Homeland security funding has been a focus since 9/11, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism including analysis on homeland security funding. Homeland security funding analysis has become more refined in recent years, with distinctions between homeland and nonhomeland security activities becoming more precise. While Table A-1 allows for year-to-year comparisons, the increasing specificity of the analysis may affect the comparability of data. DHS funding does not encompass all federal spending on homeland security, with DHS budget for FY2012 accounting for 52% of total federal funding. The Department of Defense follows with nearly 26% of federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, and Department of State are among the top agencies in spending on homeland security, collectively accounting for 93% of federal spending. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related, with total budget authority for DHS at $52.5 billion. The amounts shown in Table A-1 may not be consistent with total amounts elsewhere in the report. The inconsistency in homeland security budget authority and requested total budget authority applies to other agencies listed in the table."
