    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program Act\". Congress finds that many families lack upfront capital for energy improvements, States and utilities have innovative energy programs, home retrofits create jobs, and cost-effective energy improvements save energy and move the US towards sustainability. Energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades in residential buildings in the United States could require $280 billion in financing and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over a gigaton. Home retrofits are a key strategy for reducing global warming pollution and creating green jobs. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the context of energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades in residential buildings in the United States. In this Act, an \"eligible participant\" refers to a homeowner, apartment complex owner, residential cooperative association, or condominium association that finances energy efficiency measures and renewable energy improvements. These measures aim to reduce end-use demand for energy and carbon dioxide emissions, as determined by the Secretary. The term \"program\" refers to the Home Energy program. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The \"program\" mentioned in the Act is the Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program established under section 4(a). A \"qualified program delivery entity\" is defined as a local government, energy utility, or any other entity designated by the Secretary to administer the program for a State. The Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program is established under section 4(a) of the Act, with a qualified program delivery entity designated by the Secretary to administer the program for a State. The Secretary will provide Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program grants to States to establish State revolving finance funds for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in existing homes and residential buildings. Funds will be provided to qualified program delivery entities to capitalize revolving finance funds and increase participation in financing programs. Eligibility guidance will be provided to qualified program delivery entities by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide guidance to States on application requirements for local governments or energy utilities participating in the program, including criteria for eligible energy professionals and preferences for hiring locally and partnering with job training entities. To participate in the program, at least 15 percent of work hours must be from State-approved apprenticeship programs. Repayment for energy efficiency measures can be made over time. The Secretary will allocate funds to States based on a formula used for State energy programs. The formula used to allocate funds to States for State energy conservation plans under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act limits the use of funds in State revolving finance funds. Not more than 20 percent can be used for interest rate reductions, with the remainder available for direct funding or financial support to program delivery entities. Repaid funds are deposited back into the State revolving finance fund for additional financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements. The program provides financing for home energy retrofit programs in coordination with State energy efficiency programs. The Secretary will conduct a program evaluation to assess participant usage, effectiveness, and energy savings. The program evaluation will assess the achieved energy savings and renewable energy deployment. The Secretary will submit a report to the Senate and House committees, while States must provide reports on fund usage every two years. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2010 through 2015 to carry out this Act. Up to 5 percent of the funds can be used for administrative expenses."
