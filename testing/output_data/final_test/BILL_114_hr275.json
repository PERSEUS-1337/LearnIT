    "content": "SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that intercollegiate athletic programs benefit student athletes and campus life, but recent events threaten the financial stability of athletic programs. There are concerns about the health and safety of student athletes and academic integrity at institutions of higher education. Academic integrity in higher education is at risk due to academic fraud among student athletes, lack of support for academically unprepared athletes, and excessive time demands for athletics. Student athletes facing loss of benefits and NCAA institutions at risk of penalties lack adequate due process. The NCAA and college leaders have not effectively addressed these issues, necessitating reform by a commission of sports experts. A blue ribbon commission of sport experts and members of Congress should be convened to objectively study academic integrity issues in higher education related to student athletes and propose solutions. The Presidential Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics is established to address academic integrity issues in higher education related to student athletes and propose solutions. The Commission will review issues related to intercollegiate athletics, including the interaction of athletics and academics, graduation rates of student athletes, academic eligibility standards, and financing sources like student fees and media contracts. The Commission will review financial aspects of intercollegiate athletics, including revenue expenditures, financing ability, transparency, criteria for rewards, and rules on earnings and benefits for student athletes. The Commission will also address recruitment, retention, oversight, governance practices, and health/safety protections for student athletes. The Commission will develop recommendations on issues such as health and safety protections for student athletes, due process in enforcing rules, and other relevant matters in intercollegiate athletics.
