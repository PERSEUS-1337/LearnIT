    "content": "The \"Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act\" aims to protect salmonid stocks listed under the Endangered Species Act by preventing predation by sea lions in the Columbia River through lethal and nonlethal removal measures funded by the Federal Government. Section 120(f) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to allow the Secretary to issue permits for the lethal removal of sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered salmon, steelhead, and eulachon species. The Secretary may issue permits for the lethal removal of sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered species of lamprey or sturgeon that are not listed as endangered or threatened but are listed as a species of concern. Eligible entities can apply for permits under specific timelines and procedures established by the Secretary. The Secretary may issue permits for the lethal removal of sea lions in the Columbia River to protect endangered species of lamprey or sturgeon. Permits are effective for up to 5 years and can be renewed. Annual takings of sea lions must not exceed 10% of the annual potential biological removal level. Intentional lethal takings must be humane. The Secretary may suspend permitting authority for lethal removal of sea lions if after 5 years it is deemed unnecessary to protect fish species. Eligible entities defined in subsection (c)(6) can implement the lethal removal permits. The term 'eligible entity' refers to the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, as well as the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Confederated Tribes for removal in the Columbia River and its tributaries. The Secretary may allow eligible entities to delegate permit authority to other eligible entities, subject to approval and consultation with Indian Tribes. Additionally, the State of Washington may have additional eligibility with approval from the Secretary and consultation with Indian Tribes. The State of Washington and Oregon may enter agreements with Indian Tribes for sea lion deterrence and removal on the Cowlitz and Willamette Rivers. Eligibility is determined under specific considerations. The Secretary considers Indian tribes' wildlife management capacity for eligibility. Sea lions upstream of Columbia River mile 112 or in tributaries with salmon habitat are individually identifiable. Sea lions in the Columbia River mainstem or tributaries with salmon habitat have a significant negative impact. The decline or recovery of threatened or endangered salmon or steelhead has a significant negative impact on salmonid fishery stocks. The term 'Indian tribe' is defined as per the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The Act does not affect treaty rights of federally recognized Indian Tribes. The Secretary of the Interior must report to Congress on the impact of lethal taking of sea lions on salmonid stocks in the Columbia River within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
