    "content": "The President signed H.R. 2638 into law as P.L. 110-329 on September 30, 2008. This act included the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2009, providing $40.9 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2009. The bill did not authorize fee increases as requested by the Administration. The FY2009 VHA budget request, House and Senate Appropriations Committee action, and final enacted appropriations for VHA are discussed. The report also covers major VHA budget proposals in the President's FY2009 budget request. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits and services to eligible veterans, including healthcare, education, and assistance programs. The VHA is responsible for healthcare services and medical research, while the VBA provides compensations, pensions, and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national veterans cemeteries and provides grants for state veterans cemeteries. The VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary spending for various benefits and services, with a significant portion allocated to VA health care programs. In FY2008, discretionary funding accounted for 49% of the total VA budget authority of $88 billion. The VHA operates the nation's largest integrated health care delivery system through 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). The current VISN management structure has been criticized as ineffective by the VA's Inspector General for Health Care Inspections, citing organizational bias favoring local decision makers over national leaders. This leads to inconsistencies in financial systems, medical data systems, and management structures across VISNs. In FY2008, the VHA operated 153 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, 795 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient clinics, 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 232 Readjustment Counseling Centers. The VHA allocates medical care funds to VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system, which funds patient workload. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, the VHA provides care directly to veterans and also pays for care provided by private-sector providers. The VHA provides inpatient and outpatient care to eligible dependents of veterans through CHAMPVA. They collaborate with the DOD to share health care resources and services. In FY2008, the VHA had 7.9 million enrolled veterans and treated 5.2 million unique veteran patients. The number of unique patients is estimated to increase to 5.258 million in FY2009. In FY2009, the VHA treated 333,275 OIF and OEF veterans, an increase of 13.6% from FY2008. They also treated over 513,000 non-veterans, an increase of 4.3% from FY2008. The total number of outpatient visits is projected to reach 70.4 million in FY2009, with approximately 63.7% of medical services spending on outpatient care. Understanding VA health care eligibility and enrollment process is crucial for addressing discussed issues. VA health care is not an entitlement program like Medicare or Medicaid. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, all veterans were technically eligible for hospital and nursing home care, but eligibility did not guarantee access. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories and required the VA to manage care through an enrollment system based on priorities. P.L. 104-262 authorized the VA to provide hospital care and medical services to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange, and veterans of World War I. A patient enrollment system was also established to manage access to VA health care. P.L. 104-262 established a system of annual patient enrollment for veterans with specified priorities, giving discretion to the Secretary for operation. Health care provision depended on available resources and discretionary appropriations. The law required a national enrollment system for managing inpatient and outpatient medical care. The national enrollment system for veterans' health care was established by Congress to ensure medical judgment determines care provision. Veterans can apply for enrollment by completing VA Form 10-10EZ online, in person, or by mail/fax. Once enrolled, veterans remain in the system without needing to reapply annually. Veterans enrolled in Priority Group 5 based on income must submit updated financial information annually. Eligibility for VA health care is based on veteran's status from military service, requiring active-duty status, honorable discharge, and completion of service obligations for certain enlistment dates. Service-connected disabilities exempt servicemembers from this requirement. Members of the reserve components and National Guard may be exempt from the 24 continuous months of active duty requirement for VA health care if they completed their term of service and received an other than dishonorable discharge. Additionally, they may be eligible for service-connection for injuries incurred during duty. Members of the reserve components and National Guard may be exempt from the 24 continuous months of active duty requirement for VA health care if they completed their term of service and received an other than dishonorable discharge. They may also be eligible for service-connection for injuries incurred during duty, allowing them to receive care from the VA for those conditions. National Guard members are not granted service-connection for injuries, heart attacks, or strokes that occur during duty ordered by a governor for state emergencies or activities. Veterans are placed into priority groups based on service-connected disabilities or income levels. Priority Groups 1-6 (see Appendix A) include veterans in need of care for a service-connected disability, compensable conditions, former POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, World War I veterans, those exposed to hazardous agents, and those with income below VA means test threshold. VA assesses income and net worth to determine priority category and copayment requirements for nonservice-connected care. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), FY2008 extended the period of enrollment for VA health care from two to five years for veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8, who have nonservice-connected medical conditions and incomes above the VA means test threshold. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), FY2008 extended the period of enrollment for VA health care from two to five years for veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8 with nonservice-connected medical conditions and incomes above the VA means test threshold. Combat veterans who served in a theater of combat operations after November 11, 1998, are eligible for this extended enrollment period. New servicemembers discharged on or after January 28, 2003, can enroll for up to five years after discharge. Veterans discharged between November 11, 1998, and January 27, 2003, can apply for this enhanced enrollment opportunity until January 27, 2011. Veterans in Priority Group 6, unless eligible for a higher Priority Group, are not charged copays for combat-related medication and treatment. They can continue enrollment even after the five-year eligibility period ends and may be re-enrolled in Priority Group 7 or 8 based on disability status and income level. National Guard and Reserve personnel called to active duty after November 11, 1998, are also eligible. The VHA provides priority care for service-connected veterans rated 50% or more. According to VHA policies, service-connected veterans rated 50% or more must receive care for emergency or urgent medical needs promptly, regardless of service-connected status. Veterans rated less than 50% service-connected disabled must be scheduled to be seen within 30 days for service-connected conditions. VHA staff should prioritize veterans' access to care within 30 days if there is doubt about the condition being service-connected. Veterans in other priority groups have specific scheduling guidelines. The VHA prioritizes scheduling for veterans based on their service-connected status and priority groups. Outpatient appointment requests must be addressed within seven days. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated less than 50% must be seen within 30 days. Priority scheduling should not impact the care of other veterans. VHA reviews demand for healthcare services annually using the VA Enrollee Health Care Demand Model. The VA Enrollee Health Care Demand Model assesses utilization of 55 health care services by enrollees, including inpatient and ambulatory care, pharmacy, and prosthetics. It excludes long-term care, CHAMPVA, and non-veteran care, with budget estimates handled separately. Risk adjustments are made for veteran mortality, morbidity, and care sources like VA, Medicare, and private insurance. The VA Enrollee Health Care Demand Model projects future health care service utilization by veteran enrollees, adjusting benchmarks for unique demographics and VA system characteristics. It generates trend data for utilization, cost, and service intensity, reflecting industry changes. The model works well in a steady state but struggles in dynamic environments like when veterans return from combat. The VHA has added higher enrollee estimates to the Demand Model for sufficient resources, but long-term limitations exist due to economic changes and future military conflicts. VHA funding comes from multiple appropriations accounts, including medical care, research, and administration. Congress also allocates funds for medical facility construction. In FY2004, Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure to provide better oversight and accurate accounting of funds. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 funded VHA through four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care, treatment of veterans and dependents, medical supplies, salaries, and aid to state veterans homes. In its budget request to Congress, the VA proposed transferring food service operations costs to the medical services appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees agreed with this request. The Administration also requested consolidating the medical services and medical administration account in FY2009. The Senate Appropriations Committee consolidated these accounts, while the House Appropriations Committee did not. The medical support and compliance account funds various hospital administration expenses and programs. The medical facilities account covers expenses for VHA facility maintenance, operation, planning, design, construction, and research on veteran-centric health topics. VA researchers receive funding from various sources for investigating health conditions and improving the healthcare delivery system. The VHA receives funding from various sources including direct appropriations, medical care cost recovery collections, and private sources. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 allowed the VHA to bill veterans and health insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 gave the VHA authority to retain third-party payments collected for medical services provided to veterans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized the VA to retain funds in the Medical Care Collections Fund for medical services without fiscal year limitations. It also allowed the VA to change its billing basis to enhance collections. In FY2004, there was a proposal to consolidate medical collections accounts into one fund. The VA has permanent authority to deposit funds from various accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. These funds do not expire and are available until expended. A revenue improvement demonstration project was established to restructure the revenue collection process. The pilot project aims to restructure the revenue cycle for the VHA, including cash-flow management and accounts receivable. Concerns were raised about low collections from third-party insurance companies. The VA established a Consolidated Patient Account Center (CPAC) in VISN 6, managing eight medical centers. GAO reported ineffective controls over medical center billings. MCCF collections increased by 45% from FY2003 to FY2007, with first-party collections also rising. First-party collections accounted for 41% of total MCCF collections in FY2007. The President's FY2008 budget proposal for the VHA included a $34.6 billion request, with a 1.93% increase from FY2007. The total funding available, including collections, was around $37.0 billion. Medical services received $27.2 billion, a 4.8% increase, while medical administration, facilities, and research also received funding. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $37.1 billion for the VHA for FY2008, a 9.3% increase over the FY2007 enacted amount. H.R. 2642 provided $29.0 billion for medical services, $3.5 billion for the medical administration account, $4.1 billion for medical facilities, and $480 million for medical and prosthetic research. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $480 million for medical and prosthetic research, a 17% increase over the President's request. The Senate passed H.R. 2642 with amendments providing $29.1 billion for medical services, $3.5 billion for medical administration, and $4.1 billion for medical facilities. The Senate passed H.R. 2642 with amendments providing $4.1 billion for medical facilities, a 14.0% increase over the FY2008 request, and $500 million for medical and prosthetic research, a 12% increase over the FY2007 enacted amount. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 (H.R. 2764) combining 11 outstanding appropriations bills, including the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2008 provided $37.2 billion for VHA for FY2008, $2.6 billion above the Administration's request. $396.4 million was allocated for construction of Level I polytrauma rehabilitation centers. A new polytrauma center is planned for construction in San Antonio, Texas, to open in 2011. The President's FY2009 budget proposal requested $39.2 billion for VHA, a 5.3% increase from FY2008. The budget also aimed to consolidate medical administration activities into the medical services account, with a request of $34.1 billion for this account. The VHA estimated a 4.63% medical inflation rate for FY2009, with cost drivers being increases in goods and services costs, utilization of services, and intensity of care. The President's budget proposed $4.7 billion for medical facilities, an increase of $561 million from FY2008. Additionally, $442 million was requested for medical and prosthetic research, a 7.9% decrease from FY2008. The proposal would result in the loss of 49 full-time positions and 294 research projects. The Administration proposed cost-sharing proposals for FY2006, FY2007, and FY2008. The House and Senate reported budget resolutions for FY2009, with funding for discretionary veterans programs and mandatory spending. The House rejected health care enrollment fees and prescription drug copayment increases. The Senate provided similar funding amounts for veterans programs. After negotiations, the House agreed to an amended version of the budget resolution. The House and Senate agreed on an amended version of S.Con.Res. 70, providing $48.2 billion for FY2009 discretionary veterans' programs, $4.9 billion more than FY2008. The conference agreement also includes $45.1 billion in mandatory funding for veterans programs. Additionally, the House marked up the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill (H.R. 6599) for FY2009 on June 24. The House passed the Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill (H.R. 6599) for FY2009, providing $40.8 billion for VHA, including $31 billion for medical services. The bill stipulated that VA must spend at least $3.8 billion on specialty mental health care, including PTSD. The House MILCON-VA appropriations bill (H.R. 6599) allocated $4.4 billion for the medical support and compliance account, $5 billion for medical facilities, $500 million for medical and prosthetic research, and $923 million for construction. This includes funding for non-recurring maintenance and addressing life/safety and suicide prevention deficiencies in mental health wards. The House-passed bill, H.R. 6599, allocated $2.1 billion for VA construction projects, including CARES initiative projects and grants for state extended care facilities. This funding represents a 108% increase over the FY2009 request and an 8% decrease from the FY2008 enacted amount. Additionally, $7 million was designated for alternative fueling stations at 35 VA medical centers. On July 17, 2008, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $41.1 billion for VHA for FY2009, a 4.8% increase over the FY2009 request. They also proposed merging the medical services account with the medical administration account to provide more spending flexibility to medical center directors. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $35.6 billion for the medical services account, a 4.4% increase over the FY2009 request. Additionally, $5.0 billion was allocated for medical facilities, marking a 21% increase compared to the FY2008 enacted amount. The Senate also provided $527 million for medical and prosthetic research, a 19.2% increase over the FY2009 request. $1.2 billion was allocated for construction major projects, a 109% increase over the FY2009 request. S. 3301 provided $2.2 billion for VA construction projects, with a 26% decrease from the House Committee recommended amount. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 allocated $40.9 billion for VHA, including $30.9 billion for the medical services account, a 6.4% increase over FY2008. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 allocated $4.4 billion for the medical support and compliance account, $5 billion for the medical services account, and $510 million for the medical and prosthetic research account. Additionally, $1.8 billion was provided for VA construction projects. The final MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 allocated $923 million for major projects, $741 million for minor projects, and $175 million for state extended care facilities grants. Congressional committees are focused on mental health care for servicemembers and veterans from OEF and OIF operations, with a requirement for the VA to spend $3.8 billion on mental health care. VA estimates a $3.9 billion spending in FY2009, a 19% increase from FY2007, including $319 million for PTSD treatment and $15.5 million for suicide prevention initiatives. The Senate Appropriations Committee has expressed concern about the diagnosis and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) in soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. They have recommended increasing funding for PTSD treatment and expanding programs to understand the combined impact of PTSD and TBI. In FY2009, 88% of the total TBI funding would be spent on treating non-OIF and OIF veterans. The Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 included language stipulating medical care for veterans based on annual appropriations. Priority Group 8 veterans were temporarily suspended from enrollment in VA's health care system in 2003, with existing patients unaffected. The House Appropriations Committee directed the VA to increase Priority Group 8 enrollment by 10% to improve access to medical care for veterans without impacting current patients. The VA is directed to increase Priority Group 8 enrollment by 10% with additional funding provided. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 allocates $375 million to enroll more Priority Group 8 veterans. The beneficiary travel program reimburses veterans for travel expenses to VA medical facilities. On March 14, 1940, VA was mandated to pay travel expenses for veterans going to and from VA facilities. In 1958, the law changed to allow VA to pay necessary travel expenses for vocational rehabilitation or medical care. However, in 1987, regulations limited eligibility for the beneficiary travel program due to rising costs. The VA was authorized to pay for specialized transportation when medically necessary, including ambulance or wheelchair van services. Payment was also approved for travel related to compensation exams and for travel beyond 100 miles from the nearest VA facility. The VA could cover transportation costs for transferring veterans between healthcare facilities for continued care. However, certain transportation costs were not covered, such as excessive private vehicle expenses or routine travel for domiciliary admission. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 restored VA travel reimbursement benefits, requiring payments to be provided in the case of travel for veterans receiving mental health services, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988 restored VA travel reimbursement benefits for veterans receiving mental health services. Payments must be provided for travel for health care services for all beneficiaries specified in the statute, with a $3 deductible for most travel. Veterans with frequent medical care travel needs have an $18-per-month deductible cap. Veterans may qualify for travel reimbursement if they have a service-connected disability rated 30% or more, are traveling for treatment of a service-connected disability, or receive other specified criteria. The FY2008 Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) increased VA beneficiary travel mileage reimbursement rate to 28.5 cents per mile, effective February 1, 2008. Deductibles for mileage reimbursements were also increased to $7.77 for one way, $15.54 for round trip, with a maximum of $46.62 per month, but can be waived for financial hardship. Regulations allow waivers if deductibles cause severe financial hardship to veterans. The VA can waive deductibles for mileage reimbursements if it causes severe financial hardship to the veteran. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are considering increasing the mileage reimbursement rate due to rising gasoline prices, with the House Appropriations Committee proposing an additional $100 million to raise the rate to 41.5 cents per mile. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $138 million to increase the VA's mileage reimbursement rate to 50.5 cents per mile, aligning it with the GSA rate for federal employees. The final MILCON-VA Appropriations Act of 2009 provided an additional $133 million to raise the rate to 41.5 cents per mile and froze the deductible at FY2008 levels. The Act of 2008 (S. 2162, P.L. 110-387) required the VA to raise its reimbursement rate to match the GSA rate for federal employees using private automobiles for official business. The VA can no longer adjust the deductible rate without congressional approval and must reinstate the previous deductible amounts for the beneficiary travel reimbursement program. The Administration's FY2009 budget request includes similar legislative proposals. The Administration has proposed legislative proposals in the FY2009 budget request, similar to previous years, but rejected by Congress. The proposals include tiered annual enrollment fees for Priority 7 and 8 veterans, increased pharmaceutical copayments, and billing veterans for the full copayment amount for nonservice-connected conditions. None of these proposals have been considered by the House and Senate Appropriation Committees. The Administration's budget proposals include tiered annual enrollment fees for Priority 7 and 8 veterans based on family income, increasing pharmacy copayments for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans, and billing veterans for the full copayment amount for nonservice-connected conditions. These proposals aim to generate revenue for the Treasury and have been put forward in multiple fiscal years. The Administration proposed tiered annual enrollment fees and increased pharmacy copayments for Priority Group 7 and 8 veterans to generate revenue. Veterans in Priority Groups 2-8 currently pay $8 for a 30-day supply of medication, with caps established to prevent financial hardship. The VHA issued a directive in 2005 to increase medication co-payment to $8 for a 30-day supply for nonservice-connected conditions. The annual cap for Priority Groups 2-6 veterans will be $960, with no cap for Priority Groups 7 and 8. The proposal is estimated to contribute $355 million to the Treasury in FY2009 and increase revenue by $3.7 billion over 10 years. The VA predicts that enrollment fees and increased pharmacy copays may deter veterans from seeking VA healthcare. The VA is requesting Congress to amend its authority by eliminating the practice of reducing copayment debts with third-party health insurance collections. This proposal aims to align the VA with the DOD health care system and the private sector. Congress authorized the VA in 1986 to collect payments from third-party insurers for veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities and established copayments for their care. The VA can collect from insurers to offset medical care costs for veterans with nonservice-connected conditions and apply the payment to satisfy veterans' copayment responsibilities. The VA applies payments from insurers to veterans' copayment debts for nonservice-connected conditions. If insurers reimburse after 90 days, VA incurs additional costs for processing refunds. The entire claim payment is first applied to the copayment before billing the veteran. The VA applies payments from insurers to veterans' copayment debts for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans may receive a bill for the portion of the copayment not covered by insurance and for services not covered by their insurance plan. A proposal suggests veterans will be billed for the entire copayment without reduction from third-party health plans, potentially increasing revenue by $44 million in FY2009 and $415 million over 10 years. Combat veterans discharged from active duty on or after January 28, 2003, are eligible for enrollment in Priority Group 6 for five years following discharge unless eligible for a higher enrollment priority. Veterans discharged before January 28, 2003, applying for enrollment after January 28, 2008, are eligible for Priority Group 6 until January 27, 2011. After this special eligibility period, veterans will be reassigned to the appropriate priority group and may be subject to copayments for certain conditions.
