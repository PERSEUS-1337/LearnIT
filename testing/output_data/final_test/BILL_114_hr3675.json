If the total number of contracted employees or foreign full-time employees of the taxpayer has increased compared to the previous year, the applicable tax rate will be increased by 50 percent. This rule also applies to taxpayers who start doing business during the taxable year. For the prior taxable year, the number of full-time, contracted, and foreign employees must be zero. The term 'annual full-time equivalent' is defined based on hours worked by employees. The term 'contracted full-time employee' refers to an individual hired by the taxpayer under a written employment contract specifying the length of employment, salary, bonuses, and benefits. The term 'foreign full-time employee' refers to a full-time employee of the taxpayer working outside the United States. A full-time employee is defined as someone paid for at least 35 hours of work per week or a salaried employee paid for full-time work during the year. Controlled groups are considered for this subsection. The taxpayer must provide reports to the Secretary regarding compensation and other matters as required. The Secretary will establish regulations and guidelines for determining wages, average compensation, and compensation ratio. Effective for taxable years starting after the enactment date.
