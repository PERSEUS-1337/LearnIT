    "content": "The new law clarifies that there is no exemption for Members of Congress, congressional employees, or other federal officers from insider trading prohibitions. This legislation addresses the misconception that these individuals were exempt from insider trading restrictions. The STOCK Act affirms that all federal officials owe a duty of trust and confidence to the United States regarding nonpublic information from their public positions. It directs ethics entities to clarify rules prohibiting the use of such information for personal profit. The STOCK Act prohibits federal officials from using nonpublic information for personal profit, including passing on such information to others for private gain. Members and employees of Congress are included in the restrictions on using or sharing nonpublic information. The STOCK Act prohibits federal officials from using nonpublic information for personal gain, including purchasing securities not available to the public. Members of Congress and certain employees are also restricted from using or sharing nonpublic information. Employees compensated at a rate equal to or greater than 120 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-15 must file public financial disclosure statements by May 15 if they work for the government for more than 60 days in a year. These reports are available for public viewing at the agency ethics officer's office. The Ethics in Government Act removed the exemption for disclosing mortgages on personal residences for high-ranking officials. The STOCK Act now requires disclosure of information about mortgages on high-ranking officials' personal residences, in addition to the annual public reporting of income-producing property transactions required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The STOCK Act mandates prompt public reporting of covered transactions exceeding $1,000 in income-producing assets by federal officers and employees. This requirement does not apply to widely held investment funds like mutual funds if they are publicly traded and the reporting individual has no control over the fund's financial interests. The STOCK Act requires federal officials to report transactions in securities, not real property. Amendments clarify that officials must report transactions by their spouse or dependent children. Legislation rescinds the requirement for Internet posting of financial transaction forms but officials still need to report to ethics office within 30 days. The STOCK Act requires federal officials to report securities transactions within 30 days to the ethics office. The Act applies to all covered officials in the legislative and executive branches, including prompt reporting of financial transactions. The STOCK Act requires federal officials to report securities transactions promptly. Concerns were raised about posting detailed financial information of federal employees online, citing risks of identity theft and data mining. Federal executive employees filed a lawsuit against the provision in court. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Maryland denied in part the government's motion to dismiss a lawsuit regarding the forced publication of employees' financial reports on the Internet. The court suggested that this could violate federal employees' \"right to informational privacy.\" Congress delayed the requirement for Internet posting of personal financial data for federal officials to study the potential impact of these disclosures. The National Academy of Public Administration studied the impact of Internet disclosures under the STOCK Act and recommended suspending the online posting requirement. High-level officials are still required to post financial reports online, but the requirement for other officers and employees may be suspended. The requirement for all officers and employees in the legislative and executive branches to post public reports online has been suspended. Instead, a new electronic filing system will be implemented by January 1, 2014, allowing the public to search and download financial disclosure reports for high-level officials. The bill expands the provision for forfeiture of federal pension credit for Members of Congress convicted of corruption offenses to include time served as President, Vice President, or elected official of a state or local government. The STOCK Act expands federal criminal laws for officials, including conflicts of interest, false claims, vote buying, solicitation of political contributions, theft of government funds, false statements, obstruction of proceedings, tax evasion, and more. The STOCK Act expands federal criminal laws to include offenses such as tax evasion and wrongfully influencing private employment decisions based on political affiliations for executive branch officers and employees. It also requires individuals filing public financial disclosure reports to report future private employment negotiations or agreements promptly and recuse themselves in case of conflicts of interest. These provisions complement existing conflict of interest laws. The conflict of interest provision in 18 U.S.C. Section 208 requires recusal of executive branch employees from matters affecting their financial interests in negotiations for prospective employment. The STOCK Act prohibits bonuses for senior executives at certain entities during conservatorship. The Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Congressional Research Service, will report on the role of \"political intelligence\" in financial markets, legal and ethical issues, benefits of imposing reporting requirements, and challenges in measuring the impact of political intelligence on markets. The report discusses difficulties in determining the public or non-public nature of disclosures and weighs the costs and benefits of a registration scheme for political intelligence. The Government Accountability Office will report on the role of \"political intelligence\" in financial markets, legal and ethical issues, benefits of imposing reporting requirements, and challenges in measuring its impact. The report will discuss the costs versus benefits of a registration scheme for political intelligence firms."
