    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Established Provider Act of 2015\" introduces the Medicare Established Provider System under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. This new system is outlined in section 1893A. The Medicare Established Provider System, established under the Medicare Established Provider Act of 2015, designates low-risk providers for fraudulent claims. Providers can apply for designation, and those who qualify are designated as established providers. The Secretary will establish an electronic system for documentation submission by providers, suppliers, or third parties for claims under review. To qualify as an established provider, entities must meet specified criteria. The Secretary will establish a process for providers or suppliers to demonstrate their eligibility for payment under this title, including a requirement for a high percentage of claims to be determined eligible for payment and appealed if initially denied. The Secretary will establish a process for providers or suppliers to demonstrate compliance with qualification requirements through annual updates on claims status for payment under this title. This process will determine if the provider or supplier has satisfied and maintained the qualifying requirements for a specific period. The process established by the Secretary allows providers or suppliers to demonstrate compliance with qualification requirements through annual updates on claims status for payment. It includes identifying established providers within appropriate systems and ensuring a global track record of compliance. Protections for established providers apply to claims submitted during the designated period. \"Providers must repay payments electronically within 45 days if a final determination deems payment under this title should not have been made for a claim subject to review. Payment cannot be withheld unless a final decision is reached.\" The Secretary may extend the 45-day repayment period if significant hardship is determined for the provider. The Secretary must establish a method for applying section 1869 to initial claim determinations without redeterminations."
