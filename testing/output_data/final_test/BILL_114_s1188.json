The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses a grave threat to Iraq, Syria, regional stability, and the national security interests of the United States and its allies. ISIL holds significant territory, intends to seize more, and has the capability to do so. Leaders have expressed intentions to conduct terrorist attacks internationally, including against the United States. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has committed despicable acts of violence, including mass executions and genocide, targeting Muslims of all sects and religious and ethnic minority groups. They have also targeted women and girls with horrific violence. Approximately 20,000 to 30,000 ISIL fighters operate in Iraq and Syria, with an estimated 3,000 holding passports from western countries. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant funds its operations through various means like looting, smuggling, taxes, oil sales, kidnapping, and human trafficking. President Barack Obama outlined five strategies to counter ISIL, including supporting regional military partners, stopping foreign fighters, cutting off financing, addressing humanitarian needs, and exposing ISIL's true nature. Due to ISIL's advances in Iraq and Syria, about half of the 2 million refugees and displaced people from Syria and Iraq have sought refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq has been a reliable partner of the United States, particularly during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. The Iraqi constitution guarantees the Iraqi Kurdistan Region's right to maintain internal security forces like the Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has positioned its forces along a 650-mile border spanning five Iraqi provinces and engaged in attacks on Peshmerga forces defending the border. They have used captured armored vehicles, long-range artillery, and heavy weapons in their attacks. Kurdish Peshmerga forces have successfully retaken key areas previously controlled by the Islamic State, with support from the United States and its allies providing resupply of various arms. The United States has been providing resupply of arms and training to Peshmerga forces since June 2014, with approval needed from the Government of Iraq. Peshmerga forces are described as \"overstretched\" in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, with concerns raised about equipment shortages. Over 1,000 Kurdish Peshmerga and security forces have been killed, and more than 5,000 wounded. A strong Peshmerga force is crucial in countering the threat.
