    "content": "The House of Representatives has rules for considering bills, but can temporarily set them aside to expedite legislation through special rules or by suspending the rules. Special rules are used for complex or contentious legislation, while the suspension procedure is for broadly supported measures. Most bills in the House are considered under suspension of the rules, allowing non-privileged measures to be raised without special treatment. The suspension procedure in the House of Representatives allows non-privileged measures to be raised without special rules, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Motions to suspend the rules and pass the measure require a two-thirds vote, typically reserved for bills and resolutions that can meet a supermajority threshold. Measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas, often addressing government operations like the designation of federal facilities. The suspension procedure in the House of Representatives allows non-privileged measures to be raised without special rules, waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. Measures considered under suspension during the 115th Congress are analyzed in Figures 1-8, showing statistical data on sponsors, committee consideration, voting, and resolution of differences between chambers. Table 1 summarizes the final legislative status of measures considered under suspension. The suspension procedure, established by clause 1 of House Rule XV, covers bills, resolutions, amendments, and other business. Suspension motions in the House of Representatives are allowed on designated days according to Rule XV. The Speaker can only entertain a motion to suspend the rules on certain days, but measures can be considered on other days by unanimous consent or special order. A motion to suspend the rules is a compound motion to suspend House rules and pass a bill or resolution simultaneously. The procedure waives points of order, limits debate, and prohibits floor amendments. The House rules that are suspended under this procedure include those that would impede an immediate vote on passage of a measure. A measure considered under the suspension procedure is not subject to floor amendment but may be passed in an amended form. Suspension motions are debatable for 40 minutes, with speakers mostly expressing support for the measure. During debate time in the House, floor managers control the discussion and may yield time to other Members. A single vote is held on the motion to suspend the rules and pass the measure, requiring approval by two-thirds of Members present. If the vote falls short, the measure can be reconsidered before the end of the Congress. During the 115th Congress, most measures considered on the House floor were initially called up under the suspension of the rules procedure. Sixty-four percent of all measures that received floor action were initially considered under suspension, with House bills making up the majority of these measures. Most suspension measures were sponsored by members of the majority party. During the 115th Congress, the majority party sponsored 73% of all bills and resolutions initially considered in the House under suspension. Minority-party members sponsored 27% of these measures. In the 115th Congress, House Members sponsored 27% of the 855 House measures considered under suspension. Most suspension measures are referred to at least one House committee before being considered on the chamber floor. Measures may be referred to multiple House committees before receiving floor action. In the 115th Congress, the House Committee on Natural Resources had the most measures considered under suspension, with many bills related to federally owned land. Most House committees saw the majority of their referred measures brought to the floor under suspension, except for a few exceptions like the Committee on House Administration. In the 115th Congress, House committees had a high percentage of measures considered under suspension, with some committees having all or most of their measures brought to the floor this way. Committees handling less contentious subjects tended to have more measures considered under suspension. High-suspension committees included Small Business, Homeland Security, Veterans' Affairs, and Science, Space, and Technology. Measures included authorizations, reauthorizations, and bills designating federal facilities. In the 115th Congress, committees recommended amendments to legislative texts during markup meetings or informal negotiations for suspension measures. 55% of suspension measures were considered \"as amended,\" meaning the approved text differed from the introduced text. House Rule XIII requires measures reported by committees to be accompanied by a written report, but this rule can be suspended under the suspension procedure. In the 115th Congress, suspension measures can be called up on the floor under suspension of the rules, bypassing the committee and moving legislation directly to the House floor. 69% of suspension measures were ordered to be reported by a House committee, with 41% having no written report from either chamber. Suspension motions are regularly in order on specific days but can also be considered on other days by unanimous consent. In the 115th Congress, suspension motions can be considered on specific days by unanimous consent or under a special rule agreed to by the House. Most suspension measures were considered on Tuesdays, followed by Mondays and Wednesdays. Some measures were called up under suspension pursuant to a special rule reported by the Rules Committee. In the 115th Congress, suspension measures are debatable for 40 minutes, divided between two floor managers who both favor the motion. The managers may yield time to other Members, typically selected by relevant committee chairs and ranking members. The measure's sponsor often serves as the majority manager on suspension measures. In the 115th Congress, suspension measures are debatable for 40 minutes, divided between two floor managers. The majority manager controls 23% of the measures, the committee chair manages 28%, and the minority manager is the sponsor for 9% and ranking member for 25% of the measures. Occasionally, control of time on a motion to suspend the rules is ceded to other Members during debate. During the 115th Congress, on a motion to suspend the rules, the average number of additional speakers was fewer than two. 56% of measures had one or two additional speakers, 28% had none, and 14% had three to 13 additional speakers. During the 115th Congress, measures had varying numbers of additional speakers, with some having up to 34 speakers. A special rule allowed for four hours of debate on H.J.Res. 2, with the majority manager able to request unanimous consent for members to revise and extend their remarks. General leave statements could be inserted into the Congressional Record, with 20% of suspension measures having written statements following in-person remarks.

Bicameral differences on certain measures, like H.R. 88 and H.R. 695, were not resolved due to disagreements on the final text. During the 115th Congress, several bills were not enacted into law due to disagreements between the House and Senate on final text amendments.
