The Act \"Exclusion and Asylum Reform Amendments of 1993\" addresses admissions fraud by amending Section 212(a)(6)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to include fraudulent documents and failure to present documents as grounds for exclusion. Any alien presenting a forged, counterfeit, altered, or falsely made document, or a document containing a misrepresentation of a material fact, is excludable. Additionally, any alien boarding a common carrier to the United States who fails to present a document related to their eligibility to enter is also excludable. Any alien presenting a fraudulent document to an immigration officer upon arrival in the United States is excludable. Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to restrict aliens excludable under specific sections from applying for asylum, except in cases of direct departure from a credible country. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to restrict aliens presenting fraudulent documents from applying for asylum, except in cases of direct departure from a country where there is a credible fear of persecution. The definition of 'credible fear of persecution' is clarified to require a high probability that the alien's statements are true and a significant possibility of establishing refugee eligibility. SEC. 3. Inspection and exclusion by immigration officers. Section 235(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow immigration officers to inspect and exclude aliens seeking entry to the United States if they are deemed excludable without a reasonable basis for legal entry or intention to apply for asylum. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows immigration officers to refer aliens seeking asylum to specially trained officers for eligibility determinations. Aliens found ineligible for asylum may be excluded and deported without further hearing. If an alien seeking entry is not clearly entitled to enter, they will be detained for a hearing before an immigration judge, except for certain exceptions. The decision of the examining immigration officer can be challenged by another officer, leading to a hearing on the exclusion of the alien before an immigration judge. The Attorney General establishes procedures to ensure aliens are not excluded without inquiry into their reasons for seeking entry. An alien is considered to have entered the US only after being inspected and admitted by an immigration officer. An alien present in the US for a year without inspection is deemed to have entered without inspection. An alien who has entered the United States without inspection is subject to deportation under section 241(a)(1)(B). SEC. 4. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to limit judicial review for aliens found excludable. Habeas corpus review is allowed only for certain determinations, and other limits on judicial review are imposed. The text discusses limitations on judicial review for aliens found excludable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Habeas corpus review is permitted for specific determinations, while courts are restricted from hearing claims attacking the validity of exclusion, special exclusion, or deportation orders in collateral enforcement proceedings. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends Section 237(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding deportation procedures. SEC. 6. ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN ALIEN SMUGGLING. Increases penalties for alien smuggling. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. Specifies the effective date of the amendments."
