Congress acknowledges the prevalence of brain-related conditions affecting over 100 million Americans, including developmental delays, autism, and psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. These disorders lead to lifelong disabilities and are a major cause of disability globally. Neuroscience research has the potential to improve the quality of life for those with brain diseases and enhance our understanding of learning. The Federal Government is promoting neuroscience and mental health research through various agencies. Congress directed the establishment of an Interagency Working Group on Neuroscience to make recommendations for future research. The Federal Government is interested in researching early detection, intervention, and prevention of psychosis in light of the role of mental illness in multiple shootings. This includes participation in research programs like the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study and the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia study. The Federal Government is involved in research programs such as the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative. SEC. 3. YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH NETWORK. The Director of the National Institutes of Health may establish a Youth Mental Health Research Network for youth mental health research and intervention services in collaboration with other national research institutes and centers. The Director of NIH may award cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts for conducting youth mental health research and providing training for researchers. The Director of NIH may award agreements for youth mental health research and training, collaborating with research institutions and the National Institute of Mental Health for scientific findings and clinical techniques. The Director of NIH may award agreements for youth mental health research and training to up to 70 entities for a maximum of 5 years, with funding intended to supplement existing support. The Director of NIH may award agreements for youth mental health research and training for up to 5 years, extendable for additional periods. Coordination among recipients of awards is required, along with periodic reports. Additionally, awards under subsection (a)(3) should prioritize entities focusing on intervention services and research for severe mental illness. Entities awarded with youth mental health research agreements must focus on early detection and intervention of severe mental illness in young people, conduct clinical trials, disseminate findings efficiently, and adhere to specific guidelines and protocols. The Director of NIH will establish a data coordinating center for distributing scientific findings, assisting in collaborative research projects, organizing multisite monitoring activities, and supporting the establishment of patient registries by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Director of NIH will require the data coordinating center to provide regular reports on research conducted by entities, including enrollment in clinical trials and resource allocation. This information may be included in the Director's biennial reports under the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act authorizes $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2016 through 2020 for the Director of NIH, national centers, and national research institutes."
