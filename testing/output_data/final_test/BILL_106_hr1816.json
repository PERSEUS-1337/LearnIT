Research supports the importance of a healthy diet and regular screenings in reducing the risk of developing colorectal cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Care Financing Administration, and National Cancer Institute launched the Screen for Life Campaign to promote colorectal cancer screening for individuals aged 50 and above. Education plays a key role in raising awareness about symptoms, early detection, and prevention of colorectal cancer. SEC. 2. COVERAGE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include coverage for colorectal cancer screening in group health plans. Coverage for Colorectal Cancer Screening requires group health plans to provide screening for individuals over 50 and those under 50 at high risk or with symptoms indicating the need for screening. High risk is defined as per the Social Security Act. The group health plan or health insurance issuer must cover colorectal cancer screening as recommended by the treating healthcare provider, including specific procedures outlined in relevant acts. Additionally, the plan must comply with notice requirements and not override more protective state laws regarding health insurance issuers. The section clarifies that state laws regarding health insurance issuers in group health insurance coverage can provide greater protections than federal regulations. Amendments are made to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to include new sections related to this issue. \"SEC. 714. COVERAGE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING.\" Coverage for Colorectal Cancer Screening requires group health plans to cover screening for individuals over 50 and those under 50 at high risk or with symptoms indicating a need for screening. High risk is defined as per the Social Security Act. The group health plan or health insurance issuer must cover colorectal cancer screening as recommended by the treating healthcare provider, including specific procedures outlined in relevant acts. This requirement constitutes a material modification in plan terms, necessitating notice to participants. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Act related to health insurance coverage, including the requirement to provide notice of modifications within a specified timeframe. Amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes new section on coverage for colorectal cancer screening under individual health insurance. The provisions of section 2707(a) apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market as it does in the small or large group market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to those under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Effective dates for the amendments start for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2001. The amendments made by subsection (a) do not apply to group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment date, until the last agreement terminates or January 1, 2001. Plan amendments solely for compliance with subsection (a) do not terminate the collective bargaining agreement. Subsection (b) amendments apply accordingly. The amendments made by subsection (b) apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market starting January 1, 2001. Coordinated regulations between the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services ensure consistent enforcement of policies. The Secretaries coordinate policies to enforce requirements and avoid duplication of efforts. The Congress emphasizes the importance of educating Americans about colorectal cancer risks, prevention, screening, and treatment. They commend the CDC and HHS for launching an education campaign in 1999 and urge them to track and share progress with Congress."
