    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims to increase access to health insurance, expand federal health insurance market requirements, and create health insurance exchanges. It includes a \"shared responsibility\" provision for employers and an \"individual mandate\" for most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. These provisions became effective in 2014. The Obama Administration announced a delay in enforcing employer penalties under the ACA until 2015. The IRS released Notice 2013-45 providing more details on this decision. The delay may impact the individual mandate, tax assistance eligibility, federal spending, and revenues. The report summarizes these issues but does not cover all implications or the legal authority for the delay. ACA includes provisions to expand health insurance coverage. The ACA includes provisions for new federal tax credits and potential tax penalties for large employers who do not provide adequate health insurance coverage. The CBO projected that premium credits would increase federal spending, while employer penalties would increase federal revenue. The ACA includes provisions for new federal tax credits and potential tax penalties for large employers who do not provide adequate health insurance coverage. Penalties would increase federal revenue between $5 billion and $10 billion in 2014. Most individuals must maintain minimum essential coverage (MEC), including eligible employer coverage, individual coverage, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Those who do not comply will face penalties. Prior to the delay, CBO projected penalty payments by individuals to reach $3 billion in FY2014 and $5 billion in FY2015. Implementation of these provisions requires reporting information on health coverage availability and cost by employers, insurance companies, and others. Coordination of this information is crucial due to the interaction of these provisions. The ACA requires coordination of information reporting requirements between public and private entities. This includes filing annual returns to the IRS to report on minimum essential coverage provided to individuals. Entities such as health insurance issuers and sponsors of self-insured health plans are required to provide this information for determining employer coverage and individual mandate eligibility. The ACA mandates that insurance issuers, sponsors of self-insured health plans, and government agencies provide information returns reporting minimum essential coverage. This includes details such as the names, addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers of individuals covered, coverage dates, and whether the plan is a qualified health plan. Employer health plans must also include employer details and premium information. The ACA requires insurance issuers, self-insured health plan sponsors, and government agencies to provide information returns reporting minimum essential coverage, including individual details, coverage dates, and plan qualifications. Employers must also provide employer details and premium information for administering the small business tax credit. IRS Notice 2013-45 offers transition relief for 2014 to simplify information reporting requirements for effective implementation of the law. The transition relief provided in IRS Notice 2013-45 is for information reporting requirements under IRC Sections 6055 and 6056, as well as a delay in the employer share responsibility provisions under IRC Section 4980H. This relief aims to simplify information reporting and allow time for employers and reporting entities to adapt their systems. The Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions will be fully effective for 2015, with voluntary compliance encouraged for 2014. The transition relief provided in IRS Notice 2013-45 simplifies information reporting requirements and delays the employer shared responsibility provisions. Employers are encouraged to voluntarily comply with the reporting requirements for 2014 in preparation for full application in 2015. The delay in enforcement may impact eligibility for premium credits, individual penalties, federal spending, and revenue. The ACA authorized new federal tax credits for premium coverage through exchanges starting in 2014 for individuals and families with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. Premium credits are available for those without access to minimum essential coverage (MEC) elsewhere. Delays in enforcing employer penalties under the ACA may result in fewer large employers offering health insurance. The delay in enforcing employer penalties under the ACA may lead to fewer large employers offering health insurance, potentially increasing the number of workers eligible for premium tax credits in 2014. The impact of this effect is not fully analyzed yet. Individuals applying for premium tax credits must provide accurate information to avoid penalties under current law. Under current law, penalties apply for providing false information, with no statute of limitations for fraudulent claims. Various reports and processes are used to verify income and access to MEC. Premium credits are based on prior year's income tax returns and reconciled the following year. Changes in income may result in adjustments to credits, with excess amounts requiring repayment to the government. The federal government collects tax payments with limits on repayment based on income. A recent HHS regulation guides exchanges on determining eligibility for premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions. Exchanges can accept an applicant's attestation regarding employer-sponsored insurance without verification until January 1, 2015. State-based exchanges have this option, but federally-facilitated exchanges will follow verification procedures. The IRS has verification procedures for confirming Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) when applying for premium tax credits in state-based exchanges. Employers are required to disclose their contribution towards an employee's health insurance coverage on the W-2 form, but this information may not be consistently available for workers at smaller firms. Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty. Employers are encouraged to voluntarily comply with reporting requirements to provide additional information to the IRS about individuals' health insurance coverage. Some individuals may be exempt from the mandate or penalty, while others may receive financial assistance for insurance costs. State exchanges can contact employers for more information on coverage. The delay in enforcing the employer penalty may reduce employer-sponsored coverage, potentially increasing the number of uninsured subject to the individual mandate's penalty. Individuals may need to certify MEC to avoid penalties, with employers providing this information voluntarily or through other sources. The House of Representatives introduced H.R. 2667: Authority for Mandate Delay Act on July 11, 2013, to delay certain reporting requirements and penalties for large employers not offering affordable health insurance coverage. This bill would impact employer-sponsored coverage and the individual mandate's penalty for uninsured individuals. The cost estimate of H.R. 2667 on July 16 stated that enacting the bill would not impact spending or revenues as it aligns with the Administration's recent announcement. Pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO evaluates legislation based on baseline projections and incorporates new information immediately. On July 17, 2013, the House passed H.R. 2667."
