The Yellowstone Buffalo Preservation Act, also known as the \"Yellowstone Buffalo Preservation Act,\" recognizes the American buffalo as a symbol of the United States and an important part of Native American cultures. Despite being nearly exterminated in the late 19th Century, efforts to protect the buffalo in Yellowstone National Park have helped increase their numbers from only a few hundred to 25 by 1900. The Yellowstone buffalo herd, with only 25 survivors by 1900 due to poaching, is genetically unique and has never interbred with cattle. They are the only wild, free-roaming American buffalo in their native habitat in Yellowstone National Park. Wildlife migrate to lower elevation habitats in winter and spring due to the lack of suitable winter forage in the park. The Yellowstone buffalo herd was exposed to Brucella abortus in 1917, causing brucellosis. Transmission between species is through ingestion of contaminated reproductive products. The risk of transmission to cattle is low, with no confirmed cases in the wild. Buffalo with brucellosis and cattle have grazed together for over 50 years. The National Park Service, US Forest Service, and Montana Department of Livestock haze, capture, and kill Yellowstone buffalo to confine them in the park, despite no disease transmission incidents with cattle in the area for over 50 years. This policy has resulted in the killing of nearly 4,000 buffalo since 1984, with 811 buffalo killed in the winters of 2002-2005. Federal and State agencies, including 496 buffalo captured and slaughtered by the National Park Service, failed to provide adequate protection and conservation benefits for buffalo in key lower elevation habitat on Gallatin National Forest lands adjacent to Yellowstone National Park. The Horse Butte peninsula on the west side of the Park provides prime wildlife habitat for various species, including grizzly bears, trumpeter swans, bald eagles, wolves, and buffalo. The Horse Butte peninsula, comprising 10,000 acres of Gallatin National Forest Federal lands extending into Hebgen Lake, is vital for wildlife conservation and recreation. The Federal lands adjacent to Yellowstone National Park provide valuable habitat for various species and offer rich opportunities for wildlife viewing and recreational activities. The purpose of this Act is to protect the Yellowstone buffalo herd by allowing them to roam defined Federal lands outside of the Park. Definitions include \"hazing\" as efforts to deter wildlife movements and \"agent\" as a person acting for the government. The Act aims to protect the Yellowstone buffalo herd by permitting them to roam specific Federal lands outside the Park. Definitions include terms like \"Park,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Federal land.\" Prohibited acts include killing, hazing, or capturing buffalo on Federal or conservation lands. The Act prohibits killing, hazing, or capturing buffalo on Federal land or conservation easements, except for legally-authorized State-managed hunts. Exceptions include hazing for public safety or to end suffering, and non-lethal actions. The Act prohibits killing, hazing, or capturing buffalo on Federal land, with exceptions for State-managed hunts. Non-lethal Federal research on brucellosis in buffalo is allowed in Yellowstone National Park, with restrictions to protect the buffalo's wild status and visitor experience. Penalties for violations include fines up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to 1 year. The Act prohibits killing, hazing, or capturing buffalo on Federal land, with exceptions for State-managed hunts. Penalties for violations include fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to 2 years. A reward is offered for information leading to conviction. An exception is made for individuals in danger or property damage by a buffalo. The Secretary and other Federal agencies must ensure the Yellowstone buffalo herd's protection within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The Yellowstone buffalo herd is allowed to occupy Federal Land without being hazed or confined, with management authority under the National Park Service. The Gallatin National Forest will provide habitat for buffalo as a native wildlife species. Grazing permits in zone 3 are restricted during winter and spring, and no new permits will be issued for areas without existing permits. The Secretary has negotiated with private landowners to make all lands available as bison habitat in winter and spring, submitted the required study, dismantled the Stephens Creek Buffalo Capture Facility, and conducted a feasibility study on using Yellowstone buffalo to reestablish herds. The United States Forest Service will conduct a study on reestablishing Yellowstone buffalo herds on public and tribal lands, evaluating laws, science, logistics, humane standards, and cost-benefit analysis. The Secretary has worked with private landowners to allow buffalo to roam freely on Federal land through various efforts. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee of the Senate and the Resources Committee of the House of Representatives are discussing the success or failure of negotiations regarding bison winter habitat in zone 2. There is a preference for buffalo and other native wildlife on Federal land. Research funding is authorized to understand brucellosis epidemiology and develop vaccines to reduce its prevalence in wildlife and livestock."
