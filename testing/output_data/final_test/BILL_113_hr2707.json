    "content": "The Act titled \"Clean Water Compliance and Ratepayer Affordability Act of 2013\" establishes an Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Approach Framework. The Act establishes a pilot program for municipalities to develop integrated plans for wastewater and stormwater management in a cost-effective manner, following the Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Approach Framework. The Administrator, in consultation with States with approved National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System programs, will select at least 15 municipalities for a pilot program. Selection will focus on municipalities under compliance orders or facing issues with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Administrator will prioritize municipalities with a history of efforts in developing clean water management practices for the pilot program under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. In approving the integrated plan of a municipality under the pilot program, the Administrator will consider the municipality's financial capability, prioritize obligations cost-effectively, account for maintenance and regulatory obligations, and allow for innovative approaches to meet requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Administrator may prioritize municipalities seeking to develop integrated plans with adaptive management approaches, including new technical or institutional methods and the ability to adjust plans based on future regulatory requirements. In response to new regulatory requirements and financial constraints, the Administrator may extend the permit term under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to 25 years and modify implementation terms of consent decrees with municipalities participating in the pilot program. The Administrator may provide regulatory flexibility under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for municipalities implementing an integrated plan with adaptive approaches to reduce compliance costs. A report to Congress on the pilot program's results is required annually for 5 years."
