    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Health Care Eligibility Expansion and Enhancement Act of 2013\" enhances the eligibility for care of certain veterans by requiring enrollment in the patient enrollment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans eligible by law but not currently permitted to enroll. The Secretary must enroll veterans with zero percent noncompensable service-connected disabilities who are not currently allowed to enroll in the patient enrollment system by December 31, 2014. These veterans must also lack access to health insurance except through a health exchange. The Secretary must enroll veterans without service-connected disabilities who lack access to health insurance except through a health exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Veterans without service-connected disabilities can enroll in the patient enrollment system if they lack access to health insurance except through a health exchange. Veterans who obtain health insurance outside of a health exchange must still remain enrolled in the system. Priority for care is maintained unless circumstances change. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will provide public notice of the commencement of enrollment for veterans without service-connected disabilities in the patient enrollment system. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and on the Department of Veterans Affairs website. SEC. 4. Further extension of eligibility for health care for veterans of combat service during certain periods of hostilities and war. Amends Section 1710(e)(3) of title 38, United States Code to extend the period of eligibility for veterans who did not enroll in the patient enrollment system before January 28, 2008, after January 27, 2018. SEC. 5. Relocation and restatement of limitation on requirements to furnish certain care and services contingent on the availability of appropriations. Section 1707 of title 38, United States Code, is amended to include new subsection (c) stating that certain requirements for hospital care, medical services, nursing home care, extended care services, and prescription services by the Secretary are contingent on the availability of appropriations in each fiscal year. The Secretary provides nursing home care and prescription medicines to veterans with service-connected disabilities in State homes. Section 1710(a) of the title is amended by removing paragraph (4) and redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (4). Modification of determination of eligibility of veterans for treatment as low-income family for enrollment in the patient enrollment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will modify areas of residence and income thresholds for veterans to qualify as low-income families for enrollment in the patient enrollment system. Residence areas must be within one state and co-extensive with counties, while income thresholds will be adjusted accordingly. The patient enrollment system will have one income threshold per State, equal to the highest threshold among counties. The calculation will follow the method used for the United States Housing Act of 1937. The Secretary will determine the timing and method for implementing modifications to allow for enrolling additional eligible veterans. All required modifications must be completed within five years of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 7. CONTRACTING FOR HEALTH CARE. In contracting for health care services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must use a capitation-based resource allocation model and prioritize contracts with Federally Qualified Health Centers and Community Health Centers. The guidance of the Department of Veterans Affairs on contracts for health care services will be modified to incorporate best practices. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will incorporate standardized requirements for best practices in health care contracts, including regular reporting on patient appointments and other appropriate requirements."
