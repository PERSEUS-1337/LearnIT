    "content": "Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld issued a memorandum in November 2002 regarding the implementation of the new base realignment and closure (BRAC) round authorized by Congress in 2001. He emphasized the need for a new base structure to accompany new force structures as part of the Department of Defense's transformation initiative. The memo marked the formal launch of the 2005 base closure implementation process, with a focus on maximizing war fighting capability and efficiency through joint activities. Secretary Rumsfeld emphasized the need for a more efficient base structure in the new BRAC round. Functions across services will be jointly examined for consolidation. DOD will not make binding closure decisions before submitting final recommendations to the BRAC commission in May 2005. Two groups at the Office of the Secretary of Defense level will oversee the BRAC 2005 process. The BRAC 2005 process is overseen by two Secretary of Defense-level groups. The Infrastructure Executive Council (IEC) is chaired by the Deputy Secretary and serves as the policy-making body. The Infrastructure Steering Group (ISG), chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense, provides detailed direction for the BRAC 2005 analyses. The Secretary of Defense must develop a force structure plan, conduct a comprehensive inventory of military installations, and establish criteria for selecting bases for closure or realignment. The Secretary of Defense is tasked with developing a force structure plan to address national security threats over a 20-year period starting from FY2005. This includes estimating end-strength levels, major military force units needed, and the funding required. Additionally, a comprehensive inventory of U.S. military installations must be conducted, considering the need and availability of installations outside the U.S. Efficiencies from joint tenancy at military installations should be explored. Criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment must be developed, taking into account various military, fiscal, and environmental factors likely to impact closure. The Department of Defense's criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment in the 2005 round are similar to past rounds, focusing on military value, return on investment, economic impact, community infrastructure, and environmental impact. The new draft criteria emphasize current and future mission requirements, operational readiness, availability and condition of land and facilities, and joint warfighting impact. The Department of Defense's criteria for selecting bases for closure and realignment in the 2005 round focus on military value, return on investment, economic impact, community infrastructure, and environmental impact. Criteria include the ability to accommodate contingency, mobilization, and future force requirements, cost implications, economic impact on communities, infrastructure support, and environmental impact. The new list of criteria for base closure and realignment in 2005 emphasizes military value, joint war-fighting, and readiness. There were discussions in 2003 about potentially changing or repealing the base closure law, with some members of the House Armed Services Committee expressing receptiveness to a postponement. The House Armed Services Committee debated the 2005 base closure round, with conflicting decisions made by the subcommittee and full committee. The White House threatened to veto any bill delaying base closures. The House passed a defense bill exempting half of domestic bases from closure and requiring the maintenance of bases for military surges. The exemption initiative failed in final conference action in November 2003. In November 2003, the \"exemption\" initiative failed, while the \"surge\" initiative succeeded. The Senate passed its defense bill in May 2003, which did not contain domestic base closure language but authorized a commission to review overseas bases. The overseas bases initiative was later dropped, but the issue remained alive. The Military Construction Appropriations Act for FY2004 established a commission to review overseas bases. Senator Byron Dorgan proposed an amendment to repeal the authority for a new base closure round in 2005. Senator Trent Lott and Senator Saxby Chambliss expressed opposing views on delaying the BRAC 2005 round. The amendment was ultimately defeated in a close vote, with Pentagon officials arguing for the need to reconfigure infrastructure to support U.S. forces effectively. BRAC reorganized its installations office in preparation for the 2005 base closure round, giving more control to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The House defense bill proposed closing Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, citing the lack of military value without the bombing range on Vieques island. The Senate's bill did not include this provision. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY2004 directed the closure of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads within six months. Military activity has ceased, and units have been transferred to other installations. The closure must follow the procedures of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The Pentagon issued criteria for base closure and realignment in December 2003. The Department of Defense requested information for the 2005 base closure round, with details to be kept confidential until the list was delivered to the base closure Commission in 2005. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was involved in the process. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison emphasized the importance of conducting a comprehensive study of U.S. facilities abroad and considering the impact of closing or realigning installations on homeland security. She highlighted the need to assess whether existing base structures meet the needs of current and future missions, cautioning against closing domestic bases that may be necessary for troops returning from outdated facilities abroad. Hutchison also pointed out that the criteria for base closures should reflect the security challenges faced by the country post-9/11, as the threats have evolved since 1995. The Pentagon published final criteria for the 2005 round of base closures, criticized for being vague and broadly constructed. Representative Sam Farr raised concerns about the criteria's potential to suit any desired outcome, prompting the Pentagon to explain the challenges of specifying detailed criteria due to the military's mission diversity. The 2005 base closure law allowed Congress to disapprove final selection criteria by a deadline of March 1, 2004. The Secretary of Defense submitted a report on the need for another BRAC round, certifying potential savings for each military department. Without certification, the 2005 base closure round would have been cancelled. The 2005 base closure round would have been cancelled without certification from the Secretary of Defense. The DOD report focused on long-range force structure planning, installation inventory, excess infrastructure assessment, and economic effects of base closures. It considered major U.S. installations, need for installations outside the U.S., efficiencies from joint tenancy, and community impacts. The DOD report estimated 24% excess installation capacity and emphasized the need for a comprehensive BRAC analysis. A review of infrastructure was planned to evaluate military value. A House Armed Services subcommittee hearing on base closures sparked debate on supporting the war on terror versus concerns about challenges facing DOD and the nation. On March 24, 2004, Representative Solomon Ortiz introduced legislation (H.R. 4023) for a two-year delay in implementing a new BRAC round, citing ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as reasons not to shut down bases. On April 1, 2004, the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee discussed delaying the 2005 base closure round, with Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Raymond DuBois emphasizing the importance of completing the overseas review first. On May 6, 2004, the HASC subcommittee approved a two-year delay until 2007, expressing concerns about timing during wartime. On May 12, 2004, the House Armed Services Committee addressed the base closure issue. Representative Gene Taylor proposed ending the 2005 round, but a more moderate approach by Representative Joel Hefley to delay it to 2007 was adopted. Senator Trent Lott also introduced an amendment to delay the 2005 BRAC round, facing opposition from Senator John Warner. The House later voted to delay base closings until 2007, prompting immediate response from the White House. The White House responded to the decision to delay base closings until 2007 by stating that the Secretary of Defense and senior advisers would urge the President to veto any bill weakening the current base closure authority. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld reiterated the veto threat at a Senate hearing, linking the return of U.S. forces from overseas with the scheduled BRAC round. Senator John Warner warned that delaying base closures would burden communities already spending millions to protect their installations. On October 8, 2004, Senate and House conferees agreed on the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005, supporting DOD's authority for the 2005 base closure and realignment round. Senator John Warner emphasized the importance of evaluating infrastructure for a modern military, while Representative Duncan Hunter highlighted provisions to enhance the BRAC implementation process. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2005 supported DOD's authority for the 2005 base closure and realignment round. Provisions were made to improve the BRAC implementation process, including criteria for selecting bases, prohibiting revisions after March 15, 2005, and ensuring a super-majority of BRAC commissioners prevailed in decisions. Community leaders sought ways to protect military installations with support from state and local governments. Millions of dollars are being spent to improve infrastructure near military bases to ensure their survival. The Pentagon is evaluating bases with vulnerabilities, while Fort Jackson, SC houses various military training programs. In San Antonio, Texas, a proposal was made to issue $250 million in bonds to protect military installations. The military value of facilities is enhanced through low-rate projects. A non-profit organization in Shreveport offered to build and refurbish housing units at Barksdale Air Force Base at no cost to DOD. State grants help establish links between military bases and universities, promote public-private partnerships, and exchange military land for new base facilities. Communities are advised to emphasize strengths and partnerships to prevent base closures. The Department of Defense is concerned about \"range encroachment\" on military bases, which can decrease their desirability and make them targets for closure. In the past, the federal government had little control over local growth issues, but new laws now require local jurisdictions to consider the impact of new growth on military readiness. The National Governors Association study highlighted the problem of encroachment on military installations due to urban growth, leading to restrictions on testing and training activities. This urban growth poses challenges such as exposure to artillery fire, aircraft noise, and conflicts between mission activities and local communities. Urban encroachment compromises the effectiveness of night training exercises near military airports. The FY2003 defense authorization act (P.L. 107-314) addressed the impact of urban encroachment on military installations by allowing the Secretary of Defense to create conservation buffer zones to prevent urban sprawl and protect endangered species. This encroachment can lead to activity reductions or closures, jeopardizing economic activity, jobs, and tax revenues. The FY2004 defense authorization conference report requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study on encroachment issues affecting military installations. The President announced the redistribution of overseas bases to create a more agile force, bringing home 60,000 to 70,000 uniformed personnel and 100,000 family members. The President announced plans to bring home 60,000 to 70,000 uniformed personnel and 100,000 family members and civilian employees over the next ten years. Senators Hutchison and Feinstein expressed concerns and sponsored a bill to create an Overseas Basing Commission to assess U.S. military footprint overseas. The Overseas Basing Commission was created to assess U.S. military installations and provide recommendations to Congress for a comprehensive basing strategy. Despite White House opposition, the commission became law to address the need for a strategic overseas presence. The Overseas Basing Commission became law despite White House opposition, with a deadline extension to August 31, 2005. John Hamre highlighted the need for strategic thinking in realigning forces abroad for long-term sustainability. The Overseas Basing Commission emphasized the need for a sustainable framework for U.S. bases overseas, highlighting concerns about the Pentagon's rapid global basing plans and lack of support in key areas. The 2005 base realignment and closure statute allowed the President to nominate members to an independent base closure Commission. The 2005 base realignment and closure statute allowed the President to appoint members to the new BRAC Commission without consulting Congress. The Commission members in past rounds have included former Members of Congress, retired military leaders, U.S. ambassadors, business leaders, and former staff members. The President and congressional leaders reviewed and approved the selection of nine commissioners over a two-month period. The 2005 base closure and realignment round saw the selection of nine commissioners, including former Members of Congress, retired military leaders, and business leaders. Key recommendations came from Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader William H. Frist, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and the President who appointed Anthony A. Principi as the chairman. Principi had previously served as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and was vice-president of the Pfizer Corporation. The BRAC Commission, established in 2005, selected three nominees including Anthony A. Principi, a decorated Vietnam war veteran and former Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The commission conducted hearings to gather information on DOD's force structure needs and goals for the BRAC process, with plans for regional hearings across the country. The BRAC Commission conducts hearings to gather information on DOD's force structure needs and goals for the BRAC process. Additional hearings may be held before the final list is sent to the President. Commissioners must visit installations and reach agreement to add a base to DOD's list. In the past, a simple majority vote sufficed, but recent concerns have been raised about closing National Guard bases without a governor's consent. The Department of Defense rejected Illinois lawmakers' claim regarding BRAC process involvement of reserve components. The new base closure Commission chairman stated the debate over the governor's legal authority would not delay consideration of DOD's proposed list. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld acknowledged the 2005 base closure round might be challenging. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged that the 2005 base closure and realignment round may be less extensive than initially expected. He mentioned that the excess capacity estimate had decreased due to efforts to close military facilities overseas, potentially moving 70,000 troops back to U.S. bases. Despite this, Rumsfeld anticipates that the 2005 round will impact more installations than previous rounds. Senator Trent Lott placed a hold on the nomination of Anthony Principi as head of the 2005 base closure Commission. Senator Lott intended to place holds on remaining BRAC Commission nominees, but President Bush made recess appointments for all nine members to bypass Senate confirmation. Senator Warner supported this decision to avoid delays in the 2005 BRAC round. Senator Lott, a staunch opponent of BRAC, had previously tried to delay the 2005 round. Anthony Principi emphasized the bipartisan nature of the new base realignment and closure commission, ensuring compliance with the BRAC law. The House Appropriations Subcommittee discussed the importance of aligning base closure with DOD's global posture review, focusing on transforming armed forces, maximizing asset utilization, and reducing excess infrastructure capacity. The new BRAC Commission, chaired by Anthony Principi, emphasized the importance of aligning base closure with DOD's global posture review to support force transformation and national security needs. The Commission's first hearing included briefings on the criteria for evaluating DOD's proposed selections and lessons learned from prior BRAC rounds. The afternoon session addressed threats to the United States over the next 20 years. The National Intelligence Council chairman highlighted threats to the US in the next 20 years, including unconventional tactics like sabotage, terrorism, and weapons of mass destruction. The BRAC Commission received DOD's list of base closures, aiming to consolidate forces and save $50 billion over 20 years by closing 33 major US installations and realigning 29 others. The Department of Defense plans to close or realign 775 smaller facilities in addition to 62 major installations. The BRAC Commission began hearings on Capitol Hill, with testimony from military leaders. The Secretary of Defense stated that the U.S. military has only 5 to 10 percent excess capacity. The Pentagon plans to consolidate military Reserve and Guard facilities into 125 new multi-component Armed Forces Reserve Centers, closing 176 Army Reserve centers and 211 Army National Guard facilities. Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum stated that the closures aim to divest inefficient facilities and relocate to areas with better demographics for recruiting efforts. The Pentagon plans to relocate military and civilian workers to increase security at bases nationwide, shifting forces from New England and the Mid-West to the South and Far-West. This move aims to provide better opportunities and convenience for Reserve component members. On May 18, 2005, Representative Jeb Bradley and House Armed Services Committee members tried to stop the BRAC process with a bill, but it was defeated. The BRAC Commission planned visits to 20 military sites across the country, followed by regional hearings from June 7 to July 14. These visits aim to gather details on closing bases. On May 24, 2005, the Missouri delegation of Congress expressed concerns to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld about the lack of information regarding base closures. The Pentagon stated that most important information had been provided, except for some classified material undergoing security clearance. Representative Bradley tried to postpone the 2005 round of closures by proposing an amendment to the FY2006 Defense Authorization bill. The 2005 base closure and realignment round involved key actions such as the return of U.S. troops from Iraq and the submission of DOD's Quadrennial Defense Review. A bill to postpone the closures was defeated by a vote of 112-316. The President and Congress have the power to shut down the BRAC process."
