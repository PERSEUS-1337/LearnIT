Congress finds that armed conflicts in the Middle East have led to millions of refugees from diverse backgrounds, including Jews who have been a minority in the region for over 2,500 years. The United States has expressed concerns about human rights violations in the Middle East and plays a key role in seeking peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Previous administrations have advocated for a just solution to the Palestinian refugee issue. The Palestinian refugee issue has received attention, while Jewish refugees from Arab countries have been overlooked. A comprehensive peace in the region requires resolving all outstanding issues through negotiations. Around 850,000 Jews were displaced from Arab countries since Israel's establishment in 1948. The United States has shown concern for mistreatment and rights violations of minority populations, including former Jewish refugees from Arab countries. The issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries has been overlooked, despite efforts by the United States to address mistreatment and rights violations of minority populations. Various agreements and statements have highlighted the need to discuss the problem of Arab and Jewish refugees, emphasizing the importance of resolving all outstanding issues through negotiations. On April 1, 2008, the House of Representatives passed House Resolution 185, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the need for a comprehensive Middle East peace. President Clinton also mentioned the establishment of an international fund for Jewish refugees displaced from Arab lands and the possibility of compensating Israelis who were made refugees after the birth of the State of Israel. The House Resolution 185 emphasizes the importance of addressing all refugee rights in a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement. The President should direct US representatives to advocate for resolutions on Middle East refugees. The House Resolution 185 stresses the need to address refugee rights in a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement, including the resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue. It also highlights the importance of recognizing the rights and losses of Jewish refugees from Arab countries in any peace settlement. The international definition of a refugee applies to Jews who fled persecution in Arab countries, as determined by the UNHCR in 1957. The UNHCR declared that Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries could be considered refugees. UN Security Council Resolution 242 called for a just settlement of the refugee problem without distinction between Palestinian and Jewish refugees. On November 22, 1967, the United Nations Security Council approved Resolution 242, rejecting the Soviet Union's limited proposal and opting for a broader definition of a \"just settlement of the refugee problem\" to include both Palestinian and Jewish refugees. Justice Arthur Goldberg, the US Chief Delegate to the UN, highlighted Resolution 242's aim of achieving a just settlement for Palestinian and Jewish refugees. Secretary of State James Baker made no distinction between Palestinian refugees in a meeting on Middle East negotiations. The Refugee Working Group, as articulated by Secretary of State James Baker, aims to improve the situation of all people displaced in the Middle East region. The Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution emphasizes a fair solution for refugees, applicable to all those affected by the conflict. Israel's agreements with neighboring countries stress the need for a just resolution for all refugees in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Israel has a long-standing position supporting the rights of Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran. This includes setting up a department to gather evidence of persecution and property expropriation, reaffirming and expanding this support in later government decisions. Israel reaffirmed its support for Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran by adopting Government Decision number 1250 in December 2003. This decision directed the Department for the Rights of Jews from Arab Countries to collect information on property expropriation and persecution, create a centralized database, and publish the information. In February 2010, the Israeli Knesset passed a law preserving compensation rights for Jewish refugees from these regions, instructing the government to address compensation for private losses. Israel's support for Jewish refugees from Arab countries and Iran includes addressing compensation for property expropriation and persecution. An international campaign is documenting the history of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. A comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace must address the displacement of Jewish communities in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf. The United States should recognize equal rights for Jewish refugees from Arab countries in addition to Palestinian refugees. SEC. 2. REPORT. The President must report to Congress every two years on actions taken by the executive branch to fulfill certain resolutions regarding the Palestinian refugee issue. The United States has provided assistance to Israel to ensure that the interests of Jews displaced from Arab countries are considered in any final settlement of the Middle East refugee question as part of Arab-Israeli peace efforts. Recommended actions include considering the interests of all refugees, including Jews, Christians, and other groups, in the peace settlement."
