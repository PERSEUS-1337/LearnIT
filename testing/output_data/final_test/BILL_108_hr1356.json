    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that secure access to energy is crucial for national security, especially with the heavy reliance on oil for transportation in the United States. In 2000, 58% of oil needs were imported, with 45% coming from OPEC nations. The demand for oil is expected to increase by 33% in the next 20 years. In 1973, OPEC imposed an oil embargo on the United States, leading to oil shortages and price hikes. The \"Carter Doctrine\" declared in 1980 stated that any attempt to control the Persian Gulf would be seen as a threat to US interests and repelled by force if necessary. In 1990, the US deployed troops to the Persian Gulf to expel Iraqi forces, liberate Kuwait, and safeguard access to oil. The United States is on the brink of another war with Iraq to secure access to oil supplies. Many oil-producing nations do not share US values, making it crucial to reduce dependence on oil and nations that do not align with US interests. To reduce dependence on oil from nations that do not align with US interests, major increases in fuel efficiency in transportation vehicles are necessary. The US Government has heavily invested in securing various industrial sectors, including airlines and the national health system, to protect national security interests post-September 11. The US Government is introducing a Fuel Efficiency Vehicle Credit under the Internal Revenue Code to promote fuel efficiency in transportation vehicles and reduce dependence on foreign oil. The US Government is introducing a Fuel Efficiency Vehicle Credit under the Internal Revenue Code to promote fuel efficiency in transportation vehicles. Taxpayers can receive a credit of 25% of the cost of a qualified fuel-efficient vehicle with a fuel economy of at least 40 miles per gallon, or 35% for vehicles with a fuel economy of at least 50 miles per gallon, not exceeding $5,000. The Fuel Efficiency Vehicle Credit under the Internal Revenue Code limits the credit to $5,000 and defines a qualified fuel-efficient vehicle as one with a fuel economy of at least 40 miles per gallon, meeting certain vehicle criteria and emission standards. The Fuel Efficiency Vehicle Credit under the Internal Revenue Code limits the credit to $5,000 for qualified fuel-efficient vehicles meeting specific criteria and emission standards. The basis of property for which a credit is allowable shall be reduced by the amount of the credit, with regulations in place for recapturing the benefit if the property is no longer eligible. No credit is allowed for property used outside the United States or for certain costs under other sections. Unused credits can be carried forward. Unused credits for the Fuel Efficiency Vehicle Credit can be carried forward to the succeeding taxable year if the credit exceeds the regular tax reduced by other allowable credits and the tentative minimum tax for the year. The Fuel-Efficient Vehicle Assembly Credit under SEC. 45G applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The Fuel-Efficient Vehicle Assembly Credit under SEC. 45G provides a $2,000 credit for each qualified fuel-efficient vehicle manufactured in the US for their 1st retail sale. The term 'qualified fuel-efficient vehicle' is defined in section 30B(c) and '1st retail sale' is defined in section 4002. This credit is part of the general business credit under section 38 of the tax code. The text chunk introduces a new paragraph (16) regarding the fuel-efficient vehicle assembly credit under section 45G(a) and includes a conforming amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act.

Appropriations are authorized for the Secretary of Energy for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 for this purpose. Loan guarantee is defined as a pledge for debt payment but excludes deposit insurance.
