    "content": "The \"Site-Specific Agricultural Resource Management Act of 1993\" is referenced in this Act. Amendments, repeals, or references in this Act are considered to be made to the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. Congress finds that agricultural land users are required to develop and implement multiple conservation and environmentally-related plans, which may conflict with each other due to their single-purpose nature. Future legislation may impose additional requirements on land users. The planning process for agricultural land users is complex, making it difficult to coordinate various requirements. There is a need for a rational approach to conservation and environmental issues on agricultural land to promote practical and economically feasible measures. All conservation and environmental requirements should be coordinated by a single government agency into an integrated resource management plan for the land unit. The purpose of the integrated resource management plan for agricultural land is to coordinate conservation and environmental requirements by a single government agency. The purpose of the Act is to assist agricultural land users in meeting conservation and environmental requirements while maintaining viable farming operations. It aims to coordinate federal, state, and local conservation efforts through integrated resource management plans developed by the Soil Conservation Service. The Act ensures a site-specific approach for developing and implementing plans on agricultural land. The Act aims to assist agricultural land users in meeting conservation and environmental requirements while maintaining viable farming operations. It focuses on developing and implementing plans on agricultural land for conservation and environmental purposes, ensuring a balance between productivity, resource management, and environmental quality. The Act aims to assist agricultural land users in meeting conservation and environmental requirements while maintaining viable farming operations through comprehensive resource management planning. The Act defines agricultural land as crop land, pastureland, orchards, etc., excluding Federal lands. An agricultural land user includes landowners, leaseholders, and tenants who must meet conservation requirements. The Act defines agricultural land and establishes a program for site-specific integrated resource management plans for agricultural land. The program requirements override other laws and involve the Department of Agriculture agencies. The Act establishes a program for site-specific integrated resource management plans for agricultural land, requiring Department of Agriculture agencies to integrate regulations for soil, water, and resource conservation into a single comprehensive plan. The Soil Conservation Service will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the plan and any related permits or waivers. By January 1, 1996, all agricultural land must have a single comprehensive site-specific plan in place. The Soil Conservation Service prioritizes developing single comprehensive plans for agricultural land users and specific environmentally sensitive areas in 1994. Requests for cost-sharing or assistance under Department of Agriculture programs must comply with regulations. The Department of Agriculture requires all requests for permits, exemptions, or waivers for conservation practices on agricultural land to be approved by the Soil Conservation Service. Other government agencies can enter agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture to incorporate conservation and environmental requirements into the comprehensive plans developed by the Soil Conservation Service for the land involved. Agreements under subparagraph (A) can coordinate cost-share assistance for conservation practices on agricultural land with the Department of Agriculture. They may delegate responsibilities to the Soil Conservation Service for processing requests and performing other functions related to the program. The Secretary of Agriculture may enter agreements with States for incorporating conservation and environmental requirements into a comprehensive plan developed by the Soil Conservation Service. The agreements must include reimbursement to cover the costs of delegated functions, with funds remaining available until expended. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Soil Conservation Service, will establish criteria for comprehensive resource management plans for agricultural land, consulting with Federal and State agencies. Coordination of State and Federal assistance for agricultural land practices is required when a single comprehensive plan is developed. Individual comprehensive resource management plans for agricultural lands must be specifically designed for the land unit, provide management alternatives, encompass soil, water, plant, and animal resources, and consider the ability of agricultural land users to manage natural resources for production, conservation, and environmental concerns. The Soil Conservation Service aims to revise plans to accommodate changes in agricultural operations while ensuring conservation and environmental requirements are met. This includes promoting efficient food and fiber production, maintaining natural resources, and considering economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits. The Soil Conservation Service aims to revise plans promptly to meet environmental requirements for agricultural land units. Agricultural land users with comprehensive resource management plans are deemed to be in compliance with conservation and environmental requirements. The Act and its amendments will be effective upon enactment."
