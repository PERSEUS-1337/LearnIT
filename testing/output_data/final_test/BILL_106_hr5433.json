    "content": "The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2000\" allows for the expungement of criminal records for certain nonviolent offenders under a new subchapter D in Chapter 229 of title 18, United States Code. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2000\" permits the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent offenders convicted in a US court. To qualify, individuals must meet the requirements outlined in section 3632 and file a petition for expungement. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2000\" allows for expungement of criminal records for nonviolent offenders meeting specific criteria, including no history of violent crimes, substance abuse, high school education, and community service completion. Individuals meeting these requirements can file a petition with the Attorney General for record expungement under section 3633. The \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2000\" allows nonviolent offenders meeting specific criteria to petition the Attorney General for record expungement. The Attorney General must submit a recommendation to the court within 60 days, and if expungement is recommended, the court will grant an order. If expungement is not recommended, the petitioner can appeal within 90 days. An expungement order will restore the individual's status. After expungement under the \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2000,\" individuals are restored to their pre-arrest status. They are not required to disclose the expunged conviction and it will not disqualify them from lawful activities. Failure to disclose the arrest or criminal proceedings will not result in perjury or false statement charges. Upon expungement under the \"Second Chance for Ex-Offenders Act of 2000,\" individuals are restored to their pre-arrest status. They are not obligated to disclose the expunged conviction, and failure to do so will not lead to perjury charges. Expunged records, including arrests and criminal proceedings, are removed from official law enforcement and court records, except for certain publicly available documents. Nonpublic records of expunged dispositions are retained by the Department of Justice for court use. The Department of Justice can disclose expunged criminal records to law enforcement agencies for prosecution purposes or for employment as a law enforcement officer. Unauthorized dissemination of expunged conviction information is punishable by imprisonment. The expunged records can be restored as public records and used in court proceedings if the individual is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony. Unauthorized dissemination of expunged conviction information is punishable by imprisonment and a fine. The amendments made by this Act regarding expungement apply to individuals convicted of an applicable crime before or after the enactment date."
