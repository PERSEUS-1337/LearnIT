    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California recognizes the need for workers to have paid sick days to care for their health and family members. In-home supportive service providers are currently excluded from this benefit. Providing time off for health care will lead to a healthier and more productive workforce in the state. Paid sick days in California will have a positive impact on public health by allowing sick workers time off to care for themselves, reducing the spread of illness, and increasing the likelihood of seeking care from a primary health care provider. It will also enable parents to care for their sick children, leading to quicker recovery and improved overall health. Providing paid sick days is affordable for employers and leads to greater employee retention and reduced productivity costs from sick workers. Workers in jobs with public contact often lack paid sick days, forcing them to work while ill and spread illness. Domestic violence affects individuals regardless of demographics and has a significant impact on families, communities, and workplaces, leading to productivity loss and absenteeism. Survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault face job loss and harassment, with up to half of victims experiencing job loss and 40% reporting on-the-job harassment. Nearly 50% of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit. Providing paid sick days for these survivors is crucial for their independence and recovery. The Legislature aims to ensure workers in California can address their health needs and family care by requiring employers to offer a minimum level of paid sick days. The legislation aims to decrease healthcare costs, protect employees from job loss while using sick days for family care, provide economic security for those affected by domestic violence or sexual assault, and ensure equal paid sick leave benefits for in-home supportive service providers in California. The legislation in California aims to provide paid sick leave benefits for employees, excluding those covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement with specific provisions. An employee in the construction industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement is exempt from the paid sick leave benefits legislation in California if the agreement meets specific criteria. The definition of \"employer\" includes any person employing another under any appointment or contract of hire, including the state and municipalities. \"Family member\" is defined as specified individuals. The definition of \"family member\" includes a child, parent, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild, and sibling. \"Health care provider\" has the same meaning as defined in the Government Code. \"Paid sick days\" are compensated time off provided by an employer for specific purposes. Section 245.5 of the Labor Code defines an employee as not including those covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement that provides for wages, hours, working conditions, paid sick days, arbitration of disputes, premium wage rates for overtime, and a regular hourly rate at least 30% higher than the state minimum wage. This section will be inoperative after July 1, 2016, and repealed as of January 1, 2017. An employee in the construction industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement must have wages, hours, and working conditions specified in the agreement. The agreement must also include premium wage rates for overtime and a regular hourly pay at least 30% higher than the state minimum wage. The agreement must have been entered into before January 1, 2015, or explicitly waive the requirements of this article. An individual employed by an air carrier as flight crew must receive compensated time off as specified. \"Employer\" includes state entities. \"Family member\" includes various definitions of a child. The section defines who qualifies as a family member for the purpose of receiving paid sick days, including parents, spouses, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings. It also clarifies the meaning of a health care provider and specifies that paid sick days must be compensated at the same wage as regular work hours. This section will be effective starting July 1, 2016."
