    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"USDA Civil Rights Resolution Act of 2000\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds a strong public policy against discrimination, whether by private individuals or the Federal Government. Quick action should be taken to remedy discrimination in Federal programs. In 1997, the Department of Agriculture was found guilty of civil rights violations. Congress created a 2-year waiver in 1998 for seeking redress for discrimination by the Department. Despite the waiver of the statute of limitations, agricultural producers face challenges in getting a timely resolution for discrimination complaints against the Department of Agriculture. Complaints investigated by the Office of Civil Rights are not being resolved promptly, causing delays for producers to move on with their lives. The Act aims to set a reasonable time limit for the Department of Agriculture to resolve discrimination complaints from agricultural producers. If the Department fails to meet this limit, complainants can seek assistance from the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice for timely resolution. The Act allows for a waiver of the statute of limitations for discrimination complaints from agricultural producers. Section 741(b) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 is amended to include administrative determinations and review by the Department of Justice for eligible complaints. If an eligible complaint is not resolved by the Department within 270 days, the complainant can petition the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to review and make recommendations to resolve the complaint within 30 days. The Department of Justice provides the right to review for complainants with pending complaints at the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Agriculture that do not meet the time criteria. After the review process is completed, the complainant will be deemed to have exhausted administrative remedies and can file a complaint in United States District Court. The statute of limitations will be tolled from the date of filing at the Department of Agriculture. The review process must be completed before filing a complaint in United States District Court, with the statute of limitations tolled from the date of filing at the Department of Agriculture."
