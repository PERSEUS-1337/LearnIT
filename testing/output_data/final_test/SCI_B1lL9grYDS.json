    "content": "We propose a novel two-stage analysis on the error bounds of federated learning to address efficiency issues caused by the straggler effect in decentralized non-i.i.d. data. Our algorithm uses asynchronous settings and strategies to control discrepancies between global and delayed models, adjusting local epochs with staleness estimation for faster convergence and resistance to performance deterioration from stragglers. Experiment results demonstrate fast and robust convergence in the presence of massive stragglers. Distributed machine learning, including approaches like distributed stochastic gradient descent and parameter server paradigm, faces communication overhead and privacy risks. Federated learning is proposed to address these issues by locally training a global model on a subset of randomly selected devices, reducing communication and protecting user privacy. Federated learning deals with non-i.i.d., unbalanced, and heterogeneous data, as well as constrained computing resources with unreliable connections. Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is proposed to address the inefficiencies of synchronous optimization methods in federated learning (FL). AFL aims to mitigate the impact of slow devices and unreliable connections by allowing for asynchronous model updates, reducing synchronization costs and improving convergence. Asynchronous federated learning (AFL) methods address slow devices by allowing asynchronous model aggregation. However, asynchrony amplifies the straggler effect due to delayed updates from slow workers. Real-world data distribution in heterogeneous devices exacerbates this effect, impacting global model convergence. Challenges in parameter tuning and speed-accuracy trade-off persist in AFL. Efficient and stale-robust algorithm design guidelines are lacking in this context. Our main contributions include a new two-stage analysis on federated learning, focusing on training error decomposition and convergence analysis. This analysis offers insights for designing efficient and stale-robust federated learning algorithms. We propose a novel FL algorithm with asynchronous settings and easy-to-implement training strategies, which dynamically adjusts the number of local epochs on straggle workers to reduce staleness impact on global model convergence. Experiments evaluate the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm on imbalanced and balanced data partitions. Our approach shows fast and robust convergence in the presence of straggle worker nodes compared to existing solutions targeting AFL and staleness resilience in asynchronous gradient descent. Previous works mainly focus on distributed scenarios, while our algorithm addresses the straggler effect in federated learning with consensus-based solutions. Existing FL solutions address the straggler effect through consensus mechanisms, reducing communications and updating models without waiting for stragglers. However, current approaches focus on synchronized FL, with some considering staleness caused by network delay. Our approach, similar to Xie et al. (2019a), aims to control the trade-off between convergence speed and error reduction on staleness, but also considers imbalanced data sizes in workers, unlike previous solutions. Our approach, inspired by Xie et al. (2019a), focuses on adaptively controlling local epochs, staleness, and model discrepancy to ensure performance on imbalanced data partitions in Federated Learning (FL). In FL, a system comprises M distributed worker nodes and a server node aiming to train a global model without sharing local data. Each worker node uses the same ML model and optimizer to optimize its local model. The server aggregates local models using an operator like averaging and broadcasts the global model to workers at each communication round. In Federated Learning (FL), a system consists of M worker nodes and a server node. Each worker node optimizes its local model using the same ML model and optimizer. The server aggregates local models using averaging and broadcasts the global model to workers. The model in each worker node is denoted by \u03c9 i \u2208 R d, and the objective function by g(\u00b7). The update term is represented by h(\u00b7), which shows the model parameter differences between collected models and the previous global model. In this section, we aim to design an efficient and robust Federated Learning (FL) algorithm by establishing a two-stage analysis. The first stage involves Traning Error Decomposition, where we discuss the main errors of FL. Each worker node has a local optimal model \u03c9 * i = arg min F i (\u03c9). At communication round t, the global error is defined as the L2 norm. The error terms for worker node i include initialization and local error, as well as local-global error. The text discusses the errors in Federated Learning (FL) and how they impact the global error. It mentions the local-global error and the importance of reducing initialization and local errors to minimize the global error. The analysis suggests that a more sophisticated approach is needed to optimize FL beyond the early stages of training. The text discusses the errors in Federated Learning (FL) and the need for a more sophisticated approach to optimize FL beyond the early stages of training. It analyzes the convergence bounds of general FL on training stages other than the early stage, making assumptions on smoothness and strong convexity of objective functions. The text discusses the convergence bounds for general Federated Learning (FL) problems, focusing on strong convexity. Theorems 1 and 2 provide error bounds for model aggregation, with potential optimizations through controlled local epoch settings. Theorem 2 provides the error bound of Federated Learning with selected local epochs for strongly convex problems, implying dynamics of hyper-parameters for efficiency and robustness trade-off. Practical insights on designing efficient FL algorithms include discussing how to reduce global error and communication rounds simultaneously. Increasing local epochs can lead to linear convergence for quick error reduction. Asynchronous acceleration with stragglers is necessary in Federated Learning to reduce communication rounds while increasing local epochs for faster convergence. By sampling more worker nodes within a communication round, the global error can be controlled. Comparing n-worker participation with M-worker participation shows that increasing the number of workers can lead to higher variance and slower convergence speed, necessitating the use of asynchronous mechanisms in model aggregation. Asynchronous mechanisms in model aggregation can accelerate training by reducing waiting time. However, the straggler effect is magnified by asynchrony, leading to stale workers accumulating staleness and affecting global model convergence. Increasing local epochs can help mitigate this effect, but the divergence in epoch numbers between stale and non-stale workers may impact variance. Adjusting the number of local epochs is a practical strategy to address this issue. The workers' impact on variance can be reduced by adjusting the number of local epochs with normalized epochs. Theorem 3 discusses convergence for non-convex problems with specific assumptions and step size selection. The proposed fast and stale-robust AFL algorithm is based on this analysis, with Algorithm 1 and 2 detailing worker and server node processes. H(t) controls the server node's wait time for updated models, balancing accuracy and speed in training. The training processes on the server node involve two stages - the initial stage and the converging stage, which are switched based on the consistency of model updates. Workers send model updates to the server, which calculates U to determine convergence. The converging stage involves updating models and sending them back to the server for further processing. Update consistency is defined as the similarities between worker models at communication round t. The threshold to switch from the initial stage to the converging stage of global model training is empirically set at 0.1. The update term is defined as the normalized local epoch with a regularization term. A stale-related penalty function is also defined. The key processes of worker nodes include estimating staleness level and assigning the number of local epochs. In the next section, worker nodes estimate staleness levels and assign local epochs based on received triplets. Performance evaluation is conducted on imbalanced and balanced data partitions with stale worker nodes. Experiments are done on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a CNN model on CPU devices. Fashion-MNIST has 55,000 training and 10,000 testing samples, while CIFAR-10 has 50,000 training samples. The CNN model used for experiments on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets consists of 4 convolutional layers with 3 \u00d7 3 kernels of sizes 32, 64, 64, 128. Each convolutional layer uses ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling and dropout layers. A 512-unit dense layer with ReLU and softmax output layer are included. SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 is used, with a batch size of 50 and 50 initial local epochs. Data size is randomly split among worker nodes, with communication speed divided into ten levels. Stale workers are assigned higher communication levels.

Our proposed method outperforms four baselines in terms of convergence speed and stability, especially on imbalanced data partitions. Our proposed AFL algorithm accelerates convergence and resists performance deterioration from stragglers. Experimental results show it outperforms baselines in accuracy and loss, converging two times faster and maintaining accuracy even with up to 80% stale workers. The stage transition from initial training to converging stage validates the efficiency of our approach. Our proposed AFL algorithm accelerates convergence and resists performance deterioration from stragglers, outperforming baselines in accuracy and loss by converging two times faster. It maintains accuracy even with up to 80% stale workers and improves generalization ability of neural network models. Additionally, our method has the potential to resist malicious attacks on worker nodes. Future work will include theoretical analysis and evaluation of these abilities. In future work, the ability of the proposed AFL algorithm to accelerate convergence and resist performance deterioration from stragglers will be analyzed and evaluated. The proof of Theorem 1 and Lemmas 1 and 2 under various assumptions will be provided, demonstrating the quadratic model's minimal value and generalization ability of neural network models. The text chunk discusses the proof of a theorem related to the minimal value and generalization ability of neural network models. It involves rearranging equations and conducting experiments to evaluate the algorithm's performance on CIFAR-10. The algorithm's stale-robustness on CIFAR-10 was evaluated through additional experiments. The impact of different staleness levels on communication rounds was visualized using cosine angles between update terms of fresh and stale nodes. Results show the effectiveness of the method in adjusting update directions of stale nodes compared to FedAvg. The staleness level is determined by the differences in version numbers of models between fresh and stale nodes. For example, a staleness level of 10 means that fresh nodes have updated 10 more versions compared to stale nodes."
