    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fourth Amendment Restoration Act\". The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, with warrants requiring probable cause and specific details. American colonists objected to general warrants like writs of assistance, which played a role in the events leading to the American Revolution. The USA PATRIOT Act violates the original intent of the Fourth Amendment by allowing soldiers and police officers to issue warrants, contrary to the amendment's purpose of protecting against general warrants. The USA PATRIOT Act violates the Fourth Amendment by allowing soldiers and police officers to issue warrants. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS ON ROVING WIRETAPS. Section 105(c) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 is amended to include provisions regarding the identity of the target of electronic surveillance and the nature and location of the facilities where surveillance will be directed. The amendment to Section 105(c) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows for electronic surveillance to be conducted when the facility or place is not known at the time of the order, with a limitation on the duration based on the proximity of the target to the specific location. SEC. 4 amends the USA PATRIOT Act to sunset roving wiretap authority and access to business records. Section 206 and 215 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are amended to revert to their pre-2001 versions. SEC. 5 addresses minimization procedures. The Attorney General must establish minimization and destruction procedures for the FBI regarding records obtained through National Security Letters or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act within 180 days of this Act's enactment. The term \"minimization and destruction procedures\" refers to specific measures designed to minimize the acquisition and retention of nonpublic information of unconsenting US persons in National Security Letters or requests for tangible things for foreign intelligence investigations. These procedures also include the return or destruction of information obtained outside the scope of the letter or request. The dissemination of information not classified as foreign intelligence must not identify any US person without their consent, unless necessary for understanding or assessing foreign intelligence. Procedures allow for retention and sharing of information related to a crime for law enforcement purposes. SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF NATIONAL SECURITY LETTERS. Section 3511 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to require National Security Letters to be approved by a judge from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court before issuance. Judicial review of suspicious activity reports is mandated. Section 5318(g) of title 31, United States Code is amended to include judicial review for reporting transactions by financial institutions or entities regulated by the Secretary or securities laws. The amendment includes judicial review for reporting transactions by financial institutions regulated by the Secretary or securities laws, unless a warrant could be issued under rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure."
