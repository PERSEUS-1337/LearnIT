    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Freedom From Government Competition Act of 1997\". Congress declares that private sector businesses are the strength of the American economic system, emphasizing the efficiency and productivity of competitive enterprises. Government competition with the private sector is deemed detrimental and currently at an unacceptably high level. When the government engages in activities beyond its core mission, it competes with the private sector. The government's diversion from its core mission leads to unfair competition with the private sector. Current laws and policies have not effectively addressed this issue, especially concerning small businesses. The reliance on the private sector aligns with the goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The Federal Government aims to rely on the private sector for goods and services to avoid competition and benefit employees affected by conversions. The Federal Government aims to rely on the private sector for goods and services to avoid competition and benefit employees affected by conversions. SEC. 3. RELIANCE ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR. The Federal Government's policy mandates agencies to procure goods and services from the private sector, with exceptions for specific circumstances. No agency can provide products or services that the private sector can offer, nor can they engage in transactions with other governmental entities. Exceptions exist for goods or services essential for agency functions. The agency can provide goods or services if they are inherently governmental, essential for national security, the best value source, or if private sector sources are unavailable. The agency may provide goods or services if private sector sources are inadequate to meet their requirements. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will create regulations for this Act, emphasizing a preference for private sector goods and services while ensuring fair treatment for federal employees. The Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, will provide information on benefits for Federal Government employees affected by conversions to private sector entities. Regulations will determine if private sector or agency sources offer the best value for goods and services. The standards and procedures for evaluating costs and sources in government activities include considerations of direct and indirect costs, source qualifications, past performance, and other relevant factors. The Director must consult with private and public sector individuals in developing these standards. The regulations will determine which governmental activities should continue to be performed by an agency or another agency. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will establish a Center for Commercial Activities and Privatization to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures outlined in the Act. The Center for Commercial Activities and Privatization will provide guidance and assistance for agencies and private sector entities to transition to using private sector entities for providing goods and services on behalf of the Federal Government. SEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORT ON COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT. The Annual Performance Plan under Section 1115(a) of title 31, United States Code is amended to include the identity of program activities performed by private sector entities and those not subject to the Freedom From Government Competition Act of 1997. The Annual Performance Report under Section 1116(d)(3) of title 31, United States Code is amended to include explanations and descriptions for activities not performed by private sector entities. The Annual Performance Report under Section 1116(d)(3) of title 31, United States Code is amended to include explanations and descriptions for activities not performed by private sector entities, including assessing if these activities could be done by private sector entities and setting a schedule for their conversion. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"agency\" in this Act refers to executive departments, military departments, and independent establishments. Goods or services are considered inherently governmental if they involve inherently governmental functions. An inherently governmental function is one that is intimately related to the public interest and requires discretion or value judgments in decision-making for the Federal Government, including interpreting and executing laws to bind the United States. The inherently governmental function involves taking action to protect interests, affecting private individuals, controlling officers, and managing property. Inherently governmental functions of the United States involve controlling or disbursing federal funds and exclude tasks like providing advice to government officials or performing ministerial duties such as building security and housekeeping. The curr_chunk discusses services that can be outsourced to the private sector, such as facilities operations, warehouse operations, and motor vehicle fleet management."
