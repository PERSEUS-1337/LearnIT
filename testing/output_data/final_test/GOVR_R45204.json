    "content": "NHTSA regulates fuel economy of vehicles under EPCA and EISA. Fuel economy standards were established in response to the 1973 oil embargo. CAFE standards were set for passenger cars in MY 1978 and light trucks in MY 1979 to reduce oil dependence. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) required NHTSA to set fuel economy standards for vehicles sold in the US. Standards for passenger cars remained at 27.5 mpg from 1985 to 2011, while light truck standards were at 20.7 mpg from 1996 to 2005. Fuel economy began to rise again in the mid-2000s due to increasing gasoline prices. In the mid-2000s, NHTSA implemented standards for MY 2005-2007 and MY 2008-2011 light truck fleets, increasing fuel economy to 24.0 mpg. Congress passed EISA in 2007, raising combined passenger car and light truck standards to 35 mpg by 2020. EPA regulates GHG emissions from vehicles under the Clean Air Act. In 2003, EPA denied a petition to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act, stating that the Act does not grant authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other GHGs based on their climate change impacts. This decision was challenged by Massachusetts and other petitioners, leading to a Supreme Court case in April 2007. The Supreme Court ruled in April 2007 that EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases (GHGs) as \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act. The Court's decision required EPA to determine if GHG emissions from new motor vehicles could endanger public health or welfare, and establish standards if necessary. Despite the ruling, the George W. Bush Administration's EPA did not take action, only issuing an information request. The Obama Administration's EPA issued findings on December 15, 2009, stating that greenhouse gases (GHGs) endanger public health and welfare, leading to discussions with stakeholders to develop vehicle GHG standards aligned with CAFE standards. California has unique status to issue stringent motor vehicle emission standards. California had already promulgated GHG emissions standards prior to 2009 and requested an EPA waiver under the CAA. EPA granted California a waiver in July 2009, aligning federal fuel economy and GHG emission standards with California's. The Phase 1 standards for MY 2012-2016 light-duty vehicles were promulgated by EPA and NHTSA in May 2010. CARB regulates GHG emissions from motor vehicles under California Assembly Bill 1493. Federal preemption of state regulations can be a concern in this area. Preemption of state regulations can occur when state laws conflict with federal laws under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Congress has the power to preempt state laws entirely, preempt conflicting state laws, or allow states to act freely. Title II of the CAA generally preempts states from setting their own emission standards for new vehicles, but CAA Section 209(b) allows for waivers for states with their own emission standards. California is the only state eligible for a preemption waiver to set emission standards for new vehicles if they are as protective as federal standards. CARB has submitted numerous waiver requests since 1967. In 2002, California passed AB 1493, requiring reductions in GHG emissions from vehicles. CARB adopted regulations in 2004 for reducing GHG emissions from noncommercial personal vehicles manufactured in MY 2009 and later. EPA initially denied California's waiver request in 2008 but granted it in 2009 under the Obama Administration. EPA reversed its decision, stating California's standards were necessary. In 2009, EPA granted California a waiver for MYs 2017-2025, based on the state's demonstrated need to address serious air pollution problems. California accepted vehicles complying with federal greenhouse standards as part of the National Program developed with EPA and NHTSA. The California waiver for MYs 2017-2025 allowed vehicles meeting federal greenhouse standards to also meet California standards. Other states can adopt California's emission standards under certain conditions without EPA approval. NHTSA and EPA implemented Phase 2 CAFE and GHG standards for MY 2017-2025 light-duty vehicles in October 2012. The Phase 2 standards, brokered by the White House, involved California, 13 auto manufacturers, and the United Auto Workers union. Manufacturers agreed to reduce GHG emissions from new passenger cars and light trucks by 50% by 2025, with fleet-wide fuel economy reaching nearly 50 miles per gallon. The standards apply to vehicles with a weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less sold in the US, with testing done over EPA's two cycles. The Phase 2 standards set by the White House aim to reduce GHG emissions from new passenger cars and light trucks by 50% by 2025, with fleet-wide fuel economy reaching nearly 50 miles per gallon. The rule includes emission caps for tailpipe nitrous oxide and methane emissions, using the concept of a vehicle's \"footprint\" to set differing targets for different size vehicles. This allows auto manufacturers to produce a full range of vehicle sizes. The agencies expected auto manufacturers to meet the MY 2017-2025 standards by using advanced technologies such as gasoline engines, weight reduction, improved aerodynamics, and electrification. Manufacturers report their fleet production, sales numbers, characteristics, fuel economy, and emissions results annually to EPA and NHTSA for compliance. The EPA and NHTSA use test cycles to calculate CAFE and GHG emissions standards for manufacturers based on fleet-wide sales. Compliance is determined by comparing calculated standards to adjusted test results for vehicles sold. Compliance targets vary for each manufacturer due to attribute-based standards. Manufacturers report production, sales, fuel economy, and emissions data annually for compliance. Manufacturers have flexibility in building light-duty vehicles to their own standards under the National Program. They can adjust fleet-wide performance through various technologies and earn credits for overcompliance with standards. Manufacturers can earn and use CAFE and GHG emission credits to comply with standards, including banking, borrowing, trading, and transferring credits. CAFE credits are earned for exceeding mpg standards, while GHG credits are earned for CO2-equivalent savings. Manufacturers can also pay a penalty for non-compliance with CAFE standards. Beginning with MY 2019, NHTSA is set to assess a civil penalty of $14 per 0.1 mpg over the standard for manufacturers who fail to comply with GHG emissions standards. The penalty could be as high as $37,500 per vehicle per violation, determined by the EPA Administer and the U.S. Attorney General. As of MY 2015, no manufacturer has been found to be out of compliance with the standards. The EPA and NHTSA conducted a midterm evaluation (MTE) for MYs 2022-2025 GHG emissions standards. EPA, NHTSA, and California have different statutory obligations regarding the standards. EPA and CARB were to decide whether to revise their standards, while NHTSA would require new rulemaking for MYs 2022-2025. The EPA Administrator was to determine the appropriateness of EPA's standards for MYs 2022-2025. The EPA and NHTSA conducted a midterm evaluation (MTE) for MYs 2022-2025 GHG emissions standards. A final determination could result in strengthening, weakening, or retaining the current standards. If the standards were deemed appropriate, the decision would be announced with the basis. If changes were needed, a rulemaking process would be initiated. The MY 2022-2025 standards would remain in effect unless changed by EPA through rulemaking. The Phase 2 rulemaking outlined formal steps in the MTE process, including a Draft Technical Assessment Report, a Proposed Determination, and a Final Determination by April 1, 2018. The EPA, NHTSA, and CARB jointly issued a Draft Technical Assessment Report for public comment on the MY 2022-2025 standards. The report found that auto manufacturers could meet the standards with more efficient gasoline-powered cars and only modest penetration of hybrids and electric vehicles. The Obama Administration's EPA released a proposed determination in November 2016 stating that the standards remained appropriate and no rulemaking to change them was warranted. The EPA finalized a determination in January 2017 that the standards adopted in 2012 remain feasible and appropriate. Some industry groups criticized the review results and vowed to work with the Trump Administration to revisit the decision. EPA emphasized the importance of regulatory certainty for the automotive industry. After industry groups criticized EPA's review, the Trump Administration announced a reconsideration of the MY 2022-2025 standards. EPA held a public comment period and released a revised determination in April 2018, stating that the current standards may be too stringent. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt revised the determination on the MY 2022-2025 standards, citing factors from the Phase 2 rulemaking. The revised final determination states that EPA and NHTSA will initiate a new rulemaking process. The EPA and NHTSA will start a new rulemaking process to consider revised standards for MY 2022-2025 vehicles. The current standards remain in effect until the new rulemaking is completed. It is uncertain how EPA would reverse California's preemption waiver for regulating GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles. California reaffirmed its support for the current National Program and its own standards in response to potential revisions by the Trump Administration. CARB accepted its staff's evaluation of the state's Advanced Clean Car program, including MY 2017-2025 vehicle GHG standards aligned with EPA's 2017 final determination. The EPA and NHTSA are considering revising the MY 2022-2025 vehicle GHG standards. Efforts are being made to establish a single national standard to avoid conflicting state regulations. EPA may reconsider California's preemption waiver for GHG standards due to the agency's conclusion that the MY 2022-2025 standards are not appropriate. EPA has never reversed a grant of a waiver before. The EPA may have the ability to reverse its decision to grant a waiver for GHG standards, even though it has never done so before. The process for reversing or revoking a preemption waiver is not addressed in the Clean Air Act Section 209(b) or the Administrative Procedure Act. EPA considers its waiver proceedings as informal adjudications, with no explicit procedures for reversing decisions made in previous informal adjudications. To reverse a waiver, EPA could follow CAA Section 209(b) requirements, granting preemption waivers unless specific factors warrant denial. If California determines its standards are as protective as federal standards, EPA can only deny a waiver if California's determination is arbitrary, not needed for compelling conditions, or technologically infeasible. EPA may need to rely on specific grounds to reverse its previous decision to grant a preemption waiver to California, such as if California's standards are not needed for compelling conditions or are technologically infeasible. The APA allows for judicial review of EPA's waiver determinations, with courts able to set aside actions that are arbitrary or not in accordance with the law. The DC Circuit cautioned that the EPA Administrator risks having waiver decisions set aside if evidence is ignored or unsupported assumptions are made. Differences in test procedures and systems between NHTSA and EPA create compliance challenges for auto manufacturers. Stakeholders advocate for further integration of CAFE and GHG emission standards. Table 4 outlines differences between federal programs like NHTSA's CAFE program, which may require legislative changes for adjustments. Proposed bills in Congress aim to address limitations of the CAFE program, such as extending credit banking periods and easing credit trading limits. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers petitioned EPA and NHTSA to address regulatory differences in fuel economy calculations for dual-fueled vehicles. NHTSA partially granted the petition for rulemaking in December 2016. Under the Trump Administration, NHTSA and EPA have discussed aligning regulations by potentially loosening NHTSA's requirements to match EPA's standards. This could help auto manufacturers avoid compliance penalties under NHTSA's CAFE program. Tightening EPA's flexibilities may also be considered for greater alignment. Key policy issues regarding CAFE and GHG emission standards, their design, purpose, and potential revision are being addressed. The CAFE and GHG emissions standards are technology-forcing standards authorized by Congress to set achievable performance levels in the future. These policies have roots in the 1970s and are common in health, safety, and environmental statutes. Congress enacted the Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act in 1965 to reduce tailpipe emissions, later amending it to include emission limits and deadlines due to dissatisfaction with progress. The Clean Air Act of 1970 was amended by Congress to include emission limits, deadlines for compliance, and an enforcement program. The MY 2017-2025 CAFE and GHG emissions standards are based on thorough technology analysis by EPA and NHTSA. Incentives were created to push vehicle manufacturers to develop necessary technology to meet the standards. The council and stakeholders expressed concerns about achieving the stringent MY 2025 standards, despite some manufacturers improving CO2 emissions and fuel economy from MY 2015 to MY 2016. Preliminary projections for MY 2017 show a potential improvement, with new product lines expected to be introduced in the coming years. The EPA noted that new product lines will help manufacturers comply with standards. 26% of MY 2017 vehicles already meet or exceed MY 2020 emissions targets. About 5% of MY 2017 vehicles could meet MY 2025 emissions targets, currently hybrids, plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Advanced gasoline technology will likely be needed to meet MY 2025 standards. The technology needed to meet the MY 2025 standards includes advanced gasoline vehicle technologies with modest hybridization and low electrification levels. This includes more efficient engines, aerodynamics, light-weighting, improved accessories, and other advancements. Stakeholders debate the level of advanced gasoline, hybrid, and electric penetration required. New technologies like higher compression ratio engines and mild hybrid systems are expected to be integrated into the fleet before MY 2025. The 2018 revised final determination questions the optimistic assumptions in the Draft Technical Assessment Report regarding electrification and future technologies for meeting MY 2025 standards. It highlights the initial costs incurred by manufacturers and consumers for adding fuel efficiency technologies to the U.S. fleet of passenger cars and light trucks. The agencies must consider costs when setting standards, as per EPCA and CAA provisions and E.O. 12866. The Draft Technical Assessment Report projects initial costs for meeting MY 2025 standards, which may be offset by fuel savings over time. The initial costs of meeting the MY 2025 standards are approximately $1,100 per vehicle, with total industry-wide costs estimated at $36 billion. Benefits of the standards include reducing CO2 emissions, energy security externalities, health benefits, and reduced refueling time. EPA estimates a reduction of 540 million metric tons of GHG emissions and decreased oil consumption. The MY 2022-2025 vehicle standards would reduce GHG emissions by 540 million metric tons and oil consumption by 1.2 billion barrels. Consumer fuel savings are estimated at $89 billion, with net benefits totaling $92 billion. The MY 2025 standards would result in $1,500 in savings per vehicle with a 5-year payback period. The 2018 revised determination raises concerns about underestimating costs and overstating benefits, calling for further assessment in areas like technology costs and learning curves. The Draft Technical Assessment Report does not consider the impact of standards on low-income consumers. Consumer buying decisions are influenced by various factors such as vehicle costs, gas prices, and family needs. The CAFE and GHG emissions standards aim to allow consumers to purchase different types of vehicles while saving on gasoline and improving fuel economy. Research on consumer issues, including an assessment of feasibility and practicability, is ongoing. The agencies are researching consumer issues related to vehicle affordability, willingness-to-pay for different vehicle attributes, and auto reviews. Phase 1 of the standards saw an increase in vehicle sales, fuel efficiency, vehicle footprint, and horsepower. The agencies did not find evidence of significant obstacles to consumer acceptance of the standards leading up to the Draft Technical Assessment Report. However, economic conditions have changed with a sustained drop in fuel prices, posing challenges for manufacturers under the CAFE and GHG emission standards. Manufacturers face challenges meeting CAFE and GHG emission standards due to consumer preference for features other than fuel efficiency, like horsepower and size. Lower gasoline prices incentivize consumers to prioritize these features over fuel economy, leading to decreased interest in alternative-fueled vehicles. This shift in consumer focus presents difficulties for manufacturers in achieving sales-weighted fleet-wide conformity. The 2018 revised final determination highlights challenges for manufacturers in meeting stringent standards, especially regarding consumer acceptance of advanced fuel-efficient technologies in gasoline and alternative-fueled vehicles. Factors such as costs, effectiveness, incentives, infrastructure, and consumer understanding may impact the adoption of these technologies. The Administration argues that higher prices for new motor vehicles with advanced fuel-efficient technologies could deter some consumers from buying new vehicles, leading to slower fleet turnover and keeping less efficient vehicles on the road. This could result in fewer benefits in fuel economy and GHG emissions reductions. EPA estimates that the standards could save 4 billion barrels of oil and reduce GHG emissions by 2 billion metric tons for vehicles produced in MYs 2017-2025, with further reductions expected for vehicles meeting standards in MYs 2022-2025. The EPA's GHG emission regulations on new motor vehicles aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and oil consumption. Consumer fuel savings are estimated to be $89 billion over the lifetime of vehicles meeting the MY 2022-2025 standards. The CAA includes protecting against air pollution that endangers public health or welfare. Transportation is a significant contributor to GHG emissions. The transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, representing 27% of total emissions in 2015. Light-duty vehicles, such as passenger cars and light trucks, accounted for 60% of these emissions. In 2015, transportation emissions surpassed those from the electric-power sector for the first time. Despite the electric-power sector's increased efficiency, emissions from transportation have continued to rise in recent years. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) requires the regulation of energy use and improved energy efficiency of motor vehicles. The Act mandates the consideration of technological feasibility, economic practicability, the impact of other vehicle standards, and the need to conserve energy when setting fuel economy levels. The Ninth Circuit Court allows NHTSA discretion in balancing these factors as long as it does not undermine the Act's requirements. Various trends from the mid-1970s through today have informed the discussion on energy conservation in the transportation sector. Some argue that more stringent fuel economy standards for vehicles are unnecessary due to an increase in available petroleum products for the United States. However, other trends show a movement away from energy conservation, emphasizing the need for fuel economy benefits to conserve oil. U.S. production of petroleum has reached a level not seen in decades, contrasting with past reliance on imports. The U.S. production of petroleum has reached a level not seen in decades, with net imports dropping to 24% of consumption. Gasoline prices have fluctuated since 1975, but currently, they are comparable to 1975 levels. EIA projects gasoline prices to remain below $3.00 a gallon through 2019. The U.S. vehicle fleet has shifted towards larger pickup trucks, SUVs, and crossover vehicles over the past 25 years, with sales of these vehicles increasing from 49% in 2000 to 65% in 2017. This trend is driven by factors such as more fuel-efficient engines, greater space, and versatility compared to standard passenger cars. Some automakers have shifted away from passenger cars due to low profit margins. Compliance with CAFE and GHG emissions standards also influences vehicle categories. The trend towards light trucks over passenger cars is similar, although not as pronounced. Vehicle miles traveled in the US increased nearly 150% between 1975 and 2017. EPA's analysis of emissions standards includes industry costs, vehicle sales, and employment impacts. The 2017 final determination found reasonable costs to manufacturers but no adverse impacts on sales or employment. The 2018 final determination raises concerns about the potential unreasonable costs of standards on automakers and auto dealers, impacting sales and employment in the automotive industry. Despite this, there is recognition of the standards' potential benefits in innovation, technology investment, and global competitiveness. The CAFE and GHG emission standards aim to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, with considerations for vehicle safety. The NHTSA and EPA consider safety implications when establishing CAFE and emissions standards. Past research has shown safety trade-offs with fuel economy increases, especially before NHTSA implemented an \"attribute-based\" standard. Downsizing vehicles in response to original CAFE standards resulted in hidden safety costs, as smaller and lighter vehicles were built. Manufacturers prioritized smaller and lighter vehicles over expensive fuel-saving technologies, leading to safety concerns. The shift to an \"attribute-based\" standard in NHTSA's MY 2008-2011 proposal was influenced by these safety worries. Despite improvements in vehicle safety, some argue that fatalities could be even lower without CAFE and GHG emission standards. Fatality rates have decreased overall but have been increasing since 2013, with 2016 seeing the highest fatality count since 2007. The fatality rate has been increasing since 2013, with 2016 seeing the highest fatality count since 2007. Factors contributing to this trend include less use of restraints, alcohol impairment, speed, distraction (e.g., cell phones and texting), downsizing and light-weighting of vehicles, and pedestrian fatalities. Vehicle design concerns remain, with agencies investigating mass reduction while maintaining safety and functionality. Safety metrics also consider health impacts of reduced air pollution and Phase 2 standards aim to reduce emissions of GHGs and other pollutants for improved respiratory health effects. The CAFE and GHG emission standards aim to reduce air pollution's respiratory health effects, such as asthma exacerbation and cancer incidences. While fuel economy has improved under CAFE standards, other market-based approaches like a gasoline tax or GHG emissions fee may be more efficient. State and local governments have also proposed policies to achieve similar goals. State and local governments are implementing policies to promote alternative-fueled vehicles and limit petroleum-fueled vehicles in cities and on highways. Other transportation-related policies, such as connected and autonomous vehicle technologies, ride-sharing services, and investments in mass transit and bicycle infrastructure, are also being developed. These policies are likely to impact fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions, potentially influencing vehicle performance standards. The CAFE and GHG emission standards, a federal program, may be affected by these evolving policies. The CAFE and GHG emission standards are a federal program that generally preempt state and local governments from regulating fuel economy and air pollution emissions from mobile sources. Auto manufacturers support a single national standard to avoid divergent state standards. Revising federal standards could reintroduce divergence if California and Section 177 states maintain higher standards, leading to discussions on potential solutions. Auto manufacturers are aligning vehicle safety and emission standards globally. Countries like Canada, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and European nations are implementing stricter GHG emissions standards. This could lead to potential challenges for US auto manufacturers as they consider revising fuel economy and GHG emission standards through MY 2025. Auto manufacturers may adapt to stricter global standards to remain competitive."
