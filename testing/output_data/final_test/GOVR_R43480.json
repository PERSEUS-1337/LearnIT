    "content": "Congress has expressed concern about ballistic missile and nuclear programs in Iran, North Korea, and Syria due to their anti-U.S. positions and threats to national security. Laws and reporting requirements have been established to deter these countries from developing such weapons. U.S. Intelligence assessments show no evidence of nuclear-related trade or cooperation between Iran and North Korea. Iran, North Korea, and Syria have engaged in ballistic missile technology cooperation, with Syria receiving missiles from North Korea and Iran. Unofficial sources allege significant cooperation on nuclear programs, but lack credibility compared to official assessments. The report discusses the key elements of a nuclear weapons program involving Iran, North Korea, and Syria, focusing on cooperation in ballistic missiles and nuclear technology. It highlights the challenges of producing fissile material for nuclear devices, including plutonium and weapons-grade highly enriched uranium. Iran and North Korea are pursuing nuclear material enrichment to increase uranium-235 concentration. Both countries have medium-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. Syria, on the other hand, only possesses short-range ballistic missiles. The IC does not assess that any of the three countries discussed in this report has produced a nuclear warhead capable of being delivered to its intended target at long range. North Korea has conducted nuclear tests, and Iran has a close working relationship with North Korea on ballistic missile programs. North Korea has sold Scud missiles and technology to Iran and Syria. During the 1990s, North Korea sold extended range Scud C missiles to Syria and Iran, with Iran also receiving Scud B SRBMs from Syria. Iran utilized North Korean ballistic missile technology to enhance its own missile capabilities, aiming for self-sufficiency in medium-range ballistic missile production. The IC noted a trend of Iran acquiring missile systems and components from North Korea, including space launch vehicle technology. Iran's acquisition of North Korean missile components has significantly enhanced its ballistic missile capabilities. Recent reports have highlighted past cooperation between North Korea and Iran in the transfer of ballistic missiles and technology. Despite a decrease in recent interactions, Iran publicly acknowledged receiving missiles from North Korea in the 1980s but claimed self-sufficiency in missile production. Iran has likely surpassed North Korea in developing ballistic missiles, but may still rely on Pyongyang for certain materials. Director of National Intelligence stated that Iran is not currently receiving assistance with its ICBM program. Syria acquired Scud missiles from North Korea. Syria has acquired Scud B and Scud C missiles from North Korea and has produced missiles with North Korean-supplied equipment. With North Korean assistance, Syria has made progress in domestic production of Scud missile variants and continues to rely on North Korean and Iranian assistance for its missile programs. Agency Director Michael Flynn testified in 2013 that Syria's missile program depends on foreign assistance from North Korea and Iran. There are concerns about clandestine nuclear cooperation between Iran, North Korea, and Syria, with potential transfers of expertise or technology. Syria's potential nuclear cooperation with North Korea and Iran has raised concerns, with reports of a nuclear reactor being built in Syria. The reactor was destroyed by Israel in 2007, with the IAEA stating it was likely for nuclear weapons production. Syria denied these claims. The United States assessed that Syria was constructing a reactor with North Korean assistance for the purpose of producing plutonium. Similarities were noted between the Syrian reactor and North Korea's reactor used for their nuclear weapons program. Evidence suggested the transfer of cargo from North Korea to Syria for this project. The United States found evidence of North Korea transferring nuclear reactor technology to Syria, with suspicions of cooperation between North Korea and Iran in developing nuclear weapons. Concerns were raised about North Korea potentially exporting its nuclear technology or materials. North Korea's nuclear weapons program is based on plutonium produced at Yongbyon and includes a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program. They have tested nuclear explosive devices multiple times. Iran also has a uranium enrichment program and is building a nuclear reactor, but lacks a reprocessing facility. Iran's nuclear program is a lesser proliferation concern as they lack a reprocessing facility for producing plutonium. A 2007 National Intelligence Estimate stated that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 but is keeping the option open. The intelligence community has reaffirmed this assessment. Dennis Blair discussed North Korea's reluctance to sell nuclear weapons or fissile material due to the need for their own deterrent and the risk of a military confrontation with the US. The possibility of North Korea engaging in nuclear-related cooperation with other countries, such as Iran, for financial gain or survival, including sharing technology or test data in exchange for expertise or resources. North Korea could potentially provide nuclear assistance to Iran, but this remains speculative and unconfirmed by official sources. U.S. intelligence assessments have not mentioned nuclear cooperation between the two countries, although they have noted cooperation on ballistic missiles. U.S. officials have publicly stated that there is no evidence of nuclear cooperation between Iran and North Korea. U.S. officials stated at a Senate hearing that there is \"no evidence\" of nuclear cooperation between Iran and North Korea. Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Countryman also mentioned in 2013 that there was no nuclear cooperation, but expressed concern. Current and former U.S. officials contacted by CRS were unaware of any such cooperation. Iran and North Korea have denied nuclear cooperation, with Iran reportedly halting its nuclear weapons program. The potential benefits of cooperation between the two countries are uncertain, as their nuclear programs differ in terms of fissile material used. Iran and North Korea may not be collaborating on nuclear technology, as their programs use different fissile materials. However, they could be competing to obtain dual-use technologies from the same supply networks, particularly in China. Both countries rely on foreign suppliers for their nuclear programs, with North Korea having an easier time securing shipments than Iran. North Korea and Iran rely on foreign suppliers for their nuclear programs, with North Korea having an easier time securing shipments. Chinese trading companies have a financial interest in maintaining business with both countries. Congress has passed legislation imposing sanctions on countries assisting Iran, North Korea, and Syria in acquiring weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery systems. The Iran Nonproliferation Amendments Act and INKSNA require reports on transfers of controlled items to Iran, North Korea, or Syria. Sanctions laws aim to deter foreign entities from assisting WMD and missile programs of these countries. U.N. sanctions also prohibit nuclear and missile technology transfers to Iran and North Korea. International export control regimes restrict such transfers. Congress may consider additional reporting requirements. Congress may wish to consider requiring additional reporting from the executive branch on WMD proliferation, as the number of unclassified reports to Congress on WMD-related issues has decreased. Recently, a requirement for the IC to provide an unclassified annual report on the acquisition of technology related to WMD was repealed. Congress may also want to request information on entities aiding unconventional weapons programs in countries other than Iran, North Korea, and Syria."
