    "content": "In 2017, 39.7 million people in the United States, or 12.3% of the population, were below the poverty line. The poverty rate decreased from 12.7% in 2016, but the number of people in poverty remained stable. The Census Bureau's estimates are used to determine poverty levels, comparing family income to a poverty threshold. These poverty estimates are released annually in September. This report discusses year-to-year comparisons, focusing on statistically significant changes in numbers or percentages. It also provides historical data on poverty for different demographic groups and states. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) is introduced as an alternative research measure that includes the effects of taxes and in-kind benefits on poverty. Comparisons between the official poverty measure and the SPM are included in the report. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) considers the effects of taxes and in-kind benefits on poverty, which the official measure does not. Policymakers may be interested in historical trends for developing poverty-related legislation and overseeing programs aiding the low-income population. The Census Bureau determines poverty status by comparing resources against a poverty threshold. The poverty threshold is determined by family size and composition, with 48 thresholds in total. Income from all family members is considered for those living together, while individual income is used for those living alone. Only money income is used for calculating poverty status, excluding in-kind benefits. Threshold amounts vary based on family size and ages of members. The poverty threshold, also known as the \"poverty line,\" is determined by family size and composition, with 48 thresholds in total. The threshold dollar amounts are updated annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index. No adjustment is made for geographic variations in living expenses. The official poverty measure used is the federal government's definition for statistical purposes. The poverty threshold, or \"poverty line,\" determined by family size and composition, is updated annually for inflation. The poverty rates in the U.S. have fluctuated over time, with notable lows in 1973 and 2000, and peaks in 1983, 1993, and 2010. The poverty rate in the U.S. peaked in 1983 (15.2%), 1993 (15.1%), and 2010 (15.1%). It tends to rise during and after recessions, lagging behind leading economic indicators like new housing construction. The poverty rate in 2017 saw a third consecutive annual decrease since the most recent recession, but remained higher than in 2000. The drop from 12.7% in 2016 to 12.3% in 2017 affected specific demographic groups more than others. In 2017, poverty rates varied among different family structures. Female-householder families had a poverty rate of 25.7%, higher than married-couple families (4.9%) and male-householder families (12.4%). In 2017, poverty rates varied among different family structures, with female-householder families having a poverty rate of 25.7%, higher than married-couple families (4.9%) and male-householder families (12.4%). Among individuals not living in families, the poverty rate was 20.7% in 2017, with no significant change from the previous year. Poverty rates for all family types together dropped from 9.8% in 2016 to 9.3% in 2017. When examining poverty by age, three main groups stand out: under 18, 18 to 64, and 65 and older. In 2017, poverty rates varied among different family structures, with female-householder families having a higher poverty rate of 25.7% compared to married-couple families (4.9%) and male-householder families (12.4%). Among individuals not living in families, the poverty rate was 20.7% in 2017. The poverty rate for the working-age population decreased to 11.2% in 2017 from 11.6% in 2016, with 22.2 million people in poverty. Children and the aged did not see significant changes in their poverty rate or number in poverty from 2016. In 2017, poverty rates varied by age and race. People under 18 had the highest poverty rate, while Hispanics saw a decrease in poverty. Having a job reduced the likelihood of poverty, but did not guarantee avoidance. Among full-time year-round workers, 2.2% were poor in 2017. Among part-time or part-year workers, 13.4% were poor in 2017, down from 14.7% in 2016. Poverty rates varied by age and race, with the highest rates among people under 18. The map in Figure 5 shows states with high poverty rates in parts of the Appalachians, the deep South, and the Southwest. Mississippi had one of the highest poverty rates in the nation at 19.8%. The poverty rates in various states varied in 2017, with New Hampshire having the lowest rate at 7.7%. It is important to consider that poverty thresholds are not adjusted for cost of living differences. The District of Columbia and 20 states saw declines in poverty rates from 2016 to 2017, with improvements in the Midwest, Northeast, and South regions. The poverty rates in different states varied in 2017, with New Hampshire having the lowest rate at 7.7%. Delaware and West Virginia were the only states with increases, while 28 states and Puerto Rico saw no significant change. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was developed due to criticisms of the official measure, which was originally created in the 1960s by Mollie Orshansky focusing on food costs. The 1955 USDA food consumption survey established minimum standards for nutrition, with families spending roughly one-third of their income on food. By multiplying the cost of a minimum food budget by three, total family income could be calculated. The USDA recommended food budgets to address nutritional needs of economically stressed families, with adjustments made for smaller households. This method has been used for over 50 years to determine poverty thresholds. The poverty measure in the United States has been criticized for not accounting for benefits from major aid programs, using money income before taxes, and not considering in-kind benefit programs like SNAP or housing assistance. Additionally, the method used to compute poverty thresholds has been questioned. The poverty measure in the United States has been criticized for not accurately reflecting current needs and available goods and services, not accounting for sharing of expenses among household members, and not considering geographic variations in the cost of living. In 1995, a panel recommended improvements to the poverty measure, including adjusting thresholds to reflect basic needs, broadening the definition of \"family,\" and including geographic adjustments in the computation. The panel recommended improvements to the poverty measure in the United States in 1995, including adjusting thresholds, broadening the definition of \"family,\" and incorporating geographic adjustments. The goal was to align the measure with the real-life needs of the low-income population. The Census Bureau implemented the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) in November 2011, which provides a more detailed analysis of individuals' and families' living arrangements compared to the official measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) offers a more detailed analysis of individuals' and families' living arrangements, taking into account relationships among household members and adjusting housing costs geographically. It provides an updated view of the circumstances in which the poor live and may offer policymakers a clearer understanding of how government policies impact the poor population. Developed as a research measure, the SPM is expected to be periodically revised to incorporate improved measurement methods and newer data sources. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) provides a detailed analysis of poverty demographics, showing differences from the official measure. In 2017, the SPM had a higher poverty rate (13.9%) compared to the official rate (12.3%), with more individuals aged 18-64 and 65+ in poverty. However, the SPM showed a lower poverty rate for individuals under 18 (15.6%) compared to the official measure (17.5%). The SPM includes in-kind benefits and foster children under 15, not typically accounted for in the official measure. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) provides a different definition of resources than the official measure, including in-kind benefits and excluding work-related and medical out-of-pocket expenses. In 2017, the poverty rate was lower under the SPM for the Midwest but higher for the Northeast, West, and South compared to the official measure."
