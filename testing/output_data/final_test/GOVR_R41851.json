    "content": "Over the last decade, global health programs have received increased attention and resources due to their importance in achieving broader U.S. foreign policy goals. U.S. support for global health has been driven by humanitarian concerns and the need to address emergent infectious diseases like SARS, pandemic influenza, and HIV/AIDS, which pose threats to international development, stability, and security. Presidents have prioritized global health initiatives in response to these outbreaks, with efforts coordinated with counterterrorism measures since the 1990s. In response to global health threats, U.S. Presidents have prioritized initiatives like the LIFE Initiative, PEPFAR, PMI, NTD Program, and GHI to address infectious diseases and enhance national security. President Obama announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI) to coordinate health initiatives, increase investments in underfunded areas, and strengthen health systems in weak states. The Obama Administration emphasized the importance of coordinating defense, health, and development efforts, citing the strategic value of improving global health, particularly in the Middle East. The GHI is seen as part of a \"smart power\" approach to foreign policy. During the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations, Congress has shown strong support for global health programs, funding them above presidential requests. Congressional priorities align with past administrations, focusing mainly on HIV/AIDS but also increasing investments in other health areas like malaria, maternal and child health, and neglected tropical diseases. Despite support, there has been debate on program prioritization and implementation. Some Members of the 112th Congress have questioned levels of non-security foreign aid and argued for reducing development and health assistance. Congress funds global health efforts through three appropriations, supporting programs managed by USAID, CDC, and the Department of Defense. Cuts to these programs could endanger vulnerable populations reliant on U.S. assistance. The United States supports global health initiatives through PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and UNAIDS. The Obama Administration's Global Health Initiative aims to coordinate these efforts and track funding. The State Department leads this effort, with plans to transfer leadership to USAID in the future. The majority of U.S. global health programs are funded through the Global Health Programs account. Funding for global health programs is provided through the Global Health Programs (GHP) account in State-Foreign Operations appropriations. This funding supports various global health programs managed by USAID and HIV/AIDS programs under PEPFAR. Congress also allocates funds for global health through other accounts within State-Foreign Operations and Labor-HHS appropriations. The U.S. Congress supports international HIV/AIDS and malaria research through various appropriations. Funding for global health programs is provided through different accounts, with agencies like CDC using funds for global TB programming. Departments may transfer funds among each other for global health activities. The U.S. Congress allocates funds for global HIV/AIDS activities to agencies like USAID and CDC. These funds may also be used for field research, evaluation, and addressing various health and development challenges. Estimates of U.S. global health spending vary due to different funding streams and definitions of global health assistance. The U.S. Congress allocates funds for global health activities to agencies like USAID and CDC, which include health system strengthening, environmental health, and collaborative responses to global health emergencies. This funding also supports initiatives like PEPFAR, PMI, NTD Program, and global health programs implemented by USAID and CDC. Through State-Foreign Operations appropriations, Congress supports USAID global health program areas including Saving Mothers and Children, focusing on maternal and child health, malaria, nutrition, family planning, and social services for vulnerable children. The portfolio aims to reduce morbidity and mortality, provide services to vulnerable children, increase access to family planning, and improve awareness. The CDC global health program areas supported by Congress include initiatives to prevent, treat, and address the impacts of HIV/AIDS, fight other infectious diseases like tuberculosis and pandemic influenza, and improve capacity in laboratory services and health systems. The focus is on vulnerable populations such as women, girls, and orphans, with activities including voluntary counseling and testing, awareness campaigns, and supplying antiretroviral medicines. The CDC global health program areas supported by Congress include initiatives to prevent, treat, and address the impacts of HIV/AIDS, fight other infectious diseases like tuberculosis and pandemic influenza, and improve capacity in laboratory services and health systems. This includes strengthening in-country capacity for HIV/AIDS surveillance, reducing death and illness from parasitic diseases and malaria, enhancing global disease detection and emergency response, and immunizing children against polio and measles. The CDC global health program aims to immunize children against polio and measles, build public health capacity, and support initiatives for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and pandemic influenza. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act authorized the creation of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to oversee bilateral HIV/AIDS programs and U.S. contributions to multilateral organizations. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) oversees U.S. bilateral HIV/AIDS programs and contributions to multilateral organizations like the Global Fund and UNAIDS. The bulk of U.S. global health assistance focuses on infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, through initiatives like PEPFAR, PMI, and the NTD Program. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) aims to coordinate various health efforts supported by USAID and HHS. In January 2003, President Bush announced PEPFAR, a government-wide initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR supports a wide range of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care activities and is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease. Congress authorized $48 billion for bilateral and multilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts in 2008. PEPFAR is overseen by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the State Department. The State Department oversees the distribution of funds from Congress to support global HIV/AIDS programs implemented by various U.S. agencies and departments, as well as multilateral organizations. President Bush announced the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in 2005 to expand U.S. global malaria efforts. PMI aimed to halve malaria-related deaths in sub-Saharan African countries through prevention and treatment techniques. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) includes interventions such as residual spraying, insecticide-treated nets, artemisinin-based combination therapies, and intermittent preventative treatment for pregnant women. PMI aims to halve the burden of malaria among at-risk populations in Africa by 2014. The initiative is led by USAID and CDC, overseen by the U.S. Malaria Coordinator, and includes representatives from various U.S. agencies. Additionally, USAID launched the NTD Program in response to FY2006 appropriations language. The NTD Program was launched in 2006 with a goal of providing treatments to 40 million people in 15 countries. President Bush committed $350 million to expand the fight against NTDs to 30 countries. In 2009, the Obama Administration amended the program targets to halve the prevalence of NTDs among 70% of the affected population. The Global Health Initiative, announced in 2009, aimed to provide a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy, including the NTD Program, with a projected cost of $63 billion over six years. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) aims to shift the U.S. approach to global health by addressing various health challenges through strengthening health systems and improving coordination of existing programs. Targets include preventing new HIV infections, providing treatment and care for millions, halving the burden of malaria for 450 million people in Africa, and contributing to the treatment of TB cases and reducing TB deaths by 50%. The Global Health Initiative aims to reduce TB deaths and disease burden by 50% compared to 1990 levels. It also targets a 30% reduction in child undernutrition, preventing 54 million unintended pregnancies, lowering maternal mortality by 30%, reducing under-five mortality rates by 35%, halving the prevalence of seven Neglected Tropical Diseases, and implementing core principles for programming. The Global Health Initiative aims to reduce TB deaths and disease burden by 50% compared to 1990 levels. It also targets a 30% reduction in child undernutrition, preventing 54 million unintended pregnancies, lowering maternal mortality by 30%, reducing under-five mortality rates by 35%, halving the prevalence of seven Neglected Tropical Diseases, and implementing core principles for programming. GHI proposes core principles to guide programming and coordination between global health agencies, focusing on women, girls, and gender equality, country ownership, sustainability, multilateral organizations, partnerships, private-sector engagement, strategic coordination, metrics, monitoring, evaluation, research, and innovation. 29 \"GHI Plus\" countries receive additional resources and technical assistance to accelerate implementation and serve as \"learning laboratories\" for best practices. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) is coordinated by an executive director at the Department of State who reports to the Secretary of State and the GHI Operations Committee. The Operations Committee oversees the initiative, with leadership expected to transition from the State Department to USAID in late FY2012. The government is taking actions to improve U.S. bilateral health programs and meet GHI targets and principles through coordination and integration with national governments, involving the State Department, USAID, and CDC. The State Department, USAID, and CDC are finalizing joint strategic plans for GHI Plus Countries to streamline programs, integrate initiatives, and align with national priorities. The plans aim to guide programs without replacing disease-specific strategies. The Obama Administration emphasizes addressing broader health challenges alongside disease-specific initiatives like PEPFAR and PMI, focusing on health system strengthening and improving health worker training and retention. The Obama Administration supports health-system strengthening, including improving health-worker training, laboratory capacity, supply-chain mechanisms, and information systems. They also prioritize attention to women and girls through integrated services for various health issues. The administration is reallocating global health resources to activities with maximum impact, focusing on evidence-based and results-oriented approaches. Positive interventions will be scaled up, while ineffective activities will be phased out under the Global Health Initiative. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) is focusing on monitoring and evaluating global health programs for better outcomes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 demonstrated continued congressional support for global health programs, providing $8.2 billion for USAID and the State Department, an increase from FY2011 funding levels. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided $8.2 billion for global health programs, with increased funding for most programs but a decrease for State Department HIV/AIDS programs compared to FY2011 levels. The President's FY2013 budget request includes $8.5 billion for global health activities, representing a 3.8% decrease from FY2012-enacted levels and signaling a potential shift in funding trends. Notable decreases in the request include funding through the GHP account for almost every global health program area. The FY2013 budget request includes decreases in funding for various global health programs, such as State Department HIV/AIDS programs, USAID maternal and child health programs, USAID malaria programs, USAID tuberculosis programs, and USAID neglected tropical diseases programs. However, there are increases in funding for USAID family planning and reproductive health, as well as for the Global Fund. The CDC global health budget for FY2013 is slightly higher than in FY2012, with steady funding or slight increases for most program areas. Notable increases are seen in global immunization and NIH HIV/AIDS research. The FY2013 budget request includes decreases in funding for various global health programs, such as State Department HIV/AIDS programs, USAID maternal and child health programs, USAID malaria programs, and USAID tuberculosis programs. The Administration argues that the proposed reductions in global health funding reflect increased efficiencies brought about by better integration between programs, greater use of community health workers and nurses, increased country contributions to programs, cheaper shipping costs of medicines, and reduced per-person treatment costs. Funding is being scaled back for PEPFAR programs in some countries to transfer costs to countries with growing capacity and domestic investment in the HIV/AIDS response. The Administration is reducing funding for global health programs in countries with other donor resources or low HIV prevalence, like Ethiopia. Despite the cuts, they aim to meet GHI targets, including treating 6 million HIV-positive individuals by 2013. Congress may not support all proposed reductions, especially in areas like family planning and the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The U.S. is a major donor for global health, particularly for HIV/AIDS efforts. The United States is a major donor for global health, especially for HIV/AIDS efforts, accounting for 30% of all donor pledges to the Global Fund. The U.S. role in global health has been both praised and criticized, with some experts questioning the implementation of programs like PEPFAR and PMI. Critics argue that past use of parallel health systems created for U.S. programs has led to duplication and hindered country ownership of global health programs. The United States plays a significant role in global health assistance, with some experts questioning the implementation of programs like PEPFAR and PMI. The lack of an overarching global health strategy has led to separate planning and reporting systems among agencies involved in global health activities. The Obama Administration has started the process of establishing a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy. The Obama Administration has initiated the Global Health Initiative (GHI) to establish a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy. GHI emphasizes a whole-of-government approach and interagency country strategy plans. Critics argue that GHI implementation lacks transparency and its impact remains unclear. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) has faced criticism for lacking transparency and unclear alterations to bilateral health programs. Some question if interagency cooperation is hindering GHI implementation and disease-specific activities. Concerns also exist about ambiguous funding streams, disparate goals, and vague roles of implementing agencies within the U.S. global health strategy. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) has faced criticism for lacking transparency and clarity in its implementation. Reports do not clearly outline the roles of different agencies, such as the Department of Defense (DOD), in furthering GHI goals. Uncertainty remains about the leadership transition from the Department of State to USAID and who will oversee the initiative. Congress may need to consider options to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the global health strategy. To support a clearer and more feasible global health strategy, options include requiring annual reports to explain the role of each implementing agency, clarifying funding for global health activities by agencies beyond USAID, CDC, and the State Department, detailing metrics for monitoring progress in GHI targets, illustrating annual progress and spending by each agency, outlining U.S. spending in multilateral organizations like the Global Fund and UNAIDS, and defining the recipient government's role in program design and evaluation. The government should review reporting requirements for U.S. health assistance programs to ensure they enhance program effectiveness. Congressional debate on foreign aid reform may influence U.S. health assistance strategies. The 112th Congress has focused on specific global health programs rather than questioning the overall Global Health Initiative strategy. Congress has not yet authorized legislation for the Global Health Initiative (GHI) and concerns exist about funding levels meeting the $63 billion target. Annual appropriations would need to increase to $14 billion in FY2013 and FY2014 to reach this goal. The debate over funding levels for global health programs is tied to broader discussions on the value and design of foreign aid programs. Concerns over aid effectiveness, corruption practices, and government spending have led to calls for greater commitment to global health issues. Some Members of Congress argue that investing in global health represents misplaced priorities in a difficult fiscal environment. USAID has responded to concerns by creating a task force to monitor aid effectiveness. In response to concerns over aid effectiveness, USAID established a suspension and debarment task force led by Deputy Administrator Don Steinberg. Additionally, a new evaluation policy was released to increase independent evaluation of projects with results within three months. President Obama also created the President's Global Development Council in 2012 to advise on global development policies and practices. The debate on U.S. global health spending is complex, with some arguing for increased funding due to life-saving interventions. Some advocates argue that increased funding is critical for scaling up new tools to prevent and treat diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria. Global health experts warn that a decline in spending could threaten U.S. efforts to develop agreements with recipient countries. Despite intentions to strengthen health systems, tackling HIV/AIDS remains a priority for the Obama Administration, with a commitment to support treatment for 6 million people by the end of 2013. The Obama Administration committed to supporting treatment for 6 million people by the end of 2013, following new findings on the effectiveness of early HIV treatment in reducing transmission. Concerns have been raised about declining funding for HIV/AIDS programs despite recent scientific advances. The United States government provides significant funding for global HIV/AIDS assistance, with 90% of HIV/AIDS spending in low-income countries being financed by external donors. The Global Fund relies on U.S. government contributions to finance their programs and attract additional funding. In 2011, the Global Fund had to cancel funding due to inadequate financial resources, raising concerns about sustaining progress in the fight against global HIV/AIDS. Some analysts are concerned about the United States' ability to maintain life-long HIV/AIDS treatment programs, as taking people off medicine could have fatal consequences. Critics question whether the U.S. should increase the number of patients receiving treatment given the lifetime need for treatment and stagnant HIV/AIDS budget. The costs of HIV treatment have decreased over time, but more patients may require expensive second- and third-line treatments. Recent findings on ART's preventative benefits raise questions about funding distribution for global HIV/AIDS programs. The curr_chunk discusses new questions regarding the distribution of limited funding for global HIV/AIDS, including how funds should be divided between treatment, prevention, and other forms of prevention. It raises concerns about meeting HIV treatment goals with decreasing funding and the potential impact on other HIV interventions. Additionally, it questions the duration of U.S. investments in HIV/AIDS and the implications for other global health priorities. In FY2012, around 57% of U.S. global health spending was allocated to bilateral HIV/AIDS efforts, with over 72% of funding going towards global HIV/AIDS programs. While there has been a focus on HIV/AIDS in congressional hearings and legislation, there is a push for increased funding for other health areas to maximize impact. Despite this, some experts argue for continued support for individuals receiving life-saving medicine under PEPFAR programs. Some experts argue that reducing global health funding could limit the US's ability to invest in new health priorities. Congress may face tough decisions on allocating resources between longstanding programs like PEPFAR and newer global health priorities. The Obama Administration has shown a focus on country-specific actions. The Obama Administration has emphasized country ownership of global health programs, which involves strengthening countries' capacity to manage their own health programs. Advocates believe this approach makes assistance more effective and facilitates the transition of program responsibility from foreign donors to recipient countries. Ownership levels vary based on countries' capacity and health needs. The Obama Administration emphasizes country ownership of global health programs to strengthen countries' capacity. USAID Administrator Shah endorses the concept, advocating for Partnership Frameworks in PEPFAR programs to support country leadership. In Nigeria, the government commits to funding half of the national HIV/AIDS program. The State Department's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review outlines steps to enhance country ownership, including providing 20% of U.S. funds to partner countries and increasing grants to local organizations. The Obama Administration emphasizes country ownership of global health programs, increasing grants to local organizations and partnering with more local organizations. Concerns have been raised about potential consequences of reduced U.S. global health spending leading to higher HIV infection and mortality rates in recipient countries. Some experts fear that reduced global health spending could lead to a rise in HIV infection and mortality rates, impacting other health efforts and sectors like agriculture. Countries may cut spending on other health issues, affecting vulnerable groups. Concerns also exist about resource-poor countries managing global health programs effectively. The United States is a major contributor to global health programs, including multilateral organizations like the Global Fund and the World Health Organization. There is ongoing debate in Congress about the balance between bilateral and multilateral assistance. The Obama Administration aims to increase support for multilateral partners through financial contributions and technical assistance. The Obama Administration has shown increased support for global health activities through actions such as a multi-year pledge to the Global Fund, funding increases for the Global Fund and GAVI Alliance in the FY2013 budget request, and restored funding for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The United States debates whether to support UNFPA amid concerns about funding diversion to China's family planning programs. President Obama has requested increased funding for UNFPA in FY2013. The issue of supporting multilateral organizations remains a key debate in Congress. Proponents of bilateral funding argue for strategic aid allocation and monitoring, while supporters of multilateral spending highlight the advantages of global health responses. Some argue for U.S. participation in multilateral global health responses to leverage resources efficiently, coordinate aid with various donors, and align assistance with recipient countries' priorities. Analysts urge better alignment of bilateral and multilateral health aid programs to eliminate inefficiencies and waste. Donors could eliminate waste by aligning financial, reporting, and monitoring practices. Recipient governments could extend health coverage with better harmonization of auditing, monitoring, and evaluation. Congress might consider bolstering U.S. global health aid alignment with multilateral donors, including pooled procurement and supply chain networks. Ratification of the International Health Partnership Compact could improve efficiency of health aid. The International Health Partnership Compact calls for international organizations and donors to align funding with national health plans, address diseases within a broader health system improvement framework, and be accountable through annual evaluations. Governments are urged to use national health plans to guide health system development, work with stakeholders, prevent fund misappropriation, and report results. Other donors should support coordinated multilateral approaches, invest in learning and evaluation, and promote best practices in health system strengthening. The International Health Partnership Compact calls for aligning funding with national health plans, promoting best practices, and holding organizations accountable for measuring impact. The United States leads in providing official development assistance for health, with $7.4 billion expended in 2010, accounting for over half of all health sector assistance from DAC members. Global health funding is facing financial constraints, with the United States giving less aid compared to European donors. Despite decreases in funding from donor governments, new actors like the private sector and foundations are getting involved. In 2009, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spent more on global health than most DAC countries. The Gates Foundation's spending in 2009 was $1.8 billion, surpassing Britain by $800 million. The Gates Foundation contributes $750 million to the Global Fund after its 11th funding round cancellation. Various disease-specific partnerships are emerging, involving national, multilateral, private, nongovernmental, and academic partners. There is a debate on the impact of the growing number of global health actors on U.S. influence and effectiveness in global health. Global health is a key issue in congressional debates over foreign assistance programs and funding levels. The Global Health Initiative proposes a new direction for global health programming, but it is uncertain if Congress will support the funding requests to achieve its goals. Congress may consider how much the U.S. should invest in new global health areas when determining funding levels. Congress may debate the extent of U.S. investment in new global health areas, ways to promote country ownership of programs, funding balance between bilateral and multilateral programs, and the U.S. role in global health. Congress also plays a role in shaping global health programs through funding guidelines, spending directives, and priority recommendations, with analysts discussing the impact of congressional involvement on program efficacy. Congressional spending directives may limit country teams' ability to tailor programs to in-country needs. Some argue that these mandates protect critical areas and facilitate a cohesive global health strategy. Legislation by the 112th Congress related to Global Health Initiative (GHI) may prompt reflection on how to best support global health needs effectively and efficiently."
