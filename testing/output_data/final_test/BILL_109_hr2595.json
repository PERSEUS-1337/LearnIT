    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Land Transfer Compensation Act\" and includes findings. The Act is based on a GAO report from 2003 that identified a fiscal imbalance in the District of Columbia caused by Federal mandates. It also references a bill introduced in Congress in 2005 for Federal compensation to address this imbalance. The GAO found that the District's structural imbalance is the difference between costs of services and revenue capacity. The District of Columbia has a substantial structural fiscal imbalance that is exclusively Federal in origin and beyond the ability of the District government to correct. The cost of providing services exceeds the national average and the District's capacity to raise revenue. The District of Columbia faces a significant annual structural fiscal imbalance ranging from $470 million to $1.1 billion. This imbalance is caused by the costs of providing services to the Federal Government, the tax-exempt status of over 40% of real property in the District owned or exempted by the Federal Government, and the District's responsibility for certain State functions like special education. These burdens hinder economic and population stability and growth in the District. The District of Columbia faces a significant fiscal imbalance due to high tax burden, debt service, and inability to make major investments. The GAO suggests options to address this imbalance, including expanding the tax base, federal financial support, and increased federal involvement. Land transfers authorized in this Act would help alleviate the issue. The land transfers authorized in this Act would create a new revenue stream equivalent to a partial payment for the District's annual structural imbalance. The Act aims to convey Federal property to the District of Columbia to reduce structural imbalance and boost economic development opportunities.
