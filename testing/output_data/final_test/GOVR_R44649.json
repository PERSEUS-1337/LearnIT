    "content": "The report examines FY2017 appropriations for the Treasury Department and its operating bureaus, including the IRS. It describes the President's budget request for Treasury in FY2017 and the current status of legislation in the House and Senate to fund the department. The report also discusses selected policy issues raised by the budget request and appropriations bills. The Treasury Department performs critical functions such as protecting the financial system, collecting tax revenue, managing federal debt, regulating financial institutions, and producing currency. The Treasury Department consists of departmental offices and operating bureaus. Departmental offices handle policy initiatives and day-to-day operations, while bureaus manage specific tasks and duties, accounting for over 95% of funding and workforce. Bureaus are divided into financial management/regulation and law enforcement, with entities like the Comptroller of the Currency and U.S. Mint involved in financial management. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus are responsible for financial management and law enforcement tasks. While most bureaus are funded through annual discretionary appropriations, the IRS stands out as it handles tax collection and enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security's establishment in 2002 reduced Treasury's direct involvement in law enforcement, with exceptions like the IRS. The Treasury Department's operating bureaus are funded through annual discretionary appropriations, except for the IRS which collects fees for its services. Treasury appropriations in FY2016 were distributed among 11 accounts, covering salaries, policy formulation, financial management, and law enforcement tasks. The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence account funds programs to prevent terrorist financing and money laundering. The Department-wide Systems and Capital Investments Program account invests in technology upgrades for Treasury's operations. The Office of Inspector General account covers expenses for audits and investigations to improve efficiency. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program conduct evaluations to improve efficiency, prevent fraud, and inform Congress about issues in Treasury operations. Their investigations focus on IRS programs and TARP management, aiming to recommend changes to address problems and deficiencies. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) evaluates the effectiveness of TARP, established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) protects the financial system from illicit uses like money laundering and terrorist financing through the Bank Secrecy Act. FinCEN works with financial institutions and federal agencies to ensure compliance with reporting requirements. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service funds functions previously handled by separate bureaus. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) account covers expenses related to payment policies, debt collection, financial accounting, and public debt operations. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (ATTB) account pays for activities related to enforcing laws on alcohol and tobacco sales and production. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (ATTB) enforces laws on alcohol and tobacco sales and production, as well as federal consumer safety laws. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFIF) supports community development financial institutions that provide funding for affordable housing, small businesses, and community projects. The CDFIF has awarded over $2.0 billion since its creation in 1994. The Treasury Department supports institutions through various programs like the CDFI Program, Native American CDFI Assistance Program, and BEA program. They have allocated $40 billion in New Markets tax credits to CDEs. The IRS uses funds for operations, taxpayer services, and enforcement measures to improve voluntary compliance. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request for the Treasury Department is reviewed. The Treasury Department's budget request for FY2017 is discussed, including appropriations for the Departmental Offices (DO) account. The President's request included $334 million for DO, $5 million less than FY2016. Anticipated reimbursable expenses would bring the total DO operating budget to an estimated $437 million in FY2017. The budget request for FY2017 included $437 million in total funding. Allocations included $38 million for executive direction, $59 million for international affairs, $76 million for domestic finance, $117 million for TFI, and $43 million for Treasury management. Additionally, $22 million was designated for various programs such as financial audit, IT modernization, and critical infrastructure protection. The budget called for increases in program expansions and maintaining FY2016 levels of operation, with decreases in non-recurring expenses. The House passed a bill (H.R. 5485) on July 7, 2016 that would have provided $250 million in appropriations for the Department of Treasury in FY2017. This amount did not include funding for TFI, which was addressed in a separate account under the bill. $57 million of the recommended appropriation would have been available through the end of FY2018 for various purposes including financial audit, IT modernization, and oversight of the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund. The House Appropriations Committee directed Treasury to enforce laws against wildlife trafficking and ivory poaching, submit reports on implementing the National Strategy on Wildlife Trafficking, and report on sanctions against Iran. Funding for FSOC and OFR was also addressed. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) were created by the Dodd-Frank Act. Currently, they finance their operations through fees from private institutions, giving Congress limited control. The committee directed OFR to submit quarterly budget reports and proposed bringing OFR funding into the annual appropriations process. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $347 million in appropriations for OFR in FY2017, with $123 million for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFI). This measure did not create separate appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $347 million in appropriations for the Office of Financial Research (OFR) in FY2017, with $123 million for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFI).

The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $347 million in appropriations for the Office of Financial Research (OFR) in FY2017, with $123 million for the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFI). Concerns were raised about Treasury's administration of economic sanctions against Iran, leading to the directive for two reports on the issue. One report will identify entities removed from the Iran sanction list in the past two years and their subsequent activities, while the other will focus on non-nuclear sanctions designations related to Iran issued by Treasury in the past three fiscal years. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, the Department of Treasury is receiving $224.4 million in appropriations, with $24.0 million available until the end of FY2018 for specific activities. In FY2017, funding for the Department of Treasury raised questions on budget management. The Obama Administration and Senate wanted TFI appropriations to be part of DO appropriations, while the House sought a separate account for TFI. The final appropriations act agreed with the House, with a key consideration being congressional control over TFI's funds. The FY2017 Treasury budget requested $5.0 million for DSCIP, the same as FY2016, with no new appropriations in FY2012 and FY2013. The FY2017 Treasury budget requested $5.0 million for DSCIP, the same as FY2016, with no new appropriations in FY2012 and FY2013. The funds would have been used to expand Treasury's Enterprise Data Management infrastructure to create a data repository for fulfilling responsibilities under the Data Accountability and Transparency Act.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 provides $3.0 million in funding for DSCIP, with restrictions on fund transfers to the IRS. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget requested $37.0 million for OIG, including $10.5 million for services to other agencies. The requested funding of $47.5 million would have been used for audits and investigations, with $2.8 million available for audits and investigations under the RESTORE Act. The audits and investigations would have met requirements of various statutes including the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Information Security Management Act, Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, Small Business Jobs Act, and Digital Accountability Act. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014, and RESTORE Act were among the statutes covered by the requested funding of $47.5 million for audits and investigations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $37.0 million in appropriations for the Office of Inspector General in FY2017, with a focus on overseeing the RESTORE Act and conducting audits of Treasury's facilities and information networks. The committee instructed the Inspector General to investigate various issues related to fund approvals, internal controls, grant monitoring, and outcome assessment. They also directed monitoring of BFS employees' treatment post-merger.

In FY2017, $2.8 million was allocated for audits and investigations under the RESTORE Act. The Obama Administration proposed a Cybersecurity Enhancement Account (CEA) with $109.8 million for Treasury-wide cybersecurity protection programs and IRS programs. The CEA aimed to strengthen cybersecurity and mitigate threats to the U.S. financial system. The budget request includes $62 million for the IRS. Funds from the CEA would be used for upgrading security of information systems, including the IRS e-Authentication system. The House bill did not include a CEA, while the Senate recommended a new appropriations account for cybersecurity investments. The Senate recommended a new appropriations account for cybersecurity investments totaling $47.7 million in FY2017 for Treasury-wide programs. The Treasury CIO would review and approve all investments under the account, with quarterly reports required to appropriations committees. No funds could be transferred from the account, ensuring CIO control over spending. The bill establishes a new appropriations account for cybersecurity investments with $47.7 million for FY2017. The funds cannot be transferred or spent without approval from the Treasury Chief Information Officer. SIGTARP would receive $41.2 million in appropriations for FY2017. In FY2017, SIGTARP's operating budget would have been $46.5 million, with an increase of $0.6 million to maintain operating levels and a decrease of $0.1 million due to efficiency gains from a loss of eight FTE positions. The total number of FTEs would remain the same as the lost positions would be absorbed in SIGTARP's PPIP fund. SIGTARP focuses on preventing waste, fraud, and abuse in the use of bailout funds authorized for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The House Appropriations Committee acknowledged the need for supplementary appropriations for SIGTARP in FY2017 to maintain its operations. The agency operates temporarily and will sunset once all TARP programs no longer have outstanding investments.

The CDFIF administers the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) through a competitive selection process. Congress authorized $40 billion in NMTCs through 2013, with an annual limit of $3.5 billion in new credits from 2010 to 2013. The credit was extended through 2019 with $3.5 billion in new credits annually from 2014 to 2019 under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 established the CDFI Bond Guarantee Fund (BGF) to support CDFI lending in underserved communities. Bonds issued under the program are guaranteed by the Treasury Department and used to provide long-term capital for new loans or refinancing. Treasury issued seven bond guarantees totaling $852 million between FY2013 and FY2015, with plans to issue up to $1 billion in guarantees in FY2017.

S. 3067 would have imposed limits on the use of funds in FY2017, including not targeting U.S. citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights and ensuring funds are not used for violating the confidentiality of tax returns or developing pre-populated tax returns. The bill would have provided $2.156 billion in appropriations for taxpayer services in FY2017, with allocations for programs like Tax Counseling for the Elderly and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. The Senate Finance Committee criticized the IRS for prioritizing online interactions over taxpayer concerns and lacking transparency about its resources and flexibility. In its report on S. 3067, the committee addressed concerns about taxpayer services, including the IRS's Future State plan to encourage online tools for assistance. The plan has raised concerns from parties like the National Taxpayer Advocate, urging more input from taxpayers and tax practitioners before implementation. The committee directed the IRS to submit a report on the feasibility of online accounts for taxpayers, in consultation with the NTA. Concerns were raised about the closure of TACs and the increasing number of understaffed centers. The committee expressed concerns about the impact of IRS's Future State initiative on rural taxpayers, fearing increased reliance on paid preparers or lack of timely assistance. They directed the IRS to hold public hearings before closing Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) and submit a strategic plan for improving services for various taxpayer groups. The committee addressed the availability of service for taxpayers in Alaska and Hawaii, directing the IRS to staff Taxpayer Advocate Service Centers with technical advisors.

The committee recommended $4.860 billion for IRS enforcement activities in FY2017, focusing on combating taxpayer identity theft and refund fraud. They urged the IRS to develop stronger safeguards and quicker assistance for victims of identity theft, based on recommendations from recent reports. S. 3067 would require the IRS to report to the committee within 90 days on their plans to address the issue. Additionally, the committee directed the IRS to assign a single contact person for each identity theft case and report back on the resolution time. Staffing for the SS-8 program, which determines federal employment tax status, was noted to be insufficient for the growing workload. The IRS established the Determination of Worker Status Program in 1994, now known as the SS-8 program, to determine if a worker is an independent contractor or employee. The program's inventory and processing times increased from FY2009 to FY2012. In 2012, the IRS implemented a new method to speed up worker status determinations. The committee directed the IRS to notify relevant committees about these changes. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees, Ways and Means Committee, and Senate Finance Committee reviewed S. 3067 for IRS operations support funding in FY2017. The bill allocated $3.638 billion, $393 million less than the budget request. A 2016 GAO report stated that 97% of IRS's major IT investments in FY2017 would be funded through appropriations, with quarterly reports required on various IT projects. The committee directed the Treasury Department to review IRS's IT investments every six months to ensure transparency in cost, schedule, and scope goals. The GAO is required to submit an annual report on the cost and results of IRS projects. The committee directed the Treasury Department to review IRS's IT investments every six months for transparency. The GAO must submit an annual report on the cost and results of IRS projects, especially those in FY2017. The committee recommended $290.0 million for the BSM program in FY2017, expressing concerns about cybersecurity and project delays. IRS instructed to provide quarterly reports on CADE2 and MeF projects in FY2017. The reports should detail the performance schedules for projects CADE2 and MeF, including start dates, expected completion dates, percentage of work completed, schedule changes, and non-funding related risks. The Treasury Department and GAO are required to submit separate reports on the cost and results of the projects. $11.235 billion in appropriations is allocated for the IRS in FY2017, divided among taxpayer services, enforcement, operations support, and BSM. An additional $290 million is provided for IRS purposes. The IRS received an additional $290 million for customer service improvements, online security enhancement, and reducing identity theft and fraud. These funds are to supplement, not replace, FY2015 appropriations and require a plan submission to appropriations committees. Administrative provisions include fund transfers with consent, allocation for efficient toll-free service, and resource enhancement directives. The IRS is directed to allocate resources to enhance response time for taxpayer communications, especially for victims of tax-related crimes. Funds cannot be used to target U.S. citizens exercising First Amendment rights or groups based on ideological beliefs. Bonuses or re-hiring of former IRS employees must consider their work record and tax law compliance. Funds cannot be used to develop pre-filled tax returns or issue regulations without approval. Up to 2% of IRS appropriations can be transferred to TIGTA with approval.

The act provides $290 million for the Business System Modernization program, with funds available through FY2019 for acquiring IT systems. Quarterly reports on cost and performance schedules for CADE 2 and Modernized e-File projects are required. Policy issues raised include the IRS's funding needs to meet strategic goals and statutory responsibilities, and the rationale for proposed program increases. The Obama Administration requested a substantial increase in the IRS budget for FY2017 to meet legal responsibilities and strategic goals. Supporters argue for a larger budget to handle the agency's workload effectively. The IRS budget for FY2017 was $1.045 billion. Recent trends show a decrease in resources and workforce, with a significant reduction in enforcement staff. The IRS's aging workforce has led to decreased live assistance for taxpayers, with only 38.1% of calls answered in FY2015. In FY2015, the IRS had an average wait time of 30.5 minutes, which is expected to improve to 25.8 minutes in FY2016. New internal rules limited IRS customer assistance and audits decreased for individuals and large corporations. The overage rate for IRS correspondence doubled from 20.3% in FY2010 to 49.4% in FY2015. Since 2010, the IRS has seen an increase in individual tax returns processed and has taken on new responsibilities like implementing the ACA and FATCA. Cases of taxpayer identity theft and refund fraud have also risen significantly. Proponents of a larger IRS budget are concerned that a lack of resources could lead to decreased effectiveness in taxpayer services, delays in critical business systems, increased tax evasion and identity theft, vulnerability to cyberattacks, and reduced taxpayer confidence in the tax system. Opponents argue against substantial budget increases for the IRS. Critics argue that the IRS must demonstrate sound spending priorities, program efficiencies, and regain taxpayer trust before considering budget increases. Trust was shaken in 2013 due to allegations of discrimination against conservative organizations. The IRS must carefully plan and allocate its user fees to meet its responsibilities, achieve strategic objectives, and address critics' demands. Lawmakers must consider the appropriate size and allocation of the IRS budget to reduce the tax gap, maintain tax system integrity, meet taxpayer needs, and prevent security breaches. Increased Funding for Enforcement and Operations Support through Program Integrity Cap Adjustments under the Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for adjustments to discretionary spending caps for various reasons, such as changes in budget concepts, emergencies, and appropriations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for adjustments to discretionary spending caps for various reasons, including emergencies, Overseas Contingency Operations, disability reviews, health care fraud, and disaster relief. These adjustments aim to support program integrity initiatives and reduce improper benefit payments. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for IRS enforcement activities and operations support in FY2017 through a program integrity cap adjustment. This adjustment would have allowed for new investments by the IRS from FY2017 to FY2026, resulting in a net savings of $46 billion. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for IRS enforcement activities in FY2017, resulting in a net savings of $46 billion. Congress may want to consider the advantages and disadvantages of paying for increases in IRS's enforcement activities through such an adjustment. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) established guidelines for consistent treatment of government program budgetary effects. Changes require unanimous consent from budget scorekeepers. IRS activities cannot use additional revenue to finance tax cuts or spending increases under congressional pay-go rules. Proposed changes in IRS funding impact the federal budget deficit. The proposed changes in IRS funding impact the federal budget deficit, but would not alter the projected deficit in FY2017. Limitations also apply to other government compliance activities to prevent improper payments. Legislative proposals altering tax laws may reflect indirect and dynamic revenue effects. H.Res. 5 requires incorporating macroeconomic effects of major legislation in official estimates. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) is urged to consider the macroeconomic effects of major legislation in their cost estimates. Changes in IRS funding may impact taxpayer compliance and generate indirect revenue effects not currently scored. Congress should take into account the net contribution of IRS administration to the federal tax code when appropriating funds. The IRS's administration of the federal tax code should be considered when appropriating funds for the federal budget."
