Congress acknowledges the worsening crisis in public infrastructure in the United States, including a lack of various essential facilities. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates a need for $1.7 trillion to repair and replace outdated infrastructure. The infrastructure crisis was highlighted after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused breakdowns in critical infrastructure in the Gulf States. Federal funding is crucial for addressing these infrastructure challenges. Investing $1 billion in infrastructure creates 50,000 jobs and $6 billion in economic activity. High unemployment rates persist, especially among young males, with decreasing wages. Infrastructure projects require semi-skilled labor, including repairing dams and replacing locks, creating thousands of jobs. The Urban Youth Corps and other volunteer programs have contributed to public works and disaster response projects. The Corporation for National and Community Service should expand its authority to create a National Infrastructure Corps to provide employment opportunities and address urban unemployment trends. Establishment of National Infrastructure Corps under Title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, adding a new section for the creation of a National Infrastructure Corps. The National Infrastructure Corps, established under Title I of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, defines key terms such as Corps, eligible project, and eligible individual for the construction or repair of economic infrastructure facilities in the United States. Eligible individuals must be unemployed or part-time employed due to economic reasons, aged between 18 and 40, and citizens or lawful residents of the United States. The term 'qualified infrastructure corps' refers to a program established by a State, local government, or nonprofit organization to carry out eligible projects and provide employment to eligible individuals in the United States. The National Infrastructure Corps is established to address economic infrastructure needs and provide employment opportunities to individuals in urban and rural areas. The Corps, composed of up to 40,000 individuals recruited by the Corporation, may provide employment training and housing for participants. Training agreements may be made with building trades unions. Participants may reside together in Corps housing for up to 1 year. The Corps, consisting of up to 40,000 individuals recruited by the Corporation, may offer employment training and housing for participants, with training agreements possible with building trades unions. Participants can live together in Corps housing for up to 1 year. SEC. 199EE outlines projects to be carried out by the Corps. The Corporation selects eligible projects for the Corps with financial assistance, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Army. Projects are based on proposals from Federal, State, and local entities for disaster relief activities. The Corporation prioritizes disaster relief projects to repair infrastructure damaged by natural disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. It can collaborate with the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies through contracts and agreements. The Corporation can enter contracts and agreements with other federal entities, such as the Urban Youth Corps, National Resource Conservation Service, and National Civilian Community Corps, to perform eligible projects. The Corporation may contract with the Chief of the National Resource Conservation Service for rebuilding upstream structures nationwide. It can also work with qualified infrastructure corps through contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants to support eligible projects. The Corporation coordinates activities of the Corps with other national service activities under this title, and matching funds requirement applies to financial assistance provided. The Corps participants must be paid prevailing wages for construction work funded under this subtitle, as determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to set these wages. Additionally, the Corps operates under a non-federal status. Individuals in the Corps are not considered Federal employees and are exempt from laws regarding Federal employees, except for work-related injuries where they are treated as employees of the United States for compensation purposes. Individuals in the Corps are not considered Federal employees except for work-related injuries. They are not in the performance of duty unless authorized by the Director of the Corporation. Participants in the Corps are treated as employees of the United States for tort claims liability and procedure. Authorization of $900,000,000 for National Infrastructure Corps for fiscal years 2007-2010. Amendments to the National and Community Service Act include definitions, establishment, purposes, participation, projects, wages, and non-Federal status. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. Amends the National and Community Service Act to include an economic infrastructure construction program like the National Infrastructure Corps."
