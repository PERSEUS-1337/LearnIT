    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act of 2017\". It includes a Coastal Community Vulnerability Assessment. The \"Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act of 2017\" amends the Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2009 to include a Community Vulnerability Assessment for coastal communities in the United States. The assessment will identify communities most dependent on coastal resources and will be updated every 7 years. The Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act of 2017 amends the Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2009 to include a Community Vulnerability Assessment for coastal communities in the United States. This assessment aims to identify communities most dependent on coastal and ocean resources that may be impacted by ocean acidification. It will assess the social and economic vulnerabilities of these communities, identify potential impacts, gaps in knowledge, and possible adaptation strategies in collaboration with experts. The Community Vulnerability Assessment for coastal communities in the United States, as part of the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act of 2017, will be conducted in collaboration with experts, indigenous knowledge groups, and stakeholders familiar with the unique concerns of these communities. This includes representatives from the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Office for Coastal Management of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observing System regional information coordination entities. The Secretary will collaborate with State, local, and tribal government entities conducting vulnerability assessments and research planning related to ocean acidification. This collaboration aims to determine if these activities can serve as models for other communities. The curr_chunk discusses amending the Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act to include an ongoing input mechanism for various stakeholders to provide input on research, data, and monitoring related to ocean acidification. It also mentions the development of a strategic research plan. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act is being amended to include recommendations for research in social sciences and economics to address knowledge gaps identified in a vulnerability assessment report. Additionally, the act will now involve input from tribal governments and indigenous knowledge groups. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must report to Congress within 90 days on efforts to support State, local, and tribal vulnerability assessments, research planning, and monitoring needs as per the Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2009."
