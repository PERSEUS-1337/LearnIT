    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 527.11 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to allow the owner of vacant real property to register it with the local law enforcement agency, stating that the property is vacant and not authorized for occupancy. The registration must include the owner's contact information and a statement that law enforcement or a security company will handle inspections. The owner or agent must register vacant property within three days of learning it is vacant. They must issue written authorization for occupancy, notify law enforcement, and terminate registration when authorizing someone to occupy the property. Upon sale, the owner must notify law enforcement and terminate registration. A licensed security company or law enforcement agency must inspect the property at least once every three days. The law enforcement agency must inspect vacant property every three days and notify immediately if unauthorized persons are found. Upon notification, the responding officer must verify recent inspection, identify individuals on the property, and request proof of authorization for access. (4) Notify individuals without authorization that the owner may seek a court order and they could be arrested for trespass. (5) Confirm with the owner or agent that the property is vacant. The owner or owner's agent of vacant real property can file for a restraining order against unauthorized individuals found on the property 48 hours after notification. Failure to vacate may result in arrest for trespass and civil contempt. The summons and complaint in an action brought under this provision can be served personally or by posting at the property and mailing a copy to the property's address. Posting and mailing are sufficient even if the mailed copy is undeliverable with proof of mailing. The court may order a hearing on a temporary restraining order within three days of service, with details included in the summons or separately served on occupants. The court may issue a temporary restraining order requiring property to be vacated within 48 hours, enforceable by law enforcement. Disposition of personal property of a person under the order is governed by specific procedures. The person is considered a former tenant for personal property purposes only. Owners can pursue other legal remedies to remove individuals from vacant property. The local city council or board of supervisors establishes fees for registering vacant properties and conducting inspections by law enforcement. This section applies to one- to four-unit residences in specific cities and counties. Section 527.12 of the Code of Civil Procedure allows property owners to file a \"Declaration of Ownership\" with local law enforcement for unoccupied residential properties. This section is in effect until January 1, 2018, unless extended by a later statute. \"Declaration of ownership for unoccupied residential properties can be filed with local law enforcement under Section 527.12 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\" The declaration states ownership of a residential property in California, with a true copy of the deed provided. No ownership interest has been transferred since acquisition, and the property was unoccupied at the time of ownership. As of the present date, no persons are authorized to reside on the Property without consent. No lease or rental agreements have been made for occupancy. Any change in occupancy status will be reported to local law enforcement. The declaration is affirmed to be true under penalty of perjury. \"EXECUTED on _________________________________, at _______________________, California\u201d The section imposes liability on property owners for filing false declarations causing someone to vacate the property, with penalties including attorney's fees and damages. It applies to specific residential areas in certain counties and cities until January 1, 2018, unless extended by a later statute. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for specific cities and counties to establish a program to analyze its effectiveness before potential extension to other jurisdictions. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. However, if the Commission on State Mandates finds other mandated costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts. The act is an urgency statute to preserve public peace, health, or safety. It authorizes the expansion of a pilot program created in 2014 to local jurisdictions facing challenges with squatters."
