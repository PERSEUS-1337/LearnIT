Lifetime Savings Accounts are trusts established for individuals with contribution limits, trustee requirements, nonforfeitable interests, restrictions on investments, and asset segregation rules.

A qualified rollover contribution to a Lifetime Savings Account can come from another account of the same beneficiary or from a spouse's account, as long as it is done within 60 days of the distribution. Additionally, contributions can also come from qualified tuition programs or Coverdell education savings accounts before January 1, 2006. Rules similar to section 408(e) apply to Lifetime Savings Accounts. Custodial accounts or annuity contracts can be treated as trusts if they meet specific requirements. For a Lifetime Savings Account, the person holding the assets is treated as the trustee. Reports on the account must be made to the Secretary and beneficiary as required. Excess contributions may be subject to tax under section 4973 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The paragraph discusses the conditions for transferring amounts received before January 1, 2006, into a Lifetime Savings Account for the same beneficiary. The \"qualified portion\" is defined as the amount in the beneficiary's account on December 31, 2003, plus any contributions to the account. The paragraph discusses limitations on contributions and earnings for a beneficiary's account in a Lifetime Savings Account for the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2004, and before January 1, 2005. The total amount taken into account for all accounts of the beneficiary, including earnings, should not exceed $5,000. The amendments for Lifetime Savings Accounts will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2004."
