    "content": "FISA provides procedures for various investigative methods under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, including electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace surveillance, and orders for tangible things. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) reviews and approves governmental applications for these authorities. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) reviews and approves governmental applications for investigative methods under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Following the 9/11 attacks, the NSA started a program to collect domestic telephony metadata in bulk to identify terrorist networks. This program is authorized by orders from the FISC under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. The FBI can request the FISC for an order under Section 215 to compel the production of \"any tangible thing\" if it is relevant to authorized investigations on foreign intelligence, terrorism, or counter-espionage. Concerns about the constitutionality of the NSA telephony metadata program arose after details were made public in 2013, with arguments that bulk collection violates the Fourth Amendment. The telephony metadata program collects domestic and international telephone records, with restrictions on searching and further use imposed by FISC orders. Metadata includes call numbers, date, time, and duration, but not audio content. The telephony metadata program collects call numbers, date, time, and duration of calls, but not location information. Changes to the program were announced by President Obama in 2014, but NSA's ability to collect telephone records remains unaffected. Additional restrictions were placed on searching the dataset. The NSA collects telephony metadata from telephone service providers under Section 215 orders on an ongoing daily basis. The data is stored in a database called the \"Collection Store\" and must be deleted after five years. Searching the database is allowed only with reasonable suspicion that a number is linked to a foreign intelligence target. The NSA collects telephony metadata under Section 215 orders, with data stored in the \"Collection Store\" and deleted after five years. RAS is a less stringent standard used for querying data, with changes made in 2014 requiring FISC approval for RAS determinations. The FISC approved modifications for RAS determinations in 2014, following NSA non-compliance in 2009. Once a telephone number is RAS-approved, it can be used as a query seed in the Collection Store. After the NSA's bulk telephony program was made public in 2013, queries could include telephone numbers up to three hops away from the initial seed. However, since January 2014, query results are limited to telephone numbers within two hops of the seed. Results from queries are stored in the Corporate Store, which does not require RAS standard compliance. Several lawsuits were filed challenging the constitutionality of the NSA's bulk telephony metadata program under the Fourth Amendment. Courts are debating whether the bulk collection of telephone records constitutes a Fourth Amendment search and if it is reasonable in balancing privacy interests and national security concerns. The applicability of the 1979 case Smith v. Maryland is a key factor in this debate. The debate over the constitutionality of the NSA's bulk telephony metadata program hinges on the applicability of the 1979 case Smith v. Maryland to the program and the impact of new technologies on privacy rights. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, defining a search as a violation of a reasonable expectation of privacy. Smith v. Maryland is crucial in determining if accessing phone records constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. The Supreme Court ruled that installing a pen register on Smith's phone without a warrant was not a Fourth Amendment search because he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the numbers he dialed. The Court held that individuals lose privacy protections when they voluntarily share information with third parties. The \"third-party doctrine\" theory states that individuals lose privacy protections when sharing information with a third party, whether private or government. This concept has been applied in various cases, including undercover agent situations and government requests for transactional records from private companies. The FISC analyzed the NSA's bulk metadata collection program under the Fourth Amendment before court rulings in ACLU v. Clapper and Klayman. The court held that Fourth Amendment interests are individual, not group-based, and that grouping individuals together does not create a Fourth Amendment interest. In ACLU v. Clapper, Judge Pauley agreed with the FISC that bulk metadata collection by the NSA did not violate the Fourth Amendment, citing the Smith case. The ACLU argued that this collection intruded on privacy similar to the GPS tracking in United States v. Jones, where the Supreme Court found it to be a Fourth Amendment search. In ACLU v. Clapper, Judge Pauley agreed with the FISC that bulk metadata collection by the NSA did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Second Circuit later held that the bulk telephone metadata program exceeded congressional authorization under the PATRIOT Act. The Second Circuit held that the bulk telephone metadata program exceeded congressional authorization under the PATRIOT Act. The court acknowledged the challenges raised by modern technology in altering traditional expectations of privacy, but based its decision solely on statutory grounds. The Second Circuit court's decision on the bulk telephone metadata program was based solely on statutory grounds. The court emphasized that Congress is better suited to understand and balance national security concerns, suggesting that congressional authorization is relevant to the program's constitutionality. The focus was on whether the program constitutes a Fourth Amendment search and if it is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment's balancing test. The court upheld Section 215 of FISA against a Fourth Amendment challenge, citing the third-party doctrine and the need for Supreme Court clarification. The case is currently on appeal before the Ninth Circuit. The district court rejected criminal defendants' motion for a new trial, stating that the use of pen registers predates the digital revolution by 150 years, making the argument about new technologies invalid. In a separate case, Judge Leon found that the aggregation of telephone records could constitute a Fourth Amendment search, differing from the simple pen register upheld in Smith. He favored the mosaic theory from the Jones concurrences in assessing the bulk telephony metadata program. Judge Leon applied the mosaic theory from the Jones concurrences to determine that the aggregation of telephone metadata constituted a Fourth Amendment search. He found that this collection invaded individuals' reasonable expectation of privacy, leading to the conclusion that a Fourth Amendment search had occurred. The court then evaluated the \"reasonableness\" of this search under the Fourth Amendment, considering the special needs exception due to the lack of a warrant or probable cause required for the metadata program under Section 215. The special needs exception allows for searches without a warrant or probable cause in cases where the government's interest goes beyond normal law enforcement needs. Examples include suspicionless drug testing of students, automobile checkpoints, and searches of passengers' carry-on bags. Courts must balance individual privacy interests with government needs to determine if a warrant or suspicion is necessary. Judge Leon considered the privacy interests of the plaintiffs in their telephone data, the government's interest in identifying terrorists, and the efficacy of the metadata program. He questioned whether the program had actually prevented imminent attacks or aided in time-sensitive objectives. Due to doubts about its effectiveness and serious privacy intrusions, the court deemed the bulk metadata program unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The court found the bulk metadata program unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The government's appeal is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals. Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act is set to expire on June 1, 2015, potentially affecting pending cases challenging the program. The NSA also acquired Internet-based communications without traditional warrants, leading to new statutory authority under the Protect America Act and the FAA. NSA collected 250 million Internet records according to a declassified 2011 opinion from the FISC. The NSA collected 250 million Internet communications per year, with 91% acquired directly from Internet Service Providers (PRISM collection) and 9% through upstream collection. Two methods for collecting information about a target were identified: \"to/from\" communications collection and \"about\" communications collection. Technical limitations in the upstream collection result in the acquisition of some unrelated communications. The PRISM and upstream collections acquire the contents of communications from foreigners abroad, authorized under Section 702 of FISA. Acquisition is limited and may last up to one year. The limitations for acquisitions under Section 702 of FISA include not targeting individuals in the United States, not targeting U.S. persons outside the country, and conducting surveillance in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Traditional FISA orders require probable cause to target a foreign power or agent. Under Section 702 of FISA, surveillance targets are not necessarily reviewed by the FISC before their communications are acquired. The FISC's role is to review targeting and minimization procedures to ensure that acquisitions are limited to persons outside the U.S. and to prevent intentional acquisition of communications where all parties are in the U.S. Minimization procedures must also be in place to limit retention and prohibit certain actions. The minimization procedures aim to reduce retention and prevent dissemination of information about or identifying U.S. persons, but may allow for retention and dissemination of crime-related information. Constitutional challenges to NSA's Internet communications acquisition under FISA have been raised in various contexts, including FISC, FISCR, and federal courts in civil and criminal cases. Prior to the enactment of Section 702, a joint authorization procedure created under the PAA was upheld by the FISCR in 2008. This suit involved an ISP objecting to a directive for surveillance assistance under the PAA. The ISP raised Fourth Amendment privacy rights of its customers through third-party standing. The government typically needs a warrant for electronic surveillance under the Fourth Amendment, unless an exception applies. The FISCR previously suggested a foreign intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment for warrantless electronic surveillance. The FISCR recognized a foreign intelligence exception under the PAA, allowing warrantless surveillance for acquiring foreign intelligence information beyond routine law enforcement purposes. The court found that requiring a warrant would hinder the government's ability to collect time-sensitive information. The FISCR recognized a foreign intelligence exception under the PAA, allowing warrantless surveillance for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The court held that the Fourth Amendment required the surveillance to be reasonable, based on the totality of the circumstances. In August 2013, the Obama Administration partially declassified opinions of the FISC regarding collection activities under Section 702, evaluating targeting and minimization procedures. The FISC found deficiencies in the government's proposed minimization procedures for upstream collection, noting that they focused mainly on information analysts wanted to use, rather than the larger set of acquired information. This led to the retention of unrelated and potentially domestic communications for up to five years, even if not intended for use by the government. The FISC found deficiencies in the government's proposed minimization procedures for upstream collection, leading to the retention of unrelated and potentially domestic communications for up to five years. The court determined that the procedures did not satisfy the Fourth Amendment and approved revised minimization procedures on November 30, 2011, addressing the court's concerns. The FISC approved modifications to the government's minimization procedures for upstream collection, reducing the retention period to two years and requiring special handling for certain communications. The court found that these changes balanced the Fourth Amendment requirements, allowing for constitutionally permissible searches. Non-profit organizations challenged the joint authorization procedure for surveillance of non-U.S. persons, arguing it violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches. In Clapper v. Amnesty International, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Title VII due to insufficient concrete injury. The Court required specific facts proving injury or certainly impending harm from the challenged action for injunctive relief. Non-profit organizations could not prove it was certainly impending that the U.S. would intercept their conversations, leading to the dismissal of their case. The Court did not decide the Fourth Amendment question in Clapper v. Amnesty International. The Solicitor General stated that evidence from Section 702 surveillance could be used in criminal cases, allowing defendants to challenge its lawfulness. The government must notify individuals and the court before using information obtained through electronic surveillance under FISA. This notification allows criminal defendants to challenge unlawfully acquired evidence. The Supreme Court suggested that defendants could potentially challenge Section 702 based on this notification provision. The Solicitor General reviewed the Justice Department's notification policy post-Clapper case. The Department of Justice altered its disclosure policy after discovering that incriminating evidence was gathered under FISA, leading to notifications to criminal defendants about using evidence obtained under Section 702. Some defendants challenged the constitutionality of Section 702, not just on Fourth Amendment grounds, but also on the suppression of evidence derived from its authorities. The constitutionality of Section 702 is being challenged not only on Fourth Amendment grounds but also on whether it violates Article III of the Constitution, which limits the exercise of judicial power to adjudicating live disputes. Critics argue that Section 702 raises concerns about whether federal courts can assess the legality of government surveillance procedures without considering their specific use in a surveillance action. The constitutionality of this abstract assessment may hinge on the interpretation of Supreme Court decisions allowing courts to perform various functions beyond adversarial proceedings. Previous case law has rejected challenges to traditional FISA electronic surveillance orders on Article III grounds. The constitutionality of Section 702 under the FAA was challenged in United States v. Mohamud, where a district court denied a suppression motion in a prosecution for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. The court concluded that Congress, in the FAA, may face judicial review regarding government surveillance procedures. The Oregon court found that Congress provided an \"intelligible principle\" in the FAA for evaluating government surveillance procedures under Section 702. The court held that the warrant requirement does not apply to incidental interception of U.S. persons' communications in electronic surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons overseas for foreign intelligence. The district court found that the government could conduct surveillance under the FAA without a warrant, citing the importance of safeguards like minimization and targeting procedures. The defendant in Mohamud appealed the judgment in 2014, and the case is now pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals."
