The Railroad Retirement Board administers these benefits for workers employed by railroads engaged in interstate commerce.

The Railroad Retirement Act provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. Tier II tax revenues in excess of obligatory benefits are transferred to the Trust for investment in private stocks, bonds, and other investments. The Trust manages assets in the Railroad Retirement Account similar to private-sector retirement plans. The RRB receives transfers from the Trust to pay railroad retirement and survivor benefits. Assets in the Social Security Equivalent Benefits Account are invested solely in U.S. government bonds for RRB Tier I benefits. The Railroad Retirement Trust, established in 2002, manages assets of $26.5 billion invested in U.S. government bonds. It operates independently from the RRB and the federal government, with trustees mandated to act in the interest of railroad retirement system participants. The Railroad Retirement Trust, established in 2002, has a board of seven trustees with expertise in financial investments and pension plans. Three trustees are selected by railroad labor unions, three by railroad management, and one by the other trustees. Each trustee serves a three-year term. Independent investment managers invest the Trust's assets according to guidelines set by the trustees, with each manager controlling no more than 10% of the assets. Managers must vote proxies in the sole interest of railroad retirement participants and beneficiaries.

The Trust was designed by Congress to increase RRB funding by investing in private markets for higher returns to fund enhanced benefits and potentially reduce future tax rates for railroad employers and employees. Tier II taxes are adjusted based on the average account benefits ratio, which is the ratio of Trust assets to total RRB benefits. The Railroad Retirement Trust, established in 2002, adjusts Tier II tax rates based on the average account benefits ratio (ABR). A higher ABR leads to lower tax rates for employers and employees, while a lower ABR results in higher tax rates.

The RRB has the authority to enforce provisions of the act, and the OIG has raised concerns over the past decade. The Railroad Retirement Trust's oversight has been a concern for the RRB Office of Inspector General (OIG) over the past decade. The OIG highlighted the lack of safeguards and the need for performance audits to assess program effectiveness, economy, efficiency, internal control, and compliance with the law.

The Railroad Retirement Trust's oversight has been a concern for the RRB Office of Inspector General (OIG) over the past decade. The OIG highlighted the lack of safeguards and the need for performance audits to assess program effectiveness, economy, efficiency, internal control, and compliance with the law. In a recent report in FY2018, the OIG asserted that lack of access to the Trust's auditor continued to be a concern, preventing OIG auditors from obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the RRB's financial statements.

The recommendation for communication between OIG and NRRIT's auditors was not concurred with by RRB management, but OIG will continue to cite this issue and the need for corrective action. Trust purchases and sales were initially treated as exchanges of assets of equal value, with unrealized capital gains and losses on investments not prescribed by law. The treatment of these gains and losses was agreed upon by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and OMB, with income and capital gains reducing outlays and the deficit, and losses increasing them to reflect changes in real economic resources available to the government.

Despite negative returns in FY2008 and FY2009, the Trust rebounded with positive returns in subsequent years.
