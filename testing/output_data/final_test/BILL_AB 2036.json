    "content": "Chapter 2.3 of the Business and Professions Code in California introduces regulations for online child care job posting services. These services must include a statement on their website regarding background check services for child care providers. Trustline is California's official background check for license-exempt child care providers, including babysitters and nannies. It has access to fingerprint records at the California Department of Justice and the FBI, as well as the California Child Abuse Central Index. The Trustline registry's toll-free number is 1-800-822-8490. Online child care job posting services in California must include a statement on their website about Trustline's background check services for child care providers. Parents have the right to access information about complaints against licensed child care providers through the California Department of Social Services' website at www.ccld.ca.gov. Online child care job posting services in California must provide access to background checks for listed child care providers. Background check service providers must give a detailed description of the background checks conducted, including what is included and the databases checked in each county. The curr_chunk provides information on the requirements for online child care job posting services or background check service providers in California. It includes details such as the data source, database name, date range, update frequency, checking methods, and potential civil penalties for non-compliance. The California law requires online job posting services or background check providers to be notified of noncompliance and given 30 days to correct violations. Failure to do so may result in a civil penalty, with funds deposited into the General Fund if enforced by the Attorney General, or to the city or county treasurer if enforced by a city attorney or county counsel. An individual damaged by a willful violation of the California law regarding online child care job posting services or background check providers may bring a civil cause of action for damages. The court may award equitable relief, and these rights and remedies are in addition to any other provided by law."
