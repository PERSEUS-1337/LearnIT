    "content": "The Currency Undervaluation Investigation Act may be cited as the act for investigating or reviewing currency undervaluation under the countervailing duty law. The Currency Undervaluation Investigation Act amends section 702 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to initiate an investigation into currency undervaluation as a countervailable subsidy in countervailing duty cases. The Currency Undervaluation Investigation Act amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to investigate currency undervaluation as a countervailable subsidy in countervailing duty cases. The Currency Undervaluation Investigation Act amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to investigate currency undervaluation as a countervailable subsidy in countervailing duty cases. Benefit calculation methodology with respect to currency undervaluation is addressed in Section 3. Section 771 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include provisions for investigating currency undervaluation as a countervailable subsidy in countervailing duty cases. The administering authority will determine if there is a benefit to the recipient of the subsidy by comparing the currency undervaluation. The administering authority will measure the benefit of currency undervaluation by comparing real exchange rates from different approaches to the official exchange rate. Data relied upon must be publicly available and maintained by reputable organizations. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of the 'macroeconomic-balance approach' in relation to currency undervaluation. This approach defines the level of undervaluation of the real effective exchange rate needed to achieve balance in the exporting country's balance of payments. The curr_chunk explains the 'equilibrium-real-exchange-rate approach' as a methodology to determine undervaluation of a currency based on the observed real effective exchange rate compared to the ideal rate. The term 'real exchange rates' refers to bilateral exchange rates derived from converting trade-weighted multilateral exchange rates using macroeconomic-balance and equilibrium-real-exchange-rate approaches into real bilateral terms. SEC. 4 amends the definition of specificity regarding export subsidies. SEC. 5 states that the amendments apply to goods from Canada and Mexico. SEC. 6 specifies the effective date of the changes. The amendments made by this Act apply to countervailing duty investigations and reviews initiated before or after the date of enactment."
