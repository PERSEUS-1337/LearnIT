It is used for various applications like data augmentation and domain adaptation. When paired training data is unavailable, image translation becomes a challenging problem. To address this, a simple yet effective image translation model with a self-regularization term and an adversarial term is proposed. Additionally, an attention module is suggested to guide the translation process and prevent unwanted changes or artifacts. The attention module predicts an attention map to guide image translation, focusing on key parts while preserving the rest. This approach improves performance compared to existing methods, as shown in experiments. The model can be applied to various computer vision tasks, such as unsupervised segmentation and saliency detection. Image translation involves mapping images from one domain to another, such as colorization or style transfer. It is also used for tasks like semantic segmentation and super-resolution. Image translation is crucial for domain adaptation and unsupervised learning, where synthetic data can be used as an alternative to labeled datasets. Learning from synthetic data can be challenging but is a cost-effective solution. Image translation is essential for domain adaptation and unsupervised learning, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To address the data distribution gap, mappings or domain-invariant representations at the feature level can be found. Alternatively, translating images from one domain to another can create \"fake\" labeled data for training, aiming to preserve labels and attributes. Two settings exist for image translation: supervised, with available image pairs, and unsupervised, where a mapping is learned to preserve key features. In unsupervised image translation, X and Y are independent image sets without paired examples. The goal is to find an algorithm that can translate between X and Y without input-output examples. This setting offers simplicity and flexibility compared to supervised image translation. Image translation setting has greater potential due to its simplicity and flexibility but is also challenging. It is an under-constrained problem with unlimited mappings between X and Y. Additional assumptions and constraints are required to learn the mapping, with existing works assuming relationships between the two domains. CycleGAN, for example, assumes cycle-consistency and an inverse mapping. CycleGAN translates images from Y to X and trains two generators that are bijections and inverses of each other. It uses adversarial and cycle-consistency constraints to ensure the translated image looks like it belongs to the target domain and can be mapped back to the original image. UNIT, on the other hand, assumes a shared-latent space and trains two generators with shared layers to achieve domain translation. Existing approaches in image translation, such as CycleGAN, may struggle with differentiating between subjects of interest and background, leading to unstable training and random results. This can be problematic in scenarios where specific features need to be preserved, like translating a horse image to a zebra image. The proposed image translation model addresses issues with existing methods like CycleGAN by using a single generator with an attention module. This simplifies the process and improves effectiveness by balancing the faithfulness of the translated image and its resemblance to the new domain without excessive manual tuning. The proposed image translation model simplifies the process by using a single generator with an attention module. It aims to preserve certain attributes and visual appearance of the input in the output, enforcing perceptual similarity and adversarial terms for better translation results. The proposed image translation model includes an adversarial term and an attention module to focus on key components of the image. It also suggests a method to find the optimal weight between self-regularization and adversarial terms automatically. The model does not rely on cycle-consistency or shared representation assumption, learning only one-way mapping. Our model, incorporating an attention module, excels in image translation tasks by detecting key objects and improving results. It outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures, showcasing its effectiveness in various applications. Additionally, our model enhances face 3D morphable model BID1 prediction accuracy by augmenting training data with synthetic images. The text discusses learning function parameters \u03b8 for image translation tasks using unpaired samples x and y. The goal is to generate translated images y \u2032 that resemble domain Y while preserving visual characteristics of x. The proposed approach involves minimizing a loss function that includes an adversarial component and utilizes a vanilla generator G 0 and an attention branch G attn. The model excels in image translation tasks by incorporating an attention module and improving results, showcasing its effectiveness in various applications. The model consists of a generator G and a discriminator D, with G having two branches: G 0 for image translation and G attn for attention masks. G 0 generates images in a new domain while G attn predicts attention masks. The final image G(x) is composed by combining x and G 0 (x) based on the attention mask. The generator G is based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and includes a down-sampling front-end, multiple residual blocks, and an up-sampling back-end. It uses convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation, increasing the receptive field of the residual blocks for easier learning at a smaller scale. The generator G utilizes dilated convolutions in all residual blocks to widen the view of input without adding parameters. G attn incorporates initial VGG-19 layers up to conv3_3 and two deconvolutional blocks, followed by a convolutional layer with sigmoid for probability map output. The discriminator employs a five-layer convolutional network with down-sampling and real/fake prediction output. The generator G uses dilated convolutions in residual blocks to widen the input view. It incorporates VGG-19 layers and deconvolutional blocks for output. The discriminator is a five-layer convolutional network for real/fake prediction. PatchGAN is used for classifying image patches as real/fake, shown to be more effective than global GAN. The adversarial loss updates the generator G to create translated images that fool the network D into classifying them as from domain Y. The generator G uses dilated convolutions in residual blocks to widen the input view and incorporates VGG-19 layers and deconvolutional blocks for output. To ensure meaningful mapping, G should preserve visual characteristics of the input image, imposing constraints with a self-regularization term that minimizes the distance between the translated image y' and the input x based on perceptual loss defined using a pre-trained VGG network. The neural features are extracted across multiple layers using the \u21132 difference and layer-wise weights. The best results were obtained by using the first three layers of VGG with specific weight values. Experimentation with different pre-trained networks did not show significant differences in results. In the experiment, the training scheme involved separately training the vanilla generator and attention branch to balance translation and mask learning. Adaptive weight induction was used to determine the trade-off between resemblance to the new domain and faithfulness to the original image. The experiment involved training the generator and attention branch separately to balance translation and mask learning. An adaptive weight induction scheme was proposed to find the best \u03bb value, avoiding manual tuning for each task. This approach ensures results similar to the input and the new domain, resembling CycleGAN. Our model, related to CycleGAN, defines an inverse mapping F: Y \u2192 X satisfying cycle-consistency constraints. Comparing with UNIT, adding a self-mapping constraint for domain Y does not improve results. Our approach generalizes well to tasks with different input and output domains, producing consistently good results even without the attention branch. The cycle-consistency assumption may not be necessary for image translation, and our approach could be further improved with advanced components like the latest GAN architectures. In experiments, the model was tested on various datasets and tasks, with images resized to 256x256 and trained from scratch using an Adam solver. To stabilize training, discriminators were updated using a history of 50 previously generated images. The model was trained from scratch with a learning rate of 0.0002 and linearly decayed starting from 5k iterations. Training took about 1 day on a single Titan X GPU. Visual results of image translation from horse to zebra were shown, comparing with other models like CycleGAN and UNIT. The attention branch improved results by reducing background perturbations and artifacts near the region of interest. The attention branch in the model improves visual quality by focusing on the region of interest, removing artifacts, and preserving the background. Results of horse-zebra translations show faithful compositions with fewer artifacts. The attention maps highlight key features like eyes in dog to cat translation, and background in photo to DSLR conversion. The attention branch in the model improves visual quality by focusing on the region of interest, removing artifacts, and preserving the background. In examples of photo to DSLR and summer to winter translation, attention maps guide the final result to maintain key details and remove color changes in the foreground. The method is general and can be applied to various tasks for satisfying results. Our method, which includes an attention branch, improves visual quality by focusing on the region of interest and preserving key details. A user study was conducted with 10 graduate students to compare results from different image translation tasks. Each user ranked the visual quality of 4 results: initial result (w/o attention), final result (with attention), CycleGAN results, and UNIT results. Using different layers of VGG-19 as feature extractors in image translation tasks can affect visual quality. High-level features lead to results similar to the input, while low-level features result in blurry images. Using the first three layers of VGG-19 as feature extractors in image translation tasks strikes a balance between clarity and noise, producing accurate results without introducing artifacts. The translation process involves converting satellite photos to maps using unpaired training data, with pixel accuracy measured for predicted maps. No attention mechanism is utilized, as global changes are observed to yield similar results during training and testing phases. At test time, photos are translated to maps and accuracy is computed based on RGB differences. Results show highest map prediction accuracy. Unsupervised classification results on USPS and MNIST-M datasets are presented, achieving highest accuracy on both tasks. The study achieves high accuracy on tasks involving MNIST-translated images and 3D face shape prediction using a 3D morphable model. The approach involves training a deep neural network for regression using rendered faces due to the cost of collecting labeled training data for real faces. The study uses rendered faces for domain adaptation in 3DMM regression, achieving higher quality results than CycleGAN. The model structure is a 102-layer Resnet BID16, trained with translated faces. The visual results show preserved shape and reduced regression error compared to baseline and CycleGAN. A simple model with attention for image translation and domain adaptation is proposed. The study proposes a simple model with attention for image translation and domain adaptation, showing superior performance in various tasks. The attention module helps focus on regions of interest, remove unwanted changes, and can be used for unsupervised segmentation or saliency detection."
