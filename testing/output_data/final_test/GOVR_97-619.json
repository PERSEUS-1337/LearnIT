    "content": "Internet gambling involves placing bets online with bookies or betting shops, as well as wagering on games played online. While some states specifically ban Internet gambling, most rely on existing gambling laws. Federal laws aim to prevent interstate or international gambling activities from intruding into states where they are illegal. It is a federal crime to use wire communications for betting on sporting events, operate a large-scale illegal gambling business, or facilitate illegal gambling across state or international borders. The Wire Act is often mentioned in discussions about federal laws prohibiting Internet gambling. Early prosecutions of Internet gambling typically involved violations of the Wire Act, with the most well-known case being Cohen's conviction for operating an illegal gambling business. The Act prohibits using wire communications to facilitate illegal gambling activities, including operating a gambling business, accepting payments for illegal online gambling, laundering proceeds, and conspiring with others to violate federal laws. The Wire Act prohibits the use of interstate telephone facilities for transmitting bets or gambling-related information. Violators face imprisonment, fines, and cancellation of telephone service. Violations can lead to prosecution under various statutes including money laundering laws and the Illegal Gambling Business Act. The Act applies to those engaged in betting or wagering who knowingly use wire communication facilities for transmission. The Wire Act prohibits the use of interstate telephone facilities for transmitting bets or gambling-related information. It applies to those engaged in betting or wagering who knowingly use wire communication facilities for transmission. The government must prove awareness of using a wire facility to transmit bets or gambling-related information for prosecution under the Act. The Wire Act prohibits the use of interstate telephone facilities for transmitting bets or gambling-related information. It applies to those knowingly using wire communication facilities for transmission, without requiring knowledge of the illegality. Interstate transmission encompasses both senders and receivers. Courts have consistently ruled that knowing interstate transmission is a violation. The Wire Act prohibits interstate transmission of bets or gambling information, with courts ruling that knowing interstate transmission is a violation. The Justice Department has clarified that the Act applies to sports gambling but not to non-sports gambling. The Wire Act prohibits interstate transmission of bets or gambling information, with courts ruling that knowing interstate transmission is a violation. The Act applies to sports gambling but not to non-sports gambling. The defense available under subsection 1084(b) for the transmission of gambling information is limited to assisting in the placing of bets, with the requirement that the betting be legal in both jurisdictions where the transmission occurs. No exemption applies to other prohibited wire communications in \u00a71084(a). The Second Circuit panel in Cohen endorsed the court's construction that an accomplice who aids and abets in a federal crime may be treated as if he committed the crime himself. The Department of Justice warned broadcasters of prosecution for aiding and abetting online gambling operations. Additionally, a conspirator who plans with another for a federal crime is also liable. The Wire Act's application to horse racing activities is disputed, with some arguing it was amended by an appropriations rider. The Justice Department disagrees. The Interstate Horseracing Act emerged due to state licensed off-track betting parlors accepting wagers on races within and outside the state, leading to objections from race tracks. Compensation agreements are provided for in the Horseracing Act. The Horseracing Act prohibits interstate off-track wagers without consent, allowing aggrieved parties to take legal action. It does not include criminal penalties or address its relation to other gambling laws. Track operators within 60 miles of an off-track betting office must consent, but they cannot sue for non-compliance. The Horseracing Act prohibits interstate off-track wagers without consent, allowing legal action for aggrieved parties. Suffolk invoked the Wire Act and RICO provisions to address off-track betting site activities involving interstate transmission of gambling information. The First Circuit affirmed the rejection of the claim based on the Wire Act exception. The defendant's acts, not indictable under section 1084, cannot constitute a pattern of racketeering activity within RICO's parameters. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge, stating that the online transmission of wagers falls outside the safe harbor provision of the Wire Act. The 2000 amendments to the Interstate Horseracing Act redefined \"interstate off-track wager\" to include legal wagers placed or accepted in one state on a horserace in another state, including pari-mutuel wagers transmitted electronically. The 2000 amendments to the Interstate Horseracing Act clarified certain aspects of pari-mutuel wagering pools, allowing tracks to accept online, out-of-state bets. The Justice Department and the World Trade Organization have differing views on this issue. The United States may allow domestic entities to offer Internet gambling on horse racing but denies offshore entities the same opportunity. The Justice Department is conducting a civil investigation related to potential violations of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act. Violations of Section 1955, which outlaws illegal gambling businesses, can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or fines. The federal government may also confiscate money or property used in violation of the law. The Illegal Gambling Business Act allows for prosecution under various statutes for involvement in illegal gambling activities. Sanctions apply to those who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own part of an illegal gambling business that violates state laws, involves five or more individuals, and operates for over thirty days or generates $2,000 in a day. Participation in illegal gambling, except as a bettor, is prohibited under 18 U.S.C. 1955. The Illegal Gambling Business Act prohibits participation in illegal gambling activities, except as a bettor. It applies to those involved in conducting, financing, managing, supervising, directing, or owning part of an illegal gambling operation that violates state laws, involves five or more individuals, and operates for over thirty days or generates $2,000 in a day. Prosecution under the Act requires the illegal gambling element to be present, and the business must meet specific criteria for continuity or revenue volume. The courts have been generous in assessing continuity for the Illegal Gambling Business Act, but there is debate on whether the jurisdictional five and continuity/volume features must coincide. There is consensus that section 1955 falls within Congress's Commerce Clause authority, unlike the Gun Free School Zone Act in United States v. Lopez. Challenges to section 1955 have been rejected due to its regulation of commercial activity and jurisdictional elements aimed at affecting interstate commerce. The courts have upheld the Illegal Gambling Business Act, requiring substantial impact on interstate commerce for prosecution. To aid in an illegal gambling business, one must have knowledge and take actions to assist in its success. Unlike conspiracy, aiding and abetting require deeper involvement. \"A federal conspiracy exists when two or more individuals agree to commit a federal crime and one of them commits an overt act in furtherance of their common scheme. The partners in the criminal plan must agree to pursue the same criminal objective and may divide up the work, yet each is responsible for the acts of each other.\" The Pinkerton doctrine holds co-conspirators liable for conspiracy and any foreseeable crimes committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. The application of the Illegal Gambling Business Act to offshore operations involving US bettors raises questions about jurisdiction and congressional intent. Section 1955 of the Illegal Gambling Business Act may apply overseas if the gambling activity is illegal under a state law with jurisdictional reach. For instance, a gambling business recording bets in Jamaica may not be prosecuted under Texas law. However, accepting wagers from New York bettors could violate section 1955. Congressional intent determines the extraterritorial application of federal criminal statutes, and section 1955 does not explicitly state overseas jurisdiction. Section 1955 of the Illegal Gambling Business Act does not explicitly state overseas jurisdiction. Congressional intent determines the extraterritorial application of federal criminal statutes. The courts use various interpretive aids to divine Congressional intent, presuming laws to apply within the United States unless clear indications suggest otherwise. Elements like committing an overt act in the US or engaging in crimes abroad with an impact in the US can lead to extraterritorial application of criminal statutes. The extraterritorial application of criminal statutes is determined by Congressional intent, with a presumption against conflicting with international law. International law allows for a nation's laws to be applied based on territorial, nationality, protective, passive personality, and universal principles. The extraterritorial application of criminal statutes is determined by Congressional intent, with a presumption against conflicting with international law. Section 1955 may apply to offshore illegal gambling businesses targeting customers in the United States. The Travel Act can be violated by operating an illegal gambling business online, leading to imprisonment and fines. This act can also be the basis for prosecution under money laundering statutes and RICO. The Travel Act covers individuals involved in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to distribute proceeds from unlawful activities, including gambling and money laundering. It does not have the service termination features of the Wire Act or the forfeiture features of the Illegal Gambling Business Act. The Travel Act prohibits individuals from distributing proceeds from unlawful activities, such as gambling or money laundering, through interstate travel or use of an interstate facility. The government must prove intent to promote unlawful activity followed by acts in furtherance of the activity. The Act does not apply to customers of illegal gambling businesses, but interstate solicitation of customers may be covered. The Travel Act prohibits distributing proceeds from unlawful activities through interstate travel or use of interstate facilities. Evidence of using facilities in interstate commerce, like a telephone or ATM, suffices for jurisdiction. Intrastate telephone communications also count as using facilities in interstate commerce. This applies to Internet gambling as well. The Travel Act prohibits distributing proceeds from unlawful activities through interstate travel or use of interstate facilities. A criminal business enterprise must involve a continuous course of business in an unlawful activity outlawed by a state or federal statute. Accomplice and co-conspirator liability apply to the Travel Act. The Travel Act applies to business enterprises involved in illegal gaming, potentially including Internet gambling ventures engaged in interstate or foreign commercial activity. The Wire Act, Illegal Gambling Business Act, Travel Act, and UIGEA implicitly or explicitly outlaw Internet gambling and related activities. Violations are punishable by law. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibits individuals or organizations from accepting payments for unlawful Internet gambling. Violators may face imprisonment for up to five years and/or fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Civil and regulatory enforcement actions may also be taken against offenders. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibits accepting payments for unlawful Internet gambling, with potential imprisonment and fines for violators. The Act defines \"persons\" broadly and does not explicitly define the \"business of betting or wagering.\" The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibits accepting payments for unlawful Internet gambling, with potential imprisonment and fines for violators. It defines the terms related to the business of betting or wagering, covering businesses regardless of meeting the threshold requirements of the Illegal Gambling Business Act. Businesses must involve \"bets or wagers\" and accept payment relating to unlawful Internet gambling. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibits accepting payments for unlawful Internet gambling, with potential imprisonment and fines for violators. It defines the terms related to betting or wagering, covering businesses regardless of meeting the threshold requirements of the Illegal Gambling Business Act. The definition of \"bet or wager\" includes staking something of value on the outcome of a contest, sporting event, or game subject to chance, with the possibility of receiving something of value in return. The language change in the definition extends coverage to games with an element of chance, even if not predominant, and explicitly includes lotteries and financial aspects of gambling. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibits accepting payments for illegal online gambling. It includes exemptions for certain activities like securities trading, insurance, and fantasy sports. \"Unlawful Internet gambling\" refers to illegal bets placed, received, or transmitted online. The Act also exempts certain intrastate and intratribal gambling activities, such as state lotteries and Indian casinos operating under state regulations. To qualify for the intrastate exception, bets must be made and received within the same state and comply with state laws. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act prohibits illegal online gambling activities, with exemptions for certain activities like securities trading and fantasy sports. Intrastate gambling must comply with state laws and involve bets made and received within the same state. Intratribal gambling may involve transmissions between different tribes and does not have to be within the same state. UIGEA's prohibitions can only be breached by those who act knowingly. The term 'knowingly' in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act does not require a culpable state of mind. Those who aid or abet a violation are liable, as well as conspirators for any completed crime or foreseeable offense. Financial institutions and service providers are excluded from the definition of \"business of betting or wagering\" but may still incur liability under the act. Section 5367 of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act states that entities may still be liable if directly involved in operating an online gambling site. Congressional intent regarding extraterritorial application of the law is a key factor, with UIGEA not containing a statement on this. The legislative history shows Congress was concerned about offshore illegal gambling businesses. Offenders may face civil constraints, as UIGEA allows for federal civil action to prevent violations. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act authorizes federal and state attorneys general to sue in federal court for injunctive relief to prevent violations of the act. It limits instances when attorneys general may proceed against Internet service providers and financial institutions, allowing civil action only against financial institutions involved in unlawful Internet gambling. It does not expressly authorize a private cause of action or offer relief other than federal court orders to prevent violations. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act allows attorneys general to sue to block access to illegal gambling sites. It also limits civil liability for financial institutions and Internet service providers, but does not provide immunity from criminal prosecution. The act outlines a regulatory enforcement scheme for financial institutions. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act requires the creation of a regulatory mechanism to block prohibited financial transactions. It provides exemptions for lawful Internet gambling transactions and offers good faith compliance protection. Regulatory enforcement is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission and federal functional regulators. The Third Circuit has determined that the act is not unconstitutionally vague. The Third Circuit has ruled that the UIGEA is not unconstitutionally vague. Illegal gambling can lead to federal racketeering charges under RICO laws, punishable by up to twenty years in prison and hefty fines. Offenders may also face property confiscation, triple damages to victims, and other sanctions. The RICO Act allows for federal racketeering charges for illegal gambling activities that affect interstate or foreign commerce. To prove a substantive RICO offense, the government must establish the existence of an enterprise, its impact on commerce, the defendant's association with the enterprise, and their involvement in its affairs. The RICO Act allows for federal racketeering charges for illegal gambling activities that affect interstate or foreign commerce. To establish a RICO offense, the government must prove the defendant's participation in the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. The defendant must also manifest an agreement to participate in the affairs of the enterprise. The \"person\" committing a RICO offense can be any individual or entity capable of holding a legal interest in property. The \"enterprise\" element is broadly defined to include various legal entities and associations. A RICO enterprise may be formal or informal, legal or illegal, and must have at least three structural features: a purpose, relationships among members, and longevity. It does not require a hierarchical structure or fixed roles for its members. Nothing in RICO exempts an enterprise with sporadic activity. The RICO offense requires an enterprise to have continuity and relationships among members. It must engage in activities that affect interstate commerce or foreign commerce. The \"pattern of racketeering activity\" element demands at least two related predicate offenses. The continuity of predicate offenses can be shown by regular occurrences of related misconduct over time. The RICO law requires continuity and relationships within an enterprise engaging in activities affecting commerce. It demands at least two related predicate offenses to show a pattern of racketeering activity, with continuity demonstrated by regular occurrences of related misconduct over time. RICO conspiracies do not require an overt act and are complete upon agreement to commit the offense. The RICO law requires continuity and relationships within an enterprise engaging in activities affecting commerce. It demands at least two related predicate offenses to show a pattern of racketeering activity, with continuity demonstrated by regular occurrences of related misconduct over time. RICO conspiracies do not require an overt act and are complete upon agreement to commit the offense. RICO accomplices may not be subject to RICO tort liability. UIGEA does not qualify as a RICO predicate offense, but those involved in illegal Internet gambling may face state or federal gambling felonies that are RICO predicate offenses. Congress has enacted statutes like 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 to combat money laundering in illegal Internet gambling businesses. The proceeds of state and federal crimes, including gambling offenses, are subject to money laundering laws with penalties of up to twenty years in prison or fines up to $500,000. The lower federal courts have upheld money laundering convictions related to gambling activities. Section 1956 of the law addresses money laundering offenses involving various criminal activities, including unlawful gambling businesses, tax evasion, concealing or disguising funds, structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements, international laundering, and promoting illegal enterprises. Violations can result in civil and criminal forfeiture, with penalties of up to $500,000 for individuals and organizations. The transaction offense under Section 1956 applies to individuals who knowingly conduct or attempt to conduct financial transactions involving proceeds of unlawful activity with the intent to promote further illegal activities. The definition of \"proceeds\" is broad and includes tangible or intangible property derived from criminal activities. The knowledge element allows for conviction without proving specific details of the underlying offense. The definition of \"proceeds\" in Section 1956 includes property obtained through unlawful activity. The \"financial transaction\" required for the crime can take various forms and must impact interstate commerce. The intent to promote further criminal activity can be shown by using the proceeds for ongoing criminal behavior or to enhance future criminal endeavors. The government must establish intent to promote criminal activity in money laundering cases, showing intentional promotion of unlawful activity. Proceeds must be derived from a predicate offense and intended to promote it. All RICO predicate offenses automatically qualify as money laundering predicate offenses. The RICO predicate offense list includes state gambling felonies, violations of the Travel Act, and the Illegal Gambling Business Act, all of which automatically qualify as money laundering predicate offenses. The transportation version of promotional money laundering involves transporting, transmitting, or transferring funds with the intent to promote unlawful activity, regardless of whether the funds are proceeds of a predicate offense. The defendant must have transmitted, transferred, or transported funds with the intent to promote a predicate offense. Section 1956 is subject to general federal law on accomplice and conspirator liability, allowing the same punishment for conspirators as for simple launderers. The \"concealment\" offenses have common elements with the promotion offenses of section 1956. The concealment offense in financial transactions involves purposeful concealment to disguise the nature, source, ownership, or control of proceeds from unlawful activity. Conviction requires more than just spending the proceeds and evidence of intent to conceal can take various forms. The line between innocent spending and criminal laundering can be blurred. The transportation concealment offense involves concealing the nature, source, ownership, or control of proceeds from unlawful activity through various means such as deceptive statements, unusual secrecy, or using third parties. Unlike the transaction offense, the government must prove knowledge of the tainted funds in transportation concealment cases. This offense covers transporting, transmitting, or transferring monetary instruments or funds within or outside the United States. The transportation concealment offense involves moving monetary instruments or funds to conceal the proceeds of unlawful activity, with the intent to disguise the nature, source, ownership, or control of the funds. This offense requires knowledge of the tainted funds and carries penalties for conspiracy. The tax evasion and structured transactions offenses are related to the concealment offenses. The final crime found in section 1956 is a \"sting\" offense, allowing prosecution of money launderers caught by undercover officers claiming to have proceeds from illegal activities. It includes promotional, concealment, and report evasion components. The prosecution requires intent to frustrate reporting requirements, without needing knowledge of criminality. Section 1957 of the law covers monetary transactions involving criminally derived property valued over $10,000. It applies to individuals in the US or with American citizenship, requiring knowledge of the illegal source of the money. Federal jurisdiction is established through interstate commerce or financial institution involvement. The defendant must know the money came from criminal activity, not necessarily that it was from a money laundering predicate offense. The $10,000 threshold must be met at the time of the transaction. The definition of \"proceeds\" includes property derived from unlawful activity. The monetary transaction can involve various financial institutions. The statute requires monetary transactions involving financial institutions, exempting transactions for legal representation. Constitutional concerns include Congress's legislative power, First Amendment free speech rights, and due process for overseas activities. Congress's authority to regulate commerce is Constitutionally enumerated. The Supreme Court has confirmed Congress's broad legislative powers under the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause, but also noted limits to Congress's authority. For example, in cases like Lopez and Morrison, the Court ruled that Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause power. Lopez specifically held that Congress could not regulate possession of firearms near schools under the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce, including keeping channels free from immoral uses. Congress can also regulate activities that impact interstate commerce, such as thefts from interstate shipments. This broad power has limits, as seen in cases like Lopez and Morrison where Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause. The Gun-Free School Zones Act lacked an economic component and did not have explicit restraints or guidelines to confine its application to instances within the Commerce power. It did not contain any \"commerce\" element in its criminal proscription. The Gun-Free School Zones Act criminal proscription lacked a \"commerce\" element and overreached by attempting to regulate school activities, encroaching on states' sovereignty. Morrison and Lopez cases highlighted that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to create federal remedies for certain issues, emphasizing federalism principles. The Commerce Clause does not allow Congress to force states to implement federal regulations, but federal courts have ruled that gambling can be regulated under it. Gambling raises First Amendment concerns due to its communicative nature and reliance on advertising. While historically considered a vice outside of First Amendment protection, illegal gambling likely remains so. However, the power to outlaw a vice does not extend to outlawing related speech when the vice is unregulated, as clarified by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld an advertising ban on illegal gambling but struck down a ban on lawful gambling. Early commentators raised concerns about applying federal criminal law to offshore Internet gambling. The Due Process Clause protects individuals from being subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign without fair warning. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in establishing personal jurisdiction, stating that defendants must reasonably anticipate being sued in a particular state based on their conduct and connections there. This principle is crucial for due process analysis, rather than simply foreseeing the possibility of causing harm in another state. The lower federal appellate courts have concluded that suing nonresident parties doing business on the Internet where they have a real and continuous presence or where they caused an injury does not violate due process requirements. The critical test is often the level of commercial activity associated with the website, and there must be a nexus between the United States and the circumstances of the offense in criminal law cases. Some courts look to international law principles or the minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction to determine this nexus requirement. The due process requirement for criminal liability in American courts is debated, with some courts rejecting the notion that conduct must have a connection to the United States. The use of wire communication for transmitting bets or wagering information across state lines carries penalties of fines or imprisonment. The use of wire communication for transmitting bets or wagering information across state lines carries penalties of fines or imprisonment, with exceptions for news reporting and legal betting activities. The law prohibits the transmission of gambling information across state lines by wire communication. Common carriers must discontinue or refuse service to subscribers involved in illegal gambling activities upon receiving notice from law enforcement agencies. No penalties shall be imposed on carriers for complying with such notices. Individuals affected by this law have the right to seek legal recourse in federal or state courts. The term \"State\" refers to various jurisdictions within the United States. The law prohibits illegal gambling businesses, defining them as operations violating state laws, involving five or more individuals, and running for over thirty days or generating $2,000 in revenue in a day. It includes activities like bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, and conducting lotteries. The law prohibits illegal gambling businesses involving five or more individuals operating for over two days and generating over $2,000 in revenue in a day. Any property used in violation of this law may be seized and forfeited to the United States. The law allows for the seizure and forfeiture of property used in violation of the customs laws, with procedures similar to those for illegal gambling businesses. Interstate and foreign travel or transportation in aid of racketeering enterprises involves using interstate or foreign commerce to distribute proceeds of unlawful activities, commit crimes of violence, or promote illegal activities. This section does not apply to exempt organizations conducting bingo, lottery, or similar games of chance. The curr_chunk discusses the penalties for individuals involved in unlawful activities such as gambling, narcotics, extortion, bribery, and arson. Those who perform or attempt to perform such acts may face fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or life imprisonment if death results.

The court may also issue a permanent injunction upon conviction. The court may issue a permanent injunction prohibiting a person convicted under this section from engaging in unlawful internet gambling activities. Financial transaction providers may also be liable if they have knowledge and control of such activities on their platforms. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to prevent and restrain unlawful internet gambling activities, regardless of whether a prosecution has been initiated. The United States, through the Attorney General, may institute proceedings to prevent or restrain restricted transactions, and the court may issue temporary restraining orders or injunctions against individuals involved in such activities.

Relief granted against interactive computer services is limited to removing or disabling access to unlawful content. Interactive computer services are limited to removing or disabling access to online sites violating specific sections, with notice and opportunity to appear provided. There is no obligation to monitor for violations, and the service must be specified and the location identified. Coordination with other laws is required. An interactive computer service is not liable under certain conditions, including if they have actual knowledge and control of unlawful bets on their website. There are limitations on injunctions against regulated persons. Policies and procedures to prevent restricted transactions must be established by designated payment systems and participants within 270 days of the enactment of the subchapter. The Attorney General is not authorized to prevent financial transaction providers from engaging in restricted transactions. The establishment of policies and procedures by payment systems and participants to prevent restricted transactions is required within 270 days of the subchapter's enactment. This includes identifying and blocking restricted transactions through codes in authorization messages or other means, as well as preventing the acceptance of products or services in connection with restricted transactions. The Secretary and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must establish regulations to identify and block restricted transactions, allowing participants in payment systems to choose how to prevent such transactions. Certain transactions or payment systems may be exempted if it is not feasible to block them. The regulations require financial transaction providers to comply with payment system policies to identify and block restricted transactions or prevent acceptance of products/services in connection with such transactions. Compliance is achieved by following designated payment system procedures. The regulations require financial transaction providers to comply with payment system policies to block restricted transactions. Compliance is enforced by Federal functional regulators.

The term excludes transactions that are intrastate and legal within specific jurisdictions. Gambling excludes bets made exclusively within a single state, authorized by state laws with age verification and data security measures, and compliant with certain federal laws. The term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" excludes bets made within Indian lands of a single tribe or between multiple tribes as authorized by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The applicable tribal ordinance or resolution approved by the Chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission, and with respect to class III gaming, the Tribal-State Compact, must include age and location verification requirements to block access to minors and unauthorized persons. The bet or wager must also comply with specific federal laws to ensure legality. The term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" excludes activities allowed under the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978. Congress clarifies that this subchapter does not change the relationship between the Interstate Horseracing Act and other Federal statutes. The subchapter does not intend to change the relationship between the Interstate Horseracing Act and other Federal statutes or resolve any existing disagreements. The intermediate routing of electronic data does not determine the location of a bet. Terms like \"credit\" and \"electronic fund transfer\" are defined according to specific laws. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"financial institution,\" \"insured depository institution,\" and \"money transmitting business and money transmitting service\" under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. It excludes certain businesses like casinos and sports books from the definition of financial institution. The curr_chunk discusses the prohibition of using income derived from racketeering activities or unlawful debts to invest in enterprises affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The curr_chunk outlines that it is unlawful to acquire or maintain control of an enterprise through racketeering activities or unlawful debts if it affects interstate or foreign commerce. It is illegal for any enterprise involved in interstate or foreign commerce to engage in racketeering activities or unlawful debts.
