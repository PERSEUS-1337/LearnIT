    "content": "The Act titled \"Police Creating Accountability by Making Effective Recording Available Act of 2017\" or \"Police CAMERA Act of 2017\" establishes a matching grant program for law enforcement body-worn cameras and recorded data under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 allows the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to provide grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes for purchasing body-worn cameras for law enforcement officers. The grants aim to enhance accountability, transparency, and evidence collection in law enforcement activities. Grants awarded are for a duration of 2 years. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 authorizes the Director to disburse 50% of the grant upon award and the remaining 50% upon completion of requirements. Funds are to be used for purchasing body-worn cameras and related program implementation costs for law enforcement officers. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 authorizes grants for body-worn camera programs, training, data storage, and compliance with program requirements. Recipients must establish policies, adopt data protocols, and meet specified requirements before officers use body-worn cameras. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 requires entities receiving grants to develop and publish policies for the safe use, storage, and handling of body-worn cameras, as well as comply with data retention protocols before law enforcement officers can use the cameras. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 mandates entities to establish policies for body-worn camera use, including protecting privacy rights, data release in accordance with open records laws, and providing data to prosecutors and defense attorneys. Periodic evaluations of data security are also required. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 requires law enforcement officers wearing body-mounted cameras to follow a protocol for data collection and retention, including providing explanations for unrecorded activities, obtaining consent from crime victims or witnesses before recording, and collecting data related to legitimate law enforcement purposes. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 mandates that data collected by body-worn cameras must be logged for viewing, modification, or deletion, with strict controls to prevent unauthorized access. Law enforcement officers are prohibited from accessing data without authorization, and agencies must report statistical data on incidents of use of force. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 requires the collection and reporting of data on incidents of use of force, complaints against officers, complaint outcomes, use of camera footage in investigations, and additional statistical data as determined by the Director. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 mandates the collection and reporting of statistical data on incidents involving body-worn cameras. This includes filing complaints with law enforcement agencies and complying with Director-established requirements. The collected data must be reported to the Director, who will establish a standardized reporting system and a national database for the recorded data. Recorded data can only be used or transferred by entities receiving grants under this program. The use of body-mounted cameras by entities receiving grants under the Police CAMERA Act of 2017 is restricted to internal and external investigations of misconduct, evidence of crimes, or limited training purposes. The Director will establish rules to ensure data is used for these specific purposes only. Transferring recorded data to other law enforcement or intelligence agencies is prohibited, except for specific exceptions outlined in the Act. Exceptions to the restrictions on transferring recorded data from body-mounted cameras include allowing it for criminal investigations and civil rights claims by law enforcement agencies receiving grants under the Police CAMERA Act of 2017. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 allows the transfer of recorded data from body-mounted cameras to other law enforcement agencies for investigations related to constitutional rights or laws. The Federal share of program costs under this act cannot exceed 75%, with exceptions for Indian tribal government agencies using appropriated funds for matching requirements. The Police CAMERA Act of 2017 allows for the transfer of recorded data from body cameras to other law enforcement agencies for investigations. The Director has the authority to waive the matching requirement in cases of fiscal hardship. $30,000,000 from the Bureau of Justice Assistance budget is allocated for this program in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. An audit and assessment of the grant program and grantees' policies will be conducted by the Director of the Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management within 2 years of enactment. Recipients of grants must submit reports annually starting 2 years after enactment. Recipients of grants must submit progress reports on body-worn camera programs and provide recommendations for further support. The Director of the Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management will review grantee policies to ensure program compliance. The Director will establish a toolkit for training law enforcement agencies on body-worn cameras, including best practices and research materials. The toolkit may consolidate resources from expert agencies nationwide. To apply for a grant under this program, the chief executive of a State, local government, or Indian tribe must submit an application to the Director with required information. The Director will issue regulations within 90 days to guide the application process. Additionally, a study will be conducted under Section 3034. The Director will conduct a study on the efficacy of body-worn cameras in deterring excessive force by law enforcement officers, impact on accountability and transparency, responses to complaints, safety of officers, public safety, evidence collection, and data storage issues. The Director will conduct a study on the efficacy of body-worn cameras, including issues related to privacy, public access to footage, training of officers, best practices for camera use, and factors affecting camera effectiveness. A report must be submitted within 180 days of completing the study. After completing the study, the Director will submit a report to Congress with policy recommendations."
