The Supreme Court confirmed in 2007 that greenhouse gases are considered air pollutants under the Act. The EPA has been addressing greenhouse gas emissions since 2009 under the Clean Air Act, which grants regulatory authority. In December 2009, the agency found that emissions of greenhouse gases may endanger public health and welfare. In May 2010, GHG emission standards were established for model year 2012-2016 vehicles. In January 2011, permits and Best Available Control Technology were required for new stationary sources. The EPA has implemented GHG emission standards for vehicles and stationary sources since 2009. Regulations focus on improving fuel economy in the auto and truck manufacturing industries to reduce GHG emissions. However, the impact on emissions has been minimal so far, as many rules are prospective and have not yet taken effect. The EPA has implemented GHG emission standards for vehicles and stationary sources since 2009, focusing on improving fuel economy to reduce emissions. As of September 2013, only 110 GHG permits have been issued to stationary sources out of over 6 million. EPA set high emission thresholds exempting most new sources, with few new facilities built post-recession. To reduce GHG emissions, EPA must issue standards for existing stationary sources, starting with proposed standards for new electric generating units in 2012. President directed EPA to re-propose these standards by September 20, 2013. The EPA plans to re-propose standards for new electric generating units by September 20, 2013, and finalize them promptly after considering public comments. Coal-fired power plants are a significant source of greenhouse gases in the US, accounting for about one-third of total emissions. Once regulations for existing EGUs are in place, EPA will have addressed over half of all US emissions. EPA intends to use Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to control GHG emissions from stationary sources by setting New Source Performance Standards. The EPA plans to set standards for new electric generating units under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to control greenhouse gas emissions. The agency has already proposed NSPS/GHG standards for electric generating units and is committed to promulgating standards for petroleum refineries. EPA Administrators have historically used this authority to set emission standards for various sources of conventional pollutants. The EPA plans to set standards for new electric generating units under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to control greenhouse gas emissions. The agency has already proposed NSPS/GHG standards for electric generating units and is committed to promulgating standards for petroleum refineries. EPA Administrators historically set emission standards for various sources of conventional pollutants, considering costs, health, environmental impacts, and energy requirements. Standards must be reviewed every eight years, and guidelines for existing sources are developed based on new source standards. States must develop performance standards for existing sources, considering factors like remaining useful life. The EPA is planning to set standards for new electric generating units under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to control greenhouse gas emissions. Existing power plants are a significant source of GHG emissions in the U.S., especially in sectors like the electric utility industry where old units can operate for decades. The average coal-fired power plant in the U.S. is over 40 years old. The timeline for applying Section 111(d) standards to existing sources is uncertain, as EPA needs to propose guidelines first, followed by states developing implementation plans. The President's memorandum requested EPA to issue guidelines for power plants by specific dates and include a requirement for states to submit implementation plans by a certain deadline. It may take several years before existing power plants are subject to emission limits for greenhouse gases. The President also directed EPA to re-propose standards for power plant carbon pollution. This report discusses both the 2012 proposal and the September 2013 re-proposal. The re-proposed standard for power plants sets a limit of 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) per megawatt-hour (MWh) for coal-fired plants and 1,000 or 1,100 lbs/MWh for new natural gas-fired plants. Coal-fired plants would need emission controls to meet the standard, while new natural gas plants can comply without additional controls. EPA estimates that coal-fired plants without controls produce around 1,800 lbs. CO2/MWh. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is being researched to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. It faces challenges such as high energy consumption and additional costs for storage and transportation of captured CO2. Critics argue that CCS technology is not yet fully developed and costs may decrease with further research. The agency's 2012 proposal included an alternative for coal-fired facilities to average emissions over a 30-year period, with initial emissions allowed up to 1,800 lbs. CO2/MWh for 10 years, followed by a reduction to 600 lbs/MWh for the next 20 years. The September 2013 re-proposal does not include this option but offers two compliance periods: a 12-month rolling average or an 84-month rolling average. The longer compliance period allows flexibility to exceed standards over time but requires meeting a lower overall standard. EPA has proposed a range for the standard. The EPA has proposed an 84-month standard for emissions, with a range of 1,000 to 1,050 lbs/MWwh. The NSPS applies to sources that commenced construction after the proposal date in the Federal Register. Only three facilities may be affected by the retroactive application of the standard: the Wolverine project in MI, a project in GA, and a project in KS. The developers of the latter two claim construction has begun, exempting them from the NSPS. The status of the Wolverine project is uncertain. The EPA is proposing to exempt the Wolverine project from the NSPS due to uncertainty about its status in the development process and the standard of performance. The agency believes that market conditions will lead electricity generators to choose technologies that meet the proposed standards, citing factors such as the abundance and low cost of natural gas. The EPA predicts that new electricity generation will mainly come from natural gas or renewable sources due to factors like low natural gas cost and state requirements for renewable energy. The agency used the Integrated Planning Model to analyze the impacts of regulations, concluding that the 2012 results still apply. The EPA's analysis using the Integrated Planning Model concluded that new coal-fired capacity would not be constructed under various scenarios, as natural gas prices would need to exceed $10/mmBtu for coal to be competitive with natural gas. This price level is higher than any annual natural gas price to the electric power sector. The EPA's analysis shows that new coal-fired capacity is unlikely to be built due to high natural gas prices. The projected average annual natural gas price is $6.64/MMBtu in the Low Oil and Gas Resource scenario. The EPA anticipates negligible CO2 emission changes, energy impacts, benefits, or costs from the proposed EGU New Source GHG Standards by 2020. No notable impacts on electricity prices or energy supplies are expected, and reliability concerns are not raised. The proposed rule aims to limit CO2 emissions from new coal-fired plants as a backstop measure. It prevents the construction of high-emitting sources and signals support for CCS technology development. The proposed rule aims to support the development of CCS technology for coal-fired plants by removing regulatory uncertainty and defining emission limits for GHG. This will promote further development of CCS technology for long-term CO2 emission reductions. The re-proposed rule aims to address regulatory barriers hindering the development of CCS technology for coal-fired plants, specifically citing a case where AEP deferred a CCS project due to regulatory constraints on cost recovery without emission reduction requirements. The uncertainty surrounding regulatory requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions hinders the industry's ability to attract partners for funding. The promulgation of New Source Performance Standards is necessary for setting standards for existing units under the Clean Air Act. Many in the electric power and coal industries see the proposed standards as potentially prohibiting the development of CCS technology. The proposed standards for new coal-fired power plants may effectively prohibit construction, with questions raised about the feasibility and cost of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The EPA maintains that CCS technology has been demonstrated, but concerns remain about the statutory language and the potential impact on energy requirements. CCS is feasible for new coal-fired power plants, with core components already implemented at commercial scale. CO2 capture from industrial gas streams dates back to the 1930s. 50 million metric tons of CO2 are transported annually through pipelines in the U.S. 95% of the 500 largest CO2 sources in the U.S. are within 50 miles of potential sequestration sites, reducing transportation costs. Four commercial CCS facilities are currently sequestering CO2 into deep geologic formations. The EPA re-proposal mentions the challenge of capturing and storing CO2 on the scale of large coal-fired power plants. Five plants are identified as incorporating CCS on a commercial scale, including projects in Mississippi, Saskatchewan, Texas, California, and NRG. The EPA mentioned the challenge of capturing and storing CO2 from large coal-fired power plants. Five projects in Mississippi, Saskatchewan, Texas, and California are incorporating CCS technology, with some still in planning stages or under construction. The cost of using commercially available CCS technologies could increase electricity costs significantly, according to EPA and Congressional Budget Office reports. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and EPA reports highlight the challenges and costs associated with capturing and storing CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants. The proposed rule would require capturing only 40% of emissions, adding 20% to electricity costs from supercritical pulverized coal plants. The increased cost is mainly due to the energy load needed for capturing and compressing CO2, which can consume up to 30% of the plant's electricity. CCS-equipped plants cost more to build and operate due to the large, complex, and expensive equipment required for CO2 capture and compression. To produce the same amount of electricity, a plant with CCS capabilities must be larger and more costly due to the energy load needed for capturing and compressing CO2. The cost and energy penalty can potentially be reduced through research and development, but the road to competitive technology may be long. Legal challenges to EPA's judgment on costly technology remain uncertain, especially with other power sources available with lower or no carbon emissions. Legal challenges to EPA's judgment on costly technology for emission reduction must be filed in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court has clarified that the technology must be reasonably reliable, efficient, and not excessively expensive. The standard for achievability is within the demonstrated system's efficiency, not necessarily routinely achieved in the industry before adoption. In legal challenges to EPA's judgment on costly emission reduction technology, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals clarified that the technology must be reasonably reliable, efficient, and not excessively expensive. The standard for achievability is within the demonstrated system's efficiency, not necessarily routinely achieved in the industry before adoption. The court emphasized that projections based on existing technology are acceptable, as long as they are reasonable and not based on speculative inquiry. The EPA does not anticipate any impacts on electricity prices, employment, or the economy from the rule on costly emission reduction technology. New coal-fired units with CCS technology are not expected in the next 10 years due to the low cost of natural gas. The agency's finding is robust across various scenarios influencing power sector investments. The September 2013 re-proposal for power sector investment decisions would set separate standards for coal-fired and gas-fired EGUs, similar to previous standards for conventional pollutants. Critics argue that combining coal-fired and gas-fired units in a single category is not appropriate due to differences in control options and emissions levels. In 2012, EPA proposed a standard for emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) that imposed a single emission standard on all fossil-fueled EGUs. However, in 2013, EPA reversed course and proposed separate standards for coal-fired and gas-fired units, leading to criticism. Critics argued that setting the standard at 1,000 lbs. CO2/MWh would require coal-fired power plants to add CCS to new units. The critics argue that the proposed standard for coal-fired units violates the Clean Air Act by requiring a specific technological system for emission reduction. The interpretation of whether carbon capture technologies constitute a \"particular technological system\" is crucial in determining compliance with the standard. The NSPS rule requires compliance with emission standards without specific technological systems. Guidelines for existing sources will be developed by states, potentially less stringent but impactful due to older, less efficient plants contributing to one-third of U.S. GHG emissions. The agency may set guidelines for older, less efficient plants based on improving efficiency rather than costly CCS application. The NRDC proposes state emission budgets based on fuel mix, with coal-heavy states receiving higher budgets. Target reduction is around 26%. The state budgets would be reduced in phases, aiming for a 26% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. EGUs could comply through various methods such as shifting power dispatch, switching fuels, co-firing, retiring inefficient plants, efficiency improvements, or demand reduction. Units could average, bank, or trade emission credits to meet targets, potentially combining markets for allowances across states. The EPA guidelines for GHG emissions under Section 111(d) allow states to combine markets for allowances, providing flexibility to electric generating units and companies. The President directed the agency to propose the guidelines by June 1, 2014, finalize them by June 1, 2015, and require states to submit implementation plans by June 30, 2016. Congress has shown opposition to EPA standards for GHG emissions, with the House passing bills in 2011 and 2012 to prohibit such standards, while the Senate did not follow suit. Legislation to limit EPA regulatory action is possible in the 113th Congress, boosted by the Carbon Pollution Standard re-proposal. Enacting such legislation faces hurdles similar to the last Congress. The debate over the carbon pollution standard for new power plants is largely symbolic and characterized by exaggeration on both sides. The rule itself will have little impact, with the real significance lying in the broader climate issues. The rule for new sources is significant as it allows EPA to regulate existing sources under the Clean Air Act. However, the actual impact on reducing GHG emissions from existing plants may be limited. Both EPA and industries overstate the rule's impact, as it may not affect the construction of new coal-fired power plants. The rule is unlikely to have a major effect on the coal and electric power industries in the short term, as they are already adapting to economic challenges. The coal industry is struggling to compete with natural gas due to economic conditions. Gas is expected to remain cheap and abundant, leading to a decline in new coal-fired plants. The electric power industry is shifting towards building gas-fired plants or using renewable sources for new capacity. Despite blaming the EPA, the market factors, such as new gas production technologies and state requirements for renewable energy, are driving coal's decline. The coal industry is facing challenges from natural gas due to economic conditions and environmental regulations. Natural gas has been more cost-effective for new power generation since 1996, making coal less competitive. The EPA's analysis shows that coal would need to triple in price to compete with natural gas. This rule will further discourage the construction of new coal-fired power plants. The EPA's rule on new coal-fired power plants may not have a significant impact on the industry, according to EPA Administrator McCarthy. The rule aims to promote investment in technologies like Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) for future power plants. However, if no new coal-fired plants are built under these standards, it may not effectively stimulate the development of CCS technology. The EPA's rule on new coal-fired power plants may not have a significant impact on the industry. Existing coal-fired plants still generate about 40% of the nation's electricity and could play a role in the future. Coal is likely to remain in the mix as an insurance policy against uncertain future conditions in the energy market. The future of coal and coal-fired electricity could be greatly affected by the next carbon pollution standard for existing units, set to be proposed in June 2014. EPA's rule on new coal-fired power plants may not have a significant impact on the industry, as existing plants still play a crucial role in generating electricity. Coal is seen as an insurance policy against uncertain future conditions in the energy market."
