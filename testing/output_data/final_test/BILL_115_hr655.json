    "content": "The \"Securing the Cities Act of 2017\" is a new program added to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance security measures in urban areas. The Director for Domestic Nuclear Detection establishes the 'Securing the Cities' program to enhance the ability to detect and prevent terrorist attacks using nuclear or radiological materials in high-risk urban areas. The program assists governments in designing detection architectures, supports region-wide capabilities, and provides resources for enhanced detection and analysis. The 'Securing the Cities' program aims to enhance detection capabilities by providing resources for coordination, communication, and integration of State, local, tribal, and territorial assets into Federal operations. It also facilitates alarm adjudication, expertise on operations, training, exercises, and promotes sharing of information about nuclear or radiological materials among relevant governments. Additionally, the program offers augmenting resources to sustain and refresh capabilities developed under the program. The Director of the 'Securing the Cities' program will designate high-risk urban areas and other cities for assistance, notify Congress of any changes, and a GAO report is required within a year of the Act's enactment. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess the effectiveness of the Securing the Cities program under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and submit the evaluation to relevant congressional committees. Additionally, a clerical amendment will be made to the table of contents in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Director for Domestic Nuclear Detection of the Department of Homeland Security will assess the feasibility of developing model exercises to test the preparedness of jurisdictions in the Securing the Cities program for nuclear and radiological threats. No additional funds are authorized for this purpose. No additional funds are authorized for the requirements of this Act and its amendments, using existing authorized amounts."
