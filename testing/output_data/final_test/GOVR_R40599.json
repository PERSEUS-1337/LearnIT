    "content": "Identity theft is a major concern for policymakers in the United States due to its economic and security risks. In 2012, identity fraud cost Americans nearly $21 billion, with about 12.6 million victims reported. The average victim incurred a cost of $365, which was a 42% decrease from previous years. Identity theft poses challenges for federal law enforcement due to the globalized environment and lack of cyber borders. Criminals operate within and beyond U.S. borders with multiple identities, engaging in various criminal activities like credit card fraud. The impact extends beyond financial burdens to national security, requiring policymakers to address the issue. Identity theft poses challenges for federal law enforcement due to the globalized environment and lack of cyber borders. Criminals operate within and beyond U.S. borders with multiple identities, engaging in various criminal activities like credit card fraud. The impact extends beyond financial burdens to national security, requiring policymakers to address the issue. Policymakers may debate the federal government's role in preventing identity theft, mitigating its effects, and providing tools to investigate and prosecute identity thieves. The report analyzes trends in identity theft, federal agencies involved, complaints, prosecutions, data breaches, and the FTC's Identity Theft Red Flags Rule. It also examines possible issues for Congress to consider regarding when identity theft becomes a federal crime. Current federal law defines identity theft as a federal crime when someone knowingly transfers, possesses, or uses another person's identification without lawful authority with the intent to commit unlawful activity. Enhanced penalties apply for aggravated identity theft, with a two-year prison sentence for specified crimes and a five-year sentence for terrorism violations. Identity theft is also defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as fraud using identifying information. Identity theft is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations as fraud committed using another person's identifying information without permission. It can lead to crimes like bank fraud, document fraud, and immigration fraud, and can be aided by theft crimes like robbery or burglary. The interconnectivity between identity theft and other crimes poses challenges in analyzing trends and policy considerations for Congress. Identity theft and identity fraud are often used interchangeably, with identity fraud being the umbrella term for crimes involving false identification, while identity theft specifically involves using another person's identification. Identity theft involves using someone else's personally identifiable information without permission, leading to direct victimization and defrauding third parties. The focus is on identity theft rather than the broader term of identity fraud. The U.S. Supreme Court has addressed definitional issues related to identity theft and aggravated identity theft as crimes involving knowingly transferring, possessing, or using another person's information. The U.S. Supreme Court clarified that for aggravated identity theft, a defendant must knowingly use another person's identification. This ruling may also impact the broader identity theft statute, prompting Congress to consider clarifying the difference. Congress may need to clarify the difference between knowledge requirements for identity theft and aggravated identity theft in the U.S. Code. Prior to 1998, identity theft was not a federal crime, but with the rise of identity fraud and the use of the Internet for fraudulent activities, policymakers and law enforcement called for stronger laws to combat the growing issue. In 1998, Congress passed the Identity Theft Assumption Deterrence Act (P.L. 105-318) criminalizing identity theft at the federal level. The act provided penalties for offenders and directed the FTC to record complaints, provide victims with information, and refer complaints to relevant agencies. The FTC now maintains the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse for consumer complaint data from 2000 onwards. The Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act (P.L. 108-275) established penalties for aggravated identity theft, with additional penalties for identity theft related to federal crimes. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 (Title II of P.L. 110-326) further enhanced identity theft laws. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 authorized restitution to identity theft victims for time spent recovering from harm. The President's Identity Theft Task Force was established to coordinate federal agencies in combating identity theft. The task force made recommendations in preventing identity theft by keeping consumer data secure. The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended preventing identity theft by securing consumer data, decreasing the use of Social Security numbers, educating employers and individuals on data protection, and establishing national data protection standards. They also suggested training first responders to assist identity theft victims. The Identity Theft Task Force recommended measures to assist victims, including obtaining alternative identification documents and criminal restitution. They also suggested enhancing information sharing, training for law enforcement, and increasing enforcement to deter identity theft. Additionally, international cooperation was promoted to combat identity theft globally. The Identity Theft Task Force recommended measures to decrease identity theft by identifying safe havens for thieves, encouraging anti-theft legislation globally, and enhancing international cooperation in investigations. They proposed amending federal criminal statutes to prosecute identity theft more effectively, including prosecuting thieves who target corporations and organizations, adding new crimes as predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft violations, and eliminating provisions requiring interstate communications for theft of electronic data. Congress has taken steps to address recommendations from the Identity Theft Task Force, including amending statutes to prosecute identity theft more effectively. This includes eliminating the requirement for damage to a victim's computer to exceed $5,000 and expanding the definition of cyber-extortion. However, there is still a recommendation to expand identity theft and aggravated identity theft laws that has not been addressed yet. The Identity Theft Task Force recommendations to expand identity theft and aggravated identity theft statutes to include corporations and organizations, as well as individuals, have not been addressed by Congress. The Identity Theft Red Flags Rule, implemented under the FACT Act of 2003, requires creditors and financial institutions to have identity theft prevention programs in place. The FTC requires institutions to develop identity theft prevention programs that identify red flags, detect suspicious activities, respond to red flags, and update the program regularly. Red flags could include alerts from consumer reporting agencies, suspicious documents, unusual account activity, and reports from customers or law enforcement. The Red Flags Rule requires creditors and financial institutions to comply with identity theft prevention programs by specific deadlines, which were extended multiple times. The final enforcement date was set at December 31, 2010, amid debates over the broad inclusion of entities under the FACT Act Red Flags provision. The Red Flags Rule may help prevent identity theft by identifying security lapses or suspicious activities. This could lead to a decrease in reported incidents and investigations. Creditors and financial institutions must respond to identified red flags, which may include notifying consumers or law enforcement of potential data breaches. Early notification is not mandatory but can be part of prevention programs. Early notification is not mandatory in identity theft prevention programs, but it can lead to consumers taking swift action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. The Red Flags Rule impacts around 11.1 million creditors and financial institutions, with estimated annual labor costs of $143 million. Some entities are concerned about overlapping burdens with other regulations, such as the American Bar Association questioning if lawyers are considered \"creditors\" under the rule. The American Bar Association (ABA) questioned if lawyers are considered \"creditors\" under the Red Flags Rule due to payment practices. The American Medical Association suggested physicians be exempt due to patient privacy laws. Concerns arose that physicians may require full payment at the time of service to avoid being considered creditors, potentially impacting patient treatment. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 limited the rule's definition of a creditor. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 limited the definition of a creditor under the Red Flags Rule, excluding certain businesses like physicians. The true scope of identity theft in the United States remains unclear due to various factors. The true scope of identity theft in the United States is not clearly understood. Studies estimate that millions of Americans have been victims of identity theft, with an increase in incidents reported in 2012 compared to 2011. Consumer complaints to the FTC also show a rise in identity theft cases. The FTC received 369,132 identity theft complaints in 2012, but survey data suggests that between 12.6 million and 16.6 million people may have been victimized. Factors contributing to this disparity include victims reporting to different entities like credit bureaus and law enforcement, as well as some victims not reporting incidents at all. Since 2000, identity theft has consistently been the most common consumer fraud complaint received by the FTC, accounting for about 32% of all consumer complaints. The number of identity theft complaints generally increased from 2000 to 2008, then decreased in 2009 and 2010 before rising again in 2011 and 2012. The trends in identity theft complaints reported to the FTC have been rising since 2011 and 2012. Globalization and advanced technology have made it challenging for law enforcement to identify and apprehend identity thieves targeting individuals in the United States. Criminals may operate domestically or internationally, alone or as part of larger networks. The FBI focuses on investigating identity theft within larger criminal networks. Identity theft involves criminals operating in various cities across the United States and globally, victimizing individuals worldwide. A study by Verizon and law enforcement partners found that 55% of data breaches by external actors were attributed to organized crime. Perpetrators may use multiple identities, including stolen and cyber identities. Identity theft is linked to various crimes and frauds. Identity theft incidents are not always reported to law enforcement, consumer protection agencies, or credit reporting agencies. This lack of uniform reporting hinders analysts' ability to fully understand the extent of identity theft in the United States. Law enforcement agencies may not uniformly report identity theft due to issues with crime incident reporting forms and recording procedures. Discrepancies exist between data reported by consumers, state/local law enforcement, and federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI, Secret Service, Postal Inspection Service, SSA OIG, and ICE. Task forces with state and local law enforcement may also be involved in investigating identity theft. The Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutes federal identity theft cases, while the FBI investigates identity theft through its Financial Crimes Section and other units. The FBI collaborates with various task forces and groups nationwide, focusing on cases involving organized identity theft groups and criminal enterprises. The FBI partners with the National White Collar Crime Center to form the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) to receive and refer Internet crime complaints, including identity theft. The Secret Service's dual mission includes protecting the nation's financial infrastructure and investigating crimes like counterfeiting, financial fraud, and computer-based attacks. They have task forces dedicated to investigating identity theft and other crimes, with thousands of suspects arrested annually for identity theft-related offenses. In FY2012, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service arrested 4,277 suspects for identity theft-related crimes, and in FY2013, they arrested 3,868 suspects. The Postal Inspection Service sponsors multi-agency task forces specializing in financial crimes, including identity theft, and has arrested 627 identity theft suspects. They also deliver educational presentations to consumer groups to prevent identity theft. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service works with consumer groups to prevent identity theft and sponsors outreach programs for victims. The SSA OIG investigates identity theft involving Social Security numbers and provides assistance to victims by placing fraud alerts, replacing cards, issuing new numbers, and correcting earnings records. The SSA OIG investigates and detects fraud, waste, and abuse related to Social Security numbers. It provides limited SSN verification for law enforcement agencies and maintains a hotline for reporting identity theft. ICE investigates identity theft cases, particularly in immigration involving document and benefit fraud. ICE created DBFTFs in 19 cities to combat criminal organizations engaging in fraud. The U.S. Attorneys Offices prosecute federal identity theft cases referred by investigative agencies, but determining the proportion of cases referred by each agency is challenging due to double reporting and tracking case referrals by program area rather than statute. The U.S. Attorneys Offices prosecute federal identity theft cases referred by investigative agencies, but tracking case referrals by program area rather than statute makes it challenging to determine the proportion of cases referred by each agency. Trends in federal identity theft and aggravated identity theft cases may be better tracked by the total number of cases referred to and prosecuted by the USAOs, regardless of the referring agency. The number of identity theft complaints to the FTC has fluctuated over the years, as has the number of identity theft cases prosecuted by the DOJ. Figure 3 shows the number of identity theft and aggravated identity theft cases filed with the USAOs and convictions between FY1998 and FY2013. The number of identity theft and aggravated identity theft cases filed increased in FY2013 compared to FY2012, while convictions decreased. Cases peaked in 2007 and 2008, then declined. Aggravated identity theft cases have continued to rise since 2004. Total case filings and convictions have mostly decreased since 2008. Possible reasons for these trends include a decrease in actual identity theft incidents. The number of identity theft cases filed in FY2013 has increased, but law enforcement is arresting fewer identity thieves and filing fewer cases. Possible explanations include an increase in incidents evading law enforcement, fewer resources dedicated to combating identity theft, or fewer perpetrators impacting more victims due to technological advancements. In FY2013, the number of identity theft cases filed increased, but there was a downward trend since FY2008. This was accompanied by a rise in aggravated identity theft cases, possibly due to some cases being charged differently. Aggravated identity theft became a federal crime in 2004, leading to an increase in convictions. Survey data suggests that millions of people may have been victimized by identity theft. Between 12.6 million and 16.6 million people were victims of identity theft and fraud in 2012, with existing account fraud and new account fraud being the primary forms. Credit card fraud was the most common misuse of victims' identities until 2008, when government documents and benefits fraud became prevalent, remaining the leading category in 2012. In 2012, identity theft and fraud affected between 12.6 million and 16.6 million people. Government documents and benefits fraud became prevalent, with tax return fraud being a significant issue. Identity theft facilitates various crimes, with credit card fraud being the primary criminal use of stolen information. Thieves may change billing addresses to avoid detection, allowing them more time to abuse victims' identities and credit. Identity theft can adversely affect a victim's credit by not paying bills and opening new accounts in their name, leading to financial repercussions. Organized crime groups are increasingly involved in identity theft-related crimes like credit card fraud, with criminals operating across borders. Operation Power Outage in 2011 resulted in the arrest of 83 individuals associated with a transnational criminal organization. Armenian Power, a transnational criminal organization involved in credit card fraud, used skimming devices to steal customer information. In 2013, individuals pleaded guilty for their roles in the criminal enterprise. Identity thieves can create fake documents with stolen information, affecting victims when applying for government benefits. Identity theft affects victims when applying for benefits, as fraudulent individuals may already be receiving them under the victim's name. Fraudulent documents can provide fake identities for unauthorized immigrants or individuals trying to enter the US illegally. The DOJ has linked identity theft to international terrorism, with terrorists using stolen identities for planned attacks. Former Attorney General John Ashcroft stated that identity theft facilitates terrorism, citing a case where an Algerian national stole identities for a failed bombing plot. Identity theft and document fraud can have economic and national security impacts. In a sophisticated scheme, fraudsters generated over $3 million by selling fraudulent driver's licenses nationwide. They outsourced manufacturing to Bangladesh and China. Identity theft can lead to employment fraud, especially during times of high unemployment. Policymakers should monitor trends in employment to combat this issue. Employment fraud, linked to identity theft, can harm victims' credit, taxes, and job prospects. Scammers use fake job ads to steal personal information for further crimes. The Identity Theft Resource Center reports a rise in data breaches from 2005 to 2008, with fluctuations until 2013. In 2013, there were 619 reported data breaches across various industries. The medical/healthcare sector had the highest number of breaches (43.1%), followed by business (33.9%), government (10.2%), educational (9.0%), and banking (3.7%) sectors. The increase in reported breaches may be influenced by state laws requiring data breach notification, with 46 states and other territories having enacted such legislation by December 2013. The District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have data breach notification laws. State laws requiring breach notification could lead to more reported breaches, but the actual number remains underreported. Analysts cannot confirm if the increase in reported breaches in 2013 reflects the trend accurately. The number of records affected by each breach varies, with information available for only about 59% of reported breaches in 2013. In 2013, about 59% of reported data breaches had information on the number of records exposed. Analyzing the relationship between data breaches and identity theft is complex, as the correlation may not be very strong. Some claim data breaches directly cause identity theft, but the link is not definitive. Some experts argue that data breaches may lead to identity theft, prompting calls for increased data security and breach notification laws. However, others point out that less than 1% of data breach victims also experience identity theft, questioning the necessity of such laws. Studies show that a significant percentage of individuals have received notifications about data breaches involving their personal information. Javelin Strategy & Research data indicate that a considerable number of individuals receive breach notifications. Research data suggests that 22.5% of individuals receiving breach notifications became fraud victims. Studies found that around 11-12% of identity theft victims had their information stolen through data breaches. Most victims (65%) were unaware of how their identities were stolen, potentially due to data breaches. The Center for Identity Management and Information Protection at Utica College found that in nearly 27% of identity theft cases handled by the U.S. Secret Service between 2002 and 2006, a breach of company-controlled data was the source. The relationship between identity theft and data breaches is stronger when analyzing victims whose data was obtained through a breach. Policymakers are faced with the challenge of targeting data breaches to prevent identity theft, with options including increasing data security measures. Congress has enacted data breach laws targeting public and private sectors to prevent identity theft. Options for Congress include dedicating resources to assist victims and implementing deterrence measures. Policymakers need to consider reducing the availability of SSNs, increasing breach notification requirements, and the adequacy of current legal measures. The adequacy of legal definitions and predicate offenses for identity theft is a concern for policymakers. They must also consider the federal government's role in preventing identity theft, which could proactively prevent other crimes. Congress may evaluate various means to prevent identity theft, including securing data. Possible ways to prevent identity theft include securing data in the private sector, securing data in the public sector, and improving consumer authentication processes. The prevalence of personally identifiable information, especially Social Security numbers (SSN), is a concern for policymakers and data security experts. There are fewer restrictions on SSN use in the private sector compared to the public sector, where Congress has taken steps to reduce SSN prevalence, such as prohibiting their display on driver's licenses. Congress prohibited states from displaying SSNs on driver's licenses, but SSNs are still shown on Medicare cards. Legislation may be needed to remove SSNs from Medicare cards to prevent identity theft. Proponents cite risks to individuals, while opponents mention the high cost of transitioning to a new identifier. Congress may consider increasing restrictions on disclosing personally identifiable information, like SSNs, in federally funded grant programs. The Violence Against Women Act of 2005 prohibits grantees from disclosing certain information, including SSNs. Congress may need to evaluate if current SSN restrictions for federal grant recipients are adequate or if the government should have a larger role in limiting SSN use. The Government Accountability Office has identified vulnerabilities in federal laws protecting personally identifiable information, such as SSNs, across industries. One policy option to reduce discrepancies is to provide federal agencies with authority to curb SSN use in the private sector, like truncating SSNs uniformly. Congress may need to evaluate if current SSN restrictions for federal grant recipients are adequate. Some suggest giving authority to set rules for SSN sales, while others propose focusing on eliminating SSNs as authenticators due to their predictability. Efforts could shift towards using alternative identity authenticators in the private sector. Congress may need to address the link between data breaches and identity theft. Between 12% and 27% of identity theft incidents may result from data breaches, but the exact proportion is unknown as victims are often unaware of how their information was acquired. Congress may need to strengthen data breach notification requirements to prevent or reduce breach-related identity theft. Proponents argue that increasing notification requirements could help mitigate the monetary loss associated with identity theft. Recent trends in identity theft show that early awareness can lead to faster mitigation of damage. Enhanced reporting requirements on industries may improve data security standards, reducing data breaches and identity theft. State-level data breach disclosure laws could decrease identity theft by 6.1%. However, opponents argue that the percentage of data breaches resulting in identity theft is less than 1%, questioning the cost-effectiveness of increased notification requirements for businesses. The costs incurred from increased notification for data breaches could exceed the costs for identity theft victims. Strengthening data security and enhancing cyber security measures can reduce incidents of identity theft, which is a broadly defined crime. Investigating and prosecuting identity theft often involves related crimes like mail theft, counterfeit securities, and tax fraud. The President's Identity Theft Task Force recommended expanding the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft, but specific data supporting this claim is lacking. Congress may request reports from investigative agencies to detail the relationship between these crimes and identity theft. Investigative agencies provide a report on the relationship between identity theft and other federal crimes not yet classified as predicate offenses. Congress may consider expanding the list of predicate offenses to address identity theft-related crimes affecting national priorities like economic health and national security. Online identity thieves can exploit the increasing amount of data stored online, posing a risk even without a rise in data breaches. The potential victims of identity theft include individuals and organizations, with phishing being a common method used by identity thieves. The task force recommends Congress clarify identity theft laws to cover individuals and organizations targeted by identity thieves, citing \"phishing\" as a common method used to solicit personal information."
