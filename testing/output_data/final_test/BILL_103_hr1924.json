    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Equal Rights Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that minority communities are disproportionately affected by commercial landfills and hazardous waste sites, with higher exposure to air pollutants and hazardous waste facilities. In the southeastern United States, 3 out of 4 commercial hazardous waste landfills were located in communities with more blacks than whites. Residents near these sites had incomes below the poverty line ranging from 26% to 42%. A University of Michigan study in 1990 found that minorities were 4 times more likely than whites to live near hazardous waste facilities in the Detroit metropolitan area. Additionally, a National Law Journal study showed that penalties for pollution violations in minority-populated areas were significantly lower than in white areas. SEC. 7014 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act allows for petitions regarding environmentally disadvantaged communities. SEC. 7014 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act grants citizens the right to petition to prevent the construction of new waste management facilities in environmentally disadvantaged communities. Petitions can be submitted to the Administrator or the State for hazardous waste facilities, and to the appropriate entity for municipal solid waste facilities. The petition for municipal solid waste facilities must be submitted to the Administrator or the State. A public hearing will be held to approve the petition if the proposed facility is in an environmentally disadvantaged community and may impact human health. The petition for municipal solid waste facilities must be submitted to the Administrator or the State. A public hearing will be held to approve the petition if the proposed facility is in an environmentally disadvantaged community and may impact human health. The petitioner must demonstrate that the proposed facility will not pose significant risks to human health or the environment compared to alternative locations within the State. The submission of a petition under subsection (a) stays the issuance of a permit for the facility concerned until a decision on the petition has been rendered under subsection (b). If more than one petition relating to the same facility is submitted, the petitions may be consolidated to promote efficient resolution. Definitions include 'environmentally disadvantaged community'. The term 'environmentally disadvantaged community' refers to an area within 2 miles of a proposed solid waste facility where the population of certain ethnicities exceeds state or national averages. The term 'environmentally disadvantaged community' refers to an area with a high percentage of individuals living at or below the poverty line or with a per capita income significantly below the national average. These areas may also contain hazardous waste management facilities. The curr_chunk discusses various types of facilities that are considered hazardous, including those with releases of hazardous substances, facilities for managing municipal solid waste, and facilities required to submit toxic chemical release forms. The curr_chunk defines terms related to solid waste management, such as 'management', 'release', and 'contaminant', as determined by the appropriate entity. The curr_chunk amends the table of contents for subtitle G of the Act by adding a new item.
