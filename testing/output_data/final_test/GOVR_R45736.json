    "content": "The 2017 tax revision, P.L. 115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, reduced taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. It permanently lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%, made changes to business tax deductions, and revised international tax rules. Individual income taxes were also affected with an increase in the standard deduction and child credit, along with rate cuts and limits on itemized deductions. Temporary provisions for pass-through businesses were included, scheduled to expire after 2025. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 reduced taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, with provisions for equipment investment deductions and estate tax exemptions. The Act resulted in significant reductions in individual and corporate taxes, as well as other taxes. Various effects were projected, including increased output and investment, repatriation of income held abroad, and decreased likelihood of inversions. Business investment was expected to increase due to various factors. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 aimed to boost business investment by lowering corporate tax rates and eliminating tax penalties on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The effects of the Act in 2018 were analyzed, showing mixed results on economic growth but clear evidence of increased repatriation of funds. Various organizations projected modest economic growth rates following the tax changes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 aimed to boost business investment by lowering corporate tax rates and eliminating tax penalties on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. In its April 2018 report, CBO projected the tax change to increase GDP by 0.3% in 2018, with a feedback effect of 5%. JCT projected a larger revenue feedback effect of around 20%, suggesting a growth rate of 4.2% in 2018. Various forecasters compared CBO's output estimate with their projections. CBO projected a 0.3% increase in GDP for 2018 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with a 0.2% increase in potential GDP and a 0.1% reduction in the output gap. The increase in potential output was attributed to higher investment and labor supply. Demand-side effects were minimal due to the tax cut benefiting businesses and higher-income individuals. Supply-side effects were deemed permanent. CBO projected output effects rising to 0.6% in 2019, peaking in 2022, and declining to 0.5% in 2028. Compared to other forecasts, CBO's projections were similar for the 10-year period 2018-2027. There was divergence in estimates for 2027, with one organization projecting a negative effect. Arguments during the debate varied on the growth effects of tax cuts. The tax cuts were projected to have larger growth effects, but most analysis did not support claims that they would pay for themselves. In 2018, real GDP growth was 2.9%, slightly higher than previous years, indicating a small impact from the tax revision. The revenue loss from the tax cut was estimated at 1.2% of GDP in 2018. The increase in growth rates in 2015 and 2014 aligns with the trend shown in Figure 1. Forecasters had projected similar growth rates to CBO's, with additional stimulus from spending increases in 2018. Tariffs may have negatively impacted growth, while the tax cuts and demand-side stimulus contributed to a high growth rate in the second quarter of 2018. Overall, the effects of the tax cuts on the economy show a relatively small first-year impact. The data suggests that the tax cut did not generate enough growth in the first year to pay for itself. A 6.7% GDP increase solely from the tax cuts would be needed, but the actual growth was much lower. Consumption grew at 2.6% in 2018, similar to 2017, but below previous years. There was an unexpected drop in the first quarter followed by a rise in the second quarter. The tax cut in 2018 did not generate enough growth to pay for itself, with consumption growing at 2.6% but below previous years. There was an unexpected drop in the first quarter followed by a rise in the second quarter, possibly due to a delay in tax refunds. The tax cut mainly benefited businesses and higher-income individuals, leading to limited fiscal stimulus in an economy near full employment. The Act's first-year impact on GDP is projected to be small, with supply-side effects on investment being more significant. The tax cut in 2018 led to a 0.6% increase in fixed nonresidential investment, offset by a 0.3% decrease in net exports. Consumption grew by 2.6% and nonresidential investment by 7%, indicating a possible supply-side effect, although not solely attributed to the tax change. The tax cut in 2018 resulted in a 0.6% increase in fixed nonresidential investment, with a 0.3% decrease in net exports. The growth rates of investment subcomponents were volatile, with the largest effects seen in the first and second quarters of 2018. Real growth in equipment, structures, and intellectual property products did not align with the incentive effects of the tax change. The user cost of capital, reflecting the required rate of return for investments, declined for equipment and structures but increased for R&D. Equipment costs decreased by 2.7% and structures by 11.7%, while R&D costs rose by 3.4%. This was due to more depreciation costs for equipment. The decline in the required rate of return for equipment and structures was smaller due to favorable treatment. Lower tax rates also affect debt-financed capital by reducing the subsidy. It is premature to attribute the higher growth in nonresidential fixed investment solely to tax changes. Overall revenue changes were in line with projections. Overall, revenue changes were close to projections, with revenues only $9 billion smaller than projected. Individual income tax revenues increased by $45 billion, while payroll taxes decreased by $7 billion and corporate revenues declined by $40 billion. Data suggests that the tax cut for corporations may have been larger than the $94 billion projected by CBO in April 2018. Actual corporate revenues were $38 billion lower than projected, indicating a 16% decrease. Lower corporate tax revenues in FY2018 could not be explained by economic conditions according to CBO's January 2019 report. The CBO reported that the decline in tax revenues, particularly from corporate taxes, could not be explained by economic conditions. The decrease in revenues is expected to dissipate over time, with uncertainties about whether it will be temporary or permanent. Despite lower corporate revenues, overall revenues were close to projections due to increases in individual income tax revenues and decreases in payroll taxes. Effective tax rates fell, but the reasons for these changes were not specified by the CBO. The tax revision focused on corporations, reducing the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The effective average tax rate for corporations decreased from 17.2% in 2017 to 8.8% in 2018. The decline in tax revenues, particularly from corporate taxes, could not be explained by economic conditions. The tax revision in 2018 resulted in a significant drop in effective tax rates for corporations, with the average rate falling from 17.2% to 8.8%. The reduction in statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% led to a decrease in effective tax rates. Additionally, the marginal effective tax rate on equity investment decreased from 15.6% to 3.2% from 2017 to 2018, reflecting changes in the tax code for domestic investment. The marginal tax rate on equity investment decreased significantly from 15.6% to 3.2% in 2017 to 2018. When accounting for reduced subsidies for debt-financed investment, marginal tax rates are slightly negative, ranging from -0.3% to -6.6%. Marginal effective tax rates, which impact investment incentives, are below average tax rates due to timing benefits like accelerated depreciation. Individual income tax changes in 2018 were smaller than corporate tax changes, with the effective individual tax rate decreasing from 9.6% to 9.2% of personal income, a 4% reduction. The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis estimates a reduction in effective tax rate for individuals from 10.1% in 2017 to 8.9% in 2019. The decrease in individual tax rates was smaller compared to corporate tax rates. The top individual rate was reduced by 2.6 percentage points, while the corporate rate was reduced by 14 percentage points. Business income was eligible for a 20% reduction in some cases. The marginal tax rates on labor income and capital income decreased according to CBO estimates. The marginal tax rate for labor income fell from 29.4% to 27.2%, while the rate for all capital income dropped from 16.5% to 14.7%. These changes were small compared to the reduction in corporate tax rates. The tax revision favored higher-income taxpayers, with small changes in marginal tax rates for corporations. Arguments were made that corporate tax cuts would benefit workers through investment growth. CBO projected small effects on labor productivity and wage rates, with a slight increase in the total wage bill due to higher employment and hours per worker. The Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) study in 2017 suggested that a corporate tax rate reduction could potentially increase household income by $4,000 to $9,000 in the long term. The study also indicated that workers could immediately benefit from a significant share of profits repatriated from abroad. The CEA study in 2017 projected that a corporate tax rate reduction could boost household income by $4,000 to $9,000 in the long term, potentially increasing GDP by 2.5% to 5.7%. The effects of the tax cuts were estimated to be significantly larger (3.8 to 8.5 times) than the costs, with the corporate rate cut from 35% to 21% costing about $125 billion. The study considered various factors such as changes in user cost on investment and corporate tax incidence, although the econometric estimates of corporate tax incidence were deemed problematic. The 2017 CEA study projected that a corporate tax rate reduction could boost household income by $4,000 to $9,000 in the long term, potentially increasing GDP by 2.5% to 5.7%. Evidence from 2018 indicated that labor compensation grew slower than output, with pretax profits and economic depreciation growing faster than wages. Wage growth has sometimes been faster than GDP from 2013-2018. The rate of real GDP from 2013-2018 showed varying wage growth compared to GDP growth. In 2018, there was no significant surge in wages. Average weekly wages increased slightly, but adjusting for inflation, real wages only grew by 1.2%. This indicates that ordinary workers experienced minimal wage rate growth. International capital flows are expected to increase investment through supply-side effects. Anticipated increased investment through international capital flows, particularly in the short and medium term, is expected due to reduced user cost of capital and tax changes incentivizing reinvestment in the United States of unrepatriated earnings held abroad. The tax revision exempted dividends from tax and imposed a transition tax on deemed repatriations of existing untaxed earnings at a lower rate than the new corporate rate of 21%. The tax revision exempted dividends from tax and imposed a transition tax on deemed repatriations of existing untaxed earnings at a lower rate than the new corporate rate of 21%. Estimates indicated close to $3 trillion of unrepatriated earnings, with criticisms on the potential impact on investment. A Federal Reserve study estimated that $1 trillion was held in cash, and a significant amount of repatriations occurred in 2018. Dividends in the previous three years ranged from $144 billion to $158 billion. In 2018, $664 billion was repatriated, while reinvested earnings declined before returning to normal levels. International capital flows should be measured in terms of actual investment in the United States, reflecting resources for capital investment. This involves imports of investment goods or consumption goods that free up resources for investment, largely measured by the excess of exports over imports. In 2018, international capital flows were measured by the balance on the current account, showing a net capital inflow. The change in net capital inflows amounted to 0.8% of private investment, a relatively small increase not indicating a surge in investment from abroad. Increased funds from abroad or through tax cuts in 2018 could be used for investment, debt repayment, wage increases, bonuses, dividends, or share buybacks. Some firms used these funds for worker bonuses after the tax revision, totaling $4.4 billion, equivalent to $28 per worker. This amount represents a small percentage of corporate tax cuts and repatriated funds, in line with economic theory suggesting only a fraction of increased profits would be used to compensate workers. Worker bonuses after the tax revision totaled $4.4 billion, equivalent to $28 per worker. The funds were used for record-breaking stock buybacks, with $1 trillion announced by the end of 2018. This mirrors a similar trend in 2004 during a tax holiday. The tax cut may have also been a public relations move due to a tight labor market. The current tax system has led to firms relocating abroad to low-tax jurisdictions, known as inversions. These inversions allow firms to shift profits and repatriate earnings without taxes. Legislative actions in 2004 aimed to prevent these inversions by imposing penalties on firms with majority ownership by former U.S. shareholders. In 2014, a new wave of inversions involving mergers with smaller foreign firms began, including Pfizer's announcement to acquire Astra-Zeneca with a UK headquarters. This led to legislative and regulatory proposals in 2014, 2015, and 2016 addressing issues such as ownership limits and access to earnings of subsidiaries abroad. The 2017 Act introduced measures to discourage inversions, such as a deemed repatriation tax at 35% for firms inverting in the next 10 years. It also implemented the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) to address profit shifting, excluding certain payments to foreign parents. The 2017 tax revision introduced measures to discourage inversions, including the BEAT tax for firms inverting after November 9, 2017. It also expanded constructive ownership rules, attributing stock owned by a foreign person to a U.S. entity. The downward attribution rule applies to foreign persons owning stock in a U.S. entity, including partnerships and trusts. It was created to prevent inversions and ensures that a subsidiary maintains its status as a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC), subject to relevant tax rules. The Act included provisions to discourage inversions, affecting stockholders and stock compensation. Dividends are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, with rates of 0%, 15%, and 20%. Certain dividends from foreign firms without tax treaties or PFICs are not eligible for lower rates. Dividends from firms that inverted after P.L. 115-97 are also not eligible. An excise tax of 20% was imposed on stock compensation for insiders in expatriated corporations. The 2017 Act made inversions less attractive, leading to a decline in foreign acquisitions of US companies. Inversion-associated countries like Ireland saw significant drops in acquisitions. The user cost of capital formula includes the required after-tax return and economic depreciation. The user cost formula includes C as the user cost, R as the required after-tax return, t as the effective marginal rate, and d as the economic depreciation rate. Economic depreciation compensates for the decline in asset value. User cost calculations use a weighted pretax rate of return for debt and equity finance. The effective marginal tax rate depends on various factors. Table A-1 shows effective tax rates for investments before and after 2017 changes. The overall user cost also considers economic depreciation rates and capital stock sizes. Depreciation rates vary for different types of capital stock in the corporate and non-corporate sector. Equipment has a depreciation rate of 12.95% per year, with 67% owned by corporations. Structures consist of public utility structures (23% of total) with a 2.24% depreciation rate, and buildings with a 2.8% rate. Intangible assets depreciate at 17%, with 86% owned by corporations. User costs and percentage changes are detailed in Table A-2."
