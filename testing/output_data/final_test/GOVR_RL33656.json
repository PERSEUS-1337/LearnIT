    "content": "According to the EPA, waste from animal feedlots can harm human health and the environment by contaminating water, soil, and air. This pollution can lead to fish kills and various health issues for humans. Agriculture, including animal feeding operations, is a significant contributor to water quality impairments in rivers and lakes across the United States. Animal feeding operations in 29 states contribute to water quality impairment, with primary pollutants being nutrients, organic matter, pathogens, and odorous compounds. These pollutants can enter water through various pathways such as runoff, direct discharges, and leaching into soil and groundwater. Additionally, animal waste contains salts, trace elements, antibiotics, pesticides, and hormones. The Clean Water Act regulates discharges of waste from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) into the nation's waters. In the late 1990s, the EPA reviewed the rules governing these discharges, which had not been updated since the 1970s. A proposal to revise the rules was released by the Clinton Administration in December 2000, sparking controversy between agriculture industry groups and environmental groups. In the early 2000s, there was controversy over regulations for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). The Bush Administration revised the rules in 2002, which were challenged by environmental and agriculture industry groups. EPA proposed further revisions in 2008, leading to more challenges from industry groups. The 2003 CAFO rule was finalized in October 2008. Industry groups challenged the rule, leading to a federal court vacating a portion of it in March 2011. The report discusses the legal challenges to the 2008 rule and the court's ruling. Key interest groups have varying perspectives on the issue. The Clean Water Act prohibits pollutant discharge from any point source to US waters without an NPDES permit. The Clean Water Act requires NPDES permits for any discharge of pollutants, with specific limitations based on effluent guidelines. CAFOs are defined as point sources and are subject to NPDES permitting rules. EPA issued rules for CAFOs in 1974 and effluent guidelines in 1976. The 2003 rule revised regulations for CAFOs, expanding the number of covered operations to 15,500, primarily the largest CAFOs. Prior to the revisions, only 4,000 CAFOs had permits, indicating inadequate enforcement. The rule established effluent limitation guidelines for production areas of regulated CAFOs. The 2003 rule expanded regulations for CAFOs, including effluent limitation guidelines for production areas and land application areas. Facilities must maintain waste containment structures and comply with best management practices for discharges. CAFOs are required to develop and follow a comprehensive nutrient management plan for handling manure and wastewater. The 2003 rule expanded regulations for CAFOs, requiring them to develop a nutrient management plan for handling manure and wastewater. The rule was challenged in court, with a decision in February 2005 partially upholding EPA's authority to regulate manure discharge through permits. The court ruling in 2005 upheld EPA's authority to regulate manure discharge through permits for CAFOs. In response, EPA proposed revisions to the 2003 rule in June 2006, extending compliance dates for affected facilities until February 27, 2009. Livestock operators were given an additional 19 months to apply for discharge permits and develop manure management plans. The EPA extended compliance dates for facilities not defined as CAFOs until February 27, 2009. New livestock operations and existing CAFOs covered by permits prior to 2003 were not eligible for the deadline extension. In March 2008, EPA released a supplement to the 2006 proposal, offering additional options in response to the Waterkeeper Alliance ruling. Industry and environmental groups provided public comments on the EPA's proposal regarding nutrient management plans for livestock and poultry producers. Industry supported the proposal's flexibility, while environmental groups criticized it for not following the Waterkeeper Alliance court ruling. State environmental agencies were also involved in the discussions. The EPA issued a final revised regulation in 2008 regarding CAFOs and NPDES permits. The rule clarified the \"duty to apply\" provision, requiring all CAFOs to apply for permits if they discharge. It also stated that NMPs are enforceable under NPDES permits. The 2008 rule clarified that NMPs are enforceable under NPDES permits for CAFOs, affecting about 15,300 out of 20,700 CAFOs. Key issues addressed in the rule included the \"duty to apply\" requirement, review of nutrient management plans, and effluent limitation guidelines. The 2003 rule required CAFOs to apply for an NPDES permit or demonstrate no potential to discharge pollutants. Farm industry groups challenged this \"duty to apply\" provision, which remained controversial even after being revised in 2008. EPA's rationale was based on the presumption that most CAFOs have the potential to discharge pollutants. The Waterkeeper Alliance court ruled that CAFOs are only required to seek an NPDES permit if there is an actual discharge of pollutants, not just a potential to discharge. EPA proposed in 2006 that CAFOs must seek coverage under a permit if they discharge or propose to discharge pollutants. This proposal aimed to replace the broad \"duty to apply\" requirement of the 2003 rule. The EPA deleted the 2003 rule's provision allowing CAFOs to demonstrate no potential to discharge, requiring only CAFOs that discharge or propose to discharge to seek permits. This change would result in 25% fewer CAFOs seeking permits and a $15.5 million per year reduction in administrative burden. Additionally, a provision was included for CAFOs to voluntarily certify no discharge. The EPA deleted the 2003 rule's provision allowing CAFOs to demonstrate no potential to discharge, requiring only CAFOs that discharge or propose to discharge to seek permits. This change would result in 25% fewer CAFOs seeking permits and a $15.5 million per year reduction in administrative burden. Additionally, a provision was included for CAFOs to voluntarily certify no discharge, offering protection to farmers in case of a discharge event. EPA's proposed revisions to the NPDES permit program for CAFOs would shift the program from proactive to reactive, allowing operators to decide if they need a permit. States argued that fewer CAFOs would voluntarily seek permits, leading to increased burden on permitting authorities. EPA's expectations for states to inspect non-permitted CAFOs were deemed unrealistic. States and environmental groups objected to EPA's proposal to delete the \"duty to apply\" requirement for CAFO permits, arguing that it would increase administrative burden. Industry groups also criticized the idea of voluntary self-certification, stating it would undermine environmental protection. The agriculture industry had concerns about the proposed revisions, including the potential for retroactive penalties for unpermitted discharges. Industry groups continue to disagree with the presumption that CAFOs discharge pollutants, objecting to EPA's proposal for CAFOs to voluntarily seek permits and the addition of a permit requirement for those that \"propose to discharge.\" They argue that permitting requirements should only be based on actual discharges, not speculation about future discharges. EPA's rationale for promulgating these requirements is questioned. The 2008 rule replaced the \"duty to apply\" requirement in the 2003 rule with a requirement that a CAFO must seek permit coverage when it actually discharges or proposes to discharge. EPA recognized that some CAFOs that do not discharge will not seek permit coverage, but in the event of a discharge from an unpermitted CAFO, the operator would be in violation. The revised rule allows a CAFO to certify to the permitting authority that it is designed not to discharge. A certifying CAFO must implement a nutrient management plan meeting NMP requirements. The certification is not subject to review by the permitting authority for it to take effect. The certification for a CAFO to be designed not to discharge does not require public comment or review by the permitting authority. In case of a discharge, the facility would be liable for any unpermitted discharge, but not for failure to apply for a permit. The 2003 rule mandated NPDES permits for CAFOs to include a nutrient management plan with specific requirements. The 2003 rule mandated NPDES permits for CAFOs to include a nutrient management plan (NMP) to prevent direct contact of confined animals with waters of the United States. The NMP must be available to EPA or the permitting authority but is not part of the facility's permit. Environmental plaintiffs argued that the NMP part of the rule was unlawful under the Clean Water Act and the Administrative Procedure Act because it lacked government or public review and enforcement mechanisms. The court agreed with environmental plaintiffs that the permitting aspects of the rule violated the Clean Water Act's public participation requirements. EPA proposed requiring CAFOs to submit a nutrient management plan (NMP) as part of the permit application, which would be reviewed for completeness and sufficiency by the permitting authority. The NMP terms would become enforceable conditions of the permit after public review. The NMP, including data and technical standards, will be incorporated into the permit after public review. EPA allows for individual or general permits, with a preference for general permits to reduce regulatory burden. The 2005 Waterkeeper Alliance ruling mandated public participation in NMP review for permits. The NMP, including data and technical standards, will be incorporated into the permit after public review. EPA allows for individual or general permits, with a preference for general permits to reduce regulatory burden. The 2005 Waterkeeper Alliance ruling mandated public participation in NMP review for permits. In the case of individual permits, existing NPDES rules establish procedures for public participation. For facilities under a general permit, new provisions for public participation in review of NMPs were proposed in 2006. EPA included mechanisms for modifying general permits for CAFOs to incorporate site-specific NMP requirements and allow public review before coverage is granted. The proposal allows permitting authorities to determine public notification and comment procedures for CAFOs covered under general permits. EPA's 2008 supplementary proposal offered alternatives for CAFOs to adjust nutrient management plans without formal modifications, accommodating changes in farming practices over the permit period. The EPA proposed alternatives for CAFO operators to make routine changes in nutrient management plans without formal modifications, reducing burdens on permitting authorities and operators. Annual reporting requirements would provide public data on compliance with permit requirements. Many comments highlighted the complexity and burdens of nutrient management planning on CAFO operators and state agencies. EPA's proposal for CAFO operators and state permitting agencies included flexibility in public notice provision. Industry sought clarification on NMP terms enforceability. Some commenters wanted the entire NMP included in the permit for compliance assurance. The 2008 revised rule maintained NMP contents but added a requirement for CAFOs to submit the NMP. The final rule for CAFOs required submission of the NMP as part of the permit application, added public participation requirements, and specified minimum enforceable terms of the NMP, addressing concerns raised by the Waterkeeper decision. The rule included options for identifying terms related to rates of application. The final rule for CAFOs included two options for identifying terms of the NMP related to rates of application of nutrients. One approach is suitable for operations with predictable crops and land application, while the other is beneficial for CAFOs that may need to adjust their rates due to changes in soil levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Effluent limitations in NPDES permits are based on more general guidelines from EPA specifying maximum pollutant levels for facilities in an industrial category. The 2003 rule established non-numerical effluent limitation guidelines for CAFOs, with the court remanding the rule to EPA for further analysis and justification. EPA must promulgate NSPS for new sources of pollution based on the best available technology. The 2003 rule for CAFOs required new sources of pollution to meet waste management standards, with a provision for a less restrictive alternative performance standard. The court found EPA had not provided adequate basis for these provisions and in 2006, EPA proposed to revise the rule by deleting the provision allowing compliance through an alternative standard. EPA deleted the provision allowing CAFOs to meet the no discharge standard through a 100-year, 24-hour rain event containment structure, effectively prohibiting all discharge of manure, litter, and process wastewater for new sources. The agency also removed the voluntary superior performance standards provision. EPA's 2008 final rule adopted these revisions and introduced a new provision for CAFOs using open surface manure storage to request site-specific ELGs that incorporate the no discharge requirement. The new provision under the Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for industrial sources to reduce pollutants. These guidelines include best practicable control technology currently available (BPT), best control technology for conventional pollutants (BCT), and best available technology economically achievable (BAT). Existing sources must meet BPT by July 1, 1977, and BAT by July 1. The provision aims to incentivize the use of innovative technologies to meet the no discharge requirement for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). The Clean Water Act established effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for industrial sources to reduce pollutants, including BPT, BCT, and BAT. Existing sources must meet BPT by July 1, 1977, and BAT by July 1, 1983. BCT replaces BAT for controlling certain pollutants, including fecal coliform from CAFOs. EPA must conduct a cost reasonableness test for attaining more stringent pollutant control than BPT. The ELG requirements may incidentally reduce pathogens in animal waste. The court ruled that EPA must justify the BCT standard for reducing pathogens in the 2003 rule. EPA retained the BCT standard in the 2006 proposal and 2008 final rule, affirming it as the best control technology for fecal coliform. The Clean Water Act requires permitting authorities to establish water quality-based effluent permit limitations (WQBELs) to ensure water quality standards are met, regardless of treatment technologies or cost. The 2003 rule did not include requirements for WQBELs, with EPA stating they did not expect them for CAFO discharges from land application areas. The 2003 rule did not include requirements for Water Quality-Based Effluent Permit Limitations (WQBELs) for CAFO discharges from land application areas. The environmental plaintiffs challenged EPA's decision and the court directed EPA to explain the need for WQBELs to prevent interference with water quality standards. EPA was also ordered to clarify if states can establish WQBELs for discharges other than agricultural stormwater. In 2006, EPA clarified that WQBELs can be applied to limit discharges from CAFO production areas and non-precipitation-related land application areas. States can impose additional requirements broader than federal NPDES program. EPA reiterated in 2008 that states can include more stringent limitations on agricultural stormwater discharges under their own regulations. EPA clarified in 2006 that WQBELs can limit CAFO discharges and land application areas. States can impose stricter regulations on agricultural stormwater under their own rules. EPA stated in 2008 that states can enforce more stringent limits on stormwater discharges. The 2003 rule by EPA had to interpret the inclusion of CAFOs as point sources and the exclusion of agricultural stormwater. It detailed requirements for land application to prevent runoff of pollutants to nearby waters. The 2003 rule by EPA outlined requirements for proper land application of animal waste to ensure nutrient management practices are followed. Compliance with these practices exempts agricultural stormwater from permitting, while non-compliance may require NPDES permitting for discharges from land application areas. The 2003 EPA rule exempts agricultural stormwater from permitting if nutrient management practices are followed. Livestock industry argues runoff should be permitted only if collected, while environmental groups argue all CAFO discharges should be regulated. The court upheld EPA's interpretation, aiming to exempt agriculture-related discharges caused by nature while holding liability for others. The court upheld the EPA's rule exempting agricultural stormwater from permitting if nutrient management practices are followed, stating that CAFOs should not be held accountable for discharges primarily caused by precipitation. EPA may consider adding a provision for runoff from unpermitted CAFO fields, requiring compliance with nutrient management standards to qualify for a permit exemption. Industry groups supported EPA's proposal for agricultural stormwater exemptions based on nutrient management standards. However, they opposed the idea of additional technical standards for CAFOs, arguing it would narrow the exemption. Environmentalists criticized the proposal for allowing CAFOs to self-regulate without permits. States shared similar concerns. The revised rule for agricultural stormwater exemptions for CAFOs failed to require permits for compliance with nutrient management standards, leading to concerns about enforcement difficulties. The rule stated that unpermitted large CAFOs must apply manure, litter, or process wastewater to land according to site-specific nutrient management practices to qualify for agricultural stormwater discharge exemptions. EPA acknowledged this as a new provision in the rule. The EPA clarified the agricultural stormwater exemption for CAFOs, stating that a full NMP is not required. There was a call for more clarity and guidance on key concepts, such as criteria for permit coverage and nutrient management plan terms. Economic impacts of the 2008 rule on CAFO operators were estimated to be similar to the costs of the 2003 rule. The 2008 revisions to the 2003 rule had mixed economic impacts on CAFO operators. While some operators saved money due to reduced permitting costs, others faced increased administrative burden and costs. State permitting authorities were projected to incur slightly higher administrative costs. Industry groups were generally pleased with the final rule, except for the removal of the \"duty to apply\" provision. The 2008 rule revisions had mixed economic impacts on CAFO operators, with concerns about the agricultural stormwater exemption, compliance dates, self-certification by CAFOs, and pathogen control technology. Legal challenges ensued due to differing perspectives on EPA's actions. Legal challenges followed the 2008 rule revisions, with agriculture industry groups and environmental groups filing lawsuits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit consolidated the petitions. Settlement negotiations between EPA and environmental petitioners led to an agreement for EPA to develop a guidance document for CAFOs to determine discharge requirements. EPA also agreed to propose a rule for collecting information from CAFO owners. The settlement between EPA and environmental petitioners required the agency to develop guidance for CAFOs on discharge requirements and propose a rule for collecting information on CAFOs, including their size, location, and manure generation. Industry groups continued to challenge regulations requiring CAFOs to apply for NPDES permits. The federal court upheld the rule requiring CAFOs to apply for a permit if they have an actual discharge, but rejected the part that created liability for not applying for a permit if the CAFO only proposed to discharge. EPA did not seek a rehearing on the ruling. In July 2012, EPA modified the 2008 CAFO regulations to comply with a court ruling, eliminating the requirement for CAFO owners to apply for a CWA permit if they \"propose to discharge.\" The voluntary certification option for unpermitted CAFOs was also removed. EPA is working with states to ensure state-issued permits align with national requirements and determine if a CAFO needs a CWA permit. States can enforce water pollution standards that are no less stringent than federal requirements under Section 510 of the Clean Water Act. In some states, CAFO operators may face requirements beyond EPA's regulations, such as obtaining water pollution discharge permits or proving they do not need them, even if they do not discharge. Michigan's state regulators have upheld this requirement, despite a previous court ruling invalidating a similar provision in the 2003 EPA rule. EPA is also considering regulatory changes that could impact CAFO operations nationwide. In May 2009, President Obama declared the Chesapeake Bay a \"national treasure\" and mandated federal leadership in its restoration. EPA and other agencies developed a strategy to establish new clean water regulations for stormwater and pollution discharges from animal feedlots in the Bay watershed. Agricultural discharges are a major contributor to water quality issues in the Bay. EPA is reviewing CAFO programs in Bay states to ensure compliance with regulations. EPA is reviewing each Bay state's CAFO program to ensure compliance with the 2008 CAFO rule and is considering more stringent permit standards for nutrient discharges to the Chesapeake Bay. The settlement agreement also includes proposing stricter requirements for land application of manure and process wastewater. EPA is committed to revising national CAFO rules to potentially expand the universe of CAFOs. The revised national rule for CAFOs includes more stringent requirements for nutrient management. EPA will focus on reducing pollutants from CAFOs in the Chesapeake Bay area instead of issuing a new national rule. By June 30, 2018, EPA will decide on further actions based on compliance reviews of existing permits and state programs. EPA will review unregulated animal feedlots by June 30, 2018, to determine if a national rule is necessary. As part of a 2010 consent decree, EPA proposed a rule requiring CAFOs to submit operational information. Environmental groups question if EPA has enough data on CAFOs and their waste management practices. EPA proposed requiring CAFOs to provide contact information, production area location, animal numbers, and land available for waste application. EPA offered two reporting options for CAFOs. The EPA proposed two options for CAFO reporting under CWA Section 308, with concerns raised by agriculture and environmental groups regarding the burden on farmers to provide requested information. Environmental advocates criticized the narrow scope of the proposed options for CAFO reporting, stating that it did not meet the terms of the 2010 settlement agreement and did not provide sufficient information to regulate CAFOs effectively. Despite EPA's assertion that they could obtain necessary data from various sources, including states and federal agencies, the agency ultimately decided not to implement a regulation in July 2012 after reviewing public comments. EPA decided to obtain CAFO information from existing sources before considering a rule requiring CAFOs to submit information. Environmental groups sued EPA over the withdrawal of a proposed information collection rule, but a federal court upheld EPA's decision. Another lawsuit has environmental groups supporting EPA. In a lawsuit, environmental groups are supporting EPA regarding the release of farmers' personal information by the agency in 2012 and 2013. The environmentalists requested the data to understand EPA's decision to abandon a proposed reporting rule for CAFOs. Agriculture industry groups argue that the release endangers farmers' lives and livelihoods. In January 2015, a federal court upheld EPA's decision to release operational information about CAFOs in response to an environmentalists' FOIA request. The court ruled that agriculture groups lacked standing to challenge the data release. However, EPA was barred from releasing information under FOIA requests by environmental groups until the litigation, including appeals, is resolved. Congress has shown interest in CAFO issues in the past, particularly regarding EPA rules' impact on the agriculture sector, but future congressional attention on these issues remains uncertain."
