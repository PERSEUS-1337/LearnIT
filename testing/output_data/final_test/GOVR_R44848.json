    "content": "The Federal Reserve's responsibilities include monetary policy, emergency liquidity provision, bank supervision, and payment system services. The 115th Congress is considering bills that could impact the Fed's functions, particularly in governance, oversight, and disclosure. Some proposals aim to increase congressional oversight of the Fed, require disclosure of more information, and compare monetary policy decisions to policy rules like the Taylor Rule. Other proposals seek to limit the Fed's emergency lending powers and alter the types of assets it can hold on its balance sheet. These provisions are analyzed in this report, which does not cover changes to Fed-administered regulation of financial institutions. The Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) passed the House on June 8, 2017, with provisions spun off into stand-alone bills (H.R. 4753, H.R. 4791, H.R. 4758, H.R. 4755, H.R. 4756, H.R. 4759). The Federal Reserve Supervision Testimony Clarification Act (H.R. 4753) and the FOMC Policy Responsibility Act (H.R. 4758) were ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee on September 13, 2018. Parts of the Financial CHOICE Act were included in the FY2018 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act (H.R. 3280). The House passed the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) with provisions split into separate bills. The Federal Reserve Reform Act (H.R. 6741) combined multiple stand-alone bills related to monetary policy transparency and accountability. The Federal Reserve Reform Act (H.R. 6741) combined various bills related to monetary policy transparency and accountability. Other legislation, such as the Federal Reserve Transparency Act (H.R. 24) and the Bipartisan Budget Act (H.R. 1892), also aimed to reduce the Fed's surplus. The Federal Reserve Act created the Fed as the central bank in 1913, with a governance structure of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks overseen by a Board of Governors in Washington, DC. The board comprises seven governors nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with the chair and vice chairs serving renewable 4-year terms. The Federal Reserve Board formulates policy, while the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is composed of seven governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other regional bank presidents. The New York Fed has a permanent seat on the FOMC, but no special role compared to other regional banks. The FOMC meets every six weeks to set monetary policy. The New York Fed plays key roles within the Federal Reserve system, executing monetary policy decisions through open market operations and running emergency programs during financial crises. It supervises large banks, conducts foreign exchange transactions, and stores gold for foreign central banks. The New York Fed president is traditionally elected as vice chair of the FOMC, with no formal powers. The Fed's capital consists of paid-in capital from member banks and retained earnings. The Federal Reserve Act required member banks to purchase Fed-issued stock, with ownership conferring limited rights and fixed dividends. Stockholders have no control over Fed policy but choose two-thirds of the board of directors at regional Fed banks. Membership in the Fed is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks. The regional Fed banks have a board composed of Class A, B, and C directors who play different roles in governance. Regional bank presidents are chosen by Class B and C directors, not the President, and must be approved by the Board of Governors. Debates about the Fed's governance structure focus on the voting power of regional bank presidents versus the Board of Governors on the FOMC. The FOMC composition involves the Board of Governors and regional bank presidents sharing responsibility for monetary policy. Regional bank presidents rotate on the FOMC, with some banks having no representation every few years. There is a debate about the voting power of regional bank presidents compared to the Board of Governors on the FOMC. Some believe regional bank presidents are more \"hawkish\" on inflation, potentially impacting monetary policy. The FOMC is mandated to pursue low inflation with a 2% target. Most decisions are unanimous or have few dissents, which are more likely from presidents than governors. Governors reflect the President's view, so their hawkishness can vary. Regional bank presidents vote individually, with some dissenting as hawks or doves. The voting balance on the FOMC may have greater governance implications than economic implications, as changing the composition may not significantly impact monetary policy. The Fed chair's dominance in decisions or ability to forge consensus among members suggests that a change in composition would only marginally affect policy. Inflation has been below 4% since 1991, further diminishing the potential impact of altering the FOMC's voting balance. Inflation has been below 4% since 1991. Changing the composition of the FOMC could impact how centralized monetary policymaking is and the democratic accountability of the FOMC. Regional bank presidents may base their votes more on local economic conditions. Private banks in the Federal Reserve system are regulated by the Fed and required to own shares in the Fed, raising questions about their ownership rights. Ownership of stock in the Fed raises questions about ownership rights and potential conflicts of interest, as banks are required to own shares in the Fed. While owners have limited control over Fed policy, member banks have some influence through selecting directors and advising the Fed. Policies are in place to minimize conflicts of interest, such as restrictions on certain director activities. The Dodd-Frank Act limited Class A directors' voting rights in selecting Fed regional bank leadership to reduce conflicts of interest. Proposed bills aim to change the voting membership of the FOMC by increasing regional bank presidents' voting power and altering the frequency of their voting rights. This would shift the balance of power between governors and regional bank presidents on the FOMC. The proposed bills aim to change the voting membership of the FOMC by granting Class A directors of Reserve banks a vote on the appointments of Fed regional bank presidents and first vice presidents. Additionally, the bills would shift the responsibility for setting the interest rate paid to banks on reserves from the Board of Governors to the FOMC. The proposed bill, H.R. 10, aims to create a commission to examine and make recommendations on monetary policy, ethics standards, and conflict of interest rules for the Federal Reserve. It would also allow each board member to hire personal staff and change the voting membership of the FOMC. H.R. 10 proposes adding ethics standards and conflict of interest rules for Federal Reserve board governors and staff. It also addresses the reduction of the Fed's surplus and its remittance to the Treasury. The provision in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act will increase revenues by $1.75 billion over 10 years by shifting Fed remittances from the future to the present. Other bills like H.R. 1116, H.R. 4545, and H.R. 4296 also aim to reduce the Fed's surplus. Critics of the Federal Reserve have long argued for more congressional oversight, transparency, and disclosure. The Fed is required to report to and testify before House and Senate committees semiannually since 1978. The Fed began publishing reports on January 25, 2012. The Federal Reserve began publishing forecasts for its federal funds rate target and announced a 2% inflation goal in 2012 to increase transparency. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has audited the Fed's activities since 1978, with audits of emergency activities during the financial crisis and Fed governance. Private-sector auditors also review the Fed's financial statements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) can audit the Fed's monetary policy decisions, transactions with foreign entities, and policies related to bank reserves for waste, fraud, and abuse. The Fed's budget is self-funded and its income exceeds expenses, with most net income remitted to the Treasury to reduce the federal debt. Congressional oversight is limited as the Fed's budget is not subject to appropriations. The Federal Reserve uses its net income to pay dividends to member banks and add to its surplus. It discloses extensive information on its operations voluntarily and is required to release an annual report and weekly balance sheet summary. The Fed expanded its lending activities during the financial crisis, leading to more detailed monthly reports. In 2010, individual lending records for emergency facilities were released as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Congress has pushed for greater disclosure on regulation, international agreements, and salary information. The Federal Reserve discloses extensive information voluntarily and is required to release an annual report and weekly balance sheet summary. It follows standard notice and public comment processes in rulemaking, with an ombudsman and appeals process for supervisory decisions. The Dodd-Frank Act created a vice chair for supervision who testifies semiannually before committees. Oversight and disclosure are separate issues, with oversight focusing on independent evaluation and disclosure on internal information released to the public. The Federal Reserve voluntarily discloses extensive information and is required to release an annual report and weekly balance sheet summary. Oversight and disclosure are separate issues, with oversight focusing on independent evaluation and disclosure on internal information released to the public. The challenge for Congress is to balance the need for disclosure to better understand the Fed's actions while preserving its political independence and effectiveness in policy outcomes. The challenge for Congress is to strike the right balance between the Fed's responsiveness and political independence. H.R. 10 and H.R. 24 propose removing restrictions on GAO audits of monetary policy, potentially impacting the Fed's regulatory budget and confidentiality requirements. H.R. 10, H.R. 4756, and H.R. 6741 propose expanding GAO's powers to evaluate the economic merits of the Fed's policy decisions. H.R. 10 also suggests a media blackout period around FOMC meetings and increasing the frequency of required monetary policy reports to Congress. Additionally, H.R. 10 would change the frequency of testimony by the vice chair of supervision on Fed supervision. H.R. 10 proposes quarterly testimony by the Fed chair, public release of FOMC transcripts, and subjecting nonmonetary functions to congressional appropriations. The appropriations in the federal budget are currently financed primarily from income earned on the Fed's securities holdings. The new fees proposed in H.R. 10 would increase federal revenues. The bill also requires the Fed to disclose its stress test scenarios through the public rulemaking process and provide them to GAO and CBO's Panel of Economic Advisers. Additionally, H.R. 10 would subject all federal financial regulators, including the Fed, to quantitative cost-benefit analysis requirements. H.R. 10 would require federal financial regulators, including the Fed, to conduct cost-benefit analysis for new rules and disclose international negotiations on financial standards. It also mandates public disclosure of salary and financial information for Fed governors, officers, and employees above a certain salary level. Congress has granted the Fed discretion in monetary policy as long as it meets its statutory mandate. The Federal Reserve has discretion in monetary policy to meet its statutory mandate, including autonomy over policy tools and stance. Some Members of Congress seek alternatives, like a rules-based regime such as the Taylor rule, which relates interest rate changes to inflation rate changes. The Taylor rule relates interest rate changes to inflation rate and output gap, aligning with the Fed's mandate for maximum employment and stable prices. It is used in economic analysis to explain past Fed actions or guide future decisions. The rule has tracked policy well from the 1980s to the 2007 financial crisis, offering a simplified model of the Fed's decisions under normal economic conditions. However, it is limited to the federal funds rate as the primary monetary policy instrument. The Taylor rule, a monetary policy tool used by the Fed, was unable to provide policy prescriptions during the period when the federal funds rate was at the \"zero lower bound\" from 2008 to 2014. This led to the Fed implementing new policy tools like quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. The Taylor rule was not designed to cover the scenario of interest rates hitting zero, as it was created at a time when this had not occurred before. Economists and policy analysts debate using the Taylor rule for monetary policy decisions. The Fed currently uses it as a reference tool but may need legislative changes to require its formal adoption. The desirability of basing policy on a Taylor rule can be seen in the debate over rules versus discretion in policymaking. Advocates of rules argue for predictability and transparency to avoid financial and economic instability, while advocates of discretion argue for flexibility to manage unexpected shocks in the economy. A formal role for a Taylor rule could help Congress evaluate the Fed's decisions. The Taylor rule, a tool for monetary policy, faces challenges in incorporating complex economic factors like financial stability and asset bubbles. Adapting the rule to unforeseen events could reduce predictability and increase discretion. Using forecasts instead of actual data in the rule may be preferable due to monetary policy lags. The challenges of formalizing the traditional Taylor rule in policymaking include data lags, difficulty in estimating neutral interest rates and potential output growth, increased volatility in the federal funds rate, public comprehension, and addressing policy errors caused by forecasting errors. The Taylor rule has been favored by economists to address high inflation, but with inflation low since the 1990s, criticism has arisen that the Fed has engaged in too much stimulus. Policy rules can be adjusted to meet policymakers' goals, with parameters emphasizing price stability or responsiveness to growth. The form of a Taylor rule involves value judgments about monetary policy goals and the best way to achieve them. The Fed's preference for discretionary policy makes it difficult for Congress to enforce a rules-based policy. Congress would struggle to determine the best form of Taylor rule for the Fed to follow and when deviations should be allowed. Cooperation from the Fed is necessary to implement a rules-based policy, but the Fed has little incentive to limit its own discretion. Congress may need legal incentives or penalties to ensure Fed compliance, but this could compromise the Fed's independence. The Fed's preference for discretionary policy makes it challenging for Congress to enforce a rules-based policy. H.R. 10 proposes a Directive Policy Rule for the Fed to follow in setting monetary policy, aiming to reduce discretion while maintaining independence. This rule would require the Fed to publish a five-year inflation projection and compare it to a traditional Taylor rule. The bill requires the Fed to submit its policy rule to GAO and committees within 48 hours of a decision. GAO would report to Congress on compliance, triggering an audit if necessary. H.R. 4270 and H.R. 6741 mandate the Fed to publish an annual monetary policy strategy and adopt mathematical policy rules. Semiannual reports on strategy or policy would be issued to committees. The Fed utilizes emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to extend credit during financial crises. In 2008, the Fed used this authority to provide liquidity to nonbank financial firms and revive demand for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. Additionally, the Fed offered tailored assistance to four firms deemed \"too big to fail.\" The Fed provided special assistance to four \"too big to fail\" firms under Section 13(3), with credit peaking at $710 billion in November 2008. All credit has been repaid with interest, and the Fed earned over $30 billion without any losses. The Dodd-Frank Act added restrictions to Section 13(3) in 2010 to prevent future assistance to failing firms. The Dodd-Frank Act added restrictions to Section 13(3) in 2010, aiming to limit future assistance to failing firms while maintaining the Fed's ability to create facilities. It required public release of records for actions taken under Section 13(3) with audits by the GAO. The Fed's use of Section 13(3) in the financial crisis raised questions about its role as a lender of last resort and whether it should extend assistance to all parts of the financial system. The text discusses the role of the Fed in emergency lending, questioning whether it should lend to firms it does not supervise and how much discretion it needs to respond to financial crises. It also raises concerns about the costs and benefits of emergency lending, the need for congressional approval, and ensuring taxpayers are not exposed to losses. Fed governor Jerome Powell has opposed reducing the Fed's discretion under Section 13(3). Fed governor Jerome Powell opposes reducing the Fed's discretion under Section 13(3) to respond flexibly to financial threats. Some Members of Congress want to limit the Fed's ability to assist financially struggling entities. Bills like H.R. 10, H.R. 4302, and H.R. 6741 aim to amend Section 13(3) to restrict emergency loans to \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" H.R. 10, H.R. 4302, and H.R. 6741 propose amendments to Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to limit emergency loans to \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" The bills would increase voting requirements for emergency loans and prohibit the Fed from accepting equity securities as collateral. They would also require the Fed to establish rules for determining collateral sufficiency and borrower eligibility. H.R. 6741 would amend the Federal Reserve Act to require certification of borrower solvency by the Fed's board and other regulators before eligibility for assistance. It limits assistance to financial institutions, sets a minimum interest rate on emergency loans, and excludes government entities from receiving aid. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet previously focused on Treasury securities but expanded to include over $1 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and other debt during the financial crisis. The Fed is now gradually reducing its MBS holdings to return to a Treasury-only balance sheet. Congressional bills H.R. 4302 and H.R. 6741 propose fast-track procedures for enacting joint resolutions to regulate lending facilities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The Fed is gradually reducing its MBS holdings to return to a Treasury-only balance sheet. It acquired exotic private securities through 13(3) lending facilities during the financial crisis, but only residual holdings remain since 2012. The types of assets the Fed can purchase through open market operations are limited to reduce risk and influence on credit allocation. The Fed can purchase federally guaranteed securities, including those from GSEs and Ginnie Mae, to stabilize housing markets. Unlike 13(3) lending, there are no statutory restrictions on acquiring MBS through open market operations. Borrowers post collateral for Fed loans, which could be acquired if loans default. The Fed can acquire a broader range of collateral for loans, including private securities, through 13(3) lending to LLCs. H.R. 4278 and H.R. 6741 aim to limit the types of securities the Fed can acquire to gold, Treasury currency, or federal government obligations. Transfer of assets to the Treasury was discussed but not implemented. The bills aim to limit the Fed's authority to purchase certain assets and require it to swap its holdings for federal debt with the Treasury. This would include swapping MBS holdings and other assets for federal debt of equal value. The bills would also remove restrictions on the Fed's ability to buy debt directly from the Treasury. The bills propose restrictions on the Fed's ability to purchase certain assets and require swapping holdings for federal debt with the Treasury. They would also repeal the Fed's authority to make emergency loans to groups of banks and limit the use of mortgages as collateral for loans. The proposals aim to increase the Fed's accountability to Congress and decrease its discretion, potentially reducing its independence somewhat. The Fed's independence from political pressures has been a long-standing issue, with some advocating for more technocratic decision-making while others argue it could lead to undemocratic practices. The proposed bills aim to increase the Fed's accountability to Congress and reduce its discretion, potentially impacting how decisions are made and overseen."
