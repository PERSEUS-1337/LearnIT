    "content": "Enrollees seeking health insurance may need to pay monthly premiums or enrollment fees, which are generally prohibited under traditional Medicaid. Nominal fees, ranging from $1 to $19 per month based on income, can be collected from specific groups like families transitioning from welfare to work or pregnant women with income exceeding 150% of the federal poverty level. Premiums can be higher for certain groups, such as those with high medical expenses qualifying for Medicaid. States may also implement monthly fees for individuals using the \"spend down\" method to meet financial eligibility thresholds. Under the DRA authority, Medicaid recipients can have their eligibility thresholds adjusted by deducting medical expenses from income, known as the \"spend down\" method. Cost-sharing is uncapped for workers with disabilities and income up to 250% FPL, while premiums cannot exceed 7.5% of income for other workers with disabilities and income between 250% and 450% FPL. Premiums exceeding nominal amounts can be charged to certain groups covered by Medicaid waivers. Premiums are prohibited for individuals with income under 100% FPL and between 100% to 150% FPL, as well as specific groups like children, pregnant women, and individuals with special needs. For those with income above 150% FPL, there are no limits on the amount of premiums that may be charged. Under the DRA authority, Medicaid recipients can have their eligibility thresholds adjusted by deducting medical expenses from income. Premiums are not used under traditional Medicaid, except for workers with disabilities and waiver populations. Among the four states with approval for alternative DRA benefit packages, only Kentucky imposes monthly premiums for certain groups. Beneficiary out-of-pocket payments to providers can take three forms, including deductibles. Coinsurance, copayment, and cost-sharing are terms used in health insurance, with copayments being a fixed dollar amount for services. While deductibles and coinsurance are not common in traditional Medicaid, copayments are applied to certain services and groups. SCHIP is a federal grant that helps cover uninsured children in low-income families, with some states having both Medicaid expansion and separate SCHIP programs. The Appendix provides a comparison of cost-sharing charges under traditional Medicaid, DRA, and SCHIP. Service-related cost-sharing in SCHIP programs is capped at 5% of family income per eligibility period. Traditional Medicaid prohibits cost-sharing for specific groups and services, including children under 18, pregnant women for pregnancy-related services, and emergency services. Nominal copayments are allowed for most other groups and services, ranging from $0.50 to $3. Under the DRA option, copayments for certain groups and services range from $0.50 to $3, with exemptions similar to traditional Medicaid. However, only children covered under mandatory eligibility groups and certain foster care/adoption assistance youth are exempt. SCHIP exempts only American Indian and Alaskan Native children from cost-sharing. Under SCHIP, only American Indian and Alaskan Native children are exempt from cost-sharing. Kentucky is the only state among the four with approval for alternative benefit packages via DRA that includes cost-sharing for participants. Copayments for selected services in Kentucky plans are similar to traditional Medicaid, with a 5% coinsurance charge for non-preferred brand-name drugs and non-emergency care in an ER. The maximum annual out-of-pocket expense per member for health care services and prescriptions in Kentucky plans is $225. Under DRA, the total cost-sharing amount cannot exceed 5% of family income on a quarterly basis in Kentucky. Consequences for non-payment of premiums differ slightly between traditional Medicaid and DRA, with both allowing termination of Medicaid eligibility after 60 days of non-payment. States can apply DRA provisions to specific groups. In Kentucky, Medicaid benefits can be terminated after two months of non-payment of premiums for children in the SCHIP program. Re-enrollment is allowed upon payment of a missed premium, and after 12 months of non-payment, payment of the missed premium is not required for re-enrollment. Working families with transitional Medicaid will lose coverage after two months of missed premiums unless good cause is established. Differences exist between traditional Medicaid and DRA regarding rules for failure to pay service-related cost-sharing. Providers cannot deny care to beneficiaries in traditional Medicaid due to inability to pay, but under DRA, states may allow providers to require payment. Under DRA, states may allow providers to require payment of authorized cost-sharing as a condition of receiving services. P.L. 109-432 exempts individuals in families with income below 100% FPL from the DRA failure to pay rules for both premiums and service-related cost-sharing. Kentucky requires all providers to collect applicable cost-sharing from Medicaid beneficiaries at the time of service delivery or at a later date. Only pharmacy providers can deny services for failure to pay. States must specify consequences for nonpayment of premiums and cost-sharing under SCHIP, including disenrollment protections."
