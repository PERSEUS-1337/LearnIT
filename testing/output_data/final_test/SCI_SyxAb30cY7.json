    "content": "There is an inherent tension between adversarial robustness and standard generalization. Training robust models can be resource-intensive and may reduce standard accuracy. The trade-off between standard accuracy and robustness to adversarial perturbations exists even in simple settings. Robust classifiers learn different feature representations than standard classifiers, aligning better with salient data characteristics and human perception. This phenomenon is observed in deep learning models achieving impressive performance in various domains. Recent advancements in deep learning models have shown impressive performance in various domains. However, these models are often vulnerable to adversarial examples, where small perturbations in input data can lead to erroneous predictions. Despite efforts to build robust models, many proposed methods have been ineffective. Only recently, progress has been made towards empirically demonstrating the robustness of models. Recent advancements in deep learning models have shown impressive performance but are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Progress has been made towards achieving robustness in models, with the cost being computationally expensive training methods and potentially requiring more training data. The goal is to explore the costs and benefits of adversarial robustness. The goal of this work is to explore the trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarially robust accuracy in models. Adversarial training can improve robustness in some cases but may hinder standard accuracy. This trade-off exists even in simple settings due to differences in features learned by optimal classifiers. The study reveals that optimal standard and robust classifiers learn fundamentally different features, even with infinite data. This challenges the belief that classic machine learning tools can learn robust models with sufficient data, highlighting the need for specialized techniques. Adversarially robust models also exhibit unexpected benefits, such as invariances similar to human vision, leading to features aligned with human perception and easier model interpretability. Robust model embeddings enable clean inter-class interpolations, akin to generative adversarial models. The study shows that adversarially robust models yield clean inter-class interpolations, hinting at a stronger connection between GANs and adversarial robustness. The goal is to train models with low expected adversarial loss, resisting perturbations from adversaries. In this work, the focus is on p-bounded perturbations for inducing misclassification. Adversarial training, known as the most successful approach for building robust models, is motivated by solving the adversarial empirical risk. Different notions of adversarial perturbations have been studied, including rotations, translations, and smooth spatial deformations. The choice of perturbations to use is domain-specific. Adversarial training is an effective approach for robust optimization, involving finding worst-case input perturbations and updating model parameters to reduce loss. However, it comes with drawbacks such as increased training time and potentially requiring more data. Adversarial training is seen as a form of data augmentation, with costs in training time and data requirements. While it can improve model generalization with few samples, as training data increases, the standard accuracy of robust models may drop below that of standard models. Adversarial training is considered the \"ultimate\" form of data augmentation, where the adversarial perturbation set \u2206 is viewed as the invariants a good model should satisfy. This approach suggests that finding the worst-case \u03b4 for training data augmentation can be beneficial for improving model accuracy. In cases with limited training data, adversarial training can help improve standard classifier performance, especially on datasets like MNIST. Adversarial training acts as data augmentation, regularizing the model and improving standard accuracy. However, the positive effect diminishes as more samples are included in the training set. Training with stronger adversaries leads to a decline in standard accuracy. The goal of this work is to explain the trade-off between standard and adversarially robust accuracy. Adversarial training can decrease a model's standard accuracy due to the inherent tension between the two types of accuracy. This phenomenon is not a result of training methods but a consequence of different goals. Theoretical model demonstrating the trade-off between standard and robust accuracy in binary classification tasks. Data model consists of input-label pairs sampled from a distribution. Parameter p quantifies feature-label correlation. Standard classification is easy with moderately correlated features. The distribution is simple to classify with a natural classifier achieving close to 100% accuracy for large d. Weakly correlated features are utilized by the classifier to achieve almost perfect classification. In an adversarial setting, weakly correlated features can be manipulated by an adversary to override the classifier's accuracy, even with a small perturbation. The adversary can shift features towards the wrong class, making them anti-correlated with the correct label. This manipulation can simulate the distribution of features belonging to the wrong class, leading to a decrease in classifier accuracy. In an adversarial setting, weakly correlated features can be manipulated by an adversary to override the classifier's accuracy. The classifier's reliance on non-robust features leads to a trade-off between standard and adversarial accuracy. Any classifier aiming for high accuracy will heavily rely on non-robust features, resulting in low adversarial accuracy. This trade-off is formalized in Theorem 2.1 (Robustness-accuracy trade-off). The bound in Theorem 2.1 shows that a classifier with high standard accuracy will have low robust accuracy against an adversary. For example, if p = 0.95, a classifier with standard accuracy above 1 - \u03b4 will have robust accuracy at most 19\u03b4. The theorem highlights the trade-off between standard and adversarial accuracy, with the standard classifier not necessarily being robust in an infinite data setting. In the context of analyzing the trade-off between standard and adversarial accuracy, it is noted that the data distribution itself determines this trade-off, rather than the number of samples available. The assumption is made that a classifier cannot be both robust and very accurate (>99% standard and robust accuracy) in a specific classification task. This challenges the common belief in adversarial ML that humans are perfect classifiers for standard datasets, despite evidence showing otherwise. Humans often have imperfect performance in vision benchmarks and are sometimes outperformed by ML models. Standard ML models may rely on brittle features that humans are naturally invariant to, leading to a decrease in performance. In an adversarial setting, where high adversarial accuracy is the goal, the training procedure needs to be modified. Linear classifiers trained using the soft-margin SVM loss exhibit this phenomenon. In an adversarial setting, soft-margin SVM classifiers with unit weight norm achieve high standard accuracy (>99%) and low adversarial accuracy (<1%) against an \u221e-bounded adversary. Adversarial training is crucial for robust models, as simply optimizing standard accuracy leads to poor robust accuracy. The choice of soft-margin SVM classifiers and a constant value of 0.975 is for mathematical convenience, but the results can be adapted to other settings. The analysis shows that standard training produces classifiers relying on weakly correlated features with the correct label. Adversarial examples created by perturbing features in the direction of -y transfer across classifiers trained on independent distributions. Gradients are more interpretable for adversarially trained networks compared to standard networks. The study compares the sparsity of gradients in \u221e -trained models versus 2 -trained models for standard networks. Additional visualizations show the trade-off between standard accuracy and robustness. Empirical examination on MNIST dataset reveals a qualitatively similar behavior, indicating the transferability phenomenon. The study compares the sparsity of gradients in \u221e -trained models versus 2 -trained models for standard networks. In FIG6 (b) in Appendix E, the standard classifier assigns weight to weakly-correlated features, while the robust classifier does not beyond a certain threshold. Training a standard model with only well-correlated features improves standard accuracy but reduces robustness. Robust and standard models may rely on different feature sets, leading to decreased standard accuracy for robust models. Robust models exhibit decreased standard accuracy due to reliance on different feature sets. Robust training embeds invariances in a model, aligning it more with human vision. Loss gradients in input space align well with human perception, supporting the view that robust models learn features that are invariant to perturbations. The gradients of the loss with respect to individual features are visualized for adversarial examples in both standard and robust models. The images produced for robust models effectively capture salient data characteristics and align well with perceptually relevant features of the input image. In contrast, gradients for standard networks show no coherent patterns. The gradients of standard networks appear noisy, while robust models exhibit interpretable information in their gradients. Adversarial training may align models better with human perception. Further investigation is needed to explore this phenomenon. The study investigates how adversarial examples of standard and robust models appear visually by using Projected Gradient Descent. Adversarial perturbations for robust models tend to exhibit salient characteristics of another class, unlike standard models. The study explores how adversarial examples for robust models differ visually from standard models. Adversarial perturbations for robust models show characteristics of another class, indicating that gradient changes lead to meaningful image transformations between classes. Smooth cross-class interpolations via gradient descent produce perceptually plausible transitions between classes. The study suggests that the similarity between inter-class trajectories and GAN interpolations may be due to the saddle point problem. Future research should explore utilizing the loss landscape of robust models for smooth class interpolation. BID18 provides upper bounds on classifier robustness and shows a trade-off between standard and robust accuracy. Their work also touches on robust and non-robust features. In their work, Ross & Doshi-Velez (2017) propose regularizing the gradient of the classifier to improve interpretability and create targeted adversarial examples. Recent research has focused on proving upper bounds on classifier robustness, showing a trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness. This trade-off highlights the challenge of achieving both goals simultaneously in model generalization. The analysis explains the trade-off between standard and robust models, emphasizing the need for robust training methods. Adversarial robustness has unexpected benefits, with robust models learning features aligned with salient data characteristics. This alignment is due to adversarial perturbations encoding a prior for human perception, leading to classifiers that are invariant to input modifications. Robust models yield clean feature interpolations. The study highlights the connection between GANs and adversarial robustness, emphasizing the need for further research to understand the costs and benefits of each notion. Adversarial training on the MNIST dataset focuses on \"5\" and \"7\" labeled examples, while on the ImageNet dataset, a subset of semantically similar classes is used due to computational challenges. The study categorizes ImageNet classes into 8 super-classes for training and evaluation. Different models are used, including a linear classifier for Binary MNIST, a simple convolution architecture for MNIST, a standard ResNet model for CIFAR-10, and a ResNet-50 architecture for Restricted ImageNet. The study uses a ResNet-50 BID25 architecture from the tensorpack repository for ImageNet classification. Adversarial training against a PGD adversary is conducted with perturbations in p norm where p = {2, \u221e}. Larger perturbations were allowed for generated images in FIG2. The study conducted adversarial training against a PGD adversary using ResNet-50 BID25 architecture for ImageNet classification. Smaller values of \u03b5 were found to ensure reliance on robust features. Including unperturbed examples in training batches slightly improved standard accuracy but decreased robust accuracy. An adversary with \u03b5 = 2\u03b7 can change feature distribution to reflect a different label. The study focused on adversarial training against a PGD adversary using ResNet-50 BID25 architecture for ImageNet classification. Adversarial accuracy can be reduced by using information from features that improve standard accuracy. An adversary with \u03b5 = 2\u03b7 can change feature distribution to reflect a different label, impacting classifier accuracy. The study explores adversarial training against a PGD adversary using ResNet-50 BID25 architecture for ImageNet classification. Adversarial accuracy can be influenced by changing feature distribution to reflect a different label, impacting classifier accuracy. The standard accuracy of the classifier is crucial, and the adversarial accuracy is bounded based on probabilities and assumptions made in the study. The optimal solution assigns equal weight to features x i due to symmetry. By swapping values of w i and w j, an alternative set of parameters \u0175 with the same loss function value is obtained. Averaging w * and \u0175 does not increase the margin term value, leading to a contradiction as the regularization loss is smaller for the average point. The optimal solution assigns equal weight to features xi due to symmetry. By replacing features with their sum, a new parameterization is defined. The optimal classifier will assign at least as much weight to a combined feature as it does to a single feature. The optimal classifier assigns more weight to a combined feature than to a single feature, contradicting its optimality. The behavior of the classifier depends entirely on z, with z being at least y with high probability. The behavior of the classifier in the soft-margin SVM depends entirely on z. The standard accuracy is at least 99%, and an adversary can control the prediction with an accuracy of at most 1%. Adversarial training for classification tasks with \u03b5 > 2\u03b7 results in a classifier that relies solely on the first feature, assigning 0 weight to features x i for i \u2265 2. This classifier will have standard and adversarial accuracy of p against any \u03b5 < 1. The classifier relies solely on the first feature for \u03b5 > 2\u03b7, with a standard and adversarial accuracy of p against any \u03b5 < 1. The proof of the theorem highlights the trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness, based on robust and non-robust features. The correlation of a feature with the true label is crucial for standard classification in linear classifiers. In the adversarial setting, feature correlation is crucial for classification. A threshold on feature correlations is imposed by the threat model, affecting the use of features in robust models. Visualizing correlations in the MNIST dataset shows standard classifiers using weakly-correlated pixels for prediction confidence, while robust classifiers do not rely on such features. The robust classifier assigns weight based on strong correlations, while the standard model assigns weight even to weakly correlated pixels. In settings with limited data, non-robust features may arise from noise. Adversarially trained networks focus on a small number of strongly-correlated features for performance. The analysis explores the trade-off between predictive power and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in training robust classifiers with standard methods. By sorting features based on correlation with the label and training only on the most robust ones, a balance is found between accuracy and robustness. This raises the question of whether insights from this approach can be used to train robust classifiers without adversarial training. The analysis focuses on the trade-off between predictive power and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in training robust classifiers. By incorporating non-robust features in training, standard accuracy increases at the expense of robustness. Interestingly, using few robust features can lead to better robustness than adversarial training. This suggests a potentially more effective method for training robust networks in certain scenarios. Additionally, the study provides lower bounds for all classifiers learned in this statistical setting, offering insights different from previous works on adversarial robustness. In a study on adversarially robust generalization, it was found that achieving perfect standard accuracy can lead to perfect adversarial robustness in certain settings. There is a trade-off between standard and adversarial accuracy, with a focus on the importance of adversarial training. Previous research has shown a connection between robustness and generalization, indicating that robustness can imply generalization in some cases. In certain cases, robustness can imply generalization, as shown by recent studies. Lower bounds on robustness have been proven, but they do not fully capture the benefits of robust optimization in improving adversarial robustness. Recent work has highlighted the importance of distinguishing between robust and non-robust features in enhancing adversarial training. Results show that feature weights depend on fewer input features, similar to FIG6. Targeted adversarial attacks on naturally trained RBF classifiers on MNIST resemble images of the target class. Empirical observations reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness in standard models across different deep architectures on ImageNet. For extreme multi-label problems, 1-regularization is beneficial for classes with few examples but harmful for classes with more samples. Adversarial training in the low-data regime acts similarly to data augmentation, aiding generalization in some cases, especially on MNIST. In the low-data regime, adversarial training acts like data augmentation and aids generalization, particularly on MNIST. The standard accuracy of robust models is lower than that of standard models with sufficient training data, supporting theoretical analysis. Adversarially trained networks show more interpretable gradients aligning with relevant features. For MNIST, blue and red pixels represent positive and negative gradient regions. For CIFAR10 and Restricted ImageNet, pixels are clipped to 3 standard deviations and scaled to [0, 1]."
