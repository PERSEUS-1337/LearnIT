    "content": "The \"New Skills for New Jobs Act\" allows for federal matching payments for state new jobs training tax credits. The \"New Skills for New Jobs Act\" authorizes the Treasury Secretary to make quarterly payments to eligible community colleges based on new job tax withholding matches for trainees. Eligible community colleges are defined as public higher education institutions. The \"New Skills for New Jobs Act\" authorizes payments to eligible community colleges based on new job tax withholding matches for trainees. Eligible community colleges must award majority 2-year associate's degrees, be located in a state with a new jobs training tax credit program, and participate in the program through a contract meeting specific requirements. The State new jobs training tax credit program is established by a state government and involves contracts between eligible community colleges, employers, and trainees for state income tax benefits. The State income taxes withheld by the employer for eligible trainees will be remitted to the community college for education provided. This payment will be treated as if it had been remitted to the State for income taxes owed by the trainee. The contract between an eligible community college and an employer must meet state program requirements and provide qualified training to designated individuals. The eligible community college must not charge tuition or fees to individuals. The employer must hire them for full-time employment within the State, paying a wage of at least 175 percent of the Federal minimum wage or the State program amount. The employer will also remit State income taxes withheld on behalf of the individuals. For qualified training under this section, the employer must remit State income taxes withheld on behalf of individuals to the community college for training costs. The training contract must specify the total cost of training, including equipment and materials, at market standards. Qualified training provides education or skills necessary for individuals. Qualified training under this section includes education or skills necessary for employment, obtaining required licenses, certificates aligned with industry standards, and must be for a new job. To qualify for a State new jobs training tax credit program, employers must show that eligible trainees are hired for new jobs, not recalled, replacement, or existing within the past year. To qualify for a State new jobs training tax credit program, employers must hire eligible trainees for new jobs that result in a net increase in employment. Only U.S. employees at job sites in the United States are considered for this credit. Aggregation rules apply for determining eligibility. Employers participating in a State new jobs training tax credit program may collaborate with local workforce investment boards to recruit individuals for training. An eligible trainee is someone who has received qualified training through an eligible community college under the program. The State new jobs training tax credit program allows employers to hire full-time employees from eligible community colleges in the same State, meeting wage and job requirements. Appropriations are made to support the program's implementation. The employer's remission of State income tax withholdings to an eligible community college is not considered as payment for training or education. Instead, it is treated as if the amount had been remitted to the State for income taxes owed by the employee. Additionally, payments made with respect to an eligible trainee, including withheld State income tax and payments under subsection (a), have specific tax treatment. The amount of payment made under subsection (a) is treated as income of the eligible trainee for tax purposes. These amounts are also considered as payments for State income taxes when determining deductions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
