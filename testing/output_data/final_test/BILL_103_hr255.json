Congress finds that public confidence in the Social Security program has been undermined by political debates, causing concern for working and young Americans regarding the program's stability and future benefits. Congress finds that under current projections, the surplus income for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program will grow significantly by 2025. A reserve of three and one-third years of outlays would be excessive and unnecessary, totaling over $1 trillion. The purposes of this Act are to ensure the program's viability and certainty, and to limit social security taxes. To limit social security taxes, ensure program viability, and maintain an appropriate reserve, taxes should not exceed current obligations plus a necessary reserve. After 1994, floating OASDI tax rates were implemented to ensure program viability and maintain an appropriate reserve. The tax rate on employees' income for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is determined based on a percentage of wages received during a calendar year. The rate was 6.2 percent for wages received in 1994 and varies for subsequent years based on the prior year's percentage. The tax rate on employees' income for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is determined based on a percentage of wages received during a calendar year. The rate varies depending on the OASDI trust fund reserve percentage, with specific rules applying if the reserve is at least 60 percent. The tax rate on employees' income for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is determined based on a percentage of wages received during a calendar year. The percentage is calculated based on the OASDI trust fund reserve percentage, with specific rules applying if the reserve is less than 55 percent. The tax rate on employers for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is amended based on the OASDI trust fund reserve percentage, with specific rules if the reserve falls below 55 percent. An excise tax is imposed on employers based on the wages paid to individuals in their employ, with the percentage determined annually. The tax rate is 6.2 percent for wages paid in 1994 and varies for subsequent years based on the prior year's percentage, subject to certain conditions. The OASDI trust fund reserve must meet certain percentage thresholds for the excise tax to apply to wages paid in a calendar year after 1994. The excise tax applies to wages paid in a calendar year if the OASDI trust fund reserve on September 30 of the prior year is less than 55.0 percent of the total trust fund expenditures during the fiscal year. The self-employment tax rate for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance is determined annually based on a percentage of self-employment income. The percentage is calculated by adding the prior year's percentage to 0.4 percent. The self-employment tax rate for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance is determined annually based on a percentage of self-employment income. The percentage is calculated by adding the prior year's percentage to 0.4 percent, with specific percentages outlined for different taxable years. The self-employment tax rate for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance is determined annually based on a percentage of self-employment income. The percentage is calculated by adding the prior year's percentage to 0.4 percent, with specific percentages outlined for different taxable years. If the OASDI trust fund reserve meets certain criteria, the percentage for self-employment income will be determined accordingly. The self-employment tax rate for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance is determined annually based on a percentage of self-employment income. If the OASDI trust fund reserve is less than 55.0 percent, a specific percentage is applied to self-employment income for that taxable year. The self-employment tax rate for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance is determined annually based on a percentage of self-employment income. The percentage is calculated by adding the prior year's percentage determined under this subsection with 0.8 percent. The OASDI trust fund reserve is defined as the sum of the balances in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund on September 30 of any calendar year. The OASDI trust fund expenditures refer to the total amount paid from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for authorized purposes, excluding certain transfer payments. The OASDI Trust Fund Reserve is the total balance in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund on September 30 of any calendar year. The OASDI Trust Fund Expenditures refer to the total amount paid from these funds for authorized purposes during any fiscal year. Expenditures during a fiscal year include payments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for authorized purposes, excluding transfer payments between the funds. The amendments made by this section apply to wages received and paid after 1993 and self-employment income starting after December 31, 1993."
