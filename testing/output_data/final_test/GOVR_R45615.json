    "content": "International trophy hunting is a lucrative industry practiced worldwide, involving the killing of animals for recreational trophies. U.S. citizens import a significant number of wildlife trophies, including rare and endangered species from Africa, Asia, and South America, sparking controversy over conservation efforts. Trophy hunting is debated for its impact on conservation, ethics, and local economies. Supporters argue it can fund conservation efforts and benefit communities, while critics warn of species decline and corruption in conservation funding. Killing animals for sport is seen as unethical by some. The effects of international trophy hunting on species are challenging to determine due to lack of data. Limited data can misrepresent the number of trophies harvested, corruption can blur the route of money from hunters to conservation efforts, and a lack of information on conservation plans can raise questions about their effectiveness. Teasing out the effects of trophy hunting from other factors that affect a species is also difficult from a scientific perspective. Measuring the effects of trophy hunting on wildlife populations is challenging due to various factors affecting species viability, such as habitat alteration, prey availability, genetic makeup, climate change, poaching, and hunting. Many scientific studies lack sufficient data to accurately measure the impact of hunting on species, with some reporting that unregulated hunting has contributed to declines in certain populations. For example, in the 1980s, hunting was linked to the decline of the dorcas gazelle. Trophy hunting has reportedly contributed to the decline of the dorcas gazelle and the Nubian bustard in Sahelian Africa. Congressional interest in international trophy hunting of rare species like African lions, elephants, and rhinoceroses has been sparked by the killing of Cecil the lion in 2015. The United States, as the largest importer of sport-hunted trophies, plays a significant role in shaping policy related to trophy hunting. Congress can address the import of wildlife trophies into the United States and indirectly influence trophy-hunting practices in range countries through laws and regulations. Various bills and oversight of the Endangered Species Act and CITES have been used to address international trophy hunting. Trump Administration policies, such as evaluating permits for importing sport-hunted trophies on a case-by-case basis, have increased congressional interest in trophy hunting. The Trump Administration changed the evaluation process for permits to import sport-hunted trophies on a case-by-case basis. They also established the International Wildlife Conservation Council to advise on the benefits of U.S. citizens hunting overseas. This report discusses the history and scope of international trophy hunting in the United States, relevant laws and agreements, and potential issues for Congress to consider. It does not cover domestic trophy hunting. Sport hunting has ancient origins, with some historians tracing it back to Ancient Egypt and the Middle Ages. Sport hunting has ancient origins, with game parks in the Persian Empire and unregulated hunting in the Middle Ages. Restrictions on hunting began in the Middle Ages, leading to the creation of game reserves in the 18th and 19th centuries. Teddy Roosevelt practiced sport hunting for conservation and recreation purposes. In 1909, a hunting expedition in British-controlled East Africa and Sudan led to the shooting or trapping of nearly 11,000 animals, including hippopotamuses, elephants, and white rhinoceroses. The Smithsonian Institution funded the expedition, with many specimens deposited into the Smithsonian Natural History Museum. Sport hunting in the 20th century has contributed to conservation efforts, such as in the United States through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937. Trophy hunting in Africa originated during colonial settlement, with foreign hunters exploiting the continent for ivory and hides. The practice evolved with the expansion of railway systems, combining sport hunting with the wildlife trade to generate funds. British authorities encouraged trophy hunting in the 19th century to promote agricultural expansions. Tourist trophy hunting began in Kenya in the 20th century and spread throughout Africa. Trophy hunting, which began in Africa during colonial settlement, evolved with the expansion of railway systems. It is seen as a mechanism for conservation and development, generating millions of dollars annually through trophy fees and tourism. The largest community of international trophy hunters is from the United States. The United States is the largest importer of animal trophies, importing over 10 times more than China. CITES-listed species are hunted for trophies, with Africa being the most popular destination. Trophy imports of CITES-listed species into the US exceed other top importing countries combined. In South Africa and Namibia, the most exported mammalian trophies listed under CITES are lions, lechwe, certain species of zebra, and leopards. The big five animals of trophy hunting in Africa are lions, white rhinoceroses, elephants, leopards, and buffalo, known for their difficulty in hunting and high trophy fees. The big five animals in Africa are notable for their high trophy fees, with hunters paying up to $350,000. Many African countries rely on trophy-hunting revenue from these species. The United States is the largest importer of sport-hunted trophies, influencing international sport hunting through its policies. U.S. hunters mainly import trophies from Canada and South Africa, including CITES-listed species like snow geese, mallards, and black bears. International sport hunting is regulated through laws of the range country, the country importing trophies, and international agreements. Hunters must consider regulations of all three entities and apply for permits to hunt and transport trophies. The most common species imported into the United States are the snow goose, mallard, and black bear, with most trophies coming from Canada. Black bears and Sandhill cranes are the most imported CITES-listed species with permits, mainly from Canada. International trophy hunting can be regulated through international agreements like CITES, which lists and categorizes wildlife species based on their threat level from trade. CITES has three appendixes, with Appendix I species facing extinction primarily due to trade, Appendix II species requiring controlled trade to prevent population declines, and Appendix III species subject to regulation by individual countries. CITES regulates international trophy hunting through permit and quota systems to prevent population declines of Appendix II species. The United States implements CITES under ESA, requiring import and export permits for trophies of threatened wildlife. Trophy imports of CITES-listed species under Appendixes I and II are subject to strict regulations. The import of trophies of CITES-listed species under Appendixes I and II is regulated through a quota system to ensure no harm to the population. Non-detriment findings (NDFs) are required for Appendix I and II species, made by the designated CITES Scientific Authority of the importing country. FWS serves as the United States' Scientific Authority for CITES-listed species. The CITES Secretariat may not have complete information on how range countries establish quotas for exporting species. The CITES Secretariat receives reports from range countries on setting quotas for species like African elephant, cheetah, black rhinoceros, and lion trophies. Trade suspensions can occur if trade is detrimental to species survival or if countries lack necessary legislation. Currently, 29 countries face species-specific trade suspension resolutions. The EU governs international trophy hunting through the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations (WTR), implementing CITES to protect species by regulating trade and authorizing permits. Trade suspensions can occur for countries lacking necessary legislation, with 29 countries currently facing species-specific trade suspension resolutions. The EU Wildlife Trade Regulations (WTR) govern international trophy hunting, implementing CITES classifications. The permit system addresses sport-hunted trophies and includes regulations for species like polar bears, African elephants, and African lions. Member states can enforce stricter policies than the EU, such as Germany's heavier review for CITES Appendix I species without quotas. The EU regulations also allow the European Commission to restrict entry of species, with some species like the West African seahorse prohibited from entering the EU. The EU wildlife trade regulations are stricter than CITES regulations, with Annex A containing stricter regulations for trade. Annex B species require both import and export permits, while CITES Appendix II species only need an export permit. The EU system complies with CITES, allowing parties to have stricter laws. Hunting and killing of animals are regulated by laws of the range country, which vary. Trophy hunting regulations in range countries vary, with some countries implementing annual quotas, designated hunting ranges, and permit systems, while others have outright bans. Thirteen range countries currently ban trophy hunting, and some countries like Romania and Holland prohibit imports of sport-hunted trophies. In the United States, international trophy hunting is governed by the ESA, which implements CITES and is administered by FWS, regulating what can be imported into the country. The import of trophies into the United States is regulated by the FWS based on the status of the species. Most trophies come through designated ports of entry and require a declaration. Permits from FWS and the range country may be necessary for species listed under CITES or ESA. An enhancement-of-survival permit is needed for endangered species listed under ESA. When evaluating permits to import trophies, FWS considers the sustainability of the species, enforcement of laws, and accountability in the range country. The process aims to ensure the survival of the species. The FWS evaluates permit applications for importing trophies by considering a hunter's actions, including antipoaching activities and meat distribution to local communities. They review country data and conservation programs to streamline permit issuance. FWS makes non-detriment findings under CITES to facilitate permit issuance for importing trophies of listed species. A recent policy change by FWS has altered the process for evaluating enhancement-of-survival criteria and issuing permits for sport-hunted trophies. The FWS issued a memorandum withdrawing ESA enhancement-of-survival findings and CITES NDFs for several species globally. Permit applications will now be evaluated on a case-by-case basis using information from range countries to ensure conservation efforts. It is unclear if permit applications will be made public or if specific criteria will be used for evaluations. These changes were influenced by a District of Columbia Court of Appeals opinion. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals found that FWS did not follow rulemaking requirements for issuing enhancement-of-survival permits under ESA. International trophy hunting controversies involve ecological, ethical, and economic considerations. Studies show trophy hunting can benefit species with proper management but can be harmful with poor management. This section will analyze ecological and economic factors affected by trophy hunting. Trophy hunting can impact species populations through factors like rate of offtake, genetic consequences, traits of hunted individuals, and ecosystem effects. High rates of hunting have led to declines in African lions, American cougars, and possibly African leopards. Hunting combined with other factors can further contribute to population declines. Some African countries have adopted age-restricted hunting regulations to combat population declines in animals like elephants. Studies suggest that allowing the hunting of older animals could lead to sustainable growth of species populations. Incentives for hunters to adhere to age restrictions include increased quotas in countries like Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Hunting rates are also linked to the rarity of the species. Some scientists believe that hunting rates are correlated to the rarity of species. The Anthropogenic Allee (AA) Effect is introduced to explain why interest in trophy hunting increases as a species becomes rare. Managed trophy hunting with scientifically determined quotas, monitoring, and enforcement can have few negative effects on wildlife populations. However, trophy hunting of individuals in small populations could reduce the gene pool and increase the chance of inbreeding. Trophy hunting in small populations can reduce gene pool, increase inbreeding, and allow less vigorous males to breed. Managing hunting with accurate quotas and monitoring is crucial to avoid genetic and evolutionary consequences for the population and species. Targeting only certain genders or traits can impact future generations' genetic diversity and population viability. Trophy hunting can have genetic effects on populations, such as inbreeding and reduced reproductive rates. Scientists suggest managing hunting with accurate quotas and targeting specific animals to mitigate these effects. For example, one recommendation is to take one lion per 2,000 square kilometers in Africa to maintain population densities. Restricting trophy hunting to older male lions allows younger males to reproduce and preserves genetic diversity. Trophy hunting can impact population viability by causing lower growth rates and diminished reproduction, as seen in brown bears in Alberta, Canada. Male takeovers in lion prides due to hunting can lead to dispersal of subadults and injury to remaining males. Management techniques like specifying which individual to hunt and monitoring populations are suggested to mitigate these issues. Trophy hunting can contribute to biodiversity and habitat conservation in range countries by maintaining pristine environments for game animals. Managed hunting lands protect animals from poaching and increase biodiversity, potentially preventing conversion to lower biodiversity rangelands for livestock production. Some critics argue that managed hunting grounds may not ensure the recovery of threatened or endangered animal populations. They raise concerns about artificial alterations to ecosystems, such as introducing exotic species and reducing predators of trophy animals. Fenced hunting ranges could fragment habitats and impact the migration of non-hunted species, but they may also protect animals from poaching. Ethical issues surrounding trophy hunting, such as paying to kill animals for trophies, add to the debate on its conservation benefits. Some critics argue that trophy hunting is unethical and objectifies animals, questioning its role in conservation. Supporters believe it can increase the value of certain animals and aid in population conservation. Ethical concerns also arise in captive hunting, where fair chase is questioned. Some hunters believe fair chase is achieved if the enclosure is large enough for animals to roam a certain distance. Critics of trophy hunting also raise ethical concerns about shooting animals from vehicles and using baits. Research on trophy hunting operations and their economic impact is limited and varies by region. Trophy hunting can be a lucrative business globally, generating billions of dollars in the United States and Europe, and over $200 million annually in Africa. Reported revenue data accuracy is questioned due to varying estimates. Some question the accuracy of reported revenue data and methodology used in aggregating it across countries. Trophy hunting in developing nations with high poverty rates may have a larger impact due to low base income. Proponents argue that trophy hunting is economically viable in areas unsuitable for ecotourism. Critics argue that trophy hunting does not significantly impact GDP as supporters claim, with revenue making up only 1.8% of overall tourism revenues in some African countries. A 2009 study by the IUCN criticized big-game hunting in West Africa as financially inefficient. Trophy hunting in Africa generates smaller economic returns compared to agriculture or livestock breeding. Studies show that hunting revenue may not provide enough benefits to incentivize conservation efforts, especially for carnivores like leopards. Some argue that trophy hunting benefits local communities by creating jobs and funding community services. The literature discusses how trophy hunting can provide economic benefits for local communities through benefit-sharing arrangements. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) aims to involve local communities in wildlife management decisions and increase financial benefits. The Communal Areas Management Plan for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) program in Zimbabwe generated over $20 million, mostly from trophy hunting, allowing communities to manage habitat and resources. Trophy hunting generates income for local communities and wildlife management, with 49% going to communities, 20% to wildlife management, and 31% to administrative projects. However, researchers highlight that the revenue reaching local communities is minimal, with less than 3% in Cameroon, 12% in Zambia, and limited impact in Tanzania. In Tanzania, approximately 3% of trophy hunting revenue is allocated to \"area and community development,\" raising uncertainty about funds going to species conservation. Some areas, like Zambia's ADMADE program, direct a higher percentage of revenues to local communities, with 67% going to game management areas and 53% to wildlife management. Botswana and Namibia also have examples of locally accruing trophy-hunting revenue. Scientists evaluated safari hunting's economic contributions to rural livelihoods in Botswana, documenting various benefits. The distribution of safari hunting benefits in Botswana villages was found to be fairly equitable among households. There is no consensus on whether international trophy hunting is an effective conservation tool, with stakeholders calling for more data on species response and revenue management. Proponents argue that trophy hunting can be a conservation tool if managed sustainably and based on science. Some argue that trophy hunting can contribute to conservation if managed sustainably and governed by laws that allocate hunting fees for conservation programs. Benefits include incentivizing land managers to conserve species, protecting them from poaching, and managing populations sustainably. Additionally, trophy hunting efforts can lead to the protection and management of rangelands that support wildlife in the ecosystem. Trophy hunting can benefit local communities and wildlife conservation efforts through tourism frameworks, economic incentives, and funding for wildlife management and community development projects. Critics argue against trophy hunting. Critics question the effectiveness of trophy hunting management, citing concerns about corruption and misuse of funds for conservation. Corruption may lead to local people aiding poachers and diverting funds away from conservation efforts. The mismanagement of trophy hunting in Tanzania has led to a decline in lion populations due to a lack of community involvement and unsustainable offtake rates. Critics argue that funds are not being used for conservation purposes, and some quotas for hunting animals are not based on scientific information. Some hunting quotas lack scientific basis, fail to specify which animals can be hunted, and may lead to negative genetic and social consequences. Uncoordinated hunting in undefined areas can result in overhunting and other negative effects on populations. Fenced hunting areas can disrupt ecosystems and critics argue that local communities may not benefit from trophy hunting revenues. Critics argue that local communities may not receive revenues from trophy hunting, leading to alienation and difficulties in maintaining and monitoring hunted species. Some communities in Tanzania claim hunting organizations do not pay the agreed 5% revenue share. Stakeholders suggest using alternative methods like birdwatching and safari for generating income from natural resources. International trophy hunting is a concern for Congress due to its recreational nature, impact on wildlife, constituent interest, relevance to laws regulating trade of endangered animals, and ethical considerations. The Trump Administration and Congress have addressed international trophy hunting through laws and regulations. The International Wildlife Conservation Council provides recommendations on U.S. trophy hunting. Congress's role is limited by jurisdiction overseas, affecting hunting quotas, conservation efforts, and revenue flow. Some experts suggest that the US Congress could play a role in incentivizing range countries and hunters to collect more data on the effects of trophy hunting on wildlife populations and revenue distribution. This could be done through providing overseas development assistance and grants for NGOs to conduct studies on the matter. Some suggest that international organizations like CITES could require range countries to monitor trophy hunting's impact on wildlife populations and revenue distribution. This could involve long-term monitoring of hunted species and assessing how hunting affects local communities. For example, CITES collects data on African elephants through programs like Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants to improve monitoring and conservation efforts. Some suggest that a program similar to Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants could be used to monitor trophy hunting of iconic species like African lions, pangolins, and leopards. Critics argue that limited resources and incentives hinder range countries from collecting accurate data on trophy hunting, raising concerns about falsified data and corruption in revenue distribution. Some suggest that data accuracy and corruption in trophy hunting should be addressed by ensuring transparency and identification of data for regulatory actions. Congress can regulate international trophy hunting by U.S. hunters through permits for importing trophies, which vary based on species status. Currently, FWS evaluates permit applications on a case-by-case basis, but the standards and methodology used are unclear. Advocates may propose legislation directing the Secretary of the Interior to establish specific evaluation standards. The Secretary of the Interior may create standards for evaluating trophy-import permits, aiming to increase information on hunted species' condition. Some argue for consistent criteria to assess permits, like those used by ESA or CITES, to streamline the process. Permit applications and decisions being made public could enhance oversight. However, some stakeholders believe a uniform approach may not be suitable for all species or hunting operations. Some stakeholders propose a third-party certification system to evaluate hunting operations for trophy imports. The system would include standards like transparency in funding, support for local communities, equitable hunting concessions, and a quota system for animals. This certification could address concerns about data reliability and ensure best practices are followed in hunting operations. A standardized certification system for evaluating hunting operations includes provisions for a moratorium on hunting to replenish species in the wild. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has established principles for sustainable trophy hunting, such as biological sustainability, conservation benefits, socioeconomic benefits, adaptive management, and effective governance. Certification systems, like the Forest Stewardship Council for wood, ensure that resources come from well-managed sources. The Forest Stewardship Council and Sustainable Forest Initiative offer certification programs for well-managed forests. SFI certification in North America covers 120 million hectares without a chain-of-custody requirement. Congress debates the benefits of international trophy hunting and the potential for alternative forms of hunting in enclosed ranges to control wildlife populations. Captive hunting, also known as canned hunting, involves hunting animals within private game ranches. This practice is controversial, with proponents arguing it guarantees hunting success, drives conservation, and allows for easier population management. Critics believe it is unethical as animals have no chance of escape, detracting from the sport of hunting. Captive hunting, also known as canned hunting, is a controversial practice involving hunting animals within private game ranches. Critics argue that it goes against the concept of fair chase and does not contribute to conservation efforts. In South Africa, over 80%-90% of lions hunted are believed to be captive, with a significant number of trophies exported to the United States and the EU. This raises concerns about the ethical treatment of animals and the impact on wild populations. In South Africa, captive lion trophies are exported to the United States and the EU. Some want to ban hunting captive-bred lions, while others argue it's a lucrative industry creating jobs. Captive breeding of ESA-listed species for trophy hunting also occurs in the US, with ranchers obtaining permits for limited killing to aid in species reintroduction. Limited trophy hunting of captive-bred populations could potentially reduce hunting pressure in the wild. Trophy hunting of captive-bred populations, such as the scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle, is allowed in the United States under ESA exemptions to generate funds for captive breeding. Congress could regulate permits for importing trophies from captive hunting operations or ban trophy hunting altogether, leaving the decision to the range country. Several countries have already banned trophy hunting. Several countries have banned trophy hunting, with arguments for and against the ban. Proponents believe banning hunting could benefit wildlife populations through alternative forms of tourism. Opponents argue that trophy hunting supports biodiversity and conservation efforts, with bans leading to lower revenues for conservation and communities. They also warn of potential habitat conversion if hunting is banned. Banning trophy hunting in fringe regions can have negative economic effects, as seen in Northern Botswana where the ban led to a 10% GDP decrease. Revenue from hunting expeditions represented two-thirds of total tourism income, and the ban also impacted CBNRM programs due to loss of funding. In some cases, hunting bans have correlated with animal population declines, such as in Kenya where a ban in 1977 resulted in significant declines. In Kenya, wildlife species have declined since the hunting ban in 1977, while livestock numbers, especially sheep and goats, increased by 76.3%. The population also rose from 14.5 million in 1977 to 48.5 million in 2016. Scientists attribute wildlife declines to demographic pressure and livestock encroachment on rangelands."
