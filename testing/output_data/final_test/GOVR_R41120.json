The Internet's impact on culture and commerce grew in the late 1990s with the rise of email, discussion forums, and the World Wide Web. Today, newer tools like blogs, social networks, and video sharing sites are used for political expression, sometimes conflicting with others' opinions. The Internet has become a powerful tool for political expression, often conflicting with government ideologies in closed societies. Governments face a dilemma as they need the Internet for economic growth but also seek to control information flow. Freedom House assesses countries' restrictions on Internet freedom. In Burma, YouTube footage during the 2007 Saffron Revolution exposed human rights violations, sparking international awareness. The Iranian government's violent response to demonstrations in Tehran following the 2009 presidential elections spread globally through live cell phone pictures, emails, and phone calls. Iranians sent Voice of America (VOA) over 300 videos a day during the protests, highlighting the use of technology in political expression. Regimes use various control mechanisms to limit internet usage, including surveillance, censorship, and harassment of users, often with the help of foreign internet companies operating in their countries. Global technology companies face a dilemma when operating in foreign countries, having to choose between following local laws or risking business licenses. Human rights groups criticize companies like Yahoo! and Google for censoring content at the request of host governments. Microsoft is also accused of censorship in China. Yahoo! has been accused of providing user information to Chinese authorities, leading to arrests. Google acknowledges government involvement but emphasizes their products as platforms for free expression and accountability. The Global Online Freedom Act of 2009 (GOFA) aims to combat censorship and protect personal information in repressive countries. Technology can provide a solution to prevent government censorship, with hardware and internet services being neutral elements that can be implemented in various ways. The hardware features used for Internet traffic management can be misused by repressive governments to censor and monitor users. Tailoring Internet services for specific countries is done to comply with local laws, not to enable repression. Under Canadian human rights law, promoting violence against protected groups is illegal, leading Google.ca to remove such links from search results. Internet censorship persists in some countries, with citizens actively developing techniques to circumvent restrictions. Reporters Without Borders identifies 15 countries with restricted Internet freedom, including China, Cuba, and Iran. China serves as a case study for repressive Internet practices. China has the world's largest number of Internet users, with a sophisticated censorship regime. Many Chinese citizens are imprisoned for discussing sensitive topics online. Despite government restrictions, Chinese Internet users can access a vast amount of information. The Chinese government implements strict Internet controls to maintain social stability, targeting harmful content like pornography. They criticize the US for double standards in regulating the Internet domestically while criticizing other countries. The government uses various methods like website blocking and monitoring to control online content and expression. The Chinese government controls Internet content by targeting websites, social networking sites, and file sharing sites, blocking access to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. They employ students to promote pro-government views online and use the Internet for propaganda and surveillance. Despite limitations, the government's selective targeting creates fear and promotes self-censorship among users. The Chinese government restricts information online but faces challenges due to bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs allowing public comment. Despite the ability to block news, the Internet can expose events before censorship. Chinese Internet users use proxy servers to access censored information, and English news sites like the New York Times are available. Public exposure through the Internet has compelled some officials to be more transparent. Some U.S. Internet companies have been criticized for assisting China in restricting information and monitoring users. Congressional hearings have focused on global Internet freedom and the roles of these companies in China's censorship. Companies like Yahoo!, Microsoft, Google, and Cisco Systems have been accused of supporting Chinese censorship efforts. The companies argue that they must follow local laws. Some U.S. Internet companies claim they are not collaborating with the Chinese government or tailoring products for censorship. They argue that despite censorship policies, they are increasing information access in China and other restricted countries, promoting freedom of expression and privacy. Chinese experts suggest that foreign involvement in the Internet has led to greater political freedom, despite ongoing government control attempts. Yahoo! has faced criticism for allegedly aiding in the arrests of Chinese Internet users. Yahoo! was blamed for complicity in the arrests of Chinese Internet users by providing their e-mail account information to Chinese authorities. In a high-profile case in 2004, Yahoo!'s Hong Kong office disclosed the identity of journalist Shi Tao, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for leaking state secrets. Yahoo! later bought a stake in China's Alibaba Group and handed over its operations to the Chinese company. Microsoft also shut down the blog of Chinese political blogger Zhao Jing at the request of the Chinese government. Microsoft faced criticism for cooperating with China's censorship policies, including blocking words like \"democracy\" on MSN Spaces and assisting in the development of the Bing search engine. Google, on the other hand, tried to comply with Chinese regulations while minimizing censorship on its Google.cn search engine, which is the second most popular in China after Baidu. Google has clashed with the Chinese government over censorship and privacy issues since entering the China market in 2005. The government has accused Google of violating laws and enabling access to \"vulgar content.\" In response, Google moved its search records outside of China in 2006 and does not host Gmail and Blogger services in the country to protect user privacy. The Chinese government disrupted Google's services in 2009, seen as a response to Google's resistance to new censorship rules. In response to Google's resistance to new censorship rules, the Chinese government accused Google of copyright infringement and breaking filter laws. Google redirected searches to Google Hong Kong to avoid censorship but Chinese authorities deemed this approach \"unacceptable.\" Google resubmitted a renewal application before its license in China expired in June 2010. The company resubmitted a renewal application in China, proposing a new \"google.cn\" landing page with a link to the uncensored Hong Kong search engine. Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, Nortel, and Alcatel were involved in upgrading China's Internet infrastructure and surveillance systems. Cisco sold routers to facilitate government censorship and technology to the police for data collection. The Chinese government is increasingly concerned about the Internet's impact on society. The Chinese government has shown concern about the Internet's influence on society and politics. In 2009, they mandated the installation of \"Green Dam Youth Escort\" software on all computers sold in China to block harmful content. This move was met with opposition from various groups citing concerns about censorship, software operability, and Internet security. The Chinese government delayed the mandatory installation of \"Green Dam\" software in 2009. Despite this, they continued to tighten controls over Internet content and user registration. New restrictions in December 2009 led to the closure of many websites for violating regulations on pornography, media piracy, and national security threats. The Chinese government's tightening control over Internet content and user registration led to the closure of hundreds of websites, including those focused on entertainment. Restrictions on \".cn\" domain names were imposed, limiting them to registered businesses. Concerns were raised about the impact on Internet activity and content richness. In response, on Internet Human Rights Day in 2009, Chinese intellectuals called for online freedom of opinion, speech, and publication. Google threatened to stop censoring its Chinese search engine due to cyber attacks in December 2009. Google's chief legal officer announced that the company would no longer censor results on Google.cn, potentially shutting down the search engine and its offices in China. Yahoo! also faced Chinese hackers and supported Google's actions, leading to backlash from its PRC partner, Alibaba. Chinese online users were divided on whether Google should stay in China, with some backing Google's challenge to the government while others took a pro-government stance. Google's challenge to the PRC government led to divided opinions among Chinese online users. President Obama expressed support for unrestricted Internet access during his visit to China. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged U.S. Internet companies to oppose censorship overseas and called for transparency in the investigation of cyberattacks on U.S. companies in China. In 2009, cyberattacks on U.S. companies in China were confirmed by Google, leading to tensions with Beijing over Internet policies. The Iranian government has strict Internet controls, with an estimated 23 million users facing extensive filtering and monitoring. The U.S. Department of State's 2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices highlighted Iran's monitoring of Internet communications. The Iranian government monitored Internet communications, especially on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. They threatened, harassed, and arrested individuals critical of the government online, sometimes confiscating passports or arresting family members. Authorities at Tehran International Airport asked citizens to log into their social media accounts and forced them to delete information. The government also restricted Internet speed and technology, making it hard to access blocked websites. After the June election, there was a significant decrease in bandwidth. The Iranian government restricted Internet access and monitored online activities, leading to a drop in bandwidth after the June election. Activists were targeted to prevent them from uploading videos and expressing dissenting views online. Seven bloggers were detained, and online communication is tracked through the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. The freedom of Internet sites and blogs is contested under Iranian law. The Iranian government restricts Internet access and monitors online activities, requiring bloggers to obtain licenses and subjecting content to approval by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Internet speed is limited to 128 kilobytes per second, hindering multimedia downloads. Activists, bloggers, and journalists have been arrested for various charges. Nokia Siemens Network sold communication monitoring equipment to Iran in 2008. The Iranian government purchased communication monitoring equipment from Nokia Siemens Network in 2008. The equipment was used for content inspection following the 2009 presidential election, enabling the government to intensify repression. Critics argue that the technology goes beyond censorship practices of other countries. Following the 2009 Presidential election, the Iranian government increased monitoring and filtering of the Internet, detaining activists and bloggers during post-election unrest. Concerns were raised about Western technology aiding human rights abuses, although Iran also develops its own filtering technologies. Secretary of State addressed global Internet freedom in January 2010. In her January 2010 address on global Internet freedom, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton highlighted the use of technology by brave citizen journalists in Iran to expose government brutality and human rights abuses. Despite government intimidation, these individuals continue to use technology to share the truth with the world and inspire others to stand up for their rights. On February 9, 2010, Iran suspended Google Inc.'s e-mail services ahead of the anniversary of the Iranian Republic, seen as a move to hinder anti-government protests. Google reported a drop in traffic but later restored access, which remains intermittent. Since FY2008, Congress has allocated $50 million to support global Internet freedom, aiming to expand democratic practices and institutions. The State Department uses funding to promote Internet freedom, independent media, and information flow in Iran. The 111th Congress considered Iran-specific Internet freedom measures, including H.Res. 1457 condemning Iran's authoritarian government. The Senate passed resolutions condemning human rights abuses in Iran, supporting peaceful expression and access to the Internet. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act included the \"Victims of Iranian Censorship Act\" which authorized funds for Farsi language programming and dissemination of accurate information to Iranian citizens. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act included provisions to expand Farsi language programming and provide accurate information to the Iranian people through various media platforms. It also established the \"Iranian Electronic Exchange and Media Fund\" to support technology development for access to information and counter Iranian internet censorship efforts. Some U.S. technology firms engage in internet censoring and filtering in response to foreign laws, with examples including China and Iran. Internet censoring in Iran reportedly involves deep packet inspection, a practice under scrutiny in the United States. China's Internet filtering is scrutinized for potential violations of world trade obligations. The importance of Internet freedom to the United States was emphasized in 2006, with a focus on government limitations on internet access and censorship. The internet's role in enabling free expression and information flow was highlighted as a growing concern. The United States emphasizes defending internet freedom and addressing repression with foreign governments. The Global Internet Freedom Task Force was established to respond to violations of internet freedom by repressive regimes. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that internet freedom is a central part of U.S. foreign policy. Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of Internet freedom, advocating for a unified global community with equal access to knowledge and ideas. She highlighted the role of digital platforms in promoting free speech and criticized government censorship. Clinton linked this stance to the U.S. Bill of Rights, asserting America's commitment to supporting online freedom. Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of Internet freedom, advocating for a unified global community with equal access to knowledge and ideas. She highlighted the role of digital platforms in promoting free speech and criticized government censorship. Clinton linked this stance to the U.S. Bill of Rights, asserting America's commitment to supporting online freedom. She argued that these principles were reaffirmed in President Franklin Roosevelt's \"The Four Freedoms\" speech and the United States' support of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Clinton stated that U.S. foreign policy is based on the idea that cooperation benefits all countries, and emphasized the need for the U.S. to seize opportunities for interconnectivity to bring people closer together and expand the global community. The Task Force, co-chaired by Under Secretaries of State, works on issues like international communications, human rights, democratization, business advocacy, and country-specific concerns. It supports Internet freedom by monitoring and reporting on it globally, responding to support it in bilateral and international forums, and expanding access to the Internet in developing countries. In advancing Internet freedom as a U.S. foreign policy objective, Secretary Clinton proposed key initiatives: Continuing State Department's GIFT work in over 40 countries to help individuals bypass censorship, making Internet freedom an issue at the United Nations and U.N. Human Rights Council, collaborating with new partners to enhance \"connection technologies,\" providing grants for communication barriers, illiteracy, and access to information. To support Internet freedom, Secretary Clinton urged U.S. media companies to challenge censorship, supported the Global Network Initiative, and allocated funding from Congress for various programs. The U.S. government supports programs that promote Internet freedom through training, technology, and diplomacy. The Broadcasting Board of Governors allocates $2 million annually to enable access to VOA and other websites in repressive regimes. Concerns have been raised about potential negative consequences for U.S. and foreign companies and nationals in these countries. The U.S. government supports Internet freedom programs through training, technology, and diplomacy. Concerns have been raised about potential repercussions for individuals and companies in repressive regimes not following government dictates. Congress has taken steps to address these concerns, including a hearing on U.S. cyberspace policy in 2010. The U.S. government supports Internet freedom programs through training, technology, and diplomacy. Congress has taken steps to address concerns about Internet freedom, trade, and cyber security issues, including the formation of the House Global Internet Freedom Caucus and the Global Network Initiative (GNI) in response to criticism of technology companies selling to Internet-restricting countries. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) is a coalition of human rights organizations, academics, investors, and technology leaders that adopts a self-regulatory approach to protect individuals' rights to free expression and privacy on the Internet. The initiative provides guidance to the ICT industry on how to protect these rights when faced with government pressures. Participating organizations include Google Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Yahoo! Inc., with each committing $100,000 per year over a two-year start-up period. Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders were involved in the initiative's development. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) involves Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders in its development. Reporters Without Borders remains skeptical about GNI's impact and advocates for written government requests. GNI's Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy are based on international human rights laws. The Implementation Guidelines provide ICT companies with guidance on implementing these Principles. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) involves Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders in its development, with Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy based on international human rights laws. Participating companies commit to transparency and compliance with government demands regarding content removal and access restrictions. Participating companies in the Global Network Initiative commit to transparency and compliance with government demands regarding content removal and access restrictions. They also pledge to assess human rights risks related to personal information and implement mitigation strategies. Independent third-party assessments of company compliance will be phased in over three stages. In Phase Three, independent assessors will review participating companies' internal systems and responses to government demands on freedom of expression or privacy. Each company will submit an annual report to the Organization, and assessors will evaluate their effectiveness. The Organization's Board will assess compliance with the Principles and publish an annual report on each company's compliance. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 includes the Victims of Iranian Censorship Act, expressing support for freedom of speech and condemning censorship in Iran. The Act aims to promote freedom of press, speech, and assembly in Iran and discourage businesses from aiding censorship efforts. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 includes provisions to support freedom of speech in Iran, discourage censorship, and promote the development of technologies to facilitate information sharing and education programs for Iranians. It authorizes appropriations for Farsi language programming and broadcasting improvements to reach the Iranian people through various media channels. Additionally, it establishes the Iranian Electronic Education, Exchange, and Media Fund. Establishes the Iranian Electronic Education, Exchange, and Media Fund in the Treasury to support technology development for Iranian people's freedom of speech and information exchange. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund and requires annual reports to Congress on fund use. Directs the President to investigate claims of non-Iranian companies aiding Iran's online censorship and monitoring activities, with results reported to Congress. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of State for documenting human rights abuses in Iran. H.R. 2271, Global Online Freedom Act of 2009, aims to promote internet freedom and deter U.S. businesses from aiding online censorship in countries like Iran. It calls for international agreements to protect internet freedom and prohibits U.S. businesses from assisting foreign governments in restricting online access. The Global Online Freedom Act of 2009 aims to promote internet freedom by establishing the Office of Global Internet Freedom in the Department of State and prohibiting U.S. businesses from aiding online censorship in foreign countries. The Internet Freedom Act of 2010 authorizes the Attorney General to restrict businesses from complying with disclosure requests from Internet-restricting countries. It requires U.S. businesses to report Internet censorship information to the OGIF and prohibits them from jamming U.S.-supported websites in these countries. The President can waive provisions for specific reasons. Introduced by Representative Wu, the bill directs the National Science Foundation to establish Internet Freedom. The Internet Freedom Act of 2010 establishes the Internet Freedom Foundation to develop technologies to combat Internet censorship. It will be governed by a board of 12 members with equal representation from government, academia, and the private sector. The foundation will award grants and prizes to organizations that successfully develop deployable technologies to defeat Internet suppression and censorship. Funding will be provided as necessary. H.Res. 672 calls on the Chinese government to rescind the requirement for Green Dam filtering software on new computers and urges U.S. high-tech companies to promote Internet freedom globally. It also calls on the Government of Vietnam to release imprisoned bloggers and respect Internet freedom. Introduced by Representatives Wu and Sanchez, respectively. The House Resolution 672 supports Internet freedom in Vietnam, urging the repeal of restrictive Internet laws and the release of political prisoners, including bloggers and cyber activists. It calls for Vietnam to align with international human rights standards and respect freedom of speech, press, and political association. The resolution also includes a list of technologies used for web censorship. The technologies used for web censorship include Key-Word List Blocking, DNS Poisoning, IP Blocking, and Bandwidth Throttling. These methods are employed by governments to restrict access to certain websites and control internet traffic. Traffic classification is a sophisticated method used by repressive governments to block specific types of traffic, such as FTP transfers through TCP port 21. Shallow Packet Inspection (SPI) is a less advanced version of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) that blocks packets based on their content. Packet Inspection (SPI) is a method used by repressive governments to classify and block traffic based on packet headers. It is less refined than Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) but can handle a greater volume of traffic quickly. Packet Fingerprinting is a more refined method that looks at packet length, frequency, and other characteristics to determine content. This allows for better classification of packets and prevents users from disguising their traffic. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a sophisticated method used by governments to block Internet traffic by examining both packet headers and payloads. This allows for targeted monitoring and filtering of packets, but it is more complex and labor-intensive than other techniques. DPI provides the most precise traffic shaping capabilities, enabling governments to prevent certain keywords from reaching their intended destinations. A proxy server acts as an intermediary for user requests, allowing anonymity. Web-based circumvention systems help users access blocked websites by proxying requests. Examples include Proxify, CGIProxy, and psiphon. Web and Application Tunneling Software allows users to tunnel traffic through encrypted connections. Users can access normal services on their computer through a non-filtered computer, either by setting up private tunneling services or purchasing commercial ones. \"Web\" tunneling software is limited to web traffic, while \"Application\" tunneling software can tunnel multiple Internet applications. Examples include UltraReach, FreeGate, GPass, and HTTP. Anonymous technologies like Tor, JAP ANON, and I2P conceal a user's IP address from websites visited, allowing users to bypass Internet censorship. These technologies route web requests through proxy services, encrypting traffic to enhance privacy. However, some require software downloads and can be blocked by authorities."
