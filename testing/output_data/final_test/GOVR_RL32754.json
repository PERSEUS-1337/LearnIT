    "content": "The 9/11 Commission Report highlighted how terrorists exploited humanitarian relief in immigration law. Amendments like AEDPA and IIRIRA aimed to reduce fraudulent asylum claims and limit judicial review of removal orders. The REAL ID Act further amended the INA to prevent terrorists from abusing the immigration system. Section 208(b) of the INA allows the Attorney General to grant asylum to refugees based on defined criteria. An alien in the United States can apply for asylum regardless of their immigration status, with the burden of proof placed on the applicant. Asylum grant is discretionary, and even if eligibility criteria are met, it can be denied on discretionary grounds. Prior to the REAL ID Act, there were no explicit standards for determining credibility and evidence sufficiency in asylum cases. Prior to the REAL ID Act, asylum cases lacked explicit standards for determining credibility and evidence sufficiency, leading to inconsistent results across federal appellate courts. Factors for adverse credibility findings included demeanor, inconsistencies in testimony, and lack of detail. The Ninth Circuit required explicit reasons for such findings to be made. The Ninth Circuit required explicit reasons for adverse credibility findings, which could be based on an applicant's failure to provide corroboration. The BIA and federal courts disagreed on when corroboration is needed, with the BIA stating it must be provided when reasonable to expect it. The BIA faced criticism for not specifying required corroboration in asylum cases, with different circuit courts having varying standards. The Ninth Circuit accepted credible testimony alone if unrefuted, while the Second Circuit supported the BIA's requirement for corroboration or a satisfactory explanation for its absence. Prior to the REAL ID Act, certain aliens with terrorist ties were not eligible for asylum, but some exceptions existed. Changes in the Act now restrict asylum availability for those with terrorist connections. The Act clarifies the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to grant asylum and sets stricter standards. The REAL ID Act strengthens asylum standards and grants authority to both the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General. It amends the INA to allow both officials to exercise authority over asylum issues. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to grant authority to both the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General for asylum issues. The burden of proof is on the asylum applicant to establish eligibility, with a new standard requiring persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to grant authority for asylum issues based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The concept of a \"central reason\" in asylum laws is not defined, but case law recognizes mixed motives for persecution, where one motive must be a statutory ground for asylum eligibility. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to grant authority for asylum based on various grounds. The importance of the statutory motive in asylum cases has varied, ranging from being one of the motives to a principal motive. Subsection 101(a)(3) of the Act aims to bring clarity and consistency to evidentiary determinations. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to establish standards for evidentiary determinations in asylum cases. The adjudicator may require corroborating evidence for credible testimony, but it is not mandatory if the testimony is deemed credible and refers to specific facts demonstrating refugee status. The adjudicator can consider demeanor and candor in determining credibility. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to establish standards for evidentiary determinations in asylum cases, including factors like demeanor, candor, consistency of statements, and corroborating evidence. Adjudicators have flexibility in making credibility determinations, with no presumption of credibility. If no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made, there is a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to establish standards for evidentiary determinations in asylum cases, including factors like demeanor, candor, consistency of statements, and corroborating evidence. Adjudicators have flexibility in making credibility determinations, with no presumption of credibility. The Act allows for adverse credibility findings based on lack of corroborating evidence, aiming to resolve inconsistencies among federal appellate courts and the BIA. The INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(B)(iii) is a codification of existing case law allowing asylum adjudicators to consider various factors in credibility determinations. It supersedes Ninth Circuit precedent by allowing consideration of inconsistencies regardless of their impact on the asylum claim. There is no presumption of credibility, and adjudicators must consider the totality of circumstances. The REAL ID Act amends asylum eligibility for aliens described in terrorism grounds for inadmissibility and removal, with exceptions. It also references the transfer of immigration enforcement functions to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. The REAL ID Act amended asylum eligibility for certain aliens based on terrorism grounds and transferred immigration enforcement functions to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. Asylum standards under the Act apply to applications made on or after May 11, 2005, with preexisting case law applying to earlier claims. Withholding of removal differs from asylum as it is mandatory relief requiring a higher standard of proof. Relief from removal can be granted to those who can prove a \"clear probability of persecution.\" Asylum grants admission to the US but not permanent residency. Withholding of removal does not guarantee legal entry and is specific to a country, allowing for potential removal when the threat is gone. Withholding does not lead to permanent residency or family reunification in the US. An alien granted asylum can adjust status under \u00a7 209(b) of the INA after being present in the US for one year if still meeting refugee criteria. Spouse and children may also be granted asylum. Withholding of removal involves similar considerations but does not guarantee legal entry or permanent residency. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to include certain classes of aliens ineligible for withholding of removal, such as those believed to be a danger to US security. It also applies the same standards for burden of proof and credibility assessment used in asylum adjudications to withholding of removal cases. The REAL ID Act amends the INA to include classes of aliens ineligible for withholding of removal, based on security concerns. It also applies asylum adjudication standards to withholding of removal cases, with other relief options available. Different forms of relief from removal include cancellation of removal, temporary protected status, and waivers of inadmissibility or deportability. Each form of relief has specific eligibility conditions, such as for permanent residents, nonpermanent residents, battered spouses and children, and beneficiaries of NACARA. Evidentiary standards for cancellation of removal have not been specified in statutes, but the Attorney General has discretion in considering credible evidence for certain cases. The burden of proof for removal relief lies with the applicant, who must establish eligibility and show that any mandatory denial grounds do not apply. For withholding or deferral of removal under the Torture Convention, the applicant must prove a likelihood of torture if removed. Credible testimony may be sufficient without corroboration. The burden of proof for removal relief under NACARA lies with the applicant, who must establish eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. In cases of extreme hardship presumption, the government must prove that neither the applicant nor a qualified relative would suffer extreme hardship if removed from the United States. For temporary protected status, the applicant must provide evidence to support their claim. The burden of proof for removal relief under NACARA lies with the applicant, who must establish eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. The BIA has ruled that the general standards for suspension of deportation should be applied to the newer form of relief. The REAL ID Act did not establish standards for removal relief other than asylum and withholding of removal. The REAL ID Act amended the burden of proof in removal proceedings by establishing standards for eligibility and credibility determinations for removal relief. Aliens must prove eligibility and merit favorable discretion for any relief, comply with submission requirements, and provide credible and persuasive testimony. The REAL ID Act amended the burden of proof in removal proceedings by establishing standards for eligibility and credibility determinations for removal relief. The immigration judge may weigh credible testimony with other evidence of record, as credible testimony alone may satisfy the burden of proof for asylum and withholding of removal. Special circumstances for asylum and withholding of removal may make corroboration difficult, where persecution and flight from persecution may endanger the safety of the alien. Other forms of relief may not require such special consideration. If the immigration judge requires corroborating evidence for credible testimony, the applicant must provide it. The immigration judge may base credibility determinations on factors like demeanor, candor, consistency of statements, and corroborating evidence. The burden of proof remains with the applicant, even if unable to obtain corroborating evidence without leaving the United States. The immigration judge may base credibility determinations on factors like demeanor, candor, consistency of statements, and corroborating evidence. The burden of proof remains with the applicant, even if unable to obtain corroborating evidence without leaving the United States. Subsection 101(h)(2) of the REAL ID Act establishes standards for removal relief applications made on or after May 11, 2005. Section 242(b)(4) of the INA limits judicial review of removal orders to the administrative record. The standard of judicial review for discretionary denial of an asylum claim is whether there has been an abuse of discretion. The standard of review for a denial of asylum based on a finding of fact is whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence. The standard of review for a denial of withholding of removal is also whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence. The REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(e) amends the INA by establishing standards for judicial review of evidentiary determinations in asylum, withholding of removal, or other relief cases. It limits judicial review by barring reversal of adjudicator decisions on corroborating evidence availability unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude it is unavailable. This amendment may not significantly change existing law regarding administrative findings of fact. The REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(h)(3) establishes uniform standards for judicial review of evidentiary determinations in asylum cases. It limits reversal of adjudicator decisions on corroborating evidence availability unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find otherwise. This provision applies to all cases with final administrative removal orders issued before or after May 11, 2005. Section 242(a)(2)(B) of the INA restricts judicial review of denials of discretionary relief. The REAL ID Act limits judicial review of discretionary relief under immigration laws, barring courts from jurisdiction to review certain decisions of the Attorney General. It clarifies references to the Secretary of Homeland Security and applies regardless of whether the decision is made in removal proceedings. The REAL ID Act limits judicial review of discretionary relief under immigration laws, barring courts from jurisdiction to review certain decisions of the Attorney General, even if made outside of removal proceedings. The Act exempts asylum relief from this jurisdictional bar, but aims to prevent terrorists from obtaining asylum. The REAL ID Act, enacted on May 11, 2005, established judicial review standards that apply to all cases pending before any court on or after that date. Prior to this Act, the Attorney General could adjust the status of aliens granted asylum to lawful permanent residence, with a cap of 10,000 persons per fiscal year. The Act eliminates the cap for adjustment of status for asylees and replaces references to the \"Immigration and Naturalization.\" The REAL ID Act, enacted on May 11, 2005, eliminates the cap for adjustment of status for asylees and replaces references to the \"Immigration and Naturalization Service\" with references to the \"Department of Homeland Security.\" It also replaces references to the \"Attorney General\" with references to the \"Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General.\" The REAL ID Act, enacted in 2005, addresses issues related to aliens connected to terrorist activity. It repeals the requirement for a study on this issue and provides for the construction of barriers along U.S. land borders to deter illegal crossings. The REAL ID Act of 2005 allows for waivers of the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act to expedite barrier construction. Disputes over laws have delayed the completion of barriers in San Diego, with the California Coastal Commission citing inconsistencies with state coastal management laws. Legislation was proposed in the 108th Congress to address these conflicts. The REAL ID Act of 2005 allows for waivers of environmental laws to expedite barrier construction along the border. The Act grants the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to waive all legal requirements as deemed necessary for the expeditious construction of barriers and roads. This waiver authority has been used despite available alternatives in the past. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements to expedite barrier construction under IIRIRA \u00a7 102. The waiver decision is effective upon publication in the Federal Register, allowing for public notice. The REAL ID Act also allows for federal judicial review of waiver decisions, with a 60-day window for filing a claim in federal district court. Appellate review can only be sought through a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to prevent lawsuits from hindering construction. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive legal requirements for barrier construction under IIRIRA \u00a7 102, with federal judicial review allowed under the REAL ID Act. Waivers of this breadth are uncommon in federal law, potentially raising constitutional issues regarding state court jurisdiction. Preexisting statutes have not been amended to clarify executive authority references, replacing the Attorney General with the Secretary of Homeland Security for waiver decisions. In 1996, Congress restricted judicial review of removal orders in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Despite these restrictions, the Supreme Court upheld the availability of judicial review for removal-related matters, citing a strong presumption in favor of such review. The Court also emphasized the importance of maintaining some form of judicial oversight, even in cases where review was limited. The Supreme Court upheld judicial review for removal-related matters in 1996, despite restrictions imposed by Congress. The Court emphasized the importance of maintaining some form of judicial oversight, including habeas review for constitutional issues. The REAL ID Act restricts habeas review and other non-direct judicial review for certain removal matters, but federal appellate courts can still consider constitutional claims and legal issues raised under the INA. The REAL ID Act limits judicial review for certain removal matters, stating that federal appellate review under the INA is the exclusive avenue for review, except for expedited removal orders for arriving aliens. It clarifies that judicial review includes habeas and other non-direct review, with federal appellate review being the only available avenue for review of a removal order under the INA. The REAL ID Act limits judicial review for removal matters, clarifying that federal appellate review is the exclusive avenue for review, except for expedited removal orders for arriving aliens. It specifies that no court has jurisdiction for habeas review or non-direct judicial review of removal orders or related decisions by the Attorney General. Amendments to the INA apply to cases with final administrative orders issued before or after May 11, 2005. REAL ID Act \u00a7 106 transfers pending habeas cases to federal appellate courts, eliminating habeas and non-direct judicial review. Questions of law, including constitutional issues, still have a forum for review. The REAL ID Act strengthens consequences for aliens engaged in terror-related activities, affecting their ability to enter or remain in the United States. It broadens definitions of terrorist organizations and activities, expands grounds for inadmissibility based on support of terror-related activity, and aligns deportation grounds with inadmissibility criteria. The REAL ID Act aligns deportation grounds with inadmissibility criteria, making terror-related grounds for deportability identical to those for inadmissibility. \"Engage in terrorist activity\" includes direct acts of violence and other specified acts that facilitate terrorist activity, making aliens engaging in such activities inadmissible and deportable. Prior to the REAL ID Act, actions supporting terrorism indirectly through group membership or advocacy could render an alien inadmissible but not deportable. To \"engage in terrorist activity\" under the INA, an alien must have committed or incited violence, planned a terrorist act, gathered target information, or solicited funds for terrorist organizations. The REAL ID Act expanded grounds for deporting aliens who engage in terrorist activities or support terrorist organizations, including soliciting others to join or provide material support. The REAL ID Act expanded grounds for deporting aliens who engage in terrorist activities or support terrorist organizations, including providing material support such as weapons or explosives. This support could be to a designated terrorist organization or a non-designated terrorist organization, unless the provider can prove they did not know or should not have reasonably known that the support would further terrorist activity. The REAL ID Act expanded grounds for deporting aliens who engage in terrorist activities or support terrorist organizations by providing material support. The definition of \"engage in terrorist activity\" was revised, allowing for waivers in certain cases at the discretion of the Secretary of State or Attorney General. The REAL ID Act revised the definition of \"engage in terrorist activity\" and made it harder for aliens providing material support to avoid being considered engaged in terrorist activity themselves. The Act now requires aliens to prove by clear and convincing evidence that they did not reasonably know their support would further terrorist activities. The REAL ID Act expanded the definition of \"engage in terrorist activity\" to include providing material support to a member of a designated terrorist organization. The Act allows for the material support clause to be waived for a specific alien if certain officials determine it should not apply. The REAL ID Act broadened the definition of \"engage in terrorist activity\" to include providing support to a terrorist organization. This change applies to removal proceedings before or after the Act's enactment and includes groups designated as terrorist organizations by the U.S. and those involved in terror-related activities. Certain forms of assistance to a \"terrorist organization\" can lead to inadmissibility and deportability. Membership or association with a \"terrorist organization\" can also result in inadmissibility. Amending the definition of \"terrorist organization\" could impact other terrorism-related provisions of the INA. The REAL ID Act amends the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA, expanding the types of associations that can lead to inadmissibility/deportation. This change may greatly increase the reach of the terrorism provisions in the INA. The REAL ID Act expands the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA, potentially impacting aliens associated with groups involved in fundraising for terrorist activities. Authority over immigration law has shifted from the Attorney General to the Secretary of Homeland Security, with both having a role in designating terrorist organizations. The REAL ID Act broadens the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA, allowing groups soliciting funds or providing support for terrorist activities to be considered as such. This expansion could increase the number of organizations classified as terrorist, impacting aliens associated with these groups. The REAL ID Act broadens the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA to include groups providing support for terrorist activities. This extension raises questions about how groups can avoid being classified as terrorist organizations, and includes non-designated groups with subgroups engaging in terrorist activity. This lowers the threshold for what constitutes support for a terrorist activity. The REAL ID Act broadens the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA to include groups providing support for terrorist activities. This raises questions about how groups can avoid being classified as terrorist organizations, even if they have subgroups engaging in terrorist activity. The threshold for what constitutes support for a terrorist activity is lowered. The REAL ID Act broadens the definition of \"terrorist organization\" in the INA to include groups providing support for terrorist activities. The Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, may waive the INA provision for certain non-designated groups with subgroups engaged in terrorist activity. This waiver applies to removal proceedings and inadmissibility grounds before or after the REAL ID Act's enactment. Aliens engaging in terrorist activity are inadmissible to the United States. Prior to the REAL ID Act, various terror-related activities could lead to inadmissibility, including being known or believed to engage in terrorist activity. Additionally, representing a designated foreign terrorist organization or a group endorsing terrorist acts could also result in inadmissibility. Aliens engaging in terrorist activity are inadmissible to the United States. The Secretary of State can determine inadmissibility if the alien is a member of a foreign terrorist organization, a spokesman for the PLO, or has used their position to endorse terrorist activities. Spouses or children of inadmissible aliens can also be barred if the activity occurred within the previous five years. Aliens engaging in terrorist activity are inadmissible to the United States. The REAL ID Act expands terror-related grounds for inadmissibility, broadening definitions of \"terrorist organization\" and \"engage in terrorist activity.\" Spouses or children can also be barred if they were unaware of the terrorist activity or renounced it. The REAL ID Act broadens the terror-related grounds for inadmissibility by expanding the definition of \"engage in terrorist activity.\" This includes aliens who solicit on behalf of terrorist organizations. Under the REAL ID Act, aliens who provide support for non-designated terrorist organizations can be declared inadmissible unless they prove they did not knowingly support a terrorist group. The Act allows various authorities to declare an alien inadmissible if they are known to be engaged in terrorist activity or likely to engage in such activity upon entry into the United States. The Act does not change the existing grounds for inadmissibility related to inciting terrorist activity. The REAL ID Act expands grounds for inadmissibility to deny entry to representatives of terrorist organizations or groups endorsing terrorist activity. It broadens the definition of \"terrorist organization\" and makes representatives of such groups inadmissible. The REAL ID Act increases grounds for inadmissibility due to terrorist organization membership. The burden of proof shifts to the alien to show they did not know the nature of the organization. The REAL ID Act expands grounds for inadmissibility for alien involvement with terrorist organizations. Aliens can be deemed inadmissible if they endorse or support terrorist activities, regardless of their knowledge of the organization's terrorist nature. The REAL ID Act expands grounds for inadmissibility for alien involvement with terrorist organizations, regardless of their knowledge of the organization's terrorist activities. This includes persuading others to support terrorist activity, without requiring a mens rea element. The Act's definition of \"terrorist organization\" now includes groups engaging in terrorist activities or providing material support, broadening the scope of inadmissibility. The REAL ID Act broadens grounds for inadmissibility for aliens involved with terrorist organizations, including those who have received military-type training from such organizations. Waivers may be granted by the Secretary of State or Homeland Security. There is no requirement for the organization to be designated as a terrorist organization by the United States. The REAL ID Act expands grounds for inadmissibility for aliens who receive military-type training from terrorist organizations. Waivers can be granted by the Secretary of State or Homeland Security, and awareness of the organization's terrorist activities is not required. The Act does not change the inadmissibility of family members of aliens found inadmissible on terror-related grounds, but exceptions exist for those who were unaware of the terrorist activity or have renounced it. The REAL ID Act expands grounds for inadmissibility for aliens associated with terrorist organizations intending to engage in activities that could endanger the US. Waivers can be granted by designated officials. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other officials, may waive certain provisions of the INA related to inadmissibility for individuals endorsing or supporting terrorist activity. The Secretary of State does not have the authority to grant these waivers. The REAL ID Act \u00a7 104 imposes reporting requirements on the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security regarding their waiver authority for aliens. They must provide annual reports to specified House and Senate committees and report within one week of exercising waiver authority for a group engaged in terrorist activity. The REAL ID Act amended terror-related grounds for deportability to align with those for inadmissibility, allowing for deportation of aliens engaged in terror-related activities in the US. The REAL ID Act expanded deportation grounds for aliens engaged in terrorist activities, aligning with inadmissibility provisions. The REAL ID Act broadens the definition of \"engage in terrorist activity\" for aliens, making them deportable if they supported a non-designated terrorist organization. Consular officers, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security can declare an alien inadmissible or deportable for engaging in or likely to engage in terrorist activities. The REAL ID Act expands the criteria for deporting aliens involved in terrorist activities. Aliens can be deported for inciting or being a member of a terrorist organization. The Act also applies to those who support groups endorsing terrorist activities. The REAL ID Act allows for the deportation of aliens involved in terrorist activities, including those who are officers or representatives of terrorist organizations. This includes individuals who endorse or persuade others to support terrorist activities, without requiring knowledge of the organization's terrorist activities. The Act also repeals previous grounds for deportability related to receiving military-type training from terrorist organizations. The REAL ID Act allows for the deportation of aliens involved in terrorist activities, including those who receive military-type training from or on behalf of any terrorist organization. This provision applies regardless of whether the alien was aware of the organization's terrorist activities. The Act also includes the spouse or child of an alien inadmissible on terror-related grounds deportable if the activity occurred within the last five years. The REAL ID Act allows for the deportation of aliens involved in terrorist activities, including those who receive military-type training from or on behalf of any terrorist organization. This provision applies regardless of whether the alien was aware of the organization's terrorist activities. Additionally, an alien's spouse or child may be deported if they were involved in terror-related activities within the last five years, unless certain conditions are met. The REAL ID Act, effective since May 11, 2005, expands the grounds for deportability related to terrorism. Aliens engaged in terror-related activities are inadmissible, deportable, and ineligible for relief from removal. This Act also affects eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and cancellation of removal for certain aliens. Aliens in the U.S. can be deportable or inadmissible based on various grounds such as terrorism. The REAL ID Act affects eligibility for asylum and other forms of relief for aliens involved in terror-related activities. Membership in a terrorist organization may disqualify aliens, with exceptions for inadmissible aliens but not deportable ones. Other legal changes result from modifications in cross-references and section numbering. The REAL ID Act impacts eligibility for asylum for aliens involved in terror-related activities. Changes in law, including cross-references and section numbering, affect deportable aliens' ineligibility for asylum relief on terror-related grounds. Membership in a terrorist organization may disqualify aliens, with exceptions for inadmissible aliens but not deportable ones. The REAL ID Act amends immigration law to make deportable aliens ineligible for asylum relief on terror-related grounds, creating a disparity in asylum eligibility compared to inadmissible aliens. Deportable aliens are ineligible for asylum on terror-related grounds if they have engaged in terrorist activity, are likely to engage in terrorist activity, incited terrorist activity, are affiliated with a terrorist organization, or are members of a designated terrorist group. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for inadmissibility on terror-related grounds for aliens, including engaging in terrorist activities, endorsing or supporting terrorist organizations, and receiving military-type training from a terrorist organization. An alien may be found inadmissible on terror-related grounds if associated with a terrorist organization and intending to engage in activities endangering the US. An alien is ineligible for asylum if found inadmissible under specific terror-related grounds outlined in the INA. An alien may be ineligible for asylum if the Attorney General determines they pose a danger to the security of the United States or if they endorse terrorist activity in a way that undermines US efforts to combat terrorism. This is outlined in the INA and the REAL ID Act. The REAL ID Act amends terror-related grounds for inadmissibility in the INA, affecting the scope of asylum ineligibility for aliens endorsing terrorist activity. The REAL ID Act amends terror-related grounds for asylum ineligibility, denying asylum to aliens engaged in terrorist activities or likely to engage in such activities. The REAL ID Act amends asylum eligibility by denying it to aliens involved in terrorist activities or supporting terrorist organizations. The REAL ID Act amends the INA provision on terror-related grounds for inadmissibility, allowing inadmissible aliens to still be eligible for asylum if they used a position of prominence to endorse terrorism. Membership in a non-designated terrorist organization automatically disqualifies an alien from asylum, unless they can prove they were unaware of the organization's terrorist status. Withholding of removal is another remedy for prospective persecution, but certain aliens may be ineligible for this relief. Aliens may be ineligible for withholding of removal under certain circumstances, such as being convicted of a serious crime or posing a danger to the community or security of the United States. Aliens described in INA \u00a7 237(a)(4)(B) are considered a security threat and ineligible for withholding of removal. The REAL ID Act expands terror-related grounds for deportability, making aliens ineligible for withholding of removal if they are deportable on such grounds. This includes aliens engaged in terrorist activity, who are now ineligible for withholding of removal. The REAL ID Act expands terror-related grounds for deportability, making aliens engaged in terrorist activity ineligible for withholding of removal. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3) states that aliens inadmissible on terror-related grounds are also ineligible for withholding of removal. The Attorney General has discretionary authority to cancel removal for certain residents, but this does not apply to aliens inadmissible or deportable on terror-related grounds. The REAL ID Act expands terror-related grounds for deportability, making aliens engaged in terrorist activity ineligible for cancellation of removal. Any alien inadmissible on terror-related grounds is also ineligible for cancellation of removal. The Act significantly increases the terror-related grounds that may disqualify a deportable alien from having their removal canceled. The REAL ID Act broadens terror-related grounds for inadmissibility, expanding the category of aliens ineligible for cancellation of removal. Prior to this Act, standards for drivers' licenses and identification cards varied by state. Despite the 2004 legislation, most standards remained at the discretion of state and local governments. The Act includes provisions for improved national standards. The REAL ID Act enhances security for drivers' licenses and ID cards, repeals conflicting provisions from the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and delegates authority to set minimum standards for federal acceptance of licenses and ID cards. The REAL ID Act requires driver's licenses and identification cards to include key details like full legal name, date of birth, gender, and address, along with security features to prevent fraud. States must confiscate compromised cards and follow regulations for issuing them. The regulations for documentation verification and processing applications must not interfere with a state's authority to determine eligibility for driver's licenses or identification cards. The REAL ID Act required regulations to protect privacy rights and use negotiated rulemaking. The rulemaking committee included state and local offices, elected officials, Department of Homeland Security, and interested parties. States need to adopt federal standards for issuing driver's licenses and identification cards. The REAL ID Act establishes federal standards for driver's licenses and identification cards, including minimum issuance standards for federal recognition. States must adopt these standards to be recognized by federal agencies for official purposes, such as accessing federal facilities and boarding commercial aircraft. The REAL ID Act sets minimum issuance standards for federal recognition of driver's licenses and identification cards, requiring states to verify key information such as photo identification, date of birth, social security number, and address. This provision preempts state verification standards with new federal requirements. The REAL ID Act requires states to verify an applicant's legal status before issuing a driver's license or identification card, preempting state laws. Temporary licenses can be issued to applicants who fall into specific categories. The REAL ID Act mandates that temporary driver's licenses or identification cards must expire based on the applicant's authorized stay in the US. Renewals require proof of extended status by the Secretary of Homeland Security. States must adopt procedures to capture digital images of identity documents and retain copies for a specified period. The REAL ID Act requires states to retain documents for a minimum of seven years or images of source documents for a minimum of ten years. It also mandates facial image capture for all applicants and verification of renewing applicant information. Additionally, states must confirm Social Security numbers and ensure the security of card production locations and materials. The REAL ID Act mandates security measures for driver's licenses and identification cards, including training programs for recognizing fraudulent documents, limiting card validity to eight years, and using unique identifiers for non-compliant cards. States must maintain a database and clearly mark non-compliant cards as not for federal identification. The REAL ID Act mandates security measures for driver's licenses and identification cards, including maintaining a motor vehicle database with all relevant data fields and driver histories. States are required to provide electronic access to their databases to other states. The Act also amends federal law to criminalize the transportation or transfer of materials used for identification purposes. The REAL ID Act broadens criminal provisions related to identification features, mandates the entry of personal information into aviation-screening databases for those convicted of using false IDs at airports, authorizes grants to states for compliance, and grants the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to promulgate regulations and issue grants. Title III of the REAL ID Act focuses on improving border infrastructure and technology integration between state and federal agencies. It includes conducting a study on U.S. border security vulnerabilities, testing ground surveillance technologies on the northern and southern borders, and enhancing communication systems between federal, state, local, and tribal agencies on border security matters. The Secretary of Homeland Security can extend deadlines for states with adequate justification. Section 301 of the REAL ID Act mandates the study of technology and personnel needs for Customs and Border Protection field offices to address security vulnerabilities in the US. Reports must be submitted to Congress with findings and recommendations every five years. Necessary appropriations are authorized for fiscal years. Section 301(c) authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2006-2011 to address security vulnerabilities at US borders with Mexico and Canada. Various monitoring methods are used, including border patrol agents, video cameras, ground sensors, and aircraft. Pilot programs test advanced technologies like sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance improvement. The REAL ID Act requires a pilot program to test ground surveillance technologies for border security enhancement, covering both northern and southern border locations. Within a year of program implementation, House and Senate committees review and recommend the future of the program established under the REAL ID Act. The Act mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to collaborate with various agencies to enhance interagency communication and information-sharing on border security. A report must be submitted to designated committees within a year of plan implementation, including any recommendations made by the Secretary."
