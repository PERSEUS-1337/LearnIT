    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers Employment Registration Act of 1993\". The Congress recognizes the importance of law enforcement officials in addressing violent crime and the need to prevent officers with a history of misconduct from seeking employment in another jurisdiction. Federal legislation is needed to create a national clearinghouse of officer employment histories to prevent officers with a history of misconduct from obtaining employment in another state. This legislation would require Federal registration of employment termination data for law enforcement and correctional officers. Federal legislation is required to establish a national database for tracking officer employment histories to prevent those with misconduct records from being rehired in another state. This legislation mandates the registration of employment data for law enforcement and correctional officers. The Governor of each State or Territory receiving funds under section 506 must designate an official to submit a list of law enforcement and correctional officers since January 1, 1990, to the Attorney General. The list includes names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and appointment dates. The agency or official responsible for submitting employment data of law enforcement officers must notify the Attorney General within 90 days of an officer's appointment or separation. This includes reporting if an officer's certification has been revoked. The term 'law enforcement officer' refers to individuals appointed by a State, territory, political subdivision, or Native American entity. A 'law enforcement officer' or 'correctional officer' is an individual appointed by a State, territory, political subdivision, or Native American entity to conserve peace, make arrests, serve warrants, guard prisoners, or supervise inmates. This includes individuals whether compensated or not, full- or part-time, with temporary or permanent appointments. Excluded are citizens assisting officers unless deputized or commissioned. As a condition of employment, states must require applicants for law enforcement or correctional officer positions to disclose prior service and submit a written authorization for release of information. The Attorney General is directed to release collected data to prospective employers upon receiving the authorization. Upon receiving a completed written authorization, each state must notify the Attorney General within 30 days before appointing or employing a law enforcement or correctional officer. The Attorney General will issue regulations for the employment data clearinghouse. Agencies submitting data are presumed to act in good faith and are immune from civil liability unless proven otherwise. The data submitted must be proven to be false or submitted with malicious intent to mislead. SEC. 4 of the Act specifies the effective dates and compliance deadlines. The Act will take effect on January 1, 1994. Lists required under a specific section must be submitted within 180 days of enactment. States must comply with certain requirements within the same timeframe. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, evaluating State compliance with specified requirements. Non-compliant States will be listed in the report. Subsequent reports will be submitted as necessary."
