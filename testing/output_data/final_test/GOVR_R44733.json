    "content": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was established in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets, expanding beyond agricultural commodities to financial variables. Its mission is to prevent excessive speculation, manipulation, and fraud. The agency administers the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and oversees industry self-regulatory organizations. The CFTC, established in 1974, regulates commodities futures and options markets, including industry firms like futures commission merchants, floor traders, and commodity pool operators. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the CFTC's jurisdiction to include swaps, requiring registration of major participants and clearing of certain swaps. Newly regulated entities in the swap market include swap dealers, major swap participants, swap clearing organizations, swap execution facilities, and swap data repositories. The CFTC, similar to the SEC, does not regulate the safety of individual firms except for newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants. Derivatives trading mostly involves financial variables, but congressional oversight is still tied to agricultural commerce origins. The CFTC is led by five commissioners appointed by the President and appropriations are under specific subcommittees in the House and Senate. The CFTC is led by five commissioners appointed by the President, with staggered five-year terms and no more than three commissioners from the same political party. The agency is organized into four divisions: Clearing and Risk, Enforcement, Market Oversight, and Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight. The President designates one commissioner as chair. The CFTC, led by five commissioners appointed by the President, is organized into four divisions. The agency was last reauthorized in 2008, with authorization of appropriations through FY2013. Congress is considering a new reauthorization bill, H.R. 238, which was passed by the House and referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry in 2017. H.R. 238, a CFTC reauthorization bill, shares similarities with previous bills but differs from the Senate Agriculture Committee bill. The reauthorization process evaluates the CFTC's regulatory authority and derivatives trading. This is the first reauthorization process since the Dodd-Frank Act brought the swaps market under regulatory oversight, providing an opportunity for Congress to reexamine regulations. The House CFTC reauthorization bill, H.R. 238, includes provisions for funding the CFTC at $250 million per year for FY2017 through FY2021. Congress is using this reauthorization process to potentially make changes to futures regulation and address concerns about regulatory burdens and industry costs. Some are critical of any weakening of derivatives oversight introduced after the financial crisis. The House CFTC reauthorization bill, H.R. 238, sets funding for the CFTC at $250 million annually for FY2017 through FY2021. This approach differs from previous bills, as it replaces the flexible funding language with a fixed amount. This change may impact congressional appropriators' flexibility in adjusting CFTC funding levels. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act brought OTC swaps markets under CFTC jurisdiction. The question of appropriate CFTC funding levels has become contentious. The Trump Administration requested $250 million for FY2018, while the CFTC requested $281.5 million. The CFTC, under Chair Giancarlo, requested $281.5 million for FY2018, $31.5 million more than the Trump Administration's budget request. The additional funding would support examinations, stress testing for clearinghouses, and addressing financial technology innovation. The Obama Administration had previously requested $330 million for FY2017 to meet oversight responsibilities for swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFTC was appropriated $250 million for FY2017, the same as for FY2015 and FY2016, despite requests for more funding. Former Chairman Timothy Massad criticized the lack of increase, stating it hinders oversight of derivatives markets and enforcement of rules. The need for added resources to oversee technologically complex swaps markets was emphasized. The CFTC's budget has not kept pace with its expanded responsibilities and market growth, impacting the timely delivery of new rules and registration programs. The number of expert staff at the SEC and CFTC may not be sufficient for effective supervision in increasingly complex markets. Increased CFTC spending is questioned by critics who doubt its effectiveness in reducing financial risks. The correlation between funding increase and risk reduction is unclear, with doubts about preventing another financial crisis. H.R. 238 aims to expand factors for the CFTC to consider. H.R. 238 aims to expand factors for the CFTC to consider in cost-benefit analysis, including quantitative and qualitative analysis. The CFTC already has requirements for cost-benefit analysis in rulemakings under the CEA, but is not subject to general requirements for government agencies under E.O. 12866. The CFTC is required to consider costs and benefits before issuing regulations, evaluating factors such as market protection, efficiency, and risk management. This requirement is broader than E.O. 12866 and applies to all CFTC rules. The CFTC relies on OIRA guidance for cost-benefit analysis under Section 15(a) of the CEA. OIRA provides assistance through documents like OMB Circular A-4. H.R. 238 would expand the CEA's cost-benefit analysis provisions from 5 to 12 considerations. H.R. 238 expands the CEA's cost-benefit analysis provisions to include 12 considerations, such as market participant protection, market efficiency, and impact on market liquidity. It also includes factors like price discovery, risk management practices, and assessing the risks of various activities within its jurisdiction. The bill also considers the costs of complying with regulations for regulated entities. The proposed regulation or order under H.R. 238 expands the CEA's cost-benefit analysis provisions to include 12 considerations, such as market participant protection, market efficiency, and impact on market liquidity. It also includes factors like price discovery, risk management practices, and assessing the risks of various activities within its jurisdiction. The bill also considers the costs of complying with regulations for regulated entities, including quantitative assessments of costs and benefits. The quantitative cost-benefit analysis in economics involves quantifying externalities like pollution and risks to the financial system. It raises questions about accurately valuing intangible benefits and costs. In financial regulation, benefits are often broadly dispersed among investors. Cost-benefit analysis in financial regulation aims to quantify the benefits of corporate disclosures and investor protections, which can be challenging due to the speculative nature of some benefits. Critics argue that costs of compliance, such as payment-hours for professionals, are more easily measurable. Proponents believe that cost-benefit analysis helps agencies clarify the benefits of their rules and weigh costs against benefits, influencing outcomes in agency rulemakings. Some scholars argue that increased use of cost-benefit analysis in rulemaking processes may slow down or lead to agencies issuing guidance documents instead of regulations. This could potentially block or delay beneficial regulations, especially in financial rulemakings where costs are easier to quantify than dispersed benefits. Critics also claim that inadequate cost-benefit analysis opens rules to court challenges by industry groups, tying up agency resources and potentially invalidating beneficial regulations. Section 304 of H.R. 238 aims to broaden the definition of a financial entity, allowing more companies to qualify for the end-user exception in the Dodd-Frank Act. This change would permit certain nonbank entities engaged in financial activities to use the exception when trading on behalf of other nonbank entities, as long as they lack a prudential regulator and do not fall under specific company designations. Section 304 of H.R. 238 broadens the definition of a financial entity to include nonbank entities that are not supervised by a prudential regulator and are not swap dealers, major swap participants, hedge funds, or large banks. These entities can qualify for the end-user exception in the Dodd-Frank Act when trading on behalf of affiliates that are also not supervised by a prudential regulator. H.R. 238 broadens the end-user exception from Dodd-Frank requirements by including nonbank financial entities not supervised by prudential regulators. The bill allows these entities to qualify for the exception if they can demonstrate they are \"commercial market participants\" or meet requirements for trading on behalf of non-prudentially supervised affiliates. The CFTC will further clarify who qualifies as a commercial-market participant and which nonbank financial firms are eligible for the exception. The concept of bona fide hedging involves transactions that genuinely offset commercial risks. The CFTC uses the concept of bona fide hedging to determine derivatives that count toward position limits. H.R. 238 proposes changes to the definition of bona fide hedging in a manner similar to previous bills. H.R. 238 proposes changes to the definition of bona fide hedging, potentially broadening it to allow trades for risk reduction or management in commercial enterprises. This could enable more types of trades to be permitted under the new definition. The CFTC considered industry proposals to broaden the definition of economically appropriate risks in their position limits rule reproposal but opted against changes. The CFTC decided not to make changes to the position limits rule despite industry proposals to broaden the definition of economically appropriate risks. Industry associations criticized the restrictive view of bona fide hedging in the reproposed rule. The CFTC's Division of Market Oversight issued a no-action letter on August 10, 2017, providing relief from certain aggregation requirements for position limits. The CFTC's decision not to change position limits rule despite industry proposals, with a focus on bona fide hedging and aggregation requirements. The question of regulatory authority over cross-border swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act is significant due to the international nature of the swaps market. Section 722(d) of the Act grants the CFTC interpretive discretion in applying swaps reforms outside the United States. Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the importance of bringing swaps market reform to transactions with overseas branches and affiliates guaranteed by U.S. entities to prevent American jobs and markets from moving offshore. Derivatives trading by overseas affiliates of U.S. financial conglomerates has led to significant losses for U.S.-based entities, as seen in examples like AIG's London-based Financial Products Group and J.P. Morgan's \"London Whale\" trading losses. The CFTC issued proposed guidance on the cross-border application of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2012 to clarify who would count as a \"U.S. person\" for meeting requirements. Industry participants warned that if CFTC rules were too burdensome, swap business would migrate away from U.S. financial institutions to other jurisdictions, with little chance of returning. On December 21, 2012, the agency issued a temporary exemption for cross-border swaps, extending the deadline to meet requirements. The SEC proposed a rule on cross-border security-based swaps on May 1, 2013, with a narrower approach to defining U.S. persons. The CFTC issued final guidance on July 26, 2013, determining which entities needed to register as swap dealers and MSPs. On November 14, 2013, the CFTC issued a staff advisory regarding the application of U.S. derivatives requirements to trades involving non-U.S. persons guaranteed by U.S. persons. Three financial industry trade associations sued the CFTC on December 4, 2013, challenging the final guidance and extraterritorial application of Dodd-Frank swaps rules. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the final guidance on September 16, 2014, and remanded some rules for further consideration by the CFTC. The CFTC solicited comments on differences between foreign and domestic costs and benefits for rule changes. They concluded that no changes were needed. The CFTC approved a substituted compliance framework for dually registered central counterparties in March 2016, allowing European CCPs to comply with CFTC rules by meeting corresponding European requirements. In May 2016, the CFTC approved cross-border rules on margin for uncleared swaps. In September 2016, the CFTC found Japan's margin requirements for uncleared swaps comparable to its own, with some exceptions. H.R. 238 proposes that the swaps regulatory requirements of the top eight foreign swaps markets must be deemed comparable to the U.S. within 18 months, unless the CFTC determines otherwise. H.R. 238 requires the top eight foreign swaps markets to be comparable to the U.S. within 18 months, with challenges in determining jurisdiction and total notional value fluctuations impacting the list of largest jurisdictions. Under H.R. 238, non-U.S. persons or transactions between them may be exempt from U.S. swaps requirements if compliant with one of eight permitted foreign jurisdictions, unless the CFTC deems a foreign jurisdiction inadequate. The bill effectively replaces U.S. requirements with those of the top foreign swaps markets, pending CFTC assessment. The provision enacted under H.R. 238 involves two non-U.S. persons in swaps transactions. It potentially encompasses a large majority of swaps involving a U.S. and a non-U.S. person. The CFTC has leeway to define a U.S. person and develop cross-border rules, but must not consider the location of personnel in determining the applicability of U.S. swaps requirements. The provision in H.R. 2289 regarding the location of personnel arranging swaps has sparked debate in Congress. It challenges CFTC Advisory 13-69, which determined that swaps involving U.S. and non-U.S. persons could be subject to Dodd-Frank requirements if personnel in the U.S. were involved. The CFTC has postponed the implementation of this advisory multiple times. Residual interest in futures trading involves FCMs temporarily covering margin shortfalls in customer accounts. H.R. 238 aims to establish a deadline of no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the following business day for FCMs to deposit capital for residual interest, aligning with CFTC regulations. The CFTC's Regulation 1.22 sets the deadline for posting residual interest, impacting when customers must provide collateral for margin deficiencies. The CFTC's March 17, 2015 rule amended Regulation 1.22 to prevent the deadline from advancing earlier than 6:00 p.m. the next day without further action. Former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad noted that posting residual interest should not occur before 6:00 p.m. the following day without CFTC action or rulemaking. The CFTC conducted a study in May 2016, recommending no change to the deadline for residual interest."
