    "content": "The ATF, located in the Department of Justice, enforces federal laws on firearms, explosives, arson, alcohol, and tobacco. In FY2009, Congress allocated $1.054 billion to ATF, with $759 million (72%) for firearms compliance and investigations. The Tiahrt amendment restricts the disclosure of trace data and multiple handgun sales reports for criminal investigations. The Tiahrt amendment limits the release of firearms trace data for civil lawsuits, but allows for the disclosure of statistical information on the firearms industry and illegal trafficking. Congress modified the limitation in FY2008 to allow for sharing of information among law enforcement agencies and publishing of annual statistical reports by the ATF. The FY2008 Tiahrt language restricts the release of firearm trace data for civil lawsuits but allows for sharing statistical information on the firearms industry and illegal trafficking. The limitation is made permanent law and includes reporting requirements for gun dealers and ATF conducting firearm traces for law enforcement agencies. Gun dealers report multiple handgun sales to ATF, which, along with firearm trace data, can indicate illegal firearms trafficking. However, there are methodological and operational limits on using this data. Law enforcement submits firearm information to ATF for tracing, including manufacturer, model, caliber, and serial number. ATF then researches transfer documents from Federal Firearms Licensees to track the firearm's distribution chain. In the mid-1980s to early 1990s, as gun violence increased, law enforcement agencies utilized ATF's firearm tracing capabilities. ATF maintains records of firearm transfers from dealers, which are used to trace crime guns. In 1994, comprehensive tracing of all \"crime guns\" in a specific area became an agency objective. The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative was launched in 1996 to fund cities for comprehensive tracing of crime guns. In FY1996, the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative funded 27 cities to trace crime guns. By FY2004, over 60 cities were involved. The Bush Administration expanded Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) and YCGII to 80 cities in FY2005. However, ATF discontinued YCGII in FY2005 and focused on promoting the PSN program for violence reduction. ATF published YCGII reports from 1997 to 2000 with anonymized firearm trace data. Trace data was also available to researchers with disclosure restrictions after five years. After ATF released trace data with a five-year delay, researchers found potential for new insights on illegal gun trafficking at regional levels. However, some noted limitations in the firearms trace data that hindered national-level conclusions. ATF defines a \"crime gun\" as any firearm used illegally or in a crime, including abandoned firearms suspected of involvement. Most traced firearms fall under this definition, but data may be biased as they are mainly recovered by law enforcement. The firearms trace database is used by law enforcement to aid investigations, but it is not specifically for tracking \"crime gun\" statistics. Despite challenges like poor recordkeeping, firearm trace data, along with other investigative information, help ATF target regulatory and investigative resources effectively. Federal law mandates FFLs to report multiple handgun transfers to the Attorney General. The Federal law mandates FFLs to report multiple handgun transfers to the Attorney General within five consecutive business days. The information must also be forwarded to state or local law enforcement agencies, with strict regulations on record disclosure and destruction to prevent the creation of a firearms registry. State or local agencies must certify compliance with these requirements every six months. ATF uses firearm trace data and multiple handgun sales reports to enhance firearms-trafficking investigations. ATF analyzes multiple handgun sales reports and firearms-trafficking data to target armed criminals and traffickers. They work with researchers to identify trafficking indicators and reported that out of 83,200 FFLs, about 1,020 had 10 or more traced firearms. ATF focused enforcement on a small percentage of FFLs with high trace numbers to prevent illegal firearm diversion. This approach influenced municipalities to pursue civil lawsuits against the gun industry for gun violence. Despite ATF's clarification that trace frequency alone doesn't indicate criminal activity, gun control advocates used this data to identify and publish FFL names. Gun control advocates used ATF data to identify \"bad apple\" FFLs linked to crime guns, leading to calls for stricter regulations. Despite ATF's refusal to disclose certain data to Chicago, the 7th Circuit rejected their arguments. The Tiahrt amendment played a role in limiting the disclosure of trace and multiple handgun sales data. The Tiahrt amendment limited ATF from releasing trace data for purposes other than criminal investigations. Mayors filed civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers based on defective firearms, improper marketing, and public nuisance arguments. Some cases used ATF data to show liability, leading to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act to limit gun manufacturers' tort liability. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (P.L. 109-92) limits the liability of gun manufacturers and dealers from civil actions for damages resulting from criminal misuse of firearms. The city of New York pursued a public nuisance civil suit against gun manufacturers using ATF data, which was restricted from disclosure by the Tiahrt amendment. The Tiahrt amendment restricts access to firearm trace data for the purpose of conducting ATF trace requests in criminal investigations. Proponents argue that the data should be confidential and only used to solve crimes, not for civil lawsuits against firearms manufacturers. Opponents believe that analyzing firearm trace data is essential to cracking down on irresponsible gun dealers and informing law enforcement about the source of crime guns. The Tiahrt amendment restricts access to firearm trace data for criminal investigations. A coalition of city mayors led by Mayor Bloomberg supports repealing the amendment, while the Fraternal Order of Police and ATF want to keep it. Various bills have been introduced in Congress to either codify or repeal the Tiahrt amendment. The Tiahrt language, included in various appropriations bills, restricts access to firearm trace data for criminal investigations. It was modified to allow the release of aggregate firearms trace data on illegal gun trafficking but still prohibits using the data to sue gun manufacturers and dealers. This language was enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 and the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 without public debate."
