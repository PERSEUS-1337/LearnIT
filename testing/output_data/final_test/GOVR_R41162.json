    "content": "The 112th Congress may consider legislation to fund, reauthorize, and amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 within the context of debates on federal spending, economic development assistance, and economic recovery. The Act authorized the creation of the Economic Development Administration to help regions in economic distress through grants, technical assistance, and research. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides funding for infrastructure projects, technical assistance, and economic development strategies. Grants are awarded competitively to various entities including states, local governments, colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations. EDA assistance programs include Public Works grants for infrastructure projects supporting job creation, and Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA) grants for strategic planning and implementation activities. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides funding for infrastructure projects, technical assistance, and economic development strategies. Grants are awarded competitively to various entities including states, local governments, colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Activities eligible under Public Works grants include capitalizing Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs) for businesses in areas with economic dislocation. Planning grants cover administrative expenses for Economic Development Districts (EDDs) and tribes formulating Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies (CEDS). Technical Assistance grants provide management services for projects in distressed areas. Research and Evaluation grants support research on economic development practices. Trade Adjustment Assistance grants offer technical support for firms affected by international trade. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides funding for infrastructure projects, technical assistance, and economic development strategies. Grants are awarded competitively to various entities including states, local governments, colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Climate Change Mitigation grants support projects promoting energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse emissions in distressed communities. The agency has regional offices responsible for reviewing funding requests, providing technical assistance, and administering grants. Congress may consider granting more flexibility in managing Revolving Loan Funds (RLFs) and adjusting cost share thresholds to assist the most distressed areas. Congress may consider changing requirements for transferring federal interest in EDA-financed projects to allow more local flexibility in fund usage. They could also expand the role of Economic Development Districts and mandate greater cooperation among federal agencies, state, and local governments for economic development. Grantees can use EAA grants to capitalize Revolving Loan Funds for businesses unable to secure bank financing. The Revolving Loan Funds (RLF) program allows businesses to access financing when unable to secure bank loans. Repayments cover administrative costs and recapitalize the RLF for additional loans. Local administrators must operate RLFs indefinitely, but EDA can terminate them for cause. In FY2009, 458 organizations managed 578 RLFs with $852 million in assets, a significant funding source. However, the program has faced criticism for inadequate monitoring and reporting, highlighted in a 2007 audit by the Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General. The report criticized EDA's administration of RLFs, highlighting failures in capital utilization, compliance monitoring, oversight, and utilization of audit reports. Recommendations included developing an action plan, setting capital utilization percentages, implementing uniform cash sequestering policies, and improving grantee financial report collection and evaluation. On January 27, 2010, EDA published final rules in the Federal Register to address issues raised in the OIG report. The revised regulations included a web-based reporting system for grantees to upload data, revised reporting forms for closer program monitoring, specific violations that could lead to program suspension, and a requirement for independent compliance and loan quality reviews for RLF grantees. The EDA implemented new rules in response to OIG concerns, including requiring independent compliance and loan quality reviews for RLFs every three years. Local administrators want more flexibility in using RLF funds for other EDA-eligible activities. The NADO representative suggested amending PWEDA to address these issues. The economic development analyst recommended amending the PWEDA to allow EDA-capitalized RLFs to relinquish their federal identity after initial funds have been loaned, repaid, and fully revolved. This would reduce EDA's management burden and grant local grantees more flexibility in fund usage. Recent regulatory changes already provide some flexibility, such as using repayments for administrative expenses and a streamlined reporting system to reduce paperwork. The RLF recipient's report was reduced from 12 hours to 2.9 hours. EDA assistance limits federal contribution to 50% of project costs in areas with high unemployment or low income. Communities meeting eligibility thresholds must provide 50% of project costs. EDA may provide supplemental grants to reduce the community's cost-share obligation. The EDA has established thresholds based on unemployment rate and per-capita income to determine the federal cost-share for projects. Few areas qualify for the maximum percentage of EDA supplemental assistance due to high thresholds. Less than 100 counties were eligible for an 80% federal cost share out of 750 areas that received grants in FY2008. The EDA has established thresholds based on unemployment rate and per-capita income to determine the federal cost-share for projects. A provision in S. 782 would lower eligibility thresholds for EDA supplemental grants, returning to pre-2006 levels. EDA may assume the total cost of a project for Indian tribes, disaster areas, and areas with exhausted taxing powers. EDA retains interest in property financed with EDA funds for at least 20 years, or the useful life of the property. The EDA supports changes to reduce the time horizon for selling EDA-financed assets and calculating repayment of federal interest. S. 782, The Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011, includes provisions reflecting these recommendations. The Development Revitalization Act of 2011, reauthorizing and amending the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, was introduced by Senator Boxer and supported by Senator Inhofe. The bill addresses issues such as eligibility factors, federal cost shares, the use of RLFs, and the conversion of the federal interest in EDA projects. Senator Inhofe's amendment requires the GAO to identify federal programs that duplicate within 90 days of the act's passage. The bill, reported on May 2, 2011, proposes modifications to the PWEDA to increase local flexibility in EDA assistance, recognize business incubators, address economic distress in specific sectors, adjust federal-local cost share measures, and allow greater flexibility in program administration. The bill proposes modifications to the PWEDA to increase local flexibility in EDA assistance, adjust federal-local cost share measures, target assistance to communities in economic distress, encourage regional cooperation, and authorize $500 million in funding for EDA activities over the next five years. Eligibility for EDA grants is based on areas with high unemployment rates or low per-capita income. The EDA offers public works and economic adjustment assistance grants to distressed areas with special needs due to severe unemployment or economic dislocation. Changes in eligibility criteria have increased the number of economically distressed areas over time, with income being the primary qualifying factor. Urban areas qualify based on unemployment, while rural areas qualify based on income. The EDA offers grants to distressed areas based on unemployment or income criteria. S. 782 bill includes provision for EAA grants to communities affected by job loss in various sectors, international trade, disasters, military base closures, etc. The EDA provides grants to distressed areas based on unemployment or income criteria. The inclusion of additional factors for \"economic distress\" has allowed more areas to become eligible for EDA assistance over the years. The EDA has expanded assistance to more areas over the years, with the number of qualifying areas nearly doubling from 1970 to 1973. By 1998, around 90% of counties qualified for EDA assistance. The federal contribution to projects requires a local matching share, and S. 782 aims to adjust cost share requirements based on unemployment and income levels. S. 782 aims to adjust cost share requirements for EDA projects based on unemployment and income levels, with federal-local cost shares ranging from 50% to 80% depending on the area's economic indicators. The bill, S. 782, adjusts cost share requirements for EDA projects based on economic indicators like unemployment and income levels. It includes exceptions to the cost share schedule and allows EDA to establish additional eligibility criteria for areas facing economic challenges, with the federal share not exceeding 80% of project cost. Additional criteria may be set by the Secretary to address severe economic circumstances, with the federal share capped at 80%. 503(a) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 is amended to include \"outmigration\" after \"regional unemployment.\" S. 782 proposes changes to EDA financing, allowing for 75% to 100% coverage of project costs, with exceptions for Indian tribes and disaster areas. It also grants flexibility to administrators of RLFs. S. 782 would grant administrators of RLFs the flexibility to convert assets to other uses based on specific grounds, allowing for the sale of assets to fund other eligible activities or retention of repayments for the same purpose. The bill S. 782 would provide flexibility for administrators of RLFs to convert assets for other PWEDA-eligible activities or retain repayments for strategic reuse. It aims to assist underfunded EDDs in accessing additional resources and improve the administration of RLFs by setting aside 2% of funds for tracking systems and seeking input from various stakeholders. Additionally, the bill authorizes $5 million annually for Brightfield Demonstration projects. The EDA Reauthorization Act of 2004 authorized funds for redevelopment projects focusing on renewable energy technologies. The bill S. 782 aims to reduce dependence on foreign oil by supporting projects that enhance energy and water efficiencies. It also proposes shortening the period for EDA's reversionary interest in property from 20 to 10 years and requires establishing time frames for economic development objectives before providing assistance for construction projects. The EDA Reauthorization Act of 2004 authorized funds for redevelopment projects focusing on renewable energy technologies. Bill S. 782 outlines conditions for terminating federal interest in a property, allowing EDA to do so if obligations are met within the specified time frame. Recipients can also request termination, with repayment required based on the fair market value of the federal share of the project. S. 782 establishes a minimum 10-year holding period for EDA-assisted properties before full repayment of federal interest is required. It also sets a minimum appropriation of $31 million or 12% of funds for Economic Development District activities for fiscal years 2011 through FY2015. S. 782 would increase EDA appropriations to $291 million, strengthening the role of EDDs in coordinating economic development activities. It aims to promote intergovernmental cooperation and amend PWEDA to recognize new regional commissions. The bill, S. 782, proposes to recognize three new regional commissions - Southeast Crescent, Northern Border, and Southwest Border - for EDA assistance. It also includes university centers and EDDs as recipients of EDA technical assistance grants to support regional economic development through public-private partnerships. Supporters argue it promotes regional and federal cooperation, while detractors raise concerns about potential duplication of EDA programs. The bill, S. 782, aims to enhance cooperation between EDA and the Department of Labor for economic and workforce development strategies. It encourages collaboration with various government entities and allows for increased federal funding for planning grants. Additionally, it expands eligible activities for research grants to include peer exchange programs promoting industry best practices. The bill also mandates the General Accountability Office to report to the Senate Committee. The bill requires the GAO to identify federal programs that may duplicate efforts with EDA, including programs from HUD, USDA, and SBA. Concerns about duplication in federal assistance programs have grown as Congress aims to reduce spending. The bill also sets a multiyear funding level of $500 million for EDA. The legislation sets a multiyear funding level of $500 million for EDA, authorizing technical assistance and research grants. The Senate debated the bill for six days before rejecting a cloture motion on June 21, 2011. The Senate rejected a cloture motion on S. 782, a bill related to the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Senator Boxer tried to stop filibustering of the legislation, while Senator Coburn raised concerns about the effectiveness of EDA programs. 99 amendments were filed, but most were not relevant to the bill. Several amendments were introduced during floor debate on S. 782, including proposals to terminate EDA and its programs, eliminate specific EDA programs, reduce federal cost share for EDA projects, transfer EDA functions to HUD, and eliminate funding for all EDA programs except EAA with an annual appropriation of $150 million. Despite the introduction of these amendments, none were considered or voted on during Senate debate on S. 782. Additionally, non-germane amendments related to improving the regulatory process for small businesses were also introduced and considered. Amendments proposed for S. 782 included improving regulatory process for small businesses, reforming electronic debit card transactions, prohibiting federal funds for ethanol blender pumps, and repealing ethanol excise tax credit. Only one amendment was agreed upon, increasing funding for EDA programs to $500 million annually from 2011 to 2015, which was more than requested by the Obama Administration. The Administration objected to the proposed authorization levels in S. 782. The Obama Administration objected to the proposed authorization levels for EDA programs, stating that the bill would authorize higher spending levels than requested. The Administration's FY2012 request for EDA was $324.9 million, a 14.6% increase from the previous year. The request included $40.6 million for salaries and expenses and $284.3 million for Economic Development Assistance Programs, with funding allocated for various programs like the 21st Century Innovation Infrastructure program.
