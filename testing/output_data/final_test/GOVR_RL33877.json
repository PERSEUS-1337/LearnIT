    "content": "During the 110th Congress, U.S. relations with China remained smooth with regular high-level visits and military cooperation. Despite growing connections, issues persisted over Taiwan and other disputes. China became the largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, with $600 billion by the end of 2008. During the 110th Congress, concerns arose over China's intentions towards Taiwan, disputes over intellectual property rights, exchange rate manipulation, and product safety. U.S. policymakers expressed worries about China's growing global power and influence, prompting calls for reassessment of U.S. policies. China's role in addressing the U.S. financial system issues became crucial, leading to heavy purchases of U.S. assets to stabilize the renminbi against the dollar. China's central bank accumulated $1.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves by the 110th Congress in December 2008, becoming a significant purchaser of U.S. Treasuries and debt. U.S. policymakers were concerned about economic and political risks if China altered its purchase patterns or used its position for diplomatic leverage. The 2008 financial crisis and proposed financial rescue programs led to increased U.S. government borrowing, with China poised to be a major buyer of this debt. The financial crisis in 2008 led to global economic decision-making shifting to the G-20 countries, where China played a significant role. Concerns about tainted Chinese products affected U.S.-China relations during the 110th Congress. In early 2007, tainted pet food exports from China led to pet deaths in the US. Menu Foods initiated a massive recall, which expanded to other brands. The FDA halted imports of wheat gluten from a Chinese company due to contamination. The Chinese government initially denied the issue but later admitted to exporting tainted products. This incident sparked a series of recalls of Chinese imports including fish, tires, toothpaste, and toys. In August 2007, there were numerous recalls of Chinese-manufactured products in the US, including electric throws, baby cribs, bicycles, clothing, and more. In September 2008, concerns arose about melamine-tainted infant formula and milk powder in China, leading to illnesses and deaths in babies. In response to melamine-tainted milk incidents in China, the government set standards for melamine levels in milk products and ordered a recall of all products before a certain date. The 110th Congress addressed product safety from China with various legislation, including condemning the Chinese government for poor safety practices. The 110th Congress addressed product safety from China with legislation such as increasing safety standards for infants and toddler products. Bilateral efforts on the quality of Chinese exports to the United States had been ongoing for several years, including a memorandum of understanding signed between the CPSC and China's AQSIQ. The two agencies held Consumer Product Safety Summits in Beijing and Washington D.C. in 2005 and 2007 respectively. The United States, China, and the European Union collaborated on consumer product safety initiatives in 2008, including meetings in Beijing and Brussels. The U.S. FDA opened an office in Beijing to inspect Chinese food and medicine. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing and other cities. Beijing spent $43 billion on preparations, facing controversies leading up to the games. Multiple interest groups opposed to various PRC behaviors saw China's hosting of the 2008 Games as an opportunity to pressure Beijing to reform policies. These groups included Tibetan activists, Darfur supporters, and organizations advocating for journalistic freedom and cleaner environment during the games. Members of the 110th also supported some of these initiatives. Members of the 110th introduced legislation urging the PRC to use its influence to stop violence in Darfur and comply with U.N. directives. They also proposed resolutions calling for a boycott of the 2008 Beijing Olympics due to human rights abuses by the PRC and its support for other oppressive regimes. Legislation was introduced by members of the 110th urging the President to boycott the 2008 Olympic Games opening ceremonies unless China took action to stop genocide in Darfur and allow full deployment of the U.N.-African Union mission. Despite calls for a boycott, countries did not withdraw their teams or world leaders snub the opening ceremony. President Bush attended the games, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to do so. During the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China implemented strict security measures, including anti-terrorist teams, increased surveillance, and anti-aircraft missiles around the National Stadium. Despite designated protest parks, no public protests were approved. The issue of Tibet continued to strain U.S.-China relations during the 110th Congress. During the 110th Congress, controversy persisted over Tibet's political status within China, the role of the Dalai Lama, and the impact of Chinese control on Tibetan culture. The U.S. government recognizes Tibet as part of China, but some question the historical consistency of this stance. Congressional pressure led to the creation of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues in 1997, with Paula Dobriansky serving in this role. During the 110th Congress, the Dalai Lama was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, causing tension with Beijing. In his acceptance speech, he reiterated his stance on seeking autonomy for Tibet within China. The Dalai Lama reiterated his desire for Tibetan cultural preservation within China, which the PRC views as a path to independence. Demonstrations in 2008 started peacefully but escalated in Tibetan regions of China. In 2008, protests in Tibetan regions of China escalated, spreading to areas outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Demonstrations at monasteries in Lhasa led to violence on March 14, with mobs burning and looting establishments. Despite Chinese reports of weapons found in monasteries, protesters were shown using fists, rocks, and knives on China Central Television. The protests in Tibet in 2008 turned violent on March 14, with conflicting reports on the number of casualties. Official sources claimed 18 deaths, while the Tibetan government-in-exile reported 140. The violence included Tibetans and Han Chinese merchants being killed, some by police and some in fires set by the mob. The Tibetan government declared a \"people's war\" to suppress support for the Dalai Lama and independence aspirations. The protests in Tibet in 2008 led to an increased presence of PRC security forces in Tibetan areas, with reports of house-to-house searches for demonstrators. Despite Beijing sealing off Tibet to tourists and foreign reporters, isolated demonstrations continued during the enhanced security presence. March is a symbolic month for Tibetans, marking the anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising in 1959. On March 10 and October 7, Tibetan groups commemorated the 1959 Tibetan National Uprising and the 1950 PRC invasion of Tibet. The Dalai Lama criticized China for human rights violations and urged Tibetans to work peacefully for their rights. Tibetan exiles also began a protest march into Tibet from India to pressure Beijing for change. In January 2008, Tibetan activists launched the Tibetan People's Uprising Movement to end China's occupation of Tibet, coinciding with the Beijing Olympics and the 50th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. Their demands included the Dalai Lama's return, ending China's occupation, releasing political prisoners, and restoring rights to Tibetans. Controversy arose over media coverage of the March 2008 demonstrations in Tibet, with PRC officials accusing western media of bias. A PRC web log was created to show this bias by sharing videos of violence in Lhasa, pointing out misleading news photos, and highlighting errors in news stories. Tibetan supporters argued that PRC accounts omitted peaceful demonstrations preceding the riots and focused on Han Chinese victims. The PRC accused the Dalai Lama and Tibetan organizations of orchestrating the March 2008 unrest in Lhasa, alleging it was organized and premeditated. The PRC claimed that the Dalai Lama's dream of an independent Tibet was still active, exposing the separatist nature of the alleged \"peace\" and \"nonviolence\" advocated by the Dalai clique. The PRC accused the Dalai Lama of orchestrating unrest in Lhasa in March 2008, claiming it was premeditated. They criticized the Dalai Lama's alleged \"peace\" and \"nonviolence\" as hypocritical and deceitful. Beijing took steps in 2007 to ensure control over the selection process of the next Dalai Lama. The State Administration for Religious Affairs issued regulations in 2007 requiring government approval for Tibetan Buddhist reincarnations, seen as an attempt to control the selection process of the next Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama's envoy criticized the regulations as a threat to Tibetan religious identity. The 2007 reincarnation law inserted the PRC government into the selection process of the next Dalai Lama, which was criticized by the Dalai Lama's envoy as a threat to Tibetan religious identity. The U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibet is responsible for encouraging negotiations between the PRC government and the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile, as mandated by the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002. The Under Secretary's office submitted reports on Sino-Tibetan contacts and human rights practices in China, including Tibet. Reports in 2007 and 2008 highlighted poor human rights conditions in Tibet, with increased repression by the PRC government. Optimism in negotiations was slightly raised before a crackdown in March 2008. Progress in Sino-Tibetan negotiations raised optimism, but stalled in 2008. The Dalai Lama called a meeting of Tibetan exiles to explore new strategies. An earthquake in Sichuan Province in May 2008 further impacted the situation. The earthquake in Sichuan Province on May 12, 2008, with a magnitude of 7.9, caused over 69,000 deaths, injured hundreds of thousands, and left 5 million homeless. The quake zone included the Wolong National Nature Reserve, China's main giant panda breeding center, and received extensive media coverage. The tragedy led to global sympathy for China and praise for the government's response, overshadowing previous criticism over the Tibet crackdown. Many children perished in collapsed schools, highlighting a significant challenge in a country with strict building regulations. Many children died in collapsed schools during the 2008 Sichuan Province earthquake, leading to speculation about government investigations into school construction practices and pressure to reassess population control policies. The House and Senate in the 110th Congress adopted resolutions expressing condolences and support for quake victims. Initial casualty figures estimated 10,000 deaths, but the official count as of August 2008 was 69,222 deaths, 374,638 injuries, and 18,176 missing. In 2008, the Sichuan Province earthquake killed 69,222 people, injured 374,638, and left 18,176 missing. About 5 million were left homeless and 15 million displaced. Many lost their homes due to quake activity and were evacuated multiple times. Concerns arose about reservoirs at risk of collapse and villages with substantial damage. The Sichuan Province earthquake in 2008 caused extensive damage, with estimates of $9.6 billion in property damage to businesses and industrial enterprises, along with $2.2 billion in damage to transportation infrastructure. Foreign assistance, including $4.9 million from the U.S. Government, helped with humanitarian funding. Private American organizations also provided support, such as the National Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, the American Red Cross, and the Philadelphia Orchestra turning a concert into a charitable event. The earthquake in Sichuan Province in 2008 caused extensive damage, leading to a charitable event by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Beijing to raise funds for earthquake relief. Contention arose over the collapse of schools during the earthquake, with some blaming shoddy construction and corruption for the tragedy. The 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province caused extensive damage, leading to a charitable event by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Beijing to raise funds for earthquake relief. School design, unregulated work, outdated building codes, and lack of enforcement were cited as factors contributing to the collapse of schools during the earthquake. The loss of children was a special hardship in a country with a \"one-child\" policy, prompting speculation that public reaction to the quake may force the government to reassess population control policies. Local officials announced measures to allow parents who lost an only child to have another and offer reverse sterilization surgery for women who lost their only child in the quake. Chinese authorities were praised for their rapid response to the earthquake. Despite Chinese authorities being praised for their rapid response to the earthquake and willingness for press coverage, they faced criticism regarding school collapses. Parents in the quake zone demanded government investigations and harsh punishment for any official malfeasance. Some parent groups organized to increase pressure on the government, leading to widespread media coverage initially. However, Chinese authorities later prohibited the news media from questioning school construction practices, adopting a tougher stance. On June 4, 2008, police in Dujiangyan surrounded protesting parents, preventing them from further action. The departure of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in December 2006 led to changes in U.S. military leadership during the 110th Congress. New senior defense officials included Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Admiral Timothy Keating, Admiral Mike Mullen, and Admiral Gary Roughead, all prioritizing closer relations with China's military. U.S. officials in the 110th Congress expressed concerns about China's military budget, lack of transparency, espionage attempts, and assistance to rogue states. Allegations of PRC espionage in the U.S., such as the case of Mr. Chi Mak, continued to worry Congress. Chi Mak, a former employee of Power Paragon, was found guilty of conspiracy to violate export regulations and failing to register as a Chinese agent. He had helped develop high-tech Navy weapons technology, including details on Aegis-class battleships, quiet drive technology, electromagnetic artillery, and missile detection. Mak was sentenced to 24 \u00bd years in federal prison in March 2008 as part of a long-term Chinese espionage plan. The Pentagon released reports on China's Military Power during the 110th Congress in May 2007 and March 2008. The Pentagon reported in March 2008 that China was significantly enhancing its military capabilities, particularly focusing on a potential conflict with Taiwan and aiming to restrict access for third-party military forces, likely the United States. This build-up was seen as a long-term threat to Taiwan and the U.S. military presence in Asia. U.S. officials expressed concerns about China's military budget increase and urged for greater transparency in military affairs. PRC conducted its first successful anti-satellite test in 2007, destroying a weather satellite with a ballistic missile. The lack of advance notification to U.S. officials raised concerns about transparency in military matters. China's ASAT test in 2007 raised concerns about U.S. satellite vulnerability and China's commitment to peaceful space use. Critics also highlighted China's contribution to the issue of space debris. China's ambitious space program included manned flights in 2003, 2005, and 2008. China's space program achieved several milestones in 2007 and 2008, including manned flights and the launch of lunar probes. The program also included the release of a small satellite with potential military implications. U.S.-China military relations improved during this time, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates visiting Beijing for the first time. During his first official visit to China as Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates met with Defense Secretary Cao Gangchuan, Vice-Chairmen Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, and Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo. Agreements were reached on establishing a military hotline, enhancing dialogue and exchanges between military officers, and conducting exercises on humanitarian rescue and disaster relief. Gates also addressed China's anti-satellite weapon test and called for greater transparency in military intentions and modernization. Military contacts during the 110th Congress included visits by General Peter Pace and other senior-level officials. During 2007, high-ranking U.S. military officials visited China to enhance military ties and dialogue. The Defense Consultative Talks resulted in agreements to increase military cooperation and discuss nuclear policy. The U.S. also provided assistance to China after the Sichuan earthquake in May 2008. The PRC government denied U.S. military ships and aircraft requests to visit or take refuge in Hong Kong port starting from November 20, 2007. The rapid denials without explanation raised concerns among U.S. military officials. The first denial was to two U.S. minesweepers seeking refuge from a storm at sea. Admiral Timothy Keating criticized Beijing's refusal to offer safe harbor as inconsistent with peaceful rise and harmonious relations. The denial of port visits to U.S. military ships and aircraft in Hong Kong by the PRC government in November 2007 caused tensions. The denial of a Thanksgiving reunion for the Kitty Hawk aircraft carrier strike group was unexpectedly reversed after the ship had left Hong Kong waters. Beijing also denied a New Year's holiday port visit for a U.S. Navy frigate and landing rights for a U.S. Air Force cargo plane. The denials caught U.S. military officials by surprise and led to mixed responses from PRC officials. The denial of port visits to U.S. military ships in Hong Kong in November 2007 caused tensions, despite improved U.S.-China military relations. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had recently visited China. The denials did not disrupt the U.S.-PRC Defense Consultative Talks. China eventually allowed the Kitty Hawk visit after initially denying it for unclear reasons. China allowed the Kitty Hawk visit \"out of humanitarian considerations\" after a misunderstanding. Lack of coordination between PLA and other agencies may have contributed to China's contradictory behavior. The U.S. protested the denial of safe refuge to minesweepers, but China denied receiving any protest. China had received no U.S. protest regarding the denial of a port visit for the Kitty Hawk. The U.S. awaited clarification from Beijing about the decision, which Admiral Keating called \"perplexing.\" The request for the port visit was initially denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs but later reversed after the Kitty Hawk had already left for Japan. The PRC Embassy in Washington, DC stated that the USS Kitty Hawk requested to dock in Hong Kong for a family reunion, and China allowed it for humanitarian reasons. The US naval ships did not go to Hong Kong afterwards, which was considered a US matter. The Chinese position on the port call by USS Kitty Hawk was seen as impeccable, but it was speculated that China may have denied the visit to signal opposition to US arms sales to Taiwan. The denial of safe refuge to U.S. minesweepers in Hong Kong was seen as a signal against arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing objects to such sales as a violation of Sino-U.S. communiques. The U.S. carrier group's route through the Taiwan Strait raised concerns from the PRC. PRC spokespersons mentioned difficulties in U.S.-China relations, citing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the congressional gold medal awarded to the Dalai Lama. Large-scale military exercises were reportedly conducted by China's East and South China Sea fleets, possibly involving new stealth technologies. The exercises were seen as preparations for a possible use of military force against Taiwan, causing delays for airline passengers in southern China. The Kitty Hawk may have been in the region to monitor PRC exercises, causing delays for airline passengers. Economic issues in U.S.-China relations included a growing trade deficit, reaching $256 billion in 2007. The PRC was the second-largest U.S. trading partner during the 110th Congress, with total trade at $387 billion in 2007. During the 110th Congress, the U.S. faced economic issues with China, including a growing trade deficit that reached $256 billion in 2007. The PRC's restrictive trade practices and inability to protect U.S. intellectual property rights were highlighted. The World Trade Organization clothing and textile safeguards against Chinese products ended in 2008. The PRC established the China Investment Corporation with $200 billion in initial capital to manage foreign exchange reserves. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was established with $200 billion to manage foreign exchange reserves, raising concerns about China's global influence and impact on the US economy. U.S. observers worried about a shift in investment strategy away from U.S. Treasurys, potentially harming the already weakened U.S. economy. The U.S. Treasury Department released reports during the 110th Congress highlighting China's imbalanced economy, overly reliant on exports and lacking domestic consumer spending. The U.S. Treasury Department reports during the 110th Congress highlighted China's imbalanced economy, overly dependent on exports, and weak consumer spending at home. Calls for U.S. action to address China's currency restrictions were renewed, with concerns about the undervaluation of the renminbi (RMB) making Chinese exports cheaper and hindering U.S. producers' competitiveness. China shifted to a \"managed float\" policy for the RMB in 2005, using a basket of multiple currencies. The RMB appreciated by 20% against the dollar by the end of 2008, but U.S. congressional concerns persisted. In the 110th Congress, various measures were proposed to address currency exchange rate issues, including the Fair Currency Act, Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy Act, Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act, and Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act. The Currency Reform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007 required the U.S. Treasury Secretary to analyze foreign countries' exchange rate policies annually. In March 2007, countervailing duties were applied to two Chinese companies exporting glossy paper to the U.S., breaking a 23-year U.S. policy. Commerce Secretary cited a significant increase in imports and noted China's evolving economy. The U.S. took a new assertive stance against unfair competition from China, potentially leading to trade retaliation. China's criticism hinted at negative implications for the U.S.-China trade dialogue. Intellectual property rights protection was a key issue in bilateral trade. In 2007, IPR piracy in China cost U.S. firms $3.5 billion in lost sales. U.S. officials urged Beijing to improve IPR protection and filed two cases against China in the WTO. Bilateral dialogues between the U.S. and China were ongoing, with the form and substance of these dialogues to be determined in the Obama Administration. During his trip to China as Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson announced the creation of the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) in 2006. The SED aimed to enhance economic relations and support China's transition to a responsible global player. This dialogue reflected U.S. acknowledgment of China's growing development and international influence. The U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) during the 110th Congress resulted in multiple bilateral agreements and understandings, including increasing market access for the United States in China, cooperation on clean coal technology, and strengthening intellectual property rights. During the 110th Congress, the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) led to agreements on market access, clean coal technology, and intellectual property rights. Additionally, there was progress on product safety, financial reforms, energy, and environmental cooperation, as well as discussions on managing macroeconomic risk and the global financial crisis. The Senior Dialogue also took place during this time, focusing on bilateral issues. In 2008, the U.S.-China Senior Dialogue discussed foreign policy issues such as Taiwan, the Mumbai bombing, the crisis in Zimbabwe, and Iran. Taiwan remained a sensitive and complex bilateral policy issue for U.S. policymakers during the 110th Congress. China watchers were concerned about potential developments until May 2008. In May 2008, China watchers were concerned about potential cross-strait conflict due to Taiwan's unpredictable political environment. The balance of political power had teetered between two contending political party coalitions. The election of Ma Ying-jeou as president eased fears of cross-strait contention. President Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalist Party won the presidential election with a 2.2 million vote margin. He quickly improved cross-strait relations with China, leading to new agreements on direct charter flights and tourism. Members of the 110th Congress supported Taiwan's interests to enhance its international standing. In the 110th Congress, legislation was proposed to improve Taiwan's international standing, ease diplomatic restrictions on Taiwan officials, and support Taiwan's democratic development. This included measures such as requiring Senate confirmation for the U.S. director of the American Institute in Taiwan and calling for the lifting of restrictions on U.S. visits by senior Taiwan officials. Additionally, there was a measure expressing the sense of Congress to initiate negotiations on a free trade agreement with Taiwan. In the 110th Congress, legislation was proposed to improve Taiwan's international standing and support its democratic development. This included measures to ease diplomatic restrictions on Taiwan officials and initiate negotiations on a free trade agreement with Taiwan. Additionally, there were efforts to allow Taiwan to participate in the 2008 Olympics under its own name and to sell defense articles and services worth $6.4 billion to Taiwan. Taiwan faced delays in purchasing approved weaponry due to political disagreements, leading to a decline in defense readiness. The special arms acquisition budget was repeatedly stalled in the legislature, causing concerns about future U.S. defense commitments. However, in 2007, Taiwan's legislature passed an annual defense budget that included funds for the 2001 U.S. weapons package, easing concerns about defense spending. In 2007, Taiwan's legislature passed a $10.5 billion defense budget, including funds for a 2001 U.S. weapons package and a feasibility study for U.S.-made diesel submarines. Members of the 110th Congress were engaged in discussions on Taiwan's security and U.S. arms sales. Measures introduced included H.Res. 676, which passed in the House. The House passed several measures related to Taiwan's defense needs, including the transfer of naval vessels to TECRO and calls for more dialogue on the arms embargo against China. The House passed a bill related to Taiwan's defense needs, including arms sales. The new Ma Administration showed flexibility in Taiwan's U.N. bid, but faced objections from China. Despite a milder tone, Taiwan's request for \"meaningful participation\" in U.N. activities was not included in the agenda for the 63rd General Assembly. Taiwan's unsuccessful attempts to gain U.N. membership, including in the World Health Organization, under the DPP Administration of President Chen. Support in the 110th Congress for Taiwan's U.N. membership, with resolutions introduced but not taken up by the House. U.S. officials support Taiwan's membership in organizations where statehood is not an issue. Resumption of PRC-Taiwan talks during the 110th Congress. President Ma Ying-jeou aimed to normalize cross-strait ties by establishing a \"cross-strait common market\" and direct air links with China. He emphasized a \"three no's\" approach - no unification, no independence, and no use of force. Ma also proposed a \"diplomatic truce\" and stopped using \"dollar diplomacy.\" Taiwan collaborated with China in disaster relief after the Sichuan earthquake and resumed official talks in Beijing for the first time in a decade. Taiwan resumed official talks with China in 2008, leading to agreements on direct charter flights and increased tourism. Taiwan also implemented financial liberalization measures, allowing for yuan conversion and increased investments between the two sides. Taiwan's Ministry of Economics announced easing investment restrictions with the PRC in three steps over six months, including raising the investment cap for Taiwan companies and allowing PRC companies to invest in Taiwan. President Ma suggested using a unified name in international engagements to reduce divisiveness. Taiwan's SEF chairman aims to create a cross-strait economic cooperation agreement with China. Controversies arose, including a dispute over Taiwan's name at the 2008 Olympics. Taiwan prioritizes acquiring submarines as a deterrent against China. Critics of President Ma's policies felt official talks with China were insufficient, while opponents believed they were progressing too quickly. China's negotiators were seen as more experienced during the talks. China's robust international engagement since 2000 has sparked debate in the 110th Congress over its motivations and objectives in foreign policy. The United States' focus on military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan led to introspection on China's expanding international presence. Beijing's foreign policy objectives during this time included promoting economic development and securing energy resources. China's foreign policy objectives during the 110th Congress included enhancing economic development, securing energy resources, separating Taiwan, increasing international stature, and competing with U.S. supremacy through bilateral agreements, boundary dispute resolutions, and participation in multilateral organizations. China's economic development and need for energy resources had a significant impact on environmental issues during the 110th Congress. China's heavy dependence on coal made it a major contributor to global CO2 emissions, surpassing the United States in 2007. PRC leaders recognized the need for sustainable practices and implemented environmental laws and regulations to address the issue. During the 110th Congress, China focused on economic development, leading to challenges in addressing pollution issues. The country's rapid growth and international influence outpaced its internal political and institutional development, causing social and economic disparities. Strains were observed between the central government in Beijing and provincial/municipal governments. The United States engaged in energy and environment discussions with China through the Strategic Economic Dialogue. In 2007-2008, internal strains were observed in China between socialist left and capitalist right, economic growth advocates and sustainable development proponents, and the wealthy and the poor. Beijing leaders were concerned about the social and political implications, leading to increased debate and maneuvering. The Chinese Communist Party emphasized economic investment and export-oriented reform at its 17th Party Congress, with a focus on encouraging domestic consumption. The Party Congress emphasized the importance of encouraging domestic consumption and striving for slower, balanced growth. Party Secretary Hu Jintao reaffirmed his leadership role, along with five other senior leaders, while two new members, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, are seen as potential successors. The focus is on adhering to the \"Scientific Development Concept\" to improve livelihoods, employment, health, education, energy resources, and environmental quality. The 18th Party Congress in 2012 saw Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang rise to the Politburo as the first of the \"fifth generation\" of China's potential leadership. Economic changes in 2007-2008 led to discontent among social groups, with recurring issues like land confiscation protests and factory closures. Unique events like the 2008 Sichuan earthquake also fueled public dissatisfaction. The 2008 Sichuan earthquake fueled public dissatisfaction with the PRC government due to corruption and shoddy construction, leading to more destruction and death. Growing scandals involving tainted food and consumer products also contributed to social upheavals, with evidence of PRC citizens becoming more assertive about their rights. Public protests in Guangxi Province in 2007 highlighted issues with family planning policies, including heavy fines and confiscation of goods. The \"one-child\" policy was linked to the Sichuan earthquake, where the destruction of schools resulted in parents losing their only child. In response to product safety scandals, the PRC suspended licenses of companies violating standards. Zheng Xiaoyu was executed for bribery in drug approvals. High melamine levels in milk sickened thousands of infants. Families sued Sanlu for injuries, leading to a nationwide milk recall in 2008. In late 2008, Beijing recalled all milk products produced before September 14, 2008, due to high melamine levels. The government set standards for permissible melamine amounts in milk. Social pressure led to positive responses from the government, but harsh crackdowns were also seen, such as the arrest of activist Huang Qi and increased repression against Tibetans. In 2008, China cracked down on Tibet protests and Uighur separatists in Xinjiang. The East Turkestan Islamic Movement was targeted in a raid, resulting in casualties. Uighur groups claimed responsibility for deadly attacks leading up to the Olympic Games, including bombings in Shanghai, Wenzhou, Guangzhou, and Yunnan. In 2005, Beijing imposed new rules to limit electronic news and opinion pieces in China, viewing them as threats to government control. The Internet, cell phones, and text messaging have become dominant sources of information for PRC citizens. The Chinese government imposed regulations in 2005 to restrict online content, requiring Internet service providers to record and report news information. Penalties for non-compliance included fines, termination of Internet access, and imprisonment. U.S. companies faced scrutiny for cooperating with these restrictions, as seen in the case of Yahoo revealing a journalist's identity to Chinese authorities. The journalist Shi Tao was sentenced to ten years in prison for subversive activities after his email account was revealed. In 2008, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on Cisco's involvement in helping China build an Internet monitoring system. Internet usage in China grew rapidly, with 210 million users by 2007. The Bush Administration preferred targeted pressure on human rights cases over a broader approach. The U.S. focused on individual human rights cases and rule of law issues, with little impact on PRC policies. However, domestic social demands in China led to increased accountability and transparency in government. The PRC continued to crack down on unauthorized religious groups, including Falun Gong and the Three Grades of Servants Church. The U.S. Department of State reported on China's poor record on religious freedom, with the State Administration for Religious Affairs requiring churches to register with the government. Unregistered house churches were considered illegal and often repressed, with varying levels of repression across different localities. Communist Party officials maintained that religious belief is incompatible with Party membership. Party officials reiterated that religious belief is not compatible with Party membership. US funding for family planning programs in China, including the UNFPA, remained prohibited during the 110th Congress due to allegations of coercion in PRC family planning. The PRC continues its restrictive \"one-child\" policy, but there are signs of potential changes in government approach. In 2004, China's government considered scrapping the \"one-child\" policy due to low birth rates and economic implications for the aging population. In 2005, the government planned to make it illegal to selectively abort female fetuses. Public protests in Guangxi Province in 2007 highlighted growing assertiveness on reproductive rights in China. In Guangxi Province, violent protests erupted over harsh family planning policies, including heavy fines and confiscation of goods. The \"one-child\" policy was linked to the Sichuan earthquake tragedy. In December 2008, 303 Chinese intellectuals called for political reforms and democratic freedoms in \"Charter 08.\" The authors of a document highlighted the importance of freedom, equality, and human rights as universal values, criticizing the Chinese government for its authoritarian approach to modernization. They questioned China's direction in the twenty-first century, urging a shift towards embracing universal human values and democratic principles. The document, known as Charter 08, attracted more supporters despite PRC government's crackdown.
