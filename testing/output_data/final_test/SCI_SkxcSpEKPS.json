To improve image quality, deep learning is combined with adversarial nets to generate clear positron images. The process involves encoding medical CT images, extracting positron image features, constructing a positron image memory, and training the model until convergence. Experiments have shown the feasibility of generating high-quality positron images for industrial use. In recent years, there is a growing demand for non-destructive testing devices in industrial sectors like aviation and chemical engineering. This paper explores the use of positron emission imaging technology for detecting faults and defects in closed chambers. Experiments have shown the potential of generating rare positron images for industrial non-destructive testing. Positron emission imaging technology is used for industrial non-destructive testing. It can penetrate dense metal materials to obtain undisturbed trace images of objects for fault detection analysis. The technology is based on the decay of a radioactive positron nucleus, resulting in positron annihilation and the production of gamma photon pairs. PET technology uses gamma photon pairs to create medical images through reconstruction algorithms like MLEM and OSEM. It is widely used in clinical diagnosis due to its high imaging quality. In industrial non-destructive testing, positron emission imaging faces challenges like harsh detection environments and short sampling times, resulting in lower image quality that requires further processing. In this paper, the authors propose using adversarial networks with a positron image memory module based on an attention mechanism to enhance image quality in industrial non-destructive testing. By utilizing medical images as datasets and incorporating knowledge of migration learning, they develop a positron image generation network through joint training.

The network framework improves the details of generated images and enhances applicability in industrial non-destructive testing. By combining attention-based mechanisms in image feature extraction, a memory module containing industrial positron image features is constructed to generate images in a specific domain. The network is optimized through joint training and convergence is achieved. The model of GAN was optimized, leading to successful convergence and passing of The Turing test. GAN has been a research hotspot in unsupervised learning since 2014, with advancements in network structure and training stability.

Additionally, GANs have shown potential for application in professional and specific fields, providing feasibility for their use in generating high-quality images. Innovatively introducing neural network knowledge for positron image processing, a high-quality image is obtained through experimental verification. The structure of the positron image countermeasure generation network based on memory module is illustrated in Figure 1, utilizing the GAN model with discriminative and generative nets to generate pseudo-data close to real data distribution. The GAN model utilizes a binary classification of real and generated data, with the generator's performance indicated by the confidence level. The model is optimized through continuous iteration during training, aiming for the two sets of data to be indistinguishable. GAN is based on zero-sum game theory, where the discriminator distinguishes between real and generative data, while the generator aims to make generated data consistent with real data. The mathematical model is expressed in formula equation 1, with x as real images, z as noise to the generator, G(Z) as generated images, and D(x) as the probability of judging real images. The GAN model fits n-dimensional image vectors and samples with random noise in an unsupervised state. To control data generation, a prior is added to restrict the model training for specific areas. Due to limited industrial positron image data, migration learning is used with medical images to construct an encoder based on variational auto-encoder. The variational auto-encoder samples medical image data X to fit a distribution p(x) using implicit variable Z, assumed to follow a Gauss distribution. The encoder samples Z from a standard normal distribution to obtain Variance and Mean of Sample Data X. The clustering process parametrizes the mean and variance of the normal distribution exclusive to X k to sample Z k. This aims to create a more suitable generation model for positron images. The text proposes an image feature memory module based on attention mechanism to extract domain image features for positron image generation in the industrial field. It involves using neural networks to extract rare positron image features, combining them with hidden variables using attention mechanism to create an image memory model, and training adversarial nets to generate positron images. Principal component analysis is used for positron sample data extraction and vector space transformation to reduce dimensionality. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of positron data by transforming it into a new coordinate system. The variance of the first principal component is maximized, leading to a decrease in dimensionality. The data matrix is de-averaged, and important feature vectors are identified using Lagrange theorem. Convolutional neural networks are then used to construct an image feature extraction network. The image feature extraction network constructed by CNN consists of two convolution layers and one non-linear output layer. Small image slices are extracted from sample images, pixels are traversed for convolution operations, and hashing and histogram statistics are performed in the output layer to generate a feature vector. A Memory Module Based on Attention Mechanism fuses positron eigenvectors with hidden variables of medical images to focus on positron features and enhance the utilization of scarce data during training. The model emphasizes global attention to extract all positron image features. The model focuses on extracting positron image features by aligning image data vectors and using medical images as query vectors. The weights equation is calculated to determine the contribution degree of each feature, which is then fused according to the weight ratio. The generative network, based on DenseNet, utilizes positron image features repeatedly to strengthen their contribution in the model. The generative model utilizes positron image features repeatedly to strengthen their contribution in the model. The network structure includes 33 convolution layers, Batch Normalization, and ReLU activation layers. Feature reuse is achieved by concatenating output feature maps from previous layers and reducing parameters without losing features. The discriminative model uses a Markov Model based on PatchGAN with full convolution layers to discriminate specific images in a domain. The output is an n-dimensional matrix, with the mean used as the final output. The network structure includes Batch Normalization, 1*1 convolution, and 2*2 average-pooling layers. Each layer in the Denseblock is associated with all previous layers for global state feedback during training. The discriminative network uses a Markov Model based on PatchGAN with full convolution layers to judge receptive fields in images. An additional attention perception loss function is added to better characterize positron image features. The loss function consists of two parts: L G AN and L A P G, with L A P G measuring the distribution distance between generated data and positron images. The model is designed using an encoder to obtain hidden vectors of medical images and principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality. The memory module and adversarial nets are trained jointly, updating parameters until the optimal model is achieved. The discriminator refers to pixel and each batch is 70*70, with a learning rate of 0.0002. The model is trained iteratively using the Adam algorithm.
