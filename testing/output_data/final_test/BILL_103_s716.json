    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vegetable Ink Printing Act of 1994\". The Congress finds that over 95% of Federal printing uses lithographic inks, which contain various oils including vegetable oil. Increasing the use of vegetable oil in lithographic ink would reduce nonrenewable energy use, be more environmentally friendly, reduce emissions, and promote renewable agricultural products. Technology already exists to use vegetable oil in lithographic ink and in some cases, eliminate petroleum distillates. The use of vegetable oil-based ink in Federal Government printing can help promote renewable agricultural products and reduce nonrenewable energy use. It is cost-effective and could potentially increase demand for domestic vegetable crops. This Act aims to require the use of vegetable oil-based ink in all Federal printing. The Act aims to require Federal agencies to use ink with maximum vegetable oil and renewable materials for lithographic printing, ensuring cost competitiveness with petroleum-based inks. Federal agencies must adhere to specific printing requirements outlined in Section 3 of the Act. Federal agencies are prohibited from using lithographic printing with ink containing less than specified percentages of vegetable oil, except under certain exceptions determined by the agency head in consultation with the Public Printer. Federal agencies must use ink with specified percentages of vegetable oil in lithographic printing, unless the Public Printer determines that using vegetable oil-based ink is significantly more costly than other available ink options. The agency head must report this determination to the Committee on Government within 30 days. The term \"Federal agency\" in this Act refers to executive, military, and other government branches, including independent regulatory agencies. The agency head must report any determination to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. The curr_chunk is about the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States, who also serves as the President of the Senate."
