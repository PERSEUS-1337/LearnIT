    "content": "The Act titled \"Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Act\" requires congressional notification for major acquisition program breaches under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Act \"Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Act\" mandates notifications for breaches in major acquisition programs within the Department of Homeland Security. Notifications must be made to various officials within 30 days of identifying a breach, and to the Secretary if the breach results in specific cost overruns or schedule delays. The Component Acquisition Executive must notify key officials within five business days of a breach in a major acquisition program exceeding 180 days delay or failing performance thresholds. A remediation plan and root cause analysis must be conducted. If a breach occurs in a major acquisition program, the program manager must submit a remediation plan and root cause analysis to key officials. The plan should explain the breach circumstances. The breach in a major acquisition program requires a remediation plan that includes prior cost estimating information and a root cause analysis to determine the underlying causes of shortcomings in cost, schedule, or performance. This analysis should consider factors like unrealistic performance expectations, baseline estimates, technology maturity, and manufacturing issues. Excessive manufacturing or integration risk, unanticipated design, engineering, manufacturing, or technology integration issues, changes to program scope, inadequate program funding, and legislative or legal challenges. The curr_chunk discusses proposing corrective actions to address cost growth, schedule delays, or performance issues in coordination with the Component Acquisition Executive for the program. It also emphasizes the importance of explaining the rationale behind the proposed corrective actions and discussing all options considered. The Under Secretary for Management reviews the remediation plan for corrective actions within 30 days of submission. They may approve the plan or propose alternative corrective actions. The Under Secretary for Management must submit a copy of the remediation plan and root cause analysis to Congress within 30 days of completion. They also need to provide a statement detailing corrective actions taken for the major acquisition program, along with a justification for those actions. If a breach occurs in a major acquisition program, the Under Secretary for Management must notify the congressional homeland security committees in the next quarterly report. Significant cost overruns or delays exceeding 20% or 12 months from the baseline must also be reported. The Under Secretary for Management must certify in writing that a major acquisition program is essential to the Department's mission, has no alternatives with equal or greater capability at a lower cost and faster pace, has reasonable acquisition schedule and cost estimates, and has adequate management structure for cost, schedule, and performance control. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to acquisition programs, including acquisition, acquisition program, acquisition program baseline, and best practices. These definitions outline the process by which the Department acquires property or services to support its missions and goals. Best practices in acquisition involve a knowledge-based approach to capability development, including identifying needs, assessing alternatives, establishing requirements, realistic cost assessments, securing funding, demonstrating maturity, using milestones, and standardized processes. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of adopting standardized processes, establishing a qualified workforce, and integrating capabilities into the Department's operations. It defines a breach in a major acquisition program as a failure to meet cost, schedule, or performance thresholds. The term 'congressional homeland security committees' is also defined. The Component Acquisition Executive is the senior official responsible for overseeing acquisition and program management within a component, ensuring compliance with laws and policies. The Component Acquisition Executive oversees acquisition and program management, ensuring compliance with Federal law, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and Department acquisition management directives. A major acquisition program is defined as one estimated to cost at least $300,000,000 over its life cycle. Sec. 836. Congressional notification and other requirements for major acquisition program breach. Passed the House of Representatives on March 20, 2017. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
