Congress finds that the national unemployment rates for college graduates are high, with an average student loan debt of $29,400. Small businesses in the US are struggling in the current economic climate. Recent college graduates need workplace experience to develop skills and entrepreneurial qualities. Small businesses benefit from graduates' information and technology skills, helping them compete in the global economy. Establishment of America Rising Program. The America Rising Program, established by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, provides grants to eligible employers to cover compensation for recent college graduates and grants to graduates for further postsecondary education in math, science, engineering, or technology. Grants are awarded based on terms set by the Secretary, including the deferral of federal student loan obligations for participants. The America Rising Program offers grants to eligible employers to cover compensation for recent college graduates and grants to graduates for further education in specific fields. Employers can use the grant to defray the cost of compensating up to 2 recent college graduates participating in the program. The program provides grants to eligible employers to cover compensation for recent college graduates, with a maximum grant amount of $25,000 per graduate. Recent college graduates receiving the grant are eligible for Federal student aid without regard to their loan status. The term \"employer\" refers to a small business concern or a major corporation with operations in an enterprise zone or an area with high unemployment rates. An enterprise zone is defined as a HUBzone under the Small Business Act, and an institution of higher education follows the definition in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 defines a \"major corporation\" as an employer with annual revenue of at least $5,000,000 and employing at least 50 employees. A \"recent college graduate\" is an individual who has received a baccalaureate or associate degree within 24 months before being awarded a grant under this section, and has not previously received such a degree. In the Higher Education Act of 1965, \"institution of higher education\" is defined. The Small Business Act defines \"small business concern.\" $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2015-2017 for this Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
