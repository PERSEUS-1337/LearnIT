    "content": "Economic activity and people are increasingly concentrated in the coastal zone, leading to conflicts between preservation and development. Coordinated planning is needed to balance wise development with protecting natural resources. Pressures for both preservation and development have grown more intense as people migrate to coastal areas for economic opportunities, retirement, and recreation. Coastal natural resources like estuaries, beach systems, and wetlands are threatened by these changes. Recent events like Hurricane Katrina and new information about \"dead zones\" shape views on managing the coastal zone. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was enacted in 1972 in response to public concern about estuarine and oceanfront degradation. Congress considered national land use planning legislation to address challenges in balancing preservation and development in coastal areas. The CZMA was enacted in 1972 to address coastal land use challenges, with a promise to incorporate it into broader national land use legislation later on. However, comprehensive land use planning legislation was never passed, and Congress has not expanded beyond the CZMA. Despite this, trends such as increasing coastal population have continued to grow since 1972. Coastal counties have a high concentration of people and development, with 23 of the 25 most densely populated counties being coastal. About one-quarter of all seasonal homes are in coastal Florida. Development along the immediate coastline has led to modifications of beach systems and coastal landscapes, impacting natural resources. In some rural coastal counties, a significant portion of the tax base is on the immediate coast. Almost 82% of the country's population lived in coastal states and territories, with more than 41% residing in defined coastal zone areas. Coastal areas cover about 11% of the country's area but are home to a significant portion of the population. In the 35 years since the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was enacted, development in coastal areas has continued with new environmental considerations, such as protecting dunes and beaches. One emerging issue is the rising sea levels, intensifying the exposure of property and people to hazardous conditions associated with major storms. The CZMA, enacted 35 years ago, allows 35 states and territories to apply for federal grants to address coastal topics. Section 305 provides matching grants for coastal management plans. Participation is voluntary, with incentives including financial assistance to implement plans. Participants have developed programs focusing on various topics within the law's components. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides incentives for states and territories to develop federally approved programs addressing coastal topics. The federal consistency provision in Section 307 ensures that federal actions align with approved coastal plans. Despite evolving topics, the underlying voluntary approaches of the program have remained largely unchanged. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) has been amended multiple times since 1972 to address evolving national coastal issues. The major provisions in today's CZMA include a declaration of policy with six purposes, such as preserving, protecting, developing, and restoring coastal areas. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) has six purposes, including preserving, protecting, developing, and enhancing coastal resources. It authorizes grants for implementing management plans and encourages intergovernmental cooperation and sharing of information. Section 306 establishes grants for approved programs with specified elements and requirements. Section 306A establishes the Coastal Resources Improvement Program for matching grants to preserve or restore qualified resources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) authorizes participants to preserve or restore resources, redevelop urban waterfronts, improve access to coastal areas, and develop aquaculture facilities. It includes federal consistency provisions, coordination, and cooperation, as well as a fund for loans to address regional issues, emergencies, and disasters. Additionally, it authorizes coastal zone enhancement grants for specified purposes. Section 309 of the Coastal Zone Management Act authorizes grants for various purposes such as wetland protection, natural hazard mitigation, coastal access improvement, marine debris reduction, and energy-related activities. Section 315 establishes the National Estuarine Research Reserve System for research and education centers nominated by participants. The Coastal Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program (CZARA) is a related program enacted in 1990 to address pollution control in coastal areas. The Coastal Zone Reauthorization Act of 1990 (CZARA) requires CZM participants to develop coastal nonpoint source pollution control programs. It outlines program contents, approval process, and potential loss of federal assistance for noncompliance. Once participant plans are approved, funds from five accounts under the CZMA become available, administered by NOAA. These accounts include management grants, funds for nonpoint source pollution, and support for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The Coastal Zone Reauthorization Act of 1990 (CZARA) requires CZM participants to develop coastal nonpoint source pollution control programs. It outlines program contents, approval process, and potential loss of federal assistance for noncompliance. Funds from five accounts under the CZMA become available, administered by NOAA, including management grants, funds for nonpoint source pollution, and support for the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Additional grants are provided under Section 306, 306A, and 309 for specific topics and enhancement areas, with a total funding of $50.5 million in FY1999. In FY2010, Congress allocated $68.1 million for these programs. The Coastal Zone Reauthorization Act of 1990 (CZARA) was enacted to manage nonpoint source water pollution in coastal waters. CZARA is a standalone law providing grants for implementation and planning. Funding for CZARA has decreased over the years, with no funding in FY2010. The Estuarine Research Reserve System, authorized by the CZMA, receives funding for research, education, and coastal monitoring. Total funding in FY2010 is $27.4 million, with $23.5 million for operations and $3.9 million for acquisition and construction. The consistency provisions in Section 307 ensure participants can certify federal actions in or affecting their areas. The Coastal Zone Reauthorization Act of 1990 allows participants to certify federal actions in their coastal zones. States historically agree with 95% of federal actions. Disagreements go through an appeals process, with final determinations made by the Secretary of Commerce. 43 consistency decisions have been subject to secretarial determinations. The Coastal Zone Reauthorization Act of 1990 allows participants to certify federal actions in their coastal zones. States historically agree with 95% of federal actions, with disagreements going through an appeals process. 43 consistency decisions have been made, with 29 in favor of the participant and 14 in favor of the applicant. 18 appeals have been about offshore energy activities, with 9 decided in favor of the participant. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is a network of protected areas for research and education, administered by participants. The National Estuarine Research Reserve System provides matching funds for acquiring sites, with 70% funding for operations, management, and education activities. There are 27 designated units in 19 subbiogeographical regions, ranging in size from 571 to 365,000 acres. Evaluations are conducted periodically to gather information about participant programs. The Office of Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) conducts periodic evaluations of participant programs, generally every three years. Evaluations are used to summarize activities and accomplishments in a biennial report to Congress. Evaluations are based on each state's program goals and a national Performance Measurement System. OCRM's participant evaluations do not result in perfect or failing ratings. Evaluations always suggest areas for improvement and adjustments for success. No program has lost funding, although California was once threatened with funding loss. Participants have flexibility in how they participate in the federal program and what topics they focus on. Participants have utilized flexibility to organize and administer programs in various ways, emphasizing different topics. Differences in program administration include the division of responsibilities between state and local levels of government. For example, in Washington, the coastal program is mainly administered at the local level, while in Rhode Island, the state government retains most of the implementation responsibilities. These variations reflect the relationships between levels of government regarding planning responsibilities. The relationships between levels of government over planning responsibilities and natural resource management were established before the CZMA was enacted. Participants emphasize different program elements, with California focusing on beach access by providing detailed maps and increasing access points through easements. This diversity in coastal concerns is evident among all participants. The diversity of coastal concerns among participants is evident in the emphasis on various CZMA program elements. The 2004-2005 report highlights challenges like reduced funding, interstate coordination, public access, water quality, and coastal hazard planning. The report is organized around discussions of the six major goals of coastal management, with participant activities and success stories showcased in each focus area. The participants in the coastal management program focus on various areas such as coastal habitats, hazards, water quality, public access, community development, and urban waterfront revitalization. Some states have independent coastal management agencies, while others integrate the program within existing agencies. The placement of the program within state government reflects the participant's approach to coastal management. The participants in the coastal management program focus on various areas such as coastal habitats, hazards, water quality, public access, community development, and urban waterfront revitalization. Some states have independent coastal management agencies, while others integrate the program within existing agencies. The placement of the program within state government reflects the participant's approach to coastal management, with limited cooperative efforts such as the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Great Lakes Program being notable examples. The Great Lakes Program and the Chesapeake Bay Program are longstanding cooperative efforts involving federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and states in the watersheds. States like Virginia and Maryland have significant coastal program efforts contributing to bay restoration goals. Cooperative opportunities exist where rivers or estuaries form boundaries between states in multi-state watersheds. Oregon and Washington share a similar situation. The Columbia River serves as a boundary between Oregon and Washington, with no formal coordination currently in place. In the Southeast, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi are working to address drought in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River watershed, which affects Atlanta's water supply. However, solutions for Atlanta may harm species in the coastal Florida area. Coordination between coastal states or between coastal and noncoastal states is not required by the CZMA. The 1986 reauthorization (P.L. 99-272) limited Section 307 to addressing coordination and cooperation between participants and the federal community. Coastal states are affected by activities in inland states, such as the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico caused by nutrient influx from the corn belt. SAMPs are resource management plans for coastal areas with concentrated issues, like the Chesapeake Bay. They aim to improve government decision-making by clarifying permitted activities and considering cumulative impacts. Developing SAMPs requires flexibility and commitment from all involved parties. SAMPs have been used for over two decades under the CZMA, with many states successfully developing plans to address various coastal management topics. Congress has directed a focus on nonpoint water pollution through the CZARA provisions enacted in 1990. The CZARA provisions enacted in 1990 require coastal program participants to address nonpoint source pollution to protect coastal waters. Approval from the Secretary of Commerce and EPA Administrator is necessary, with potential funding consequences for non-compliance. All participants have submitted plans, with 19 receiving full approval and none opting out of the federal coastal program. NOAA and EPA oversee the implementation of these requirements. The federal OCRM identifies success stories addressing polluted runoff sources like agriculture, forestry, urban areas, marinas, hydromodification, and wetlands. Limited accomplishments are attributed to factors such as lack of federal funding, with funding levels dropping in recent years. Interest in coastal management policies and programs has increased since the last CZMA reauthorization in 1996. Two national commissions, the Pew Oceans Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, have elevated coastal topics among policy makers. The Pew Oceans Commission released its final report in 2003 with 26 recommendations, while the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy issued its final report in 2004 with 212 recommendations, many of which have a coastal component. NOAA and the Coastal States Organization have been involved in these efforts. NOAA and the Coastal States Organization released a report titled Discussion Paper: Current and Future Challenges for Coastal Management. The report focuses on 28 topics related to coastal management, including governance issues and resource management challenges. Key areas of concern include federal coordination, habitat conservation, climate change, and promoting sustainable development. The public and Congress are increasingly aware of coastal issues such as economic growth, sustainable development, climate change, marine commerce, invasive species, and decision support. These issues are interconnected and pose challenges for existing programs and policies. Awareness has been raised by events like Hurricane Katrina and trends like sea level rise and fishery stock declines. This growing recognition may prompt policy action. The growing recognition of coastal issues like economic growth, sustainable development, climate change, marine commerce, and invasive species may prompt policy makers to focus more on coastal management. Various issues are currently receiving attention, and efforts are being made to address them through coastal zone management. Proposed policy changes aim to enhance these efforts, with coastal management being a central or critical response for some issues and one of multiple components for others. Over two dozen reauthorization proposals have been introduced to address these issues since the CZMA authorization. Several reauthorization proposals have been introduced since the CZMA authorization expired in 1999, but none have been enacted. These proposals aimed to increase funding levels for coastal management and address coastal hazards, such as hurricanes and sea level rise, due to continued coastal development. The coastal management program aims to limit threats to life and property by discouraging unwise development in flood-prone areas and protecting natural coastal features. Advocates believe better planning through this program can help reduce public costs and minimize the impact of future coastal hazards. Advocates suggest Congress should prioritize coastal hazards in the coastal program by allocating federal grant funds, improving collaboration with FEMA and other disaster agencies, providing comprehensive maps, and reporting on capacity-building efforts. The coastal program should prioritize coastal hazards by tying federal assistance to programs that lower vulnerability. Habitat protection efforts are fragmented, focusing on specific species rather than larger ecosystems. Coastal-dependent species are not prominent in current federal law or participant programs. The CZMA identifies these resources in congressional findings. The CZMA emphasizes the importance of greater coordination and comprehensive planning for coastal-dependent species. Funding provisions under Section 309 can be used to protect these species. Addressing threats to these species highlights the value of taking a broader approach to topics like wetlands protection, fisheries management, hypoxia, and nonpoint source pollution. Past experiences show that addressing these issues successfully requires considering larger scales and multiple factors. The hypoxia condition, also known as the \"dead zone,\" is found in coastal waters and estuaries, often caused by nutrient and chemical inputs from sources like the Mississippi River drainage. Better coordination among federal programs could improve effectiveness in managing resources on an ecosystem basis. Additional planning at the state and regional levels, such as the salmon restoration effort, is also important. The ocean side of coastal management at state and regional levels, like the salmon restoration effort in the Pacific Northwest, could benefit living resources. State waters see growing uses like energy facilities, offshore wind farms, aquaculture, and sand and gravel resources, leading to potential conflicts. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) encourages states to plan for marine resources and uses within state waters, with some states like Oregon, Massachusetts, and California already addressing issues such as wind farms, aquaculture facilities, and sand and gravel resources. States can influence federal decisions beyond 3 miles in federal waters through the consistency provision. However, participants often lack basic information and expertise in ocean management, hindering their ability to effectively address management topics. Congress could amend the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) to encourage states to address ocean management topics more aggressively, including ocean zoning and working closely with federal agencies. Some interests want to extend offshore state boundaries from 3 to 12 miles, raising questions about control of energy resources and enforcement responsibilities in expanded state waters. The costs of enforcing laws in expanded state waters may pose challenges for users accustomed to federal law consistency. Disagreements over boundary lines and jurisdiction extension to 12 miles offshore could lead to potential litigation. Improved governance through the federal Coastal Zone Management Program aims to address these issues. The federal Coastal Zone Management Program aims to build capacity, coordinate partnerships, and improve decision-making for coastal areas. Measuring the program's benefits has been challenging, with limited evaluation beyond participant activities every three years. Reauthorization legislation could focus on enhancing governance and promoting greater coordination among federal agencies. Coastal management can create opportunities for greater coordination among federal programs in coastal areas. Regional collaboration and watershed management are gaining attention. Encouraging consistency in local government decisions can be supported by a national framework and funding. Establishing a national framework to support local government efforts, providing funding and technical assistance, and encouraging collaboration with private and non-governmental organizations are key aspects of reauthorization bills introduced during the 110th Congress. The House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, and Oceans passed H.R. 5451 with a substitute amendment that included language from bills related to working waterfronts, climate change adaptation, and renewable energy projects. During the 111th Congress, several bills were introduced to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), including establishing grant programs for renewable energy planning, coastal climate change adaptation, and working waterfronts. A CZMA reauthorization bill was not introduced, and it is unlikely to be considered by this Congress. Coastal zone management programs coordinate various topics and activities addressed by federal laws and programs, some of which may be included in potential CZMA reauthorization legislation. The CZMA reauthorization legislation may directly or indirectly recognize topics relevant to coastal program participants. These programs are focused on coastal locations and address key aspects of coastal management. Additionally, various federal programs not limited to coastal areas can also impact coastal regions through infrastructure development and financial subsidies. The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP) provides matching grants to states and local governments for acquiring coastal property. It was originally enacted in 2002 and later authorized under the CZMA in 2009. The program has funded 157 projects between 2002 and 2008, totaling $216 million, to protect coastal habitats, reduce water pollution, and improve coastal access for recreation. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA), enacted in 1982, designates undeveloped coastal barriers and adjacent areas where federal spending for additional development is prohibited. The system includes 585 units covering 1.3 million acres of land and aquatic areas, with 271 \"otherwise protected areas\" only ineligible for flood insurance. Unit boundaries can only be modified by Congress through site-specific amendments. The program does not regulate activities but prohibits federal support for development within designated units. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) designates undeveloped coastal barriers where federal spending for additional development is prohibited. Development has occurred in some units, especially along the southeast Atlantic coast. CBRA does not prevent federal expenditures to restore units after natural disasters. The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) provides funds for coastal wetland restoration, with 70% allocated to Louisiana for restoration projects. The Wetlands Conservation Program in Louisiana, administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has re-established or protected over 70,000 acres of wetlands and enhanced an additional 320,000 acres at a cost of almost $625 million. The National Estuary Program (NEP) was created in 1987 to maintain and restore estuaries of national significance, with 28 NEPs around the country. Each NEP implements a plan to improve water quality, habitat, and living resources through partnerships with government and private interests. The National Estuary Program (NEP) was created in 1987 to maintain and restore estuaries of national significance. NEPs monitor their accomplishments and can modify their plan to achieve goals. NEP has protected and restored over 1.3 million acres of habitat from 2000-2009. The program leveraged about $15 for every $1 of EPA spending from 2003-2008, resulting in over $1.48 billion committed to achieve program goals. The Chesapeake Bay Program is one of the oldest and largest programs, involving federal, state, and other participants to better understand and protect the bay's resources. The Chesapeake Bay Program has been in operation for nearly 30 years, documenting accomplishments and remaining problems. Other site-specific programs exist for Long Island Sound, the Great Lakes, and the Everglades and southwest Florida, but none are as comprehensive as the Chesapeake Bay Program. The federal coastal management program may serve as a model for areas facing conflicting pressures of resource protection and economic development. The federal coastal management program may serve as a model for areas facing conflicting pressures of resource protection and economic development. Strengths and weaknesses of the program are debated, with varying views on the variability in program administration. The context of each participant's program, including governance traditions and established resource management approaches, is crucial in evaluating the model. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides a flexible framework for coastal planning, tailored to individual participant needs. It allows for progress measurement based on each participant's capabilities and encourages capacity building in planning and management. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) aims to enhance planning and management capacity for activities in a defined geographic area. It includes protected research and education sites, federal funding incentives, and a process for participants to oppose incompatible federal actions. However, some weaknesses include its voluntary nature and lack of regulatory leverage. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) lacks regulatory leverage on participants' actions, leading to inadequate funding for necessary coastal protection measures. Some participants prioritize coastal development over environmental conservation, and the impact of federal programs on coastal development and resource protection remains uncertain after 30 years of effort. Congressional findings in Appendix A highlight the national interest in coastal management. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) lists congressional findings about the national interest in the coastal zone and declares policies to preserve, protect, and enhance coastal resources. It encourages management plans, intergovernmental cooperation, and grants for participants to submit their programs for approval. Section 306 authorizes grants for approved programs with specified requirements and procedures for modifications. Section 306A establishes the Coastal Resources Improvement Program for resource preservation and urban waterfront redevelopment. Section 307 mandates federal consistency for actions in coastal zones, while Section 308 creates a fund for loans to address coastal management needs. Section 308 establishes a coastal zone management fund for loans addressing regional issues, demonstration projects, emergencies, disasters, excellence recognition, and public trust doctrine. Section 309 establishes coastal zone enhancement grants for various purposes like wetlands protection, hazard mitigation, coastal access improvement, marine debris reduction, and energy-related activities facilitation. Section 310 authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide technical assistance and research results for coastal management support. Section 311 requires 30 days notice for public hearings, and Section 312 mandates NOAA to review and evaluate participant performance periodically. Section 312 requires NOAA to review and evaluate participant performance periodically, with the ability to withhold or withdraw financial assistance for non-compliance. Section 313 mandates record maintenance and federal access, while Section 314 establishes the annual Walter B. Jones awards for coastal zone management excellence. Section 315 authorizes the National Estuarine Research Reserve System for research and education purposes. Section 316 requires the Secretary of Commerce to prepare biennial reports for Congress. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for reports to Congress, the establishment of a National Coastal Resources Research and Development Institute, appropriations authorization, and the appeals process under the Coastal Zone Management Act. It also mentions reauthorization legislation in 1975 and 1976 that made amendments to the CZMA. In 1978 (P.L. 95-372), amendments were made to the Coastal Zone Management Act, including the addition of energy development as a major topic, creation of a Coastal Energy Impact Program, and reauthorization of appropriations through FY1980. In 1980 (P.L. 96-464), further amendments were made, including the addition of a new grant category and authorization of appropriations through FY1985. In 1986 (P.L. 99-626), amendments to the Recreational Boating Safety Act required participants to return unobligated funds for reobligation. In the same year, amendments to the Deficit Reduction Amendments of 1985 replaced the Estuarine Sanctuary Program with the Estuarine Research Reserve System. In 1990 (P.L. 101-508), extensive amendments reauthorized the Coastal Zone Management Act through FY1995, making changes to management grants and consistency provisions. The Interstate Grants with Enhancement Grants, amended provisions regarding estuarine research reserves, and established the Walter Jones awards. Section 6217 established the coastal nonpoint source pollution program in 1996 (P.L. 104-150). Limited amendments in free-standing legislation eliminated grants to assist states in preparing plans, authorized appropriations through FY1999, and made other funding changes. Some deadlines for secretarial actions when consistency determinations have been appealed to that level were also stated."
