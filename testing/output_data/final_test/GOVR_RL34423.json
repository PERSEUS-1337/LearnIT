The HOPE NOW approach, developed by the Administration and the mortgage industry, aims to assist borrowers with subprime mortgages facing interest rate increases through counseling, interest rate freezes, or new mortgages. Critics argue that HOPE NOW is not acting quickly enough to help those in need. Foreclosure is costly for lenders, borrowers, and neighboring property owners, making efforts to reduce foreclosures beneficial for all parties involved. The lender may not recover the mortgage balance and foreclosure costs, leading to the borrower losing equity, incurring additional costs, and facing credit damage. Vacant homes in a neighborhood can lower the value of occupied homes, creating an externality that economists suggest warrants government intervention. Analysts compare the current mortgage crisis to the Great Depression, citing the Home Owners' Loan Corporation's role in refinancing mortgages in 1933. The report also examines the Continental Illinois failure, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, and the 1989 Brady Plan for developing bonds. One issue Congress may consider is how to divide limited aid for home owners in need. Should assistance go to a few for more help or to many but risk spreading it too thin? The question of who \"deserves\" help arises, including whether owners of rental or second homes should be included, or only present owners of single-family homes. Should aid be provided to homeowners based on specific criteria such as subprime mortgages, current payment status, upcoming interest rate resets, or mortgage type exclusions? Should assistance be limited based on factors like false statements during mortgage acquisition, purpose of mortgage (purchase vs. refinance), cash equity extraction limits, and cutoff dates for eligibility? The HOPE NOW program offers financial assistance to homeowners with subprime mortgages who are current on payments but may struggle after mortgage resets. Assistance includes freezing interest rates and refinancing with the FHA. Concerns exist about government intervention leading to moral hazard and riskier decisions by home buyers in the future. The HOPE NOW program provides aid to homeowners with subprime mortgages facing financial difficulties. Concerns about moral hazard arise, as government intervention may lead to riskier decisions by home buyers in the future. Delinquency, default, and foreclosure are key terms in mortgage finance. Foreclosure is a costly process for lenders, with estimates of total costs ranging from $50,000 to $58,759. The process takes an average of 18 months and results in direct property value loss of $53,493, as well as neighborhood property value loss of $24,163. Each foreclosure can reduce property tax collections by $692. The borrower's ability to make mortgage payments after a reset was not a concern as the mortgage would be refinanced before the reset, allowing for profit from price appreciation. No-documentation or low-documentation mortgages became popular, along with subprime mortgages for borrowers with impaired credit histories, all relying on home price appreciation for repayment in case of foreclosure. However, if home prices stopped appreciating rapidly, the collateral might not be enough to cover the debt without a loss to the lender. The federal government has intervened in the past to modify market outcomes. The federal government has intervened in the past to modify market outcomes, analyzing previous government actions that directly affected individuals. This report examines four government market interventions: the Home Owner Loan Corporation (HOLC) of 1933, Continental Illinois in 1994, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, and Brady bonds in 1989. These interventions are relevant to the current discussion on assisting homeowners. The Home Owner Loan Corporation (HOLC) was established in 1933 to prevent mortgage foreclosures by exchanging its bonds for defaulting mortgages. Mortgages at that time were typically for three to five years and did not amortize. HOLC's federal guarantee increased from interest only to interest and principal in its first year. Mortgages were limited to one- to four-unit structures with an appraised value of $20,000 or less. The HOLC program established in 1933 aimed to prevent mortgage foreclosures by exchanging bonds for defaulting mortgages. Mortgages were limited to properties valued at $20,000 or less, with a maximum mortgage amount of $14,000 or 80% of the appraised value. HOLC issued up to $4.75 billion in bonds, which could be exchanged for defaulted mortgages or cash. The bonds had a maximum interest rate of 4% for 18 years and were tax-exempt. HOLC also provided loans for taxes and insurance. When HOLC was created, concerns arose about lenders accepting HOLC bonds. To address this, defaulted mortgages could be purchased for cash and the government guarantee on interest was increased. Today, private and FHA mortgage insurance guarantee payment of principal and interest. Approximately 40% of eligible applicants applied for HOLC mortgages, with half being rejected or withdrawn. HOLC employees were not civil servants and the corporation did not follow federal procurement regulations. Despite forecasts of losses, HOLC made a small profit upon liquidation in 1951 due to declining interest rates and the government guarantee. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) was liquidated in 1951 due to declining interest rates and government guarantees. HOLC developed its own mortgage processing system, supervised appraisers, and negotiated flexible repayment terms. It acquired 200,000 homes from borrowers unable to pay their mortgages out of one million loans issued. Foreclosure rates varied across states, with New York and Massachusetts having rates over 40%. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) set prices on foreclosed homes, provided financing, and worked with real estate agents. At its peak, HOLC had 20,000 employees in 458 offices. The program aimed to work with homeowners, offering new mortgages based on appraised values, potentially lower than the original mortgage. A similar program could be considered by Congress, with questions about maximum house values eligible for participation. In considering a new housing assistance program, key questions include the maximum house value eligible, loan-to-value ratio, loan term, interest rate restrictions, program management, treatment of delinquencies, and program duration. In 1984, Continental Illinois bank faced financial troubles, receiving secret loans from the Federal Reserve to stabilize its operations. In May 1984, Continental Illinois bank received government assistance totaling $4.5 billion to support uninsured deposits. The FDIC purchased problem loans at a discount and invested $1 billion in Continental, giving the federal government 80% of its shares. Little congressional debate occurred as no congressional action was required. Concerns were raised about market discipline being weakened by guaranteeing uninsured deposits and the impact of Continental's failure on other banks. The government intervention in Continental Illinois bank in 1984 raised concerns about bank regulation and market discipline. The FDIC purchased problem loans and invested $1 billion in Continental, leading to management changes and Bank of America's purchase in 1994. The FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 was passed to strengthen large bank regulation. Continental's rapid growth and risky lending practices, including loans with Penn Square Bank, ultimately led to its downfall. Other banks and CD holders became concerned after Penn Square's closure due to defaults on gas and oil project loans. The closure of Continental Illinois bank in 1984 due to defaults on loans raised concerns among other banks and CD holders. An analysis by the FDIC revealed that Continental had failed to properly underwrite oil and gas loans made with Penn Square Bank. In the 1980s, many U.S. savings and loan associations expanded their business beyond mortgages, leading to 563 S&L failures between 1980 and 1988 due to factors like fraud and rising interest rates. The Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) became insolvent, leading to the failure of state-sponsored insurers as depositors withdrew their money. Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to reform the federal deposit insurance system. $91.3 billion was provided to the Resolution Trust Corporation to pay for the restructuring of the S&L industry. The Savings and Loan crisis in the late 1980s led to the insolvency of the FSLIC and the restructuring of the S&L industry with $91.3 billion allocated to the Resolution Trust Corporation. The intervention aimed to minimize costs to the government and ensure the viability of the financial system. Deposit insurance was crucial to protect most depositors, with only a few at risk for amounts exceeding $100,000. The S&L intervention was necessary to address issues in the thrift industry caused by mortgage lending. The Latin American debt crisis in the late 1980s was caused by a variety of factors, including relaxed lending standards, poor debt management, and a changing international economy. U.S. banks were heavily involved, lending $91.8 billion to 17 highly indebted countries. Initial attempts to address the crisis failed due to coordination issues among lenders. In 1989, the Brady Plan was proposed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, which involved forgiving bank loans and repackaging remaining debt into tradable bonds. The Brady Plan involved restructuring remaining debt into tradable bonds, with lenders recognizing the reduced value of existing debt. Three types of bonds were used: dollar-denominated discount bonds, below market interest rate bonds, and bonds paying market interest rates. Banks also provided new money to maintain borrower liquidity. The Brady Plan involved restructuring debt into tradable bonds, with lenders recognizing reduced debt value. Borrower nations had to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds to collateralize principal and interest. The World Bank and IMF provided structural adjustment loans. Discussions focused on eligible countries for debt restructuring and terms. The plan accelerated the creation of new international financing mechanisms. The Brady Plan accelerated the creation of new international financing mechanisms by shifting lending to bonds, adding liquidity to the financial system. This restored financial stability to U.S. banks, increased international lending, and provided more affordable terms for borrowers. However, it also shifted exchange rate and collateral risks to debtor nations. The Brady Plan shifted collateral risk from U.S. banks to debtor nations. Custom agreements were negotiated with some nations due to the size of their loans. Renegotiating loans for two million potential mortgage defaults in 2008 and 2009 could be challenging. Lenders recognized losses on existing loans but had more assurance of repayment with renegotiated loans. Borrowers benefited from more manageable repayment schedules. Restructuring subprime loans could involve reducing principal and interest rates to reflect the decreased value of the mortgages. The value of subprime mortgages is lower due to weakened home values and increased default risk. Lenders may offer additional funds if placed in escrow as collateral. HOLC also recognized reduced mortgage values. Not all subprime borrowers may renegotiate loans after interest rate resets. Lenders prefer foreclosure over terms that leave them worse off. Temporary payment inability may lead to foreclosure, especially if the borrower is likely to regain financial stability. The inability to make mortgage payments may lead to foreclosure, especially if the borrower is unlikely to regain financial stability. Representative John Conyers introduced H.R. 1106, which allows judges to modify mortgages in bankruptcy proceedings and authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay lenders the outstanding balance of modified VA-guaranteed mortgages. The proposed legislation aims to modify VA-guaranteed mortgages in bankruptcy, make certain agreements unenforceable, provide a safe harbor for loan modifications, and set new standards for lenders in the FHA insurance program. Congress faces questions on who should be helped, income limits, tax treatment, program administration, foreclosure procedures, government's role, program duration, and restrictions on future home sales for assisted homeowners. The government faces questions on how to assist homeowners in financial difficulty, including determining the amount of financial contribution, financing options, and restrictions on future home sales. Lessons from past interventions show that acknowledging losses is crucial for recovery, and interventions often follow the triage principle to categorize those in distress. The government must determine how to assist homeowners in financial distress, categorizing them into those who can survive independently and those needing immediate help. Previous interventions like HOLC and Brady bonds involved negotiations with borrowers, but not all could meet the terms. It may be unrealistic to keep all subprime borrowers in their homes, as some may lose their jobs and be unable to make payments. Even a foreclosure moratorium is temporary. HOLC had to proactively reach out to delinquent borrowers to modify mortgages for eventual repayment. HOPE NOW is urging delinquent homeowners to talk with lenders and credit counselors for personalized mortgage modification plans. Economists are concerned about moral hazard, where government intervention may lead to riskier behavior in the future. The government's intervention to help homeowners may lead to lenders taking more risks in the future. Homeowners who benefit from the intervention and others who witness it could also react in a similar manner."
