The creation of CIC led to congressional inquiries in 2007 and 2008, with various committees holding hearings on the implications of SWFs for the U.S. economy and national security. After the global financial crisis, concerns about SWFs, including the CIC, diminished as investments were curtailed. However, since 2009, the CIC has been making significant investments in energy and natural resources companies. Its subsidiary, Central Huijin, also invested in Chinese banks, leading to foreign and domestic investments. These actions have raised concerns about the CIC's investment strategy. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) is seen as a vehicle for Chinese government strategy to secure resources for its economy, raising concerns about U.S. security. China's sovereign wealth fund, created in 2007, aims to invest foreign reserves more profitably. The CIC's investments in energy and natural resources companies have sparked worries about its strategy. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was established in 2007 to provide China with a new investment avenue for its growing foreign exchange reserves, which have increased from $1.4 trillion in 2007 to $2.45 trillion in 2010. The CIC was created under the control of the State Council after political infighting among China's financial institutions. The CIC's investment activities are overseen by an 11-member board of directors and a seven-person Executive Committee. Its mission is to make long-term investments for maximum financial returns. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was established in 2007 by the State Council to maximize risk-adjusted financial returns for its shareholders. The CIC's investment decisions are made on a commercial basis, but some investments, like assuming responsibility for Central Huijin's assets and liabilities, raise questions about their commercial merit. Central Huijin's mission is to preserve and enhance the value of state-owned financial assets, leading to potential contradictions with the CIC's goals. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) is a state-owned company supervised by the State Council. Its operations are managed by an Executive Committee overseen by a board of directors and monitored by a board of supervisors. Key executives include Lou Jiwei as CEO, Zhang Hongli as COO, and Jesse Wang Jianxi as CRO. The CIC's investment details are not publicly available, and it utilizes internal staff, asset management companies, and subsidiary investment companies for investments. Reports suggest the CIC has made various investments since its establishment. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) has hired asset management companies to manage its investment portfolio. 51% of its holdings are externally managed, and 41% are internally managed. The CIC owns subsidiaries like Beijing Wonderful Investment, Ltd., Chengdong Investment Corporation, and Central Huijin. Lou Jiwei is the CEO of CIC and chairman of Central Huijin's board of directors. President Peng Chun is the chairman of Central Huijin. The CIC's investment objective is to achieve long-term returns for its shareholder, the State Council. It follows four key investment principles: selecting investments based on commercial criteria, being a passive investor, complying with laws and regulations, and utilizing standard evaluation techniques. The CIC is a member of the IFSWF and abides by the Santiago Principles. Since its establishment in 2007, the CIC has grown from an initial endowment of $200 billion. The CIC, established in 2007 with an initial endowment of $200 billion, has grown to a total worth of $332 billion by the end of 2009. In 2009, it had a return on capital of 12.9% and a return on its global portfolio of 11.7%. The CIC has requested an additional $200 billion in capital based on its 2009 performance, but the State Council has not yet made a decision. The CIC focuses on overseas investments, while Central Huijin, chaired by President Peng Chun, focuses on domestic investments to support China's financial institutions. The CIC, established in 2007 with an initial endowment of $200 billion, has grown to a total worth of $332 billion by the end of 2009. The CIC focuses on overseas investments, while Central Huijin supports China's financial institutions. The CIC's investment activities can be divided into three distinct periods, with a notable shift to investments in energy and natural resource companies starting in 2009. The CIC had holdings in 82 different U.S. entities as of December 31, 2009, with a total worth of $9.627 billion. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) held shares in major corporations like Apple, Bank of America, Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Wells Fargo, with a total worth of $9.627 billion. There were reports of potential investments in companies like Fortescue, Areva, and United Co Rusal in 2009 and 2010. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) discussed potential investments in the mining industries of Brazil and Mexico in 2010. They also considered purchasing real estate funds from Harvard University, but the negotiations were unsuccessful. By the end of 2009, CIC shifted its portfolio from cash funds to equities and fixed income securities due to improved investment capabilities and emerging opportunities in global markets. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) considered investments in mining industries in Brazil and Mexico in 2010. They also explored purchasing real estate funds from Harvard University, but negotiations failed. By the end of 2009, CIC shifted its portfolio to equities and fixed income securities, benefiting from improved investment capabilities and global market opportunities. The perceived protectionist attitudes of Europe and the United States towards sovereign wealth fund investments diminished, allowing CIC to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Central Huijin, a subsidiary of CIC, is separate in its investment business and share management functions. Central Huijin, a subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, restructured ailing financial institutions in 2009 and acquired holdings in Chinese financial institutions. They sold bonds worth billions to finance investments in Export-Import Bank of China and Sinosure in 2010. They have approval to issue up to 187.5 billion yuan in bonds. Central Huijin, a subsidiary of China Investment Corporation, has approval to issue up to 187.5 billion yuan ($27.6 billion) in bonds to invest in state-owned banks like BOC, CCB, and ICBC. This investment aims to prevent dilution of Central Huijin's holdings in the banks and provide them with additional capital. Discussions about reforming the CIC arose in 2008 due to poor overseas investment performance and administrative tensions. There were internal conflicts regarding investment missions, and external challenges from SAFE, which tried to challenge CIC's role as the leading overseas investment fund. In 2008, there were discussions about reforming the CIC due to poor overseas investment performance and administrative tensions. There were conflicts with SAFE challenging CIC's role as the leading overseas investment fund. The State Council authorized SAFE to invest up to 5% of China's foreign exchange reserves in non-fixed income investments. There were talks about separating the CIC and Central Huijin to avoid regulatory problems and clarify their roles. The Federal Reserve delayed licensing for CCB and ICBC branches in NYC due to combined shareholdings of CIC and Central Huijin. In 2008, U.S. Fed informed CIC it couldn't subsidize loans via ICBC branch. China's leadership considered keeping CIC primarily as an investor in overseas assets and Central Huijin as an administrator of state-owned financial assets. State Council announced new roles for Central Huijin and China Jianyin Investment Company on October 22, 2008. In October 2008, the State Council announced new roles for Central Huijin and China Jianyin Investment Company under the CIC. Central Huijin would hold majority stakes in state-owned banks, while China Jianyin Investment Company would focus on being an \"investment platform for companies.\" Central Huijin took control of holdings in five securities firms in January 2009, but talk of splitting CIC and Central Huijin resurfaced in 2010 to diversify CIC's portfolio. The CIC is considering splitting to focus on international investments and diversify its portfolio. There are discussions about compensating for domestic holdings and the future reporting structure of Central Huijin. Concerns have been raised about the commercial merit of CIC's investments and whether they align with government policy. The CIC's investment strategy has shifted towards energy and natural resources companies, sparking speculation about China's government policy and securing access to resources. Central Huijin's investment activities have also raised questions. Central Huijin's investment in major Chinese banks indirectly finances state-owned enterprises and large private companies for overseas acquisitions. CIC may transition from a passive to an active investor, with recent board appointments in companies like AES and GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Limited. The CIC assured the SEC it would only seek one seat on Morgan Stanley's board to gain approval for purchasing over 10% of the company. Obama expressed concerns about sovereign wealth funds not solely driven by market factors. Marisa Lago highlighted that sovereign wealth funds are government entities, not just private investors. Sovereign wealth funds like the CIC are government entities investing in the private sector. CIC's investments in the US face regulatory reviews by CFIUS and the SEC. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 expanded CFIUS's authority in national security cases. Analysts warn of economic risks from SWFs and inward FDI from China, including financial instability and foreign control over key industries. Regulatory changes suggested to address concerns about foreign control over key industries or companies include requirements for SWFs to publicly release audited financial statements, restrictions on ownership percentages, limitations on types of investments in U.S. companies, and changes in governance structures. Changes in U.S. tax code may eliminate tax-exemption for SWFs. Policy analysts suggest access to U.S. financial markets should require reciprocity agreements. Concerns about regulatory constraints on SWFs leading to global financial protectionism. China may restrict U.S. FDI in response to restrictions on Chinese investments in the U.S. The debate is whether protection outweighs the benefits of investments. The debate revolves around whether the value of protection obtained outweighs the forgone benefits of investments prevented in more restrictive global and/or Chinese financial markets."
