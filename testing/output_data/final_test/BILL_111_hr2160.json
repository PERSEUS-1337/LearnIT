The Congress acknowledges the valuable public service provided by nearly 700,000 licensed amateur radio operators in the United States, especially in disaster communications. These operators have consistently offered emergency and disaster relief communications services during various crises, including hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Hugo. Amateur Radio operators have provided emergency communications during disasters like hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Hugo, and Andrew, the 2001 terrorist attacks, and the Oklahoma City bombing. They have formal agreements with various agencies for volunteer activities. Public Law 103-408 recognized their valuable service in disaster communications. Amateur Radio operators have been recognized for their valuable service in disaster communications by Congress. Public Law 109-295 directed the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate with amateur radio operators for emergency communications. Amateur Radio is a valuable resource for technical self-training in telecommunications and emergency communications. There is a strong Federal interest in supporting and protecting Amateur Radio stations from unreasonable regulation. SEC. 3. Study of enhanced uses of amateur radio in emergency and disaster relief communication, and for relief of restrictions. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to conduct a study on the uses of Amateur Radio communications in emergencies and disaster relief. The study will include recommendations for enhancing the deployment of Amateur Radio licensees and improving their integration in disaster relief efforts. The findings must be reported to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The study will evaluate the impact of private land use regulations on residential antenna installations for Amateur Radio communications. It will also assess the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and make recommendations on potential modifications to prevent unreasonable restrictions that hinder emergency communications by licensed operators. In the study required by this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security will use the expertise of the American Radio Relay League and gather information from private and public sectors."
