    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act of 2003\". Congress finds that there have been sharp increases in electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural gas, and propane prices in the United States since 1990. Recent examples include high gasoline prices due to global politics, electricity price spikes during the California energy crisis of 2001, and Midwest gasoline price spikes in spring 2001. Energy regulation changes have impacted price stability and consumers in unknown ways, undermining low-income families, the elderly, and small businesses. The Department of Energy has determined that stable energy prices are essential for a strong economy, as price spikes can discourage investment and growth. Various factors can cause these spikes, such as supply disruptions, insufficient infrastructure, and over-reliance on foreign supplies. The Department of Energy emphasizes the importance of stable energy prices for economic growth, as price spikes can hinder investment and development. Factors like supply disruptions, inadequate infrastructure, and dependence on foreign sources can contribute to these spikes. Consumers and small businesses are often left with limited options when faced with higher energy costs, impacting investment, economic growth, and job creation. It is crucial to examine the effects of price spikes on consumers and small businesses, as previous studies have not comprehensively analyzed this aspect. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
