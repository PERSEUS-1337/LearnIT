    "content": "The \"Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2005\" is the short title of this Act. It establishes a postal benefits program for members of the armed forces. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the United States Postal Service, shall establish a program to provide postal benefits to qualified individuals who are members of the Armed Forces on active duty in Iraq or Afghanistan or hospitalized due to service-related injuries. The postal benefits provided under this Act consist of vouchers entitling qualified individuals to make free postage mailings within the US. Qualified mailings include specific mail matter sent from areas served by a US post office to qualified individuals. The mail matter eligible for free postage vouchers includes personal correspondence, sound or video recordings, ground parcels, and bound printed matter, with weight limitations. Individuals can receive one voucher per month if they are qualified. Vouchers cannot be used for more than one qualified mailing. The Act allows for free postage vouchers for qualified individuals, limited to one voucher per month for a single qualified mailing. Postal benefits are additional to any other reduced rates of postage available by law. The Secretary of Defense must establish regulations within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Postal Service, will prescribe regulations for the enactment of the Act, including procedures for providing vouchers to qualified individuals and ensuring compliance with the number of vouchers per individual. SEC. 3. FUNDING. The Department of Defense is authorized to appropriate funds for providing benefits as described in section 2(c). Funds will be transferred to the Postal Service in advance of each quarter based on estimated postal benefits usage. The Department of Defense consults with the Postal Service to estimate and determine the amount of postal benefits needed for each quarter. A final determination and any necessary corrections must be made within 6 months after the end of the 1-year period. The postal benefits provided by this Act will be applicable for mail sent within a 1-year period after the regulations take effect. The bill aims to offer free mailing privileges for personal correspondence and certain mail sent from the U.S. to active-duty members of the Armed Forces in Iraq or Afghanistan."
