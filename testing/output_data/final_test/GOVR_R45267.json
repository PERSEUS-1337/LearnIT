    "content": "The United States exports agricultural products worldwide, with U.S. agricultural exports reaching nearly $139 billion in FY2017. Exporters must adhere to importer requirements, with USDA's APHIS regulating most animal and plant product exports. Export health certificates are often required for horticultural products and livestock, which accounted for over one-third of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2017. APHIS negotiates export health certificates with each partner country to meet health standards. APHIS negotiates \"export health certificates\" with partner countries to meet health standards for agricultural exports. These certificates are crucial for avoiding delays or rejections of shipments. Failure to obtain a required certificate could result in a rejected shipment by the importing country. APHIS issues export health certificates to ensure U.S. agricultural products meet importing countries' health standards. In FY2017, close to 675,000 certificates were issued for international shipments. APHIS manages programs nationally and internationally, covering various regions including Mexico, Central America, South America, and Western Europe. APHIS issues export health certificates for agricultural products in various regions including Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Western Europe, Asia, and Africa. They have jurisdiction over live animals, animal products, veterinary biologics, biotechnology permits, live plants, plant products, organisms, and soil. Other agencies, like the Department of Commerce, handle health certificates for fish and seafood. The Department of Commerce handles health certificates for fish and seafood, while APHIS issues export health certificates for agricultural products in various regions. Different types of certificates may be required for specific agricultural products based on trade agreements. The Department of Health and Human Services' FDA issues Certificates of Free Sale for various food products, while USDA's FSIS provides Export Certificates of Wholesomeness for meat, poultry, and egg products. USDA's AMS manages the Export Verification Program for agricultural exports. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees the Export Verification (EV) Program, which approves companies as eligible suppliers for certain products for export. Eligible suppliers must meet specified product requirements through an approved Quality System Assessment Program. Other USDA programs support U.S. agricultural exports, including export promotion and financing programs. Federal agencies may also establish memoranda of understanding (MOU) to enhance cooperation in supporting U.S. exports. In 2008, the Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service and the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service signed an MOU with APHIS to endorse export health certificates for aquatic animals. The MOU clarifies responsibilities and allows agencies to request assistance from each other. Exporters must work with APHIS to obtain export health certificates. APHIS works with various federal agencies to facilitate the verification process for plant and animal export health certificates. PPQ issues export plant health certificates for a variety of products, and exporters must submit an application to PPQ to obtain the certificate. The exporter must submit an application to PPQ for plant products certification based on import requirements. PPQ verifies the requirements and issues an export certificate within 30 days. VS is responsible for issuing export animal health certificates for live animals and animal products, requiring cooperation between the exporter and VS. The exporter submits an application to VS for export animal health certification. A USDA-accredited veterinarian inspects the facility and conducts tests to verify compliance with importer requirements. The completed health certificate is then issued to the exporter. The number of APHIS-issued export certificates has shown an upward trend between FY2011 and FY2017. The President's FY2019 budget proposes a 25% reduction in the overall APHIS budget, potentially impacting resources for processing export health certificates. APHIS negotiated 110 export protocols for animal products in FY2017, opening new markets for U.S. agricultural exports. In FY2017, certificate discussions among scientific authorities opened markets for beef to China, poultry to Korea, and potatoes to Japan. Export health certificates facilitate trade in animal health situations, such as outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). Countries must report incidents to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and follow disease control guidelines. This can lead to altered relationships with trading partners regarding poultry exports. Export health certificates can open market opportunities by limiting bans to specific regions. For example, the US gained access to export pork to Argentina after a pork SPS agreement was finalized in 2017. This agreement could potentially result in a $10 million per year market for US pork producers in Argentina. Congress has a direct interest in export health certificates for U.S. pork producers, overseeing issues like animal disease outbreaks, market openings, and trade barriers. APHIS's budget is divided into categories like Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response, representing 85% of their budget, where most export health certificate activities are housed. The President's FY2019 proposed budget for APHIS includes a significant reduction in funding, particularly affecting Safeguarding and Emergency Preparedness/Response activities. This budget cut could impact APHIS's ability to issue health certificates for agricultural exports and imports, potentially harming U.S. agricultural exports and the enforcement of animal and plant health requirements. The House and Senate proposed roughly $1 billion for the FY2019 APHIS budget, an increase from the Administration's request. This funding is crucial for responding to disease outbreaks, maintaining trade, and fulfilling U.S. commitments to the WTO. When renegotiating free trade agreements involving agriculture, APHIS's health certificates play a key role in SPS chapters that adhere to WTO guidelines. Importing countries may have varying requirements, leading to non-tariff measures and potential trade disputes. APHIS works to address concerns of U.S. exporters with importing countries' scientific authorities."
