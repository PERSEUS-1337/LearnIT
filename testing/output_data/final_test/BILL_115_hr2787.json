The \"Veterans-Specific Education for Tomorrow's Health Professionals Act\" includes a pilot program for clinical observation by undergraduate students at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a one-year pilot program starting by August 15, 2021, offering clinical observation experiences to certain students at at least five VA medical centers with regional diversity. Each center will host one to three observation sessions per year. The pilot program will offer clinical observation sessions to students at VA medical centers, with sessions lasting 4-6 months and accommodating 5-15 students. Sessions should align with academic terms and have minimal overlap. The pilot program offers clinical observation sessions at VA medical centers for US students. Each session must have 20-40 observational hours, with a majority spent observing health professionals. The experience should be diverse and well-rounded. Students selected for the program must be US nationals. The pilot program offers clinical observation sessions at VA medical centers for US students enrolled in accredited programs at higher education institutions.
