    "content": "The \"Educational Flexibility Act\" is the short title of the Act. It aims to provide findings and purpose for educational flexibility. The Congress finds that historically, Federal education programs have provided categorical assistance with detailed requirements, which may inadvertently impede educational achievement. Schools are facing diverse educational needs that current program structures may not address effectively. It is crucial to provide programs that result in improved educational outcomes for all students in an era of educational change and reform. The purpose of this Act is to establish a national program that promotes educational reform leading to improved outcomes for participants, holds schools accountable, responds flexibly to diverse student needs, reduces unnecessary regulations, and focuses on achieving program results rather than measuring resources and procedures. The Act aims to hold schools accountable for achieving specific educational goals in exchange for flexibility in resource use and encourages collaboration among stakeholders to develop effective education programs for all participants, especially the disadvantaged.
