    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act of 2006\". Food allergy is a growing concern in the US, especially among students. Peanut allergy doubled among students from 1997 to 2002. A survey of elementary school nurses in 2003 found a high number of students with severe food allergies. 44% of nurses reported an increase in food allergies in the past 5 years. A study in 2001 showed that over half of fatal food-allergy induced reactions were in individuals aged 18 or younger. Food allergies are a serious concern, especially among younger individuals. 8 foods are responsible for 90% of food-allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can be fatal if not treated promptly with epinephrine. Fatalities from anaphylaxis are often due to a delay in administering epinephrine. In a study of 13 food allergy-induced anaphylactic reactions in school-age children, only 2 of the children who died received epinephrine within 1 hour, while all but 1 of the children who survived received epinephrine within 30 minutes. Various medical associations recognize the importance of managing life-threatening food allergies in schools, but there are no Federal guidelines for this. Three-quarters of elementary school nurses are involved in managing life-threatening food allergies. Many elementary school nurses create their own training guidelines. Schools often lack full-time nurses, leading to one nurse covering multiple schools with hundreds or thousands of students. Parents of students with severe food allergies face inconsistent management approaches when changing schools. Delays in treating food allergy reactions in schools are due to not following emergency plans, calling parents instead of administering medication, and not being able to administer epinephrine. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"elementary school\" according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"school\" includes kindergartens, elementary schools, and secondary schools. The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Education. The Secretaries must develop a voluntary policy for managing food allergies and anaphylaxis in schools within a year of this Act. The policy should include guidelines for parents to provide documentation from a student's physician or nurse before each school year, detailing food allergies and prior history of anaphylaxis. The policy for managing food allergies and anaphylaxis in schools includes creating individual health care plans for students at risk, detailing emergency procedures, medication lists, and assessing readiness for self-administration. It also provides substitute meal options and procedures for self-administration of medication by capable students. The policy for managing food allergies in schools includes communication strategies with emergency medical services, reducing exposure to allergens, disseminating information on allergies, and training school personnel. The policy for managing food allergies in schools includes training school personnel to administer epinephrine when the nurse is not available, ensuring timely access to epinephrine, addressing extracurricular programs in health care plans, and collecting data on epinephrine administrations. This policy does not override state laws on students self-administering medication. SEC. 5. SCHOOL-BASED FOOD ALLERGY MANAGEMENT GRANTS. The Secretaries may award grants up to $50,000 to local educational agencies to help implement food allergy management guidelines. To be eligible, agencies must submit an application certifying adoption of the guidelines and describing the funded activities. The grant awarded to local educational agencies will fund activities for implementing food allergy management guidelines, including informing parents and students, training school staff, and carrying out guidelines at individual schools. Each local educational agency receiving a grant under this section can use the funds for creating systems and databases for student record management. The agency must also provide a budget table, describe how guidelines will be monitored, and cooperate in any evaluations conducted by the Secretaries. The grant funds can be used for creating, storing, and maintaining student records, purchasing equipment or services related to student records, training personnel for food allergy management, purchasing medical supplies, educating students about food allergies, outreach to parents, and other activities consistent with the policy guidelines. Grants can be awarded for up to 2 years. The grant awarded under this section is limited to a maximum of $50,000 and can be used for student records, equipment, training, medical supplies, and education on food allergies. Priority is given to local educational agencies receiving Federal funding under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Administrative costs are capped at 2% of the grant amount, and progress evaluations are required for grants lasting less than a year. Local educational agencies receiving grants under this section must provide information on the implementation of food allergy management guidelines. Agencies receiving grants for 1 to 2 years must report on progress and successful implementation of the guidelines. The agency must report on the successful implementation of food allergy management guidelines, which are voluntary but required to receive grant funds. Grant funds should supplement, not replace, other available funds. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2007, with additional funding for the following years."
