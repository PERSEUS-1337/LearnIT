    "content": "The \"Fast Help For Homeowners Act\" requires prompt decision making regarding short sales under the Truth in Lending Act. The \"Fast Help For Homeowners Act\" mandates that a servicer must notify all holders of subordinate liens on a property within 10 days of receiving a written request from a mortgagor of a federally related mortgage loan. The \"Fast Help For Homeowners Act\" requires a subordinate lien holder to respond in writing to a servicer within 45 days of receiving notification regarding a mortgagor's request. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in the request being considered approved by the lien holder. The written response must specify whether the request has been denied or approved. The \"Fast Help For Homeowners Act\" mandates that a mortgagor's request for a short sale must be responded to by a subordinate lien holder within 45 days. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in the request being considered approved. The response must specify if the request has been denied, approved, or approved with specified changes. The \"Short Sales Taking A New Direction Act\" exempts federally related mortgage loans from the 45-day response requirement for short sale approval if a written agreement is in place before the enactment date. It also clarifies that other laws or contracts with shorter time limits for decision-making on short sales are not affected. The definition of a federally related mortgage loan is consistent with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 defines terms like 'securitization vehicle' as a legal structure for issuing securities backed by mortgage loans, 'servicer' as a person managing mortgage loans, and 'short sale' as the sale of a property for less than the amount owed on the mortgage. The amendment defines a short sale as the sale of a property for less than the remaining amount due on the mortgage, requiring authorization from the securitization vehicle, investment holder, or servicer. It applies to written requests for short sales made after the enactment of the Act."
