    "content": "The \"Smart Grid Advancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. Definitions are provided in Section 2. The terms defined in this Act include the Secretary of Energy, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Smart Grid as per the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Peak demand reduction, and Peak demand. The Act defines terms such as \"peak period,\" \"load serving entity,\" \"applicable baseline,\" and \"peak load reduction plan\" in relation to electricity demand and system reliability. The Act defines terms related to electricity demand and system reliability, including \"peak load reduction plan\" as a plan developed by a load serving entity to meet peak demand management goals. Incorporation of smart grid capability in Energy Star program. Within one year of this Act, the Secretary and the Administrator will assess integrating Smart Grid technologies in products reviewed by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency for Energy Star designation. Within two years, they will analyze potential energy and electricity cost savings for products with full Smart Grid capability in utility service areas with Smart Grid capability and time-of-use electric rates. The Secretary and the Administrator will assess integrating Smart Grid technologies in products for Energy Star designation. They will analyze energy and electricity cost savings for products with Smart Grid capability in utility service areas with time-of-use electric rates. The analysis will determine if the installation of Smart Grid capability for each product would be cost effective based on cumulative savings over 5 years exceeding the incremental cost of Smart Grid features. The Secretary and the Administrator will inform manufacturers of products with Smart Grid capability if it is cost-effective. They will also highlight Smart Grid features on Energy Star labels, emphasizing their value and dependency on utility systems. The Energy Star program will analyze products with Smart Grid capability to determine potential cost savings from energy and electricity usage. A report will be submitted to Congress outlining the results and national savings if cost-effective Smart Grid features were installed in relevant products. SEC. 4. SMART GRID PEAK DEMAND REDUCTION GOALS. Load serving entities or States must establish peak demand reduction goals for entities with baselines exceeding 250 megawatts within one year of this Act. The Commission, with input from the Secretary, will create a methodology for adjusting baselines over time to account for various external factors. The Commission will assist load serving entities in determining baselines and setting peak demand reduction goals. The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission and the National Electric Reliability Corporation, will develop a system and rules for measuring and verifying demand reductions. Peak demand reduction goals can be set for individual load serving entities or by State or regional entities for larger regions with common peak demand. State or regional entities establishing peak demand reduction goals must cooperate with the Commission, the Secretary, and other relevant bodies. The applicable peak demand reduction goals can be determined using the 2009 National Demand Response Potential Assessment. Load serving entities must reduce peak demand by a minimum percentage in 2012 and a greater percentage in 2015. Each load serving entity must prepare a peak load reduction plan to meet applicable goals through energy efficiency measures or contractual commitments for peak reduction. The goals are based on the 2009 National Demand Response Potential Assessment, with minimum reductions in 2012 and greater reductions in 2015 achievable with smart grid technologies. The load serving entity must commit to peak reduction through various methods such as demand response programs, smart appliances, distributed generation resources, and dynamic electricity storage. The load serving entity must commit to peak reduction through methods like demand response programs, smart appliances, and distributed generation. Distributed generation is reliable during peak periods, with smart appliances and equipment available for direct control by the utility. If certain methods are used for peak demand reduction, the entity must demonstrate this capability through testing. The Act does not require the disclosure of confidential information in peak demand reduction plans. States retain authority to regulate peak load management, demand response, and distributed storage. The Commission aims to coordinate Federal and State programs for peak management. The Commission may grant relief to load serving entities from requirements, except as provided in other laws. They will establish a public website for compliance information and report to Congress annually on meeting peak demand reduction goals. The Commission will report on meeting peak demand reduction goals and may grant relief to load serving entities. They have the authority to modify peak demand reduction goals and provide assistance and funding through grants. The Secretary may deem costs burdensome or extraordinary, and funding is authorized for the Commission, Secretary, and Administrator to implement the provisions of this Act. SEC. 5. REAUTHORIZATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM TO INCLUDE SMART GRID INFORMATION. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to focus on energy efficiency and Smart Grid technology. Changes include increasing energy efficiency, optimizing economic and environmental benefits, and reducing energy and electricity prices throughout the economy. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to focus on energy efficiency and Smart Grid technology, including purchasing equipment with smart grid features and updating deadlines to 2020. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include Smart Grid features in the appliance rebate program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new definition for \"smart appliance\" in the energy efficient and smart appliance rebate program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new definition for \"smart appliance\" in the energy efficient and smart appliance rebate program, with specific modifications to subsections (b)(1), (b)(3), (d), and (e)(3) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new definition for \"smart appliance\" in the energy efficient and smart appliance rebate program, with specific modifications to subsections (b)(1), (b)(3), (d), and (e)(3) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Additionally, changes are made to subsection (f) regarding necessary funding for fiscal years 2010 through 2015. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new definition for \"smart appliance\" in the energy efficient and smart appliance rebate program."
