Management competencies are defined for supervisors in the federal government, with guidance issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management on expected competencies. Agencies are required to assess competency based on the OPM model. The competency model requires agencies to assess supervisors' overall competency, develop a training program to address identified issues, and measure the program's effectiveness. Agencies must submit annual reports on their progress in implementing these requirements. Technical amendments are made to the table of sections in the United States Code. The text amends section 4304(b)(3) of title 5, United States Code by replacing \"section 4305\" with \"section 4306\" in regulations related to management competencies."
