    "content": "The federal government offers various disaster assistance programs, including rebuilding infrastructure and complying with environmental laws like NEPA. Emergency response actions under the Stafford Act are exempt from NEPA requirements. The Stafford Act exempts emergency response actions from NEPA requirements, allowing for essential relief to victims and protective measures to reduce immediate threats. However, long-term recovery projects may still need to comply with NEPA for activities like modifying existing structures or relocating structures in a floodplain. Compliance with other environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, or National Historic Preservation Act may also be necessary. The NEPA process is not the source of obligation for compliance with laws like the Endangered Species Act or National Historic Preservation Act. Congressional interest in NEPA implementation for disaster-related projects has been driven by confusion among federal grant applicants. This report discusses the NEPA process for projects seeking federal funding for disaster recovery or preparedness. This report focuses on the NEPA process for projects requiring grant applicants to provide specific information for eligibility, excluding disaster-related projects that involve federal agencies collecting environmental review documentation. The report primarily discusses the NEPA process for recovery and rebuilding projects funded by FEMA and HUD. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts before proceeding with proposed actions, with regulations set by the Council on Environmental Quality. The NEPA regulations set by the Council on Environmental Quality direct federal agencies like FEMA and HUD to implement environmental review requirements for disaster-related projects. These regulations specify the need to consider potential environmental impacts before proceeding with proposed actions. The NEPA regulations require federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews for disaster-related projects, assessing potential environmental consequences before proceeding with actions. Agencies are not required to prioritize environmental concerns over other factors, but must evaluate and identify adverse effects. Compliance with legal requirements from state and federal agencies may be necessary for disaster-related projects. The NEPA regulations require federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews for disaster-related projects, assessing potential environmental consequences before proceeding with actions. Compliance with all applicable environmental laws, executive orders, and legal requirements should be documented within the NEPA documentation, forming the \"NEPA umbrella.\" NEPA serves as a framework for coordination and compliance with other environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Clean Water Act. Compliance with each applicable law would still be required even if NEPA requirements were removed. FEMA's NEPA process serves as a Unified Federal Environmental and Historic Preservation Review (EHP review) for disaster recovery projects. Projects must comply with EHP laws, regulations, and Executive Orders to protect various resources and minimize adverse effects on low-income and minority communities. After a disaster, Federal Agencies conduct EHP reviews to ensure compliance with over twenty EHP requirements for disaster recovery projects. These reviews are necessary before approving Federal assistance or permits. NEPA serves as an umbrella statute for environmental review requirements, such as those for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) by HUD. An environmental review must be conducted before committing funds to a project. The environmental review for projects must document compliance with various statutes and authorities, including historic preservation, floodplain management, wetland protection, and more. The process aims to identify applicable compliance requirements and ensure compliance. Stakeholders have cited NEPA as a challenge post-Hurricane Katrina in dispersing CDBG funds. The challenge in dispersing CDBG funds post-Hurricane Katrina is due to stakeholders struggling to distinguish between NEPA requirements and other environmental compliance criteria. Various agencies like the Corps, Fish and Wildlife Service, Coast Guard, EPA, and state regulators require comprehensive reviews and documentation for project funding. The NEPA process may not be the sole cause of project delays, as other agencies may have separate requirements for permits and consultations. After a disaster, communities may be overwhelmed with projects, leading to delays in federal funding for planned projects. In the aftermath of a disaster, agencies can struggle with compliance requirements and accessing federal funding for reconstruction. Failure to meet environmental obligations can slow down funding, and federal agencies aim to rebuild in a way that prevents future disasters. The NEPA process plays a crucial role in demonstrating compliance. The NEPA process is crucial for federal agencies to meet environmental obligations in disaster-related projects. It applies to projects funded by federal agencies and helps in demonstrating compliance for rebuilding and mitigation efforts. Various funding sources are available for disaster-related projects, with different levels of environmental review required. The NEPA process is essential for federal agencies to fulfill environmental obligations in disaster-related projects. It involves the lead agency, cooperating agencies, and project applicants. Various federal programs provide funding for eligible projects, with different levels of environmental review required. The NEPA process involves the lead agency, cooperating agencies, and project applicants for disaster-related projects. Multiple funding sources may be available for a single project, with the lead agency coordinating environmental reviews. If more than one federal agency is involved, they must determine the lead agency based on factors like project approval authority. The lead agency, cooperating agencies, and project applicants work together for disaster-related projects. Cooperating agencies, such as EPA, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Corps, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, provide expertise on environmental impacts for NEPA documentation. The project applicant, such as a state or local agency, plays a significant role in the NEPA process by providing information to support FEMA's Environmental and Historic Preservation compliance process. Funds will not be awarded until FEMA completes its environmental review. Determining NEPA applicability is straightforward, but assessing the level of review needed for a project can be case-specific. Some FEMA-funded projects are exempt from NEPA compliance, while others require review based on their impacts. This review can result in categorical exclusion or the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. Preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required for actions with significant environmental impact, while an Environmental Assessment (EA) is for uncertain impacts. The majority of FEMA-funded projects are likely exempt or approved as categorical exclusions, with only a small percentage requiring an EIS. Alternative compliance arrangements may be considered for projects with significant effects implemented under emergency conditions. Alternative arrangements for environmental review may be considered for actions subject to NEPA. The Stafford Act exempts certain FEMA-funded activities from NEPA in emergencies and disasters to preserve life and property. Exclusions apply to most Public Assistance actions but not to hazard mitigation or FEMA grant programs. Response actions excluded from NEPA include federal assistance for disaster support. The federal assistance provided in response to a major disaster includes immediate actions to save lives and protect property, repair and restore damaged buildings, and remove debris. This assistance is essential for meeting immediate threats to life and property resulting from a disaster. After a major disaster, federal emergency assistance may include personnel, equipment, supplies, and support for disaster assistance. Actions exempt from NEPA still require compliance with other environmental laws. Federal environmental statutes, such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, provide exemptions for designated FEMA-funded activities authorized under the Stafford Act. HUD-funded programs like CDBG disaster assistance do not have similar exemptions. Projects with no significant environmental impacts may be categorically excluded from preparing an EA or EIS. Federal environmental statutes provide exemptions for certain FEMA-funded activities under the Stafford Act, while HUD-funded programs like CDBG disaster assistance do not have similar exemptions. Projects with minimal environmental impacts may be categorically excluded from preparing an EA or EIS, as individual agencies list specific projects that are likely to be considered categorical exclusions. For example, FEMA identifies upgrades to codes and standards, removal of structures after addressing historic preservation needs, and minor improvements at existing facilities as categorical exclusions. HUD identifies the \"acquisition, repair, improvement, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of public facilities and improvements (other than buildings)\" as a categorical exclusion. The categorical exclusion for the rehabilitation of public facilities and improvements (other than buildings) involves projects that will be retained in the same use without a significant change in size or capacity. Documentation requirements may vary depending on extraordinary circumstances that could impact the environmental effect of the project. It is important to note that a project not having a significant impact under NEPA does not exempt it from statutory requirements. Compliance with environmental laws may be required for federal actions impacting historical sites, endangered species habitat, wetlands, or minority neighborhoods. Even categorically excluded projects may need documentation to support the CE determination. Unresolved extraordinary circumstances may require an Environmental Assessment (EA) if there is a potential significant adverse environmental impact. The proposed action may require an Environmental Assessment (EA) if it cannot be categorically excluded. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) may be necessary for projects with significant environmental impacts, such as those aimed at long-term recovery of affected regions. Examples include disaster-related projects like flood-control, hurricane protection, road construction, storm water management, and public facilities. Past disasters can help determine if an EIS is needed for a project. An Environmental Assessment (EA) may be required for disaster-related projects to determine if an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is needed. CEQ regulations define an EA as a concise document providing evidence for decision-making, including the need for the proposal, alternatives, impacts, and consultation with agencies. The process for developing an EA may be similar to that of an EIS. The applicant should consult agencies to scope the project, discuss purpose and need, identify alternatives, mitigate adverse impacts, and meet environmental review requirements. Public participation in the EA process is at the discretion of the lead agency. If impacts are significant, EIS preparation begins; if not, a FONSI is prepared as the agency's decision record. The FONSI must be available to the public. In emergency situations, Alternative Arrangements can be used to expedite the NEPA process for actions with significant environmental impacts without following all NEPA regulations. These arrangements do not waive the requirement to comply with NEPA regulations but aim to speed up the process when an EIS would typically be needed. The federal agency must consult with CEQ to determine the specific arrangements and time frame for completion. Alternative Arrangements under NEPA provide a means of compliance in emergency situations to control immediate impacts without fully following NEPA regulations. CEQ guidance from 2005, specific to Hurricane Katrina, outlines activities like disposal of disaster debris and facility replacement for analysis under alternative arrangements after a disaster. After a disaster, alternative arrangements for projects that do not require an EIS can be used for disaster response, recovery, and mitigation. Federal funding for rebuilding roads, bridges, and buildings post-disaster requires meeting specific criteria to ensure funds are not wasted in future disasters. Before federal funds are provided for disaster recovery or rebuilding, compliance with regulations, laws, and executive orders must be assured through the NEPA process to reduce the risk of investment loss in future disasters."
