    "content": "Ammonium perchlorate is a key ingredient in solid fuel for rockets and missiles, while other perchlorate salts are used in various products. Concerns about the health effects of perchlorate exposure have led to states setting their own drinking water standards, such as Massachusetts at 2 ppb and California at 6 ppb. Multiple states have issued health goals or advisory levels for perchlorate in water. Perchlorate contamination has been found near weapons and rocket fuel manufacturing facilities, military bases, and other sources such as fireworks and construction sites. It can also occur naturally and as a breakdown product of other substances. Detected in drinking water primarily in the Southwest and scattered locations across the country, contamination is most often found in groundwater, including large aquifers in California. EPA required public water systems to monitor for perchlorate in 1999. The EPA mandated monitoring for perchlorate in public water systems to determine its presence and levels nationwide. Out of 3,865 systems tested, 4.1% had levels of perchlorate exceeding 4 \u00b5g/L, with 14 systems surpassing EPA's remediation goal. California had 58 systems with elevated levels. Approximately 1.9% of samples collected had perchlorate detections, with an average concentration of 9.85 \u00b5g/L. California has implemented more extensive monitoring for perchlorate. Since 2002, perchlorate has been detected in 241 sources of drinking water in California. EPA found contamination at 65 DOD facilities, 7 federal facilities, and 37 private sites in 2005. Perchlorate was detected at 395 sites overall. FDA tested 500 food samples in 2004, finding perchlorate in 90% of lettuce samples and 101 of 104 bottled milk samples. The FDA began testing a wider range of foods in 2005 for perchlorate presence, detecting it in 625 out of 1065 samples and in 211 out of 285 foods tested. Perchlorate levels were mostly low but higher in some foods like shrimp, tomatoes, spinach, and bacon. Children aged 2 years had the highest perchlorate intake, followed by infants and children aged 6 to 10 years. EPA considers non-water exposures when setting standards for contaminants like perchlorate, which is not known to cause cancer. Perchlorate is a contaminant that disrupts iodine uptake in the thyroid, leading to health effects similar to iodine deficiency. It can impair thyroid function in pregnant women, affecting fetal development and learning capacity. Studies show that even low levels of perchlorate can impact thyroid hormone levels, especially in women with iodine deficiency. Perchlorate may affect thyroid hormone levels in women with iodine deficiency. EPA has evaluated perchlorate for a potential federal drinking water standard. In 1998, perchlorate was placed on the list of contaminants. In 1998, EPA listed perchlorate as a candidate for regulation but deemed information insufficient for a decision. Further research on health effects and treatment technologies was prioritized, with water systems required to monitor perchlorate in 1999. By January 2007, EPA had enough data to make a regulatory determination. EPA issued draft reference doses for perchlorate exposure in 1992 and 1995. The EPA develops Reference Doses (RfDs) to estimate daily oral exposure levels that do not cause adverse health effects. Factors like sensitive populations, study duration, and data gaps are considered. Draft RfDs for perchlorate range from 0.0001 to 0.0005 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 4-18 ppb in drinking water. The EPA uses RfDs to set drinking water standards, considering costs, monitoring capabilities, and other sources of perchlorate exposure. In 1999, a human risk benchmark of 0.0009 mg/kg/day (32 ppb in water) was established, with a 100-fold uncertainty factor. In 2002, EPA prepared a draft risk assessment for perchlorate, identifying potential health risks including effects on the nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies. The draft RfD was 0.00003 mg/kg per day, equivalent to a drinking water level of 1 ppb, sparking controversy over cleanup costs and science policy concerns. In 2002, an interagency working group including DOD, EPA, and other agencies convened to discuss perchlorate risk assessment and regulatory issues. The group asked the National Research Council to review the available science to resolve uncertainty over perchlorate's health effects and the draft risk assessment. The National Research Council (NRC) was asked by an interagency working group to review the science on perchlorate and EPA's draft assessment. The NRC committee found limitations in using rat studies to assess human health risks from perchlorate exposure, noting humans have mechanisms to compensate for iodide deficiency and thyroid disorders. Flaws were also found in the design and methods of the rat studies. The NRC found flaws in the design and methods of rat studies used for assessing perchlorate risks. They recommended that EPA not use animal data as the basis for risk assessment and disagreed with EPA's definition of adverse effects related to changes in thyroid hormone levels. The committee suggested using nonadverse effects to evaluate perchlorate's potential impacts. The committee recommended using nonadverse effects, specifically the inhibition of iodide uptake by the thyroid in humans, as the basis for risk assessment of perchlorate. This approach led to an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect the most sensitive population, such as fetuses of pregnant women with hypothyroidism or iodide deficiency. The recommendation was supported by human studies and epidemiologic research. The NRC recommended a reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg per day for perchlorate based on human studies and epidemiologic research. EPA adopted this recommendation in 2005, setting a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb to protect pregnant women and fetuses. EPA assumed all exposure would come from drinking water when establishing the DWEL. EPA adopted a reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg per day for perchlorate in 2005, setting a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb. The Superfund office adopted this value as the preliminary remediation goal for perchlorate cleanup. The Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee raised concerns that the PRG did not protect infants, who could be exposed to perchlorate through breast milk. They recommended lowering the PRG and developing a standard for perchlorate in drinking water. The Superfund office lowered the PRG for perchlorate and the Office of Water was tasked with developing a standard for perchlorate in drinking water. EPA announced a preliminary determination not to regulate perchlorate due to low occurrence levels above the health reference level. The Science Advisory Board argued that EPA must have a compelling basis to support this decision. EPA sought advice from the NRC before finalizing a drinking water standard for perchlorate. They replaced the preliminary remediation goal with an interim health advisory of 15 ppb, based on NRC's recommendation to protect fetuses of pregnant women. The advisory considers exposures from food and water. The EPA sought NRC advice on perchlorate's health effects, particularly on infants and young children. Despite concerns about infant exposure, EPA decided not to further review perchlorate issues to avoid delays in regulatory decisions. EPA published a Supplemental Request for Comments seeking public input on analyzing data for perchlorate regulation. The agency is reevaluating exposure to sensitive life stages and may decide to regulate perchlorate. The DOD has spent over $114 million on research and cleanup efforts for perchlorate contamination. Cleanup efforts are typically driven by drinking water standards, but without a federal standard, goals and responsibilities are unclear. In 2006, the EPA set a DWEL for perchlorate, prompting DOD to adopt a policy setting 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. The DOD has adopted a policy setting 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. EPA has withdrawn the 2006 perchlorate remediation guidance and recommends using the interim health advisory level of 15 ppb for cleanup. Legislation in the 111th Congress may address managing perchlorate releases. Legislation in the 111th Congress addresses the regulation of perchlorate under the Safe Drinking Water Act. H.R. 3206 requires EPA to propose a drinking water regulation for perchlorate within 12 months and finalize it within 18 months. Funding has been allocated for the cleanup of perchlorate contamination in drinking water wells and for Inland Empire perchlorate remediation. H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252, titled the Inland Empire Perchlorate Ground Water Plume Assessment Act of 2009, would require studies on water resources in California, specifically the Rialto-Colton Basin. The studies would include a survey of ground water resources, focusing on perchlorate concentrations. H.R. 4252 was passed by the House and ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Additionally, H.R. 102 would authorize appropriations for the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund with a non-federal matching requirement for water districts. During the 110th Congress, bills were considered regarding perchlorate contamination, with S. 24 introduced to require water systems to test for perchlorate. S. 150 and H.R. 1747 aimed to set a standard for perchlorate. Senate committees reported on S. 24 and S. 150, while H.Con.Res. 347 urged action to educate the public on iodine intake for protection against perchlorate exposure."
