The State Administrator shall establish a Problem Resolution Office with officers authorized to investigate taxpayer complaints and halt collection activities if deemed non-compliant with the law. Only the highest official or General Counsel of the relevant taxing authority can reverse such injunctions based on clear evidence. Officers cannot be penalized unless issuing unreasonable injunctions repeatedly. The State Administrator can establish a Problem Resolution Office to investigate taxpayer complaints and stop collection activities if found to be non-compliant with the law. This section does not limit the authority of the State Administrators or taxpayers to seek legal remedies in court. \"SEC. 53. JURISDICTION AND INTERSTATE ALLOCATION.\" The Secretary will establish an Office of Revenue Allocation to resolve disputes among states regarding the destination of taxable property and services for revenue allocation from taxes imposed by this subtitle. The Administrator's determination can be reviewed in federal court under an abuse of discretion standard. The destination of taxable property and services for revenue allocation from taxes imposed by this subtitle is determined based on the location of the property or services. Tangible personal property is allocated to the state where it was delivered, real property to the state where it is located, and other property to the purchaser's residence. Services are allocated to the state where they are used, consumed, or enjoyed. Allocation of service invoices for services occurring in multiple jurisdictions is based on time. Telecommunications services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. Domestic transportation services are allocated based on the final destination of the trip, while international transportation services are allocated based on the final destination or origin. For transportation services with a final destination or origin outside the United States, 50 percent of the service amount is attributed to the United States. Financial intermediation services are allocated based on the purchaser's residence. State Tax Administrators have jurisdiction over payments with a destination within their state. Rents and royalties for tangible property are allocated based on the property's location. Payments for the lease of tangible property are determined by the property's location. For vehicles, rent and lease payments depend on the term length: for terms of one month or less, it's where the vehicle was delivered, and for terms longer than one month, it's the lessee's residence. SEC. 54. TAX TO BE STATED AND CHARGED SEPARATELY. The sales tax must be charged separately from the purchase price by the vendor. A receipt provided to the purchaser should include details such as the price exclusive of tax, amount of tax paid, price inclusive of tax, tax rate, date of sale, vendor's name, and registration number. The vending machine exception exempts sales made through vending machines from the requirements of charging sales tax separately. Vending machines must dispense taxable items for coins or bills up to twenty dollars, with no single item exceeding ten dollars in price. The State Administrator or Secretary can enter installment agreements or compromises for tax payments to facilitate collection. Agreements remain valid unless inaccurate information is provided. Accounting procedures are also outlined. SEC. 56. ACCOUNTING. Vendors must use the cash method for tax remittance. An accrual method election is allowed for reporting transactions.

Modifications to federal income tax for taxable years ending June 30, 2006 include reducing dollar figures by half for calendar year taxpayers. For fiscal year taxpayers, the dollar figures in section 1 and section 11 are adjusted based on the taxpayer's taxable year ending June 30, 2006. The Secretary is required to publish tax rate schedules accordingly. Starting January 1, 2006, the Social Security Administration will collect payroll taxes. Section 7 of the Act covers self-employment tax rules. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases of taxable property or services, wages paid for business purposes, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income from prior periods. Transition amounts for the years starting in 2006 are calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount from December 31, 2005, divided by ten. The unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 2005, is divided by ten. This amount relates to prior law section 167 property and inventory held at the end of 2005. Conforming amendments are made to subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c), with subsections 1402(d) et seq. being renumbered as subsections 1402(b) et seq. SEC. 8. SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS INDEXED ON SALES TAX INCLUSIVE BASIS. The Consumer Price Index for Social Security benefits is amended to calculate the CPI increase percentage based on quarterly data provided by the Department of Labor. The term 'CPI increase percentage' is defined as the percentage by which the product of the Consumer Price Index for a quarter and the national sales tax factor exceeds the index for the most recent prior base quarter or cost-of-living computation quarter. The national sales tax factor is calculated as one plus the sales tax rate divided by one.

This calculation involves dividing the sales tax rate by one. SEC. 9. COMPENSATING PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN PERSONS ON FIXED INCOME. Compensating Payment: Eligible persons receive a compensating payment if they comply with the application requirements. The payment is calculated based on the qualified fixed income payment amount and the excess inflation rate. An eligible person is someone entitled to Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. A qualified fixed income payment is received by a beneficiary under a defined benefit plan. A qualified fixed income payment is received by a beneficiary under a defined benefit plan or annuity contract. Such payments do not vary with investment performance, interest rates, or inflation. Payments under an annuity contract entered into after June 30, 2006, are not considered qualified fixed income payments. Additionally, payments to a beneficiary who was a participant in the defined benefit plan for less than 5 years are also not qualified fixed income payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount is calculated as \\1/12\\ of the total payments eligible individuals are entitled to receive in the following calendar year, capped at $5,000. The excess inflation rate is determined by comparing the consumer price index over an 18-month period ending December 31, 2006, with the projected increase reported in the Office of Management and Budget baseline for the same period. An application is required to receive compensating payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services requires an application for compensating payments, to be paid with Social Security benefits. Insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors may need to provide information for determining qualified fixed income payment amounts. SEC. 10 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to lower the interest rate. SEC. 11 requires a supermajority vote in Congress to raise federal sales tax rates or provide tax benefits that reduce federal revenues."
