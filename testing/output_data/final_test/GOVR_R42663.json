    "content": "A health insurance exchange is a marketplace for buying and selling health insurance products. Exchanges bring together individuals, businesses, and insurance companies to increase access to coverage. Exchanges contract with insurers to offer their products, with some exchanges having more administrative roles in facilitating transactions. A health insurance exchange can function like a website for buying insurance, similar to Kayak for airline tickets. The Utah Health Exchange is a minimalist example, connecting consumers to information for informed choices. Exchanges can also have additional functions beyond just being a marketplace, such as implementing regulatory standards. An exchange, like the Health Connector in Massachusetts, implements regulatory standards and determines eligibility for plans and subsidies. It can be physical or virtual, governed by public, private, or hybrid entities. An exchange, whether physical or virtual, is established to provide a platform for insurance companies to offer their products and for purchasers to compare and select from various options. The concept was introduced in the ACA to enhance access to health insurance, with states having flexibility in designing and operating their exchanges. The ACA allows states to establish their own health insurance exchanges, either independently, in partnership with the federal government, or leaving it to the federal government. Open enrollment starts on October 1, 2013, with all exchanges operational by January 1, 2014. The report outlines requirements, functions, financial responsibilities, and coverage options for ACA exchanges, aiming to provide marketplaces for individuals and small businesses to shop for comprehensive private health insurance. The ACA allows states to establish health insurance exchanges, offering comprehensive plans meeting ACA reforms. Plans will be certified as \"qualified health plans\" (QHPs) and enrollment is voluntary. Exchanges facilitate purchasing QHPs and provide subsidies for low to middle-income individuals. Individuals, small businesses, and insurance carriers can participate in the health insurance market outside of exchanges. The ACA allows states to establish health insurance exchanges, offering qualified health plans (QHPs) for voluntary enrollment. Exchanges assist low to middle-income individuals in purchasing and using health insurance, screening for eligibility for public programs like Medicaid. Small businesses can use the SHOP exchange to purchase QHPs for their employees. Exchanges must be established by the state or the Secretary of HHS. Exchanges, established by the state or Secretary of HHS, must carry out general functions for individuals and small businesses. They will manage QHPs, assist in accessing coverage, and have an open enrollment period from October 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014. Coverage for qualified individuals and small businesses must begin on January 1, 2014. ACA provides direction for exchange establishment and administration, supplemented by regulations from federal agencies like HHS. States have the option to establish their own exchanges or partner with the federal government. If a state-based exchange is not approved, the HHS Secretary can establish and operate an exchange directly. In a federally-facilitated exchange, HHS carries out all functions and has authority over the exchange. In a state partnership exchange, a state can partner with the federal government to combine certain state-designed functions with federally-designed functions. States in a partnership exchange must carry out specific functions related to plan management or consumer assistance. HHS retains authority over state partnership exchanges, but states may also choose to establish and administer their SHOP exchange while the federal government administers the state's individual exchange. States had until December 14, 2012, to declare their intentions to operate a State-Based Exchange (SBE) in 2014, and until February 15, 2013, to declare their intentions for a partnership exchange. HHS has not set a deadline for requesting a state-based SHOP/federally-facilitated individual exchange, but only states with an approved SBE application can request the change for 2014. States' decisions on exchange types are shown in Figure 1 as of May 30, 2013, with the possibility of future changes. The HHS Secretary must approve the operation of a State-Based Exchange (SBE) if it meets certain standards, including the ability to carry out required functions and information reporting. States can choose to establish a SBE in the future even if they opt out for 2014. A State-Based Exchange (SBE) can be established by a state if approved by the HHS Secretary. The state has the option to create its own exchange structure, decide if it will be a governmental agency or non-profit, and can operate independently or collaborate with other states for a regional exchange. States can establish subsidiary exchanges serving distinct areas that meet geographic size requirements. They must serve the entire state population and meet all exchange requirements. A State-Based Exchange (SBE) must operate individual and SHOP exchanges, which can be merged or separate in governance structures. Regional and subsidiary exchanges must function as SHOP exchanges. A State-Based Exchange (SBE) can operate individual and SHOP exchanges under different governance structures. The SHOP exchange must cover the same geographic area as the individual exchange. States have the authority to allow SBEs to contract with entities to carry out exchange responsibilities, regardless of whether the exchange is a governmental agency or a non-profit. For example, a non-profit SBE could contract with a state agency for consumer assistance functions. A State-Based Exchange (SBE) must have a governing board with specific requirements, including consumer representation, transparency, and relevant healthcare experience. The governance principles for State-Based Exchanges (SBEs) include ethics, conflict of interest standards, transparency, and accounting standards. SBEs must disclose financial interests, and their principles are reviewed periodically by HHS. If a state does not operate its own exchange, the HHS Secretary establishes a Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE) in the state, which must adhere to similar standards as SBEs outlined in the ACA and regulations. HHS provides guidance on how FFEs operate within this framework. The regulations and guidance outline how a Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE) operates within the ACA framework. FFEs determine plans offered, conduct eligibility activities, and operate the SHOP exchange. States can enter partnerships with HHS for FFE implementation, where HHS retains authority but states assume certain responsibilities. Exchanges require states to manage plan management or consumer assistance activities in partnership exchanges. States can choose to administer plan management, consumer assistance, or both. Plan management involves recommending and overseeing exchange plans, while consumer assistance includes providing in-person help and outreach. States opting for both activities will handle all responsibilities. Exchanges are responsible for various functions such as determining eligibility, enrolling individuals in plans, plan management, assisting consumers, ensuring accountability, and financial management. These responsibilities apply to both State-Based Exchanges (SBEs) and Federally Facilitated Exchanges (FFEs). Individual exchanges and SHOP exchanges may have different responsibilities. Exchanges must verify information from applicants and re-determine eligibility as needed. They are expected to have secure electronic databases for sharing information among agencies. Individual exchanges use a streamlined application to collect and verify applicant information, including verifying social security numbers through HHS. HHS will consult with Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify information. Individual exchanges must re-determine eligibility based on new information, either from the enrollee or through periodic examinations. Annual re-determinations are required, with additional assessments for status changes. An individual exchange is required to determine eligibility for enrollment in a QHP and facilitate enrollment. Financial assistance in the form of premium tax credits is available for some individuals purchasing exchange coverage. Premium tax credits are advanceable and help offset the cost of coverage. The Affordable Care Act provides advanceable premium tax credits to individuals to help pay for insurance premiums, which can be received in advance to coincide with when premiums are due. Additionally, cost-sharing subsidies are available to help with out-of-pocket costs for health services. Eligibility for premium tax credits must be determined at the time of applying for coverage through an exchange. An individual exchange may determine eligibility for advance payment of premium tax credits directly or implement HHS's determination. The exchange must calculate the advance payment amount according to Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code and only provide it if the applicant meets eligibility criteria. Eligibility for cost-sharing subsidies can also be determined directly by the exchange or through HHS. If an individual exchange chooses not to directly determine eligibility for premium tax credits or cost-sharing subsidies, they must transmit all information to HHS for determination. The exchange does not make a recommendation but shares information with HHS and adheres to their eligibility decisions. The exchange may also assess eligibility for Medicaid and/or CHIP. The individual exchange is responsible for assessing eligibility for Medicaid/CHIP and transmitting applicant information to the state agency for final determination. The exchange must adhere to the agency's decision on eligibility. The final rule on Medicaid eligibility changes under ACA is indicated by the state. The final rule on Medicaid eligibility changes under ACA states that the state Medicaid and/or CHIP agency will determine eligibility for its programs. Some individuals qualify for Medicaid based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), while others do not. States can decide the role of the individual exchange in determining eligibility for MAGI and non-MAGI populations. The Basic Health Program (BHP) is a health insurance program for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid, offered in states choosing to implement it. Exchanges will interact with BHPs in these states, determining eligibility and facilitating enrollment. SHOP, the exchange for small businesses, has similar responsibilities in collecting and verifying information for employers and employees. The SHOP, an exchange for small businesses, is responsible for processing applications from employers and employees to determine eligibility and facilitate enrollment in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs). Qualified employees receive coverage offers from qualified employers, who must make all full-time employees eligible for QHPs. The SHOP verifies applicants' eligibility and allows employers to purchase coverage. A SHOP allows employers to purchase coverage for employees at any time during the year, with a 12-month coverage period starting from the effective date. Employees follow annual open enrollment periods set by the SHOP, with exceptions for new hires. Employers are not obligated to contribute to premiums, and there is no specified minimum contribution requirement. Employers can choose coverage levels for all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) within that level, and may offer different QHPs through alternative methods. A SHOP allows employers to select coverage levels for all QHPs available to employees, with the option to limit plan selection. Premium aggregation functions are required, but not until 2015 according to a final rule. In 2014, a SHOP may choose to offer only one QHP to employees and decide whether to perform premium aggregation functions. Partnership exchanges allow employers to choose one QHP for employees without premium aggregation functions. Exchanges certify QHPs based on minimum criteria outlined in the ACA, including marketing, provider choice, networks, and accreditation. Recertification and decertification processes are also required, with recertification due by September 15 each year. The decertification process for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) includes requirements such as the ability for exchanges to decertify a plan if it no longer meets certification standards, an appeal process for decertification, and notification to all affected parties. Exchanges also have additional plan management functions, such as requiring justification for premium increases and posting this information on their websites. The HHS Secretary must create a system to rate QHPs based on quality and price, with exchanges assigning ratings to each QHP. Exchanges are responsible for assigning quality ratings to Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) based on HHS Secretary's criteria and providing this information on their websites. They assist consumers in accessing coverage, determining the right plan, and understanding financial responsibilities. Exchanges must operate a toll-free hotline for consumer assistance and adhere to accountability practices for transparency. The exchange provides assistance to consumers, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency, through a website offering information on QHPs, an electronic calculator for comparing plans, outreach and education activities, and a Navigator program for selecting a QHP. Navigators help individuals select a QHP and raise awareness of the exchange. Stakeholders consulted include enrollees, advocates, businesses, and health experts. Financial information on regulatory fees is shared on the website. Exchanges are responsible for financial management and are expected to be self-sustaining by 2015. They have the authority to generate funding to support their operations, such as charging participating issuers assessments or user fees. Exchanges are required to collect premiums, distribute them to issuers, and maintain financial oversight and integrity. Federal agencies, primarily HHS, oversee exchanges and are responsible for creating systems and criteria for their establishment and administration. The HHS Secretary must develop minimum criteria for certifying QHPs to be offered on exchanges. The HHS Secretary is required to develop minimum criteria for certifying QHPs to be offered on exchanges, grant financial awards to states for establishing exchanges, and oversee the general operation and coordination of exchanges with federal agencies. The HHS Secretary oversees the operation of exchanges, offering of QHPs, and establishment of reinsurance and risk adjustment programs under ACA. Coordination with federal agencies is required to verify applicant information and eligibility for programs. Tools and minimum standards are developed for exchanges to assist consumers. Federal assistance is provided to states for exchange development. The ACA requires the HHS Secretary to award planning and establishment grants to states for setting up exchanges. Grants were given to 49 states and DC, with up to $1 million each for research and planning. Establishment grants are given based on progress, with level one for initial phases and level two for significant progress. No grants may be awarded after December 31, 2014. As of the report date, 34 states and DC have received level one grants, and 12 states and DC have also received level two grants, totaling $3.6 billion. The HHS Secretary awarded grants to entities for technology systems to determine eligibility and process enrollment for exchanges. Seven \"early innovator\" grants were given to entities to develop IT infrastructure for exchanges. The seven entities received over $249 million in early innovator grants to develop IT infrastructure for exchanges. Exchange plans must cover essential health benefits, limit cost-sharing, and provide coverage based on actuarial value. ACA identifies 10 broad benefit categories for essential health benefits. The essential health benefits (EHBs) must include 10 broad benefit categories: ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, laboratory services, preventive and wellness and chronic disease management, and pediatric services. States can add additional benefit mandates but must cover the total cost themselves. The HHS Secretary is responsible for defining Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) for health plans affected by state mandates. States select a benchmark plan to model EHBs after, choosing from specific plan types. If the benchmark plan doesn't cover all 10 required categories, the state must supplement it. The benchmark plan for Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) is selected by each state and must cover all 10 required categories. If the chosen plan falls short, the state must supplement it. The finalized benchmark plans vary by state, with options from small group market plans, state employee health benefit plans, and non-Medicaid HMOs. Cost-sharing includes deductibles and co-payments for services rendered, with limits set by the ACA. Cost-sharing under the ACA includes deductibles and co-payments, with limits on the amount that exchange plans can impose. These limits prohibit high deductibles and set annual cost-sharing limits. Health plans offering essential benefits must adjust cost-sharing based on actuarial value, which measures the plan's generosity in covering medical expenses. The ACA requires health plans to adjust cost-sharing based on actuarial value, which reflects the share of cost-sharing that may be imposed. Actuarial value estimates vary based on data sources and methods used. HHS issues regulations for determining plan generosity levels based on essential health benefits and a standard population. HHS proposed a definition for actuarial value and solicited comments. Exchanges will offer various health plans with comprehensive benefits, including essential health benefits. Some plans will be specific to certain subpopulations. Plans offered in exchanges may also be available outside of exchanges. Exchanges offer qualified health plans (QHPs) that meet certification standards, including essential health benefits. QHP issuers must be licensed in each state, offer silver and gold coverage levels, and comply with exchange regulations. Plans may be offered inside or outside exchanges. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will contract with issuers to offer Multi-State Plans (MSPs) through every exchange in all states. MSPs provide nationally available Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) for individuals and small businesses, with voluntary enrollment and eligibility for premium credits and cost-sharing assistance. Contracts are for at least one year and can be renewed automatically. At least one contract will be with a nonprofit entity, and one contract cannot cover abortion services. The OPM Director will contract with issuers to offer Multi-State Plans (MSPs) through all states. MSPs must meet specific requirements and adhere to certain policies, such as offering a uniform benefits package and complying with minimum standards. Unlike other QHPs, MSPs will be licensed by states but regulated by OPM. The OPM has the authority to certify, recertify, and decertify MSPs for participation in exchanges. ACA requires child-only plans to be offered by issuers of QHPs, providing coverage for individuals under 21. ACA also establishes the CO-OP program to create nonprofit health insurance issuers for qualified health plans in individual and small group markets. The ACA establishes the CO-OP program for nonprofit health insurance issuers in individual and small group markets. The HHS Secretary can grant start-up and solvency loans to non-profit organizations applying to become qualified issuers. CO-OP QHPs must comply with state-specific standards to participate in an exchange. CMS has the authority to certify CO-OP QHPs for exchange participation. The ACA establishes the CO-OP program for nonprofit health insurance issuers in individual and small group markets. CMS has the authority to certify CO-OP QHPs for exchange participation. CO-OP loan recipients must offer CO-OP QHPs at silver and gold levels in individual and small group markets. Premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies are available for individuals enrolling in CO-OP QHPs. 24 non-profits in 24 states had received CO-OP program loans as of December 21, 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 rescinded unobligated funding for the CO-OP program, except for governance and oversight of awarded loans. Issuers can offer catastrophic plans with lower premiums and less generous coverage in the exchanges. These plans are for individuals under 30 or exempt from the individual mandate, must include essential health benefits. The ACA requires health insurance plans to provide affordable coverage with essential health benefits, including three primary care visits and no deductible for preventive services. Stand-alone dental benefits with pediatric oral services can be offered through exchanges either separately or in conjunction with a qualified health plan. Issuers have discretion in offering these benefits. The ACA allows issuers to offer stand-alone dental benefits either separately or with a qualified health plan. Premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits is provided to certain individuals to make exchange coverage more affordable. Exchanges are responsible for determining eligibility for cost assistance and calculating the amount provided. New federal tax credits were authorized to help low-middle income individuals pay for exchange coverage. The ACA authorized new federal tax credits in 2014 to help low-middle income individuals pay for exchange coverage. The premium credit is advanceable and refundable, based on household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. Eligibility criteria include enrollment in an exchange plan and being part of a tax-filing unit. The amount of the tax credit varies based on household income. The premium credit amount for exchange coverage depends on household income, the exchange plan enrolled in, and other factors. Exchanges determine eligibility and calculate the credit amount. Some individuals may qualify for subsidies towards service-related cost-sharing. The federal government provides monthly payments to health plan issuers to reduce cost-sharing for subsidy recipients. Cost-sharing subsidies for silver plan enrollees in exchanges further lower out-of-pocket expenses for health services. Exchanges determine eligibility for cost-sharing subsidies as specified in the federal tax code. Beginning in 2014, individuals are required to have health insurance or face a penalty. Most plans offered through exchanges qualify as minimum essential coverage, along with employer-sponsored insurance and Medicaid. Certain individuals may be exempt from this requirement. In 2014, individuals must have health insurance or face a penalty. Exchanges determine exemptions based on affordability or religious beliefs. Large employers may face penalties for not offering health insurance or if their workers receive premium credits. In 2014, individuals must have health insurance or face a penalty. Exchanges determine exemptions based on affordability or religious beliefs. Large employers may face penalties if their workers receive premium credits due to offering coverage with an actuarial value lower than a bronze-level plan. Exchanges notify employers if an employee is eligible for premium credits or cost-sharing subsidies, explaining the potential penalties and the right to appeal. ACA includes private market reforms imposing health insurance requirements. The ACA includes private market reforms that impose requirements on health insurance carriers and others, such as extending dependent coverage to children under 26. These reforms will apply to exchange plans, with exchanges certifying plans as qualified health plans. Market reforms are generally imposed on insurance companies. Market reforms are requirements imposed on insurance companies, enforced by states even post-ACA enactment. ACA's Medicaid and exchange provisions were designed to provide subsidized coverage for low- to middle-income individuals and families. ACA required states to expand Medicaid to certain individuals with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level, expanding eligibility and raising income eligibility levels for certain groups. The ACA required states to expand Medicaid to individuals with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot be penalized for refusing to expand Medicaid. Based on the Supreme Court's opinion, states can choose not to expand Medicaid without losing current federal matching funds. Some individuals may not have access to Medicaid or premium tax credits if states opt out of expansion. Coordination between exchange plans and Medicaid will still apply, with exchanges determining Medicaid eligibility and enrolling eligible individuals. The individual exchange must enroll the person in Medicaid and share their information with the state Medicaid agency."
