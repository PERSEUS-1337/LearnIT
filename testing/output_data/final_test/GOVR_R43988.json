    "content": "This report focuses on the legal implications of ISDS provisions in U.S. IIAs, discussing who may bring a claim, how arbitrators conduct proceedings, available remedies, interpretation of substantive obligations, interplay with domestic law, and recognition/enforcement of arbitral awards. It will specifically focus on ISDS provisions in NAFTA and the United States' 2012 Model BIT. The curr_chunk discusses the investment provisions in the United States' 2012 Model BIT and the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement (KORUS) as examples of provisions U.S. diplomats may seek to include in the TPP and T-TIP. Congress plays a crucial role in approving U.S. IIAs and ISDS provisions within those agreements. BITs are ratified through the treaty process, requiring Senate approval, while FTAs are often approved as congressional-executive agreements. The curr_chunk discusses how Congress influences the approval of international agreements and the jurisdiction requirements for ISDS cases. It analyzes the definition of \"investor\" and \"investment\" in U.S. IIAs and the exhaustion of remedies in host countries. The curr_chunk examines ISDS provisions related to \"forum shopping\" and \"treaty shopping\" in international agreements. It highlights the importance of defining \"investor\" and \"investment\" in U.S. IIAs for clarifying tribunal jurisdiction. NAFTA limits investor-state arbitration to specific measures adopted. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for bringing a claim in investor-state arbitration under NAFTA, emphasizing that the claimant must be an \"investor\" from a nation that is a party to the agreement. It clarifies that an investor must make an investment in the territory of another NAFTA State, not in their own, to qualify for arbitration. The definition of \"investment\" in U.S. IIAs also impacts tribunal jurisdiction. The Model BIT provides a broad definition of an \"investment\" in U.S. IIAs, including assets like enterprises, equity participation, debt instruments, derivatives, contracts, intellectual property rights, licenses, and tangible or intangible property. The 2012 Model BIT and NAFTA have different approaches to defining \"investments.\" NAFTA has a limited list of property interests that qualify as investments, while the Model BIT has a broader definition. Neither agreement considers goods exported into another party's territory as investments. Meeting regulatory requirements in the host country does not constitute an investment under NAFTA. Exhausting local remedies is not required for ISDS claims under either agreement. Under NAFTA, investors must exhaust judicial remedies before claiming a violation of the minimum standard of treatment obligation based on \"denial of justice\" by a host country's judiciary. This requirement is considered part of a \"denial of justice\" claim rather than a jurisdictional prerequisite. Concerns exist about foreign investors engaging in \"forum shopping\" and \"treaty shopping\" under ISDS provisions in IIAs. \"Forum shopping\" involves seeking compensation in local courts or ISDS tribunals and then pursuing compensation in the other forum if unsatisfied. \"Treaty shopping\" and \"forum shopping\" are practices where investors try to benefit from more favorable rules in IIAs by bringing ISDS claims against host countries. U.S. IIAs restrict investors from seeking local remedies after agreeing to arbitration. Investors can seek local remedies for monetary compensation before international investment arbitration. U.S. IIAs may deny treaty benefits to investors engaging in \"treaty shopping\" if certain conditions are met. The tribunal in a CAFTA-DR case ruled that benefits can be denied to investors before the time limit for jurisdictional objections expires. KORUS requires notifying investors before denying benefits if possible. ISDS proceedings raise concerns about arbitrator impartiality, transparency, dismissal of frivolous claims, and third-party participation. Arbitration rules ensure arbitrator independence and impartiality in investor-state disputes. Selection methods vary based on ICSID, UNCITRAL, NAFTA, or 2012 Model BIT agreements. NAFTA and 2012 Model BIT have similar procedures for arbitrator appointment. Article 1123 of NAFTA and the 2012 Model BIT outline the process for appointing arbitrators in investor-state disputes. The tribunal typically consists of three arbitrators, with the presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the disputing parties. If they cannot agree, the Secretary-General of ICSID will appoint the presiding arbitrator from a roster of potential arbitrators. The appointed arbitrator must not be a national of the disputing parties. Under the 2012 Model BIT, the Secretary-General appoints arbitrators as parties do not provide a list. Disqualification of arbitrators is addressed in the ICSID Arbitration Rules and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Arbitrators must disclose any reasons for impartiality doubts and can be challenged for such doubts. Challenging parties must promptly notify of disqualification circumstances. The challenge to an arbitrator's qualifications must be promptly addressed by notifying all parties and arbitrators. If all parties agree, the arbitrator is replaced; if not, the appointing authority decides. Arbitrators must have high moral character and recognized competence, and can be disqualified for impartiality doubts. Rules and procedures require arbitrators to disclose any prior relationships with disputing parties and reasons for questioning their independence. Challenges to an arbitrator's qualification are submitted to the Secretary General, with the remaining arbitrators voting on disqualification. The Chairman of the Administrative Council makes the final decision if needed. Grounds for removal vary and may seem inconsistent between cases. Some panels have differing views on whether an arbitrator's past involvement in cases related to a party should lead to disqualification. Challenges often stem from prior relationships between arbitrators and disputing parties. For instance, an arbitrator was disqualified in 2013 due to a conflict of interest. Some arbitrators can be disqualified for biases or prior relationships with disputing parties. In a case involving a NAFTA arbitration, an arbitrator was challenged for giving a speech on the U.S. law in dispute. The arbitrator in a dispute referred to the U.S. law as \"harassment,\" leading to a challenge. The ICSID Secretary General upheld the challenge, prompting the arbitrator to resign. The requirement for an arbitrator to have \"independent judgment\" means being both independent and impartial. Independence involves examining relationships with disputing parties, while impartiality focuses on bias. The UNCITRAL and ICSID Arbitration Rules mandate arbitrator independence and impartiality. Tribunals have varied interpretations of disqualification criteria, with some imposing a high burden of proof for showing a \"manifest lack\" of impartiality. This requires clear evidence of an arbitrator's inability to judge impartially. Some tribunals interpret disqualification criteria differently, with varying standards for proving arbitrator bias. While some require clear evidence of partiality, others use a \"reasonable doubt\" standard. Concerns about transparency in ISDS remain. The level of public access to tribunal decisions in ISDS disputes depends on the specific IIA and arbitration rules. NAFTA has strong transparency requirements, with the US, Canada, and Mexico agreeing to make tribunal documents available to the public, with certain exceptions. The NAFTA hearings are generally open to the public, allowing access to oral and written submissions, challenges to arbitrators, tribunal decisions, and awards. The 2012 Model BIT also emphasizes transparency, making pleadings, orders, awards, and amicus curiae submissions available to the public. The 2012 Model BIT and recent IIAs like KORUS and CAFTA-DR emphasize transparency in arbitration proceedings, allowing public access to submissions, transcripts, and hearings. However, ICSID's transparency provisions are less robust, with basic information available on its website but awards only made public with consent from both parties. Exceptions are in place to protect confidential information such as trade secrets or security interests. The ICSID Arbitration Rules allow for publication of excerpts of the legal reasoning of the Tribunal, but oral and written submissions of parties and experts usually remain confidential. UNCITRAL's Rules on Transparency apply to arbitrations under treaties governed by UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules entered into after April 1, 2014, unless agreed otherwise by the parties. The United Nations Convention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration, known as the Mauritius Convention, opened for signature on March 17, 2015. The Rules on Transparency apply to IIAs entered into by both parties prior to April 1, 2014 if they have signed the Mauritius Convention. The United States signed the Mauritius Convention on March 17, 2015, but it has yet to enter into force. The new UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency have requirements similar to NAFTA and the 2012 Model BIT. The Rules on Transparency in investor-state arbitration require public availability of written statements, amicus submissions, transcripts, orders, decisions, and awards. Hearings must be open to the public, with exceptions for confidential information. Prior to these rules, UNCITRAL allowed closed hearings and did not require publication of arbitral materials. Frivolous claims in ISDS cases may lead to concerns due to high costs even if the host country wins the case. Recent U.S. IIAs address the dismissal of frivolous claims and cost shifting in ISDS cases. The 2012 Model BIT allows tribunals to expedite the process by determining objections early on. Tribunals can award costs and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. The 2012 Model BIT allows tribunals to award costs and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party if a claim or objection is deemed \"frivolous.\" Recent U.S. IIAs suggest that tribunals may be hesitant to dismiss claims early on, but ICSID and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provide for early dismissal of frivolous claims. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules give tribunals broad authority to dismiss frivolous claims and award costs and attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. Some argue that current rules for disposing of frivolous claims are insufficient. Some argue that current rules for disposing of frivolous claims are insufficient and propose a diplomatic screening mechanism for dismissing investor claims. ISDS arbitration tribunals may allow third-party submissions, with rules varying depending on the arbitration governing body. NAFTA is generally silent on amicus submissions but allows parties to make submissions on the agreement's interpretation. The 2012 Model BIT and KORUS differ in their approach to amicus curiae submissions. The 2012 Model BIT allows non-disputing states to make submissions on treaty interpretation, while KORUS gives more discretion to the tribunal in allowing amicus curiae submissions. Factors are considered in KORUS for permitting such submissions. The submission of amicus curiae in international arbitration cases is subject to certain criteria under KORUS, including relevance to the dispute, unique perspective or knowledge, and significant interest in the proceeding. The acceptance of amicus briefs in investor-state arbitration is a relatively recent development, with the first instance occurring in 2001 in Methanex Corp. v. United States. In 2001, the Methanex Corp. v. United States case allowed for third-party submissions in NAFTA disputes under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Changes to ICSID and UNCITRAL rules now permit amicus briefs, with ICSID tribunals requiring third parties to seek permission to submit written statements. Disputing parties must be consulted before allowing third-party submissions. The tribunal may allow third-party submissions over the objection of a party to the dispute. The tribunal must consider if the non-party has a significant interest in the proceeding and if the submission would assist in deciding factual or legal issues. Some tribunals have held a broad view on the requirement that the submission be within the scope of the dispute. Granting permission for amicus submissions under ICSID rules does not permit veto power. The ICSID Arbitration Rules and UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency both allow for third-party submissions, but with limitations. While the ICSID rules do not grant access to closed hearings or private documents, the UNCITRAL rules require third-party submissions to be made public. The UNCITRAL rules outline a clear process for accepting submissions, including consultation with disputing parties and consideration of the submission's relevance to the dispute. Investment arbitration tribunals do not establish legally binding precedent like U.S. federal courts. However, arbitrators may explain their reasoning if departing from a prior tribunal's decision. The NAFTA tribunal emphasized the importance of addressing challenges in each case. Investment arbitration tribunals do not set binding precedent like U.S. federal courts, but they should consider previous decisions. Each tribunal has discretion in following precedent, with some arguing for case-specific evaluation and others advocating for consideration of prior holdings. The Glamis Gold tribunal highlighted the importance of explaining departures from past decisions. Currently, U.S. IIAs lack a mechanism for appealing investment arbitration tribunal decisions. ICSID Arbitration Rules allow for annulment of awards on limited grounds, but not as an appellate body. National courts may refuse to enforce awards, except in specific circumstances governed by international treaties. Suggestions have been made to establish an international appellate system for ISDS arbitral decisions to improve overall operation. An international appellate system for ISDS arbitral decisions could enhance the effectiveness of investment agreements by providing coherence to inconsistent tribunal decisions. However, there has been little progress in establishing such a body, with concerns raised about potential delays and costs for disputing parties. Some question the ability of a global appellate body to reconcile differing rights and procedures in various investment treaties. NAFTA does not mention an appeal process, but the 2012 U.S. Model BIT includes provisions for reviewing awards by investor-State dispute settlement tribunals. The Model BIT includes provisions for an appellate mechanism to review awards from investor-State dispute settlement tribunals in the future. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency in any appellate process agreed upon. IIAs not only establish procedural rules for ISDS proceedings but also outline substantive obligations for host countries towards foreign investors, including minimum treatment standards, limited expropriation circumstances, and non-discrimination against foreign investors. U.S. IIAs include obligations such as non-discrimination against foreign investors, limitations on trade-distorting requirements, and rules on fund transfers. Recent IIAs may also cover labor, environment, and exceptions for financial, taxation, and national security measures. The \"minimum standard of treatment\" obligation aims to set a baseline for how host countries treat foreign investments. The minimum standard of treatment (MST) under NAFTA requires fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security for foreign investments. Scholars compare the obligations imposed by the MST to those under various U.S. constitutional clauses. Early NAFTA tribunal awards raised concerns about violations of the MST, leading to a binding interpretation issued by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission in 2001. The NAFTA Free Trade Commission issued a binding interpretation in 2001 regarding the minimum standard of treatment (MST) under NAFTA. The interpretation clarified that the MST obligations depend on customary international law, with \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" not requiring treatment beyond the minimum standard. A breach of other provisions does not automatically mean a breach of Article 1105(1). The MST obligation under NAFTA depends on customary international law, with disagreements on authoritative sources. The content of the obligation remains unclear, with tribunals debating whether the standard is fixed or has evolved over time. Despite attempts to clarify, the precise content of the MST obligation remains uncertain. NAFTA tribunals may find a breach of the MST if a host country violates an investor's \"legitimate expectations\" induced by the host country, even without bad faith. There is inconsistency in scrutinizing domestic regulatory decisions, and tribunals may assess if a domestic court decision constitutes a \"denial of justice.\" The 2012 Model BIT and other U.S. IIAs protect various property interests, including enterprises, stock, contracts, and intellectual property rights. They prohibit expropriation of investments unless for a public purpose, non-discriminatory, with prompt compensation, and due process. Direct expropriation occurs when the host country transfers title of the investment to the state. Indirect expropriation occurs when the investor cannot make economic use of the investment due to government regulations. Some concerns were raised about early NAFTA decisions on the legal standard for indirect expropriation. The 2012 Model BIT addresses concerns about indirect expropriation by outlining factors for tribunals to consider, similar to the U.S. Supreme Court's Penn Central decision on regulatory takings. Factors include the economic impact of government actions and interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations. Recent U.S. IIAs have specifically provided that nondiscriminatory regulatory government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations. An investor's reasonable expectations play a key role in arbitral decisions on expropriation, especially in uncertain legal fields. Investors in heavily regulated industries may expect further regulation of their investments. Recent U.S. IIAs state that non-discriminatory regulatory measures generally do not constitute indirect expropriations, with provisions against discrimination in international trade agreements. These measures aim to protect public welfare objectives like health, safety, and the environment. Some U.S. IIAs require host countries to provide national treatment or MFN treatment to foreign investors or investments. To prove a violation, the claimant must show that they received less favorable treatment compared to domestic investors or investments. To establish a violation of MFN treatment, the claimant must prove the same criteria, with a foreign investor as the comparator. Identifying a comparator \"in like circumstances\" is crucial, requiring a fact-specific inquiry. One NAFTA tribunal ruled that the host country must regulate the comparator similarly to the claimant. A controversy arises over whether an investor can claim treatment given to foreign investors under another IIA. In ADF Group Inc., a Canadian investor argued for such treatment. In a NAFTA arbitration, a Canadian investor argued for importing more favorable MST from U.S.-Albania and U.S.-Estonia BITs. The tribunal acknowledged the investor's entitlement to the MST but disagreed on its favorability. Another NAFTA arbitration noted that the MFN clause cannot be used in this manner. The tribunal examined U.S.' treatment of a NAFTA party investor under the U.S.-Jamaica BIT. The Constitution governs how federal statutes may be amended, requiring adherence to processes in Article I. The Constitution governs how federal statutes may be amended, requiring adherence to processes in Article I. ISDS provisions in BITs and investment chapters in FTAs cannot alter federal law. Agreements like NAFTA and the 2012 Model BIT limit remedies that arbitration tribunals may award, such as only monetary damages and/or restitution of property. Punitive damages cannot be awarded by an arbitration panel. Arbitration panels cannot award punitive damages or change U.S. laws directly. However, substantial awards can still be granted, as seen in Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Ecuador where Ecuador was ordered to pay over $1 billion in damages for violating an investment agreement. Some commentators believe that large monetary damages in investment arbitration could influence lawmakers and regulators when considering laws that may violate international obligations. The apportionment of costs and fees among disputing parties can have a significant impact, with different methods provided by ICSID and UNCITRAL rules. The ICSID Convention and UNCITRAL rules determine the allocation of arbitration costs and fees among parties. While ICSID gives discretion to the tribunal and Secretary-General, UNCITRAL provides a detailed framework for apportionment, including a list of eligible expenses and rules for arbitrators' fees. UNCITRAL also allows for a large amount of tribunal discretion in cost allocation. Article 42 of the UNCITRAL rules outlines the apportionment of arbitration costs, stating that the unsuccessful party typically bears the costs. The tribunal may divide costs between parties if deemed reasonable. ICSID tribunals have shown a tendency to split costs evenly in complex cases. After an investment tribunal's award in an ISDS case, a respondent state may choose to compensate the investor voluntarily, otherwise, the investor can seek enforcement. This section analyzes international treaties and U.S. laws regarding the recognition, enforcement, and execution of investment arbitration awards against foreign countries and the United States in U.S. courts. Recognition involves a U.S. court domesticating the award to be equivalent to a U.S. judgment, enforcement converts the award into a judicial judgment for the debtor to comply, and execution refers to actions taken when the host country fails to pay compensation. The ICSID Convention limits the ability of member countries, like the United States, to refuse recognition and enforcement of arbitration awards. Article 54 states that each Contracting State must recognize and enforce the award's pecuniary obligations as a final judgment. Additionally, Article 53 addresses the enforcement of awards in federal courts. The ICSID Convention establishes that arbitration awards are binding and not subject to appeal, with limited review by U.S. courts. Awards under the Convention create rights under U.S. treaties and must be enforced like final judgments. Non-ICSID arbitrations may involve the investor's home country, the host country, or both. Under the ICSID Convention, investors can seek recognition and enforcement of awards under the New York Convention in states party to the convention. The New York Convention, implemented in the Federal Arbitration Act, applies to awards made in a different state or considered foreign in the state where enforcement is sought. Contracting states must recognize and enforce awards according to their procedural rules. The New York Convention allows for broader means of challenging recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards, such as when the arbitrator exceeds its powers or the award would go against public policy. While the ICSID and New York conventions limit grounds for U.S. courts to refuse recognition and enforcement, they do not affect laws regarding judgment execution in contracting states. The ICSID Convention defers to member countries' laws on sovereign immunity from execution on foreign assets in the United States. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 could apply in cases of seeking judgment execution on a foreign country's assets in the US. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) places limits on seizing assets of foreign countries in the US. Enforcement of arbitral awards against a foreign country's US assets is restricted to those used for commercial activities. Certain properties like foreign military and central bank assets may have immunity from execution. ISDS tribunals have never ordered the US to compensate investors, but if the US lost a case, it would likely compensate the investor. In the unlikely event that the United States refuses to compensate a foreign investor, the investor could seek recognition of an investment arbitration award in federal court. The court would have limited grounds to refuse recognition and enforcement of the award under relevant treaties. However, the investor may be unable to collect on the judgment if the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity from execution of the award. The United States may not compensate a foreign investor, who could seek recognition of an investment arbitration award in federal court. The investor may face challenges in collecting the judgment if Congress has not appropriated funds for payment. However, the US still has an international obligation to comply with the judgment."
