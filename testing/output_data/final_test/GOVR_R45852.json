It is relevant to Congress due to its use in federal programs, economic potential, scientific research, national security roles, and concerns such as weapons development and intellectual property law. This report explains the basic parts of 3D printers, their operation, materials, capabilities, historical development since 1980, federal role, manufacturing properties, secondary impacts, and issues relevant to Congress. 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, involves creating parts by adding consecutive layers of material on a build plate. This process contrasts with subtractive manufacturing, which carves out parts from a block by removing material. Additive and subtractive manufacturing have been around for centuries, with 3D printing finding applications in aerospace, medicine, defense, prototyping, and education. The technology varies in prices, capabilities, and dimensions, with 3D printers typically consisting of five common parts. 3D printers consist of five common parts: input material, print head, build plate, axes, and 3D design file. Input material can be solid filament, pellets, liquid, or powder. The print head deposits the material, the build plate is the base for construction, and axes move the print head relative to the build plate. The 3D printing process is guided by a digital 3D design file, providing instructions for the printer to create patterns on each layer. 3D printers range in price from consumer printers under $5,000 to industrial models costing millions, with different capabilities for printing various materials like plastics. Different types of materials are available for 3D printers in the price range of $5,000 and up, including nylon, rubber-like plastics, carbon fiber reinforced plastics, dissolvable plastics, clear plastics, and decorative plastics resembling wood or metal. Some printers can also use ceramic or chocolate. Structural metal-infused plastic can be used but requires high-temperature post-processing to remove the plastic, leaving a metal product. Specialized devices like pottery kilns or sintering machines can achieve the necessary high temperatures for post-processing. Commercial services are available for high-temperature post-processing of metal-infused 3D-printed parts. Industrial 3D printers priced at $5,000 and above can utilize a wide range of materials for various applications, creating larger, more detailed, and reliable structures compared to consumer printers. They can print in materials like living cells, metals such as titanium and steel, large-format plastics up to 6 feet tall, and even concrete for building walls. The development of 3D printing can be divided into three major periods from 1980 to 2010, marking the technology's creation, industrial use, and growth. The period from 1980 to 2010 saw the creation and industrial use of 3D printing, with the consumer movement starting in 2010. The market expanded between 2010 and 2015, with prices for consumer printers falling since 2015. Various materials like plastic, metal, paper, ceramic, and wax were used in 3D printers in the 1990s, with the market expanding into specialized industries in the early 2000s. Key patents expired in the early 21st century, leading to further growth in the industry. The 21st century saw the expiration of key 1980s 3D printing patents, leading to the birth of the consumer 3D printing movement. Developments included the formation of the open-source 3D printer community, the launch of print-on-demand websites like Shapeways, and the creation of file-sharing platforms like Thingiverse. MakerBot released a $750 3D printer in 2009, and the consumer market expanded in the 2010s with various offerings including branded printers, kits on eBay, and crowdfunded projects. Consumer and industrial 3D printers became more accessible with prices dropping to $500-$600 for basic models. Advanced features were added to higher-end printers, making them easier to use. 3D design software and printer reliability improvements led to widespread adoption in shared makerspaces, libraries, and universities. 3D file sharing, including on sites like Thingiverse, became popular with over 2 million active users in 2015. Various materials for 3D printing became available from different companies, reducing costs. Transmission of design files also expanded through mainstream sites and anonymous channels like internet torrents. In the period discussed, 3D printers became more diverse and were offered by various companies, leading to lower printing costs. Print-on-demand services expanded, providing a range of materials for consumers to purchase 3D-printed parts from their own design files. However, the 3D printing industry showed signs of weakening in 2014, with leading companies experiencing significant stock value losses and layoffs. The 3D printing industry saw growth in annual grants of patents and increased consumer unit sales in 2015. Despite a decline in industrial unit sales, overall industry revenues have shown consistent growth over the past 30 years. From 2015 to 2019, there was a resurgence in 3D printing investment from corporations and federal departments. The Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health have invested millions in 3D printing initiatives. Consumer 3D printer prices have dropped, with basic models available for less than $150. Sales of both industrial and consumer 3D printers have increased, with over 140,000 industrial and 2 million consumer printers sold worldwide. The consumer 3D printing market has seen significant growth, with over 2 million printers sold worldwide. 3D-print-on-demand services are now available, providing access to industrial-grade 3D printers for creating high-precision parts. Online databases and communities make it easier for users to access 3D design files. The global 3D printing industry revenue was estimated at $9.975 billion in 2018, but it still makes up less than 1% of manufacturing revenues worldwide. Future products will be created through traditional manufacturing methods, even when 3D printing is technologically mature. Estimates predict that 3D printing will eventually account for 5%-10% of total global manufacturing revenues. Issues like quality control, cybersecurity, and production speed compared to traditional methods may limit the effectiveness of current 3D printing technologies. New evaluation methods, certification programs, cybersecurity advances, and research programs aim to address these limitations. Private industry has been the main innovator in 3D printing technology, holding an estimated 90% of additive manufacturing patents. The federal government has played a small but crucial role in the development of 3D printing technology. The federal government played a crucial role in the creation of 3D printing technology by providing direct funding for early research and later refinements in two of the four processes. This support led to the development of foundational AM patents and technologies, with key contributions from agencies like the Department of Defense Office of Naval Research and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Additionally, NSF support was instrumental in the early development of relevant AM technologies. The National Science Foundation (NSF) played a significant role in the development of additive manufacturing (AM) research, providing over $200 million in funding for AM research and activities over 25 years. In 2012, President Obama established the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) in Youngstown, OH, as a pilot institute under the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). The National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) was established in 2012 in Youngstown, OH, as a pilot institute under the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI). It later rebranded as America Makes under the Manufacturing USA program, aiming to increase U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, transition innovative technologies into scalable manufacturing capabilities, develop an advanced manufacturing workforce, and support business models for the institutes. The Government Accountability Office estimates that America Makes received $56 million in federal funding and $85 million in nonfederal funding from August 2012 to August 2019. As of December 2018, America Makes had 225 members. Many national laboratories, including Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, Los Alamos, and Fermi, use 3D printing.
