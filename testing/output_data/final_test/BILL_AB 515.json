    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 17053.88 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow a tax credit for qualified taxpayers who donate to California food banks. The credit is equal to 15% of the value of the donated items, with a minimum amount specified. Qualified donation items include fresh fruits, vegetables, raw agricultural products, and processed foods like meat, poultry, eggs, fish, rice, beans, and canned, frozen, dried, dehydrated, and 100 percent juice forms of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Qualified donation items include a variety of food products such as cheese, milk, yogurt, butter, dehydrated milk, infant formula, vegetable oil, olive oil, soup, pasta sauce, salsa, bread, pasta, canned meats, and canned seafood. A qualified taxpayer is defined as the person responsible for various activities related to the donation items. The qualified value is determined based on the wholesale sale price of the donated item sold within the calendar month of the donation. If no wholesale sales of the donated item occur in the calendar month, the qualified value is based on the nearest regional wholesale market price for that month. Any credit claimed by the taxpayer will reduce the deduction allowed for the cost incurred for the donation. The donor must provide the food bank with the value and origin of donated items. Upon acceptance, the food bank issues a certificate with details of the donation. The certificate must be provided to the Franchise Tax Board upon request. The credit allowed by this section can be claimed on a timely filed original return and any excess can be carried over to reduce the \"net tax\" in the following years. The Franchise Tax Board will report to the Legislature on the utilization of the credit and include details on the qualified donation items. Section 23688 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to include reporting requirements for the utilization of a credit allowed by the section.
