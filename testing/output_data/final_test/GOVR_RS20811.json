Money income includes earnings, interest, pensions, and government non-means-tested income. It excludes taxes, noncash benefits, fringe benefits, and capital gains. In 2012, income distribution data showed that 2.1% of households had incomes between $200,000 and $249,999, while 2.4% had incomes of $250,000 or more. Additionally, 3.4% of households had incomes of less than $5,000. The income distribution in 2012 showed a concentration of income among a few households in the upper tail. Median income was $51,017, with half of households above this level. Mean income was $71,274, with fewer households above this average. The share of total income going to different household groups was also analyzed. In 2012, the top 5% of households accounted for 22.3% of all income, while the lowest quintile had only 3.2% of aggregate income. The Congressional Budget Office uses a richer data set to estimate household income, including capital gains and noncash benefits like food stamps and Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office uses a comprehensive data set to estimate household income, including noncash benefits like food stamps and Medicare. Their 2010 income distribution estimate shows a slightly more equal distribution compared to the Census estimate, due to transfers and taxes. The Congressional Budget Office's analysis shows that changes in the federal tax system impact income distribution, with the highest quintile seeing a decrease in after-tax share. The concept of the middle class is subjective and varies among individuals, with no official government definition. Median household income in 2012 was $51,017. In 2012, the middle class was defined as households with income between $20,592 and $104,087, accounting for 60% of all households. This definition broadened to include the top quintile as well. In 2012, the middle class was defined as households with incomes between $20,592 and $191,150, accounting for 75% of all households. Opinion surveys show that 42% of respondents considered themselves to be middle class. The Census Bureau's detailed data on household income distribution shows that the top income class ($250,000 or more) only accounts for 2.3% of all households. There is a discrepancy between survey responses and Census income data, suggesting that some households with incomes over $250,000 identify as upper middle class. Comparing respondents who reported being middle class with Census data suggests the upper bound of the middle class might be lower at under $125,000. The lower bound of the middle class might be just over $40,000 based on a comparison with Census data. The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago has been collecting self-reported social class data since 1972. According to the 1972-2010 General Social Survey (GSS) data, 3.2% of the population consider themselves upper class, with the dividing line between middle and upper class at over $200,000. Additionally, 5.7% identify as lower class and 45.7% as working class, placing the lower income level for the middle class at just over $50,000. In a 2012 Pew Research Center study, 51% of adults with incomes between $30,000 and $49,999 identified as middle class, while 65% of those with incomes between $50,000 and $99,999 did the same. The Pew survey found that 46% of adults with household incomes of $100,000 or more identified as middle class, suggesting the upper bound of the middle class might exceed $100,000. If the 15% who considered themselves upper middle class were added to the middle class category, the upper bound might be over $200,000. Overall, the survey suggests the lower bound of the middle class might start in the middle quintile of the income distribution. The middle class extends from the middle quintile of the income distribution to the top quintile, possibly including households with income over $200,000. Satisfaction with income is influenced by both the absolute level and how it compares to others. Comparing income with neighbors or coworkers can impact satisfaction within the middle class. Since the 1990s, economists have focused on factors affecting well-being, including relative income comparisons. One study by Mary Daly and Dan Wilson linked group-specific suicide rates to income comparisons. They found that an increase in the 50/10 income ratio was associated with a decrease in suicide rates. Relative income comparisons have a significant impact on well-being, as shown by studies linking suicide rates to income ratios. The 50/10 ratio decrease in suicide rate, while the 90/50 ratio increase was associated with higher suicide rates. This suggests that middle-income individuals are happier with larger gaps to lower-income groups and unhappier with larger gaps to higher-income groups. Inequality at the upper and lower income tails has opposite effects on the satisfaction of the middle-income group. Erzo F. P. Luttmer also found that relative income influences well-being through self-reported happiness and other measures. Relative income comparisons have a significant impact on well-being, as shown by studies linking income data with happiness. Luttmer, Dynan, Ravina, Guven, and Sorensen all found that relative income strongly affects self-reported happiness, especially for those with above-average income but not extremely rich. Studies have shown that self-reported happiness is more influenced by perceived relative income than actual income for the middle-income group. This perception plays a significant role in the well-being of the middle class compared to low- and high-income groups. The findings suggest that satisfaction in the middle class depends on perceived relative income, not just \"keeping up with the Joneses.\" The middle class's satisfaction is influenced by perceived relative income, not just \"keeping up with the Joneses.\" Daly and Wilson found that having incomes much higher than lower-income groups leads to satisfaction, but when upper-income groups fare much better, middle-class satisfaction decreases."
