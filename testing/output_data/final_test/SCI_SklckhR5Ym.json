    "content": "Highly regularized LSTMs achieve impressive results in language modeling by proposing a new regularization method called Past Decode Regularization (PDR). This method biases the model towards retaining more contextual information, improving its ability to predict the next token. PDR achieves a word level perplexity of 55.6 on the Penn Treebank and 63.5 on the WikiText-2 datasets using a single softmax. When combined with a mixture-of-softmaxes, it achieves a word level perplexity of 53.8 and 60.5. Additionally, PDR achieves 1.169 bits-per-character on the Penn Treebank Character dataset, setting a new state-of-the-art in language modeling. The results represent a new state-of-the-art in language modeling. Language modeling involves predicting the next token in a sequence using recurrent neural networks. Various works have aimed to enhance language modeling performance with more advanced RNNs. In recent work, vanilla LSTMs with a large number of parameters have achieved state-of-the-art performance in language modeling. Regularization techniques such as variational dropout and norm regularization have been key in improving LSTM models. Tuning hyperparameters and using optimization algorithms like NT-ASGD can further enhance performance. These regularization methods are general techniques applicable to various sequence modeling tasks. Regularization techniques specific to language modeling, such as transforming distributions over vocabulary using LSTMs, aim to decode input distribution information from the output distribution. This is crucial for predicting the next token in the sequence. Incorporating a regularization term in the loss function of a language model allows for decoding more information about past tokens from the predicted next token distribution. The symmetry in inputs and outputs of the language model enables a simple decoding operation, treating future predictions as inputs and the last token as the target for prediction. Incorporating a regularization term in the loss function of a language model allows for decoding more information about past tokens from the predicted next token distribution. The token embedding matrix and weights of the linear decoder can be reused in the past decoding operation. A few extra parameters model the nonlinear transformation by using a stateless layer. The cross-entropy loss between the decoded distribution for the past token and the target token is added to the main loss function. The method, called Past Decode Regularization (PDR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for language modeling. In this paper, the language model experiments with word and character level modeling. An LSTM computes a distributed representation of the context available for the next token. The probability of the next token is calculated using a linear decoder and Softmax layer. The weights of the decoder are tied for efficiency. The language model uses tied weights for the decoder to optimize parameters. The loss function minimizes cross-entropy between predicted and actual tokens. The model predicts the next token based on the context, encoding information about past tokens to improve accuracy in prediction. The decoding operation computes a probability distribution over the last token in the context to predict the next token better. It involves a non-linear function and bias vector with parameters. The cross-entropy loss measures the difference between the decoded distribution and actual tokens in the context. The context in this case does not preserve any state. The context in Eq. FORMULA4 for decoding does not preserve state information across time steps, focusing only on predicting the next token. A \"soft\" token embedding lookup is used, where the token vector is a probability distribution. A regularization term \u03bb P DR is added to the loss function in Eq. FORMULA2 to emphasize decodability of the last token. The choice of \u03bb P DR determines how much the language model incorporates this bias. In practice, the choice of \u03bb P DR determines how much the language model incorporates the bias introduced by the regularization term. The trainable parameters \u03b8 r associated with PDR are only used during training to bias the language model and not during inference. To control the complexity of the nonlinear function f \u03b8r, a simple choice is a single fully connected layer of size d followed by a Tanh nonlinearity. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of using PDR for language modeling on standard benchmark datasets. In language modeling, the AWD-LSTM model is evaluated on datasets like Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. The regularization technique, PDR, is applied to improve model performance. Two versions of the model are considered: AWD-LSTM with a single softmax and AWD-LSTM-MoS with a mixture-of-softmaxes. The PDR regularization term is computed using specific equations. The model is named AWD-LSTM+PDR or AWD-LSTM-MoS+PDR based on the softmax used. The experimental procedure closely follows that of the original models. For experiments, 7 hyperparameters are associated with regularizations in AWD-LSTM and one extra with MoS. PDR has a weighting coefficient \u03bb P DR = 0.001 determined through a search on validation sets. Model configurations include 3-layered LSTMs with varying hidden dimensions and embedding dimensions for both single softmax and mixture-of-softmax models. The model configurations for training include 3-layer LSTMs with different hidden dimensions and embedding dimensions, along with the use of weight tying. Training follows a procedure similar to AWD-LSTM using a combination of SGD and NT-ASGD, with learning rate schedules and batch sizes from previous experiments. The AWD-LSTM+PDR model has slightly more parameters than AWD-LSTM during training, with minimal time overhead due to additional computation. The AWD-LSTM+PDR model achieves a perplexity of 55.6 on the PTB test set, improving the state-of-the-art by 1.7 points with a single softmax. When combined with a cache pointer, it shows a 1.2 improvement over AWD-LSTM, and with dynamic evaluation, the perplexity decreases to 49.3, the first method to achieve sub 50 perplexity on the PTB test set with a single softmax. Our method (AWD-LSTM-MoS+PDR) achieves a test perplexity of 53.8, an improvement of 0.6 points over the current state-of-the-art. Dynamic evaluation further reduces the perplexity to 47.3. The model shows improved performance on the more complex WT2 dataset, achieving a perplexity of 63.5 with a single softmax, and maintaining gains with cache pointer and dynamic evaluation. Using a mixture-of-softmaxes, AWD-LSTM-MoS+PDR achieves perplexities of 60.5 and 40.3 on the WT2 test set, improving upon the current state-of-the-art by 1.0 and 0.4 points respectively. PDR is applied to a baseline 2-layer LSTM language model on the Gigaword dataset BID0 with a truncated vocabulary of about 100K tokens. The model achieved a perplexity of 44.0 (42.5) with PDR, showing less effectiveness on larger datasets. Our method achieves a BPC performance of 1.169 on the PTBC test set, improving on the current state-of-the-art by 0.006 or 0.5%. Even with a small vocabulary of 51 tokens, our method outperforms highly regularized models. Additionally, on Enwik8, AWD-LSTM+PDR achieves 1.245 BPC, which is 0.012 or about 1% less than the 1.257 BPC achieved by AWD-LSTM in our experiments. The experiment validates that PDR can act as a form of regularization for AWD-LSTM models. By turning off all dropouts and regularization and only using PDR, the model achieves better validation perplexity on PTB and WT2. Decoding the distribution of past tokens from the predicted next-token distribution can act as a regularizer, leading to improved generalization performance. The experiment shows that PDR can serve as a regularization method for AWD-LSTM models, improving validation perplexity on PTB and WT2. By decoding past tokens from the next-token distribution, PDR acts as a regularizer, enhancing generalization performance. The use of PDR as a regularization method for AWD-LSTM models is shown to reduce entropy in the predicted next token distribution, leading to improved validation perplexity on PTB and WT2 datasets. This regularization effect is evident in the training curves, with lower validation perplexity but higher training perplexity compared to models without PDR. The use of PDR as a regularization method for AWD-LSTM models reduces entropy in predicted token distribution, improving validation perplexity on PTB and WT2 datasets. Ablation experiments show PDR's significant impact on decreasing validation set performance, though less than other regularizations. AWD-LSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance with a single softmax on multiple datasets. By using a mixture-of-softmaxes, PDR reduces entropy in predicted token distribution, improving validation perplexity on PTB and WT2 datasets. It can also be applied to seq2seq models for text summarization and neural machine translation. Regularizing LSTMs with auxiliary tasks, such as language modeling, has been successful in NLP tasks. Specialized architectures like Recurrent Highway Networks and NAS have also been explored. Specialized architectures like Recurrent Highway Networks and NAS have been used successfully in language modeling, particularly for character level modeling. Fast-Slow RNNs, with a two-level architecture, have shown strong results in capturing long-range dependencies. Historical information has been shown to greatly assist language models in handling long-range dependencies. Additionally, improved performance in language modeling has been achieved by using frequency agnostic word embeddings, a technique that can be combined with other methods like PDR."
