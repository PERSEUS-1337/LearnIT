Congress finds that it is the Government's role to address discrimination, inequality, and economic hardship faced by women. Initiatives should be established to promote equality and protect against discrimination in all areas of public and private life. Women in the country still face inequalities and discrimination, such as low representation in elected offices. Women of color make up a small percentage of legislative office-holders. Women earn less than men, with African-American women and Latinas facing even greater wage disparities. A significant number of women earn minimum wage or less, with a higher percentage of women than men having low family incomes. The United States ranks poorly in terms of women's labor force participation compared to other industrialized nations. Among college-educated women in the United States, there is a low rate of full-time employment compared to men. Single-parent families, mostly led by women, face high poverty rates. Mothers' employment is declining due to lack of support for working parents and discrimination in the labor market. Women, especially women of color, face inequalities in the labor market and healthcare. One in four women experience domestic violence, with 85% of victims being women. The cost of intimate partner violence exceeds $5.8 billion annually. 18% of women in the US lack health insurance, with higher rates among American Indian/Native Alaskan and Hispanic women.
