    "content": "The National Park Service manages the National Park System for recreation and conservation, leading to debates over balancing these goals. The system, with 401 units covering 85 million acres, had over 268 million visits in 2013. Various recreational activities like off-highway vehicles, mountain biking, and hiking intersect in the parks. OHV use in the National Park System is contentious, with supporters arguing for access to natural areas, economic benefits, and recreation opportunities, while opponents cite environmental damage, safety concerns, and conflicts with other forms of recreation. Opponents of OHV use in the National Park System argue that NPS staffing levels are inadequate to monitor motorized use and its impact on park resources. They also mention the availability of other federal lands for OHV use. Environmental concerns include potential damage to wildlife habitat, ecosystems, winter snow melts, water supply, noise, air, and water pollution. Critics also highlight the economic benefits of nonmotorized recreation on local communities. The 113th Congress has addressed motorized recreation in NPS units through legislation and oversight, including bills such as H.R. 819, H.R. 2954, and S. 486. The House Natural Resources Committee has addressed outdoor recreation issues, including motorized and nonmotorized uses, on federal lands. Hearings in May and June 2013 discussed problems of coordination, trail planning, conflicts between motorized and nonmotorized uses, and local input into agency planning. Executive orders define OHV use on federal lands. The first Executive Order (E.O. 11644, February 8, 1972) defines off-highway vehicles as motorized vehicles designed for cross country travel on various terrains. It aims to control and direct the use of these vehicles on public lands to protect resources, promote safety, and minimize conflicts among users. Agencies are directed to develop regulations for the designation of areas where OHVs may be permitted. OHVs may be permitted in designated areas, with agencies monitoring effects and having the authority to close areas if damage occurs. E.O. 11989 amended the order to exclude certain vehicles and allowed for immediate closures if necessary. Agencies could adopt policies to close areas to OHV use except for certain circumstances. The agency was authorized to adopt a policy allowing areas to be closed to OHV use, except for designated open areas. This policy applies to federal lands, with specific regulations for OHVs in the National Park System, requiring special rulemaking for designated routes and areas. OHV use in park units must not have adverse impacts on natural, cultural, scenic, and esthetic values. The National Park Service's regulations govern snowmobile use in the National Park System, limiting them to designated routes and water surfaces used by motor vehicles or motorboats in other seasons. Snowmobile use must align with the park's values, safety, and management objectives, without disturbing wildlife or damaging park resources. NPS management policies restrict snowmobile use to designated routes and water surfaces to prevent impacts on park resources. Some NPS units allow off-road use of ATVs and other vehicles, which has raised concerns about wildlife habitat damage and disturbance to nonmotorized activities. The National Park Service (NPS) is issuing special regulations to designate routes and areas for off-road use in park units that permit ATVs and oversand vehicles. Eleven of the 13 park units already have special regulations in place, while two units are open to public use as NPS completes OHV management planning. OHV users argue that NPS restrictions harm communities dependent on business generated by off-road recreation. NPS is developing regulations to change boundaries for OHV riders in various national park units, including NRA and Cape Lookout National Seashore. Some areas previously open to off-road use are now closed, following a 2005 lawsuit alleging threats to NPS resources by ATVs. Settlement requirements include developing environmental impact statements and special rules for OHV use at specific locations like Glen Canyon NRA and Cape Lookout National Seashore. The National Park Service is addressing unauthorized OHV use through public outreach, education, and enforcement activities. Unauthorized use has been reported in some areas, but the extent in the National Park System is unclear. NPS encourages units with illegal OHV use to pursue enforcement actions. The National Park Service is addressing unauthorized OHV use through public outreach, education, and enforcement activities. Some believe budgetary and staff constraints limit enforcement effectiveness. Controversy surrounds NPS's regulation of ATVs and oversand vehicles, with ongoing disagreement over trail designation at Big Cypress National Preserve. Conservation groups cite potential harm to endangered species and their habitat, while those concerned about access for hunting, fishing, and trapping oppose limitations on OHV use. The National Park Service is facing conflict over the management of addition lands in the preserve, with debates over OHV trails, wilderness designation, and primitive backcountry zoning. Hunters oppose restrictions on OHV use, while conservationists argue that OHVs are harming the environment. Conservation groups have filed lawsuits against NPS over the management plan. Conservation groups sued NPS over the addition lands management plan in 2011. The U.S. District Court ruled in 2012 that NPS violated environmental laws by reopening OHV routes in Bear Island. NPS banned dispersed OHV access in Big Cypress National Preserve in 2011. ATV and off-highway vehicle use is now restricted to designated trails. The designated trail network for OHV access in protected lands has faced criticism for either providing too little or too much access. Management planning at Cape Hatteras National Seashore addresses potential harm to endangered species from beach buggies and oversand vehicles. The balance between preservation and use is influenced by the area's enabling act, which designates it as a recreational area but also as a primitive wilderness. In January 2012, NPS published special regulations for motorized vehicles at Cape Hatteras National Seashore, designating 28 miles as year-round OHV routes and 13 miles as seasonal OHV-accessible. The remaining 26 miles are vehicle-free areas, with night-driving restrictions during sea turtle nesting season. The regulations also include vehicle standards and require a fee-based OHV permit. These regulations contrast with NPS's 2007 interim OHV management plan, which allowed greater access for motorized vehicles and was the subject of a lawsuit by environmental groups. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 819 and H.R. 2954 aim to overturn 2012 regulations at Cape Hatteras National Seashore and reinstate the 2007 interim management plan. H.R. 2954 has passed the House, with supporters arguing that the 2012 regulations limit visitor access to local businesses and are unnecessary for wildlife protection. Opponents claim that OHV restrictions have benefited endangered species without reducing visitation. A Senate bill, S. 486, addresses OHV management at Cape Hatteras differently, proposing to reduce wildlife buffers, add new vehicle access points, and consider opening more beaches through a public process. In the 113th Congress, there have been proposals to regulate recreational snowmobile use in National Park System units. User groups argue that snowmobile use is necessary for accessing park sites in winter and supports local communities, while opponents are concerned about emissions, noise pollution, and wildlife damage. The National Park Service initially planned to ban snowmobile use but later allowed it in 43 park units. The National Park Service initially planned to ban snowmobile use but later modified its stance to allow it in 43 park units. No further action has been taken on a general policy for snowmobiles, with regulations requiring designated routes for snowmobile use after park planning deems it appropriate. Yellowstone National Park and nearby units have been the focus of regulatory and judicial actions regarding snowmobile use since 2000, with the Clinton Administration issuing rules in 2001 to phase out snowmobile use in these parks and introduce \"snowcoaches\" as an alternative. The George W. Bush Administration replaced the Clinton rules on snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park with regulations in December 2003. The new regulations allowed for daily entry limits, trained guides, snowmobile emission standards, and monitoring for air and noise pollution impacts. Both the Clinton and Bush plans were challenged in court, leading to confusion for park visitors, local communities, and businesses. The Obama Administration later implemented regulations that allowed for reduced snowmobile use in Yellowstone. Starting in the 2012-2013 winter season, Yellowstone operated under winter use rules allowing entry to 318 snowmobiles and 78 snowcoaches per day, a decrease from previous years. New regulations were implemented starting in the 2013-2014 season, with a phased transition to measure winter use through \"transportation events\" instead of vehicle limits. Up to 110 transportation events per day are now allowed in the park. The regulations for winter use in Yellowstone National Park allow up to 110 transportation events per day, with a mix of snowcoaches and snowmobiles. Vehicles must meet new technology requirements by the 2016-2017 season. The plan is supported for balancing economic and conservation priorities, increasing the maximum number of snowmobiles while aiming for noise and pollution reductions. Some snowmobile user groups have concerns. Some snowmobile user groups and environmental groups support the plan to increase the maximum number of snowmobiles in Yellowstone National Park while aiming for noise and pollution reductions. Conservation groups challenge claims that new snowmobile models are cleaner and quieter, citing a recent NPS report. Snowmobile usage in the park has decreased over the past decade, with fluctuations influenced by factors beyond NPS regulations. Factors such as yearly snowfall, gas prices, and the economy impact snowmobile usage in NPS units. No recent legislation on snowmobiles in NPS units has been introduced in Congress. Conflict arises between NPS's goal of public enjoyment and resource protection, and FAA's control over airspace. Grand Canyon National Park is a focal point for conflicts over limiting overflights. The National Parks Overflights Act of 1987 and the National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000 regulate aircraft overflights in national parks, including Grand Canyon, to address concerns about noise, safety, and economic impacts on local businesses. The Air Tour Act regulates air tours at Grand Canyon, including route and altitude restrictions. FAA must establish quiet aircraft technology requirements within one year and designate routes for quiet technology aircraft. Actions have been taken to restore natural quiet, including capping commercial overflights and expanding flight-free zones. The final rule establishes a standard for quiet technology for certain aircraft in commercial air tour operations over Grand Canyon. Data on natural ambient sound levels collected by NPS is being used to model air tour traffic and aircraft noise at Grand Canyon. A draft environmental impact statement was published on options to restore natural quiet at Grand Canyon. The agency postponed issuing a final environmental impact statement due to the enactment of P.L. 112-141. The DEIS presented alternatives for restoring natural quiet at Grand Canyon, with a goal of achieving at least 50% restoration. NPS is assessing provisions that may impact its planning efforts under P.L. 112-141. The preferred alternative for air tour management at Grand Canyon National Park includes restoring natural quiet in 67% of the park during peak season, allowing for 65,000 annual air tour operations, limiting daily air tours to 364, establishing higher flight altitudes near the North Rim, providing incentives for quiet technology aircraft, and raising flight-free zone ceilings. No general legislation has been introduced in Congress regarding air tour management at the park. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced on air tour management at Grand Canyon National Park, following the enactment of broad transportation legislation in the 112th Congress. The legislation aimed to establish standards for restoring natural quiet at the park, with a provision stating that 50% of the park should be free of sound from commercial air tours for at least 75% of each day. Advocates of the legislation believed it was necessary to set standards for air tours, while opponents expressed concerns about limiting the National Park Service's authority. The legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to establish standards for air tour management at Grand Canyon National Park, requiring commercial air tour aircraft to convert to quiet technology within 15 years. This legislation was met with opposition from those concerned about limiting the National Park Service's authority. Additionally, the Air Tour Act final rule requires air tour operators to apply for authority to fly over national parks and tribal lands. The FAA and NPS have received applications for commercial air tours over 100 park units, granting interim operating authority. Air Tour Management Plans (ATMPs) are being developed to mitigate harm to natural and cultural resources. Development of ATMPs has been slow, with none completed yet. Agencies are also working on voluntary agreements for some areas in lieu of ATMPs. The agencies are assessing areas for voluntary agreements instead of Air Tour Management Plans (ATMPs). A list of exempted park units with fewer than 50 commercial air tours has been published. Development of an ATMP for Petrified Forest National Park has been stopped. Ambient sound levels are being measured as a baseline for noise impact assessment during peak and off-peak seasons. Data collection is ongoing at various locations for at least 25 days. On October 24, 2013, the FAA announced plans to collect data on human response to aviation noise in protected natural areas. The research aims to establish a scientific basis for air tour management policy decisions in park units under the Air Tour Act. Additionally, on August 9, 2013, the NPS announced intentions to conduct a public survey on the value of natural quiet in park units. The National Park Service is gathering information on how human-caused sounds impact park visitation. Some park units are creating soundscape management plans to address noise from aircraft, vehicles, and voices. For example, Zion National Park issued a plan to identify sources of sound, set standards, eliminate incompatible noises, and restore degraded soundscapes. No specific legislation on air tour management at park units has been introduced in Congress as of January 2014. The 112th Congress passed aviation legislation (P.L. 112-95) affecting commercial air tours over park units. The legislation allows for voluntary agreements between the NPS director, FAA administrator, and commercial air tour operators to govern tours. These agreements can establish conditions, ensure compliance, set fees, and promote quiet aircraft technology. Public review and consultation with Indian tribes are required before implementing agreements. The 112th Congress passed legislation (P.L. 112-95) regarding commercial air tours over park units. The law allows for voluntary agreements between the NPS director, FAA administrator, and tour operators to regulate tours, set fees, and promote quiet aircraft technology. Park units with 50 or fewer annual air tour flights are exempt from certain requirements, but the NPS director can withdraw exemptions to protect park resources. The law also allows for modifications to interim operating authority and requires reporting on air tours over national park units. Additionally, there is a provision specific to Crater Lake National Park, allowing the NPS director to deny applications for commercial air tours without an air tour management plan. P.L. 112-141 extended provisions for air tour management plans to Great Smoky Mountains National Park and applications to expand operations at both park units. Personal watercraft (PWC) are high-speed, shallow-draft watercraft operated by a person sitting, standing, or kneeling on the vessel. PWC include brands like Jet Ski, Sea-Doo, and WaveRunner. Despite representing a small segment of the recreational boat market, PWC accidents have raised concerns with 721 injuries and 58 deaths reported in 2012. In 2012, there were 721 PWC injuries and 58 deaths reported, accounting for 19% of all recreational boat accidents. Critics raise environmental concerns such as noise, air, and water pollution, and damage to land and wildlife. Supporters argue for access, citing technological advancements and economic benefits. Recent controversies focus on regulatory actions limiting PWC recreational use in specific park units. NPS has evaluated PWC use in units allowing motorized boats and issued park-specific regulations in response to a lawsuit settlement. PWC use is authorized in designated areas of 13 units. In designated areas, PWC use is authorized in several national recreation areas and seashores. However, environmental groups filed a lawsuit in 2008 seeking reinstatement of PWC bans at Gulf Islands National Seashore and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. In 2010, the court ruled that NPS violated the National Environmental Policy Act by not fully considering PWC impacts on wildlife, water quality, air quality, noise, and visitor experiences at these park units. The court ordered NPS to re-evaluate environmental assessments justifying PWC use. In February 2013, NPS issued a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement concerning the use of PWC at Gulf Islands National Seashore. No new legislation has been introduced regarding PWC use in Congress. Mountain biking advocates support opening more trails in National Parks, while others are concerned about potential resource damage and visitor experience. NPS finalized a rule in July 2012 addressing mountain biking within NPS units. The final rule allows park superintendents to open existing hiking and horse trails for biking without special regulations, requiring public input and environmental assessments. Special regulations are still needed for new construction trails outside developed areas. Over 40 NPS units currently allow mountain biking on dirt trails and roads, with a partnership agreement between IMBA and NPS renewed through 2015. The IMBA and NPS renewed a five-year partnership agreement to explore more mountain biking opportunities in park units. Several park units have implemented bicycle-applicable rules and multi-use trails, such as the Sleeping Bear Heritage Trail in Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, and New River Gorge National River. These actions allow for biking on designated trails and roads within the parks. The National Park Service is considering allowing bicycling on certain park trails and roads, but there have been controversies over increasing biking trails. There has been no legislation introduced regarding mountain bike use in National Parks. Motorized recreation on NPS lands can conflict with the mission of conserving public land while providing for public enjoyment. The conflict between the desire for motorized recreational opportunities in National Parks and concerns about resource damage and conservation is a key issue. Economic considerations also play a role, with debates over the impact of restrictions on local industries versus the damage to natural resources. The National Park Service prioritizes conservation in conservation/use conflicts, with fewer lands open to off-highway vehicles compared to other federal agencies. The 113th Congress has addressed motorized recreation in National Parks through legislation and oversight. The 113th Congress has addressed motorized recreation in National Parks through legislation and oversight, focusing on specific conflicts and broader topics such as NPS management of motorized recreation and impacts on natural resources. Congress could consider additional conflicts or topics related to OHV use in specific units in the future."
