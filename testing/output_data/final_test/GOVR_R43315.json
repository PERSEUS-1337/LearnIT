    "content": "Water infrastructure funding issues are a concern for Members of Congress and stakeholders. Localities are responsible for providing water services, with estimated capital costs totaling $744 billion over 20 years. Analysts debate the accuracy of these estimates, but agree that communities face challenges in maintaining water infrastructure. Capital investments are necessary to protect public health and the environment, with most projects being debt-financed. The majority of public capital projects are debt-financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds, with at least 70% of U.S. water utilities relying on this method. Federal assistance is available but insufficient, and public-private partnerships (P3s) provide limited capital financing in the water sector. Most P3s for water infrastructure involve contract operations for operation and maintenance. Drinking water utilities are privately owned and invest in water infrastructure, unlike the wastewater sector owned by municipalities. Congress has considered legislative options to finance water infrastructure projects, including the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program established in 2014 for financial assistance. The WIFIA program provides financial assistance for water infrastructure projects, modeled after the TIFIA program for transportation projects. It discusses appropriation levels, EPA's implementation, and selected issues for policymakers. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) established the WIFIA program for water infrastructure projects. Congress provided appropriations for the program in FY2017, and the America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA) reauthorized appropriations and made amendments to certain provisions. The WIFIA pilot program authorized EPA to offer credit assistance for drinking water and wastewater projects, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could provide assistance for water resource projects. The WIFIA program was established in FY2014 by the EPA, with no funds allocated for a Corps WIFIA program. The program authorized $175 million over five years for both agencies, with project costs needing to be $20 million or more for eligibility. Assistance is available for various entities, including state infrastructure financing authorities and federal, state, local, or tribal governments. The WIFIA program allows for loans to be provided to projects sponsored by private entities, with a maximum loan amount of 49% of eligible project costs. The program also authorizes EPA or the Corps to provide up to 25% of available funds each year for credit assistance exceeding 49% of project costs. Federal assistance, including WIFIA and other sources, cannot exceed 80% of a project's cost, except for certain projects in rural areas. Eligible activities include project development, planning, construction, real property acquisition, and carrying costs during construction. The WIFIA program provides loans for projects sponsored by private entities, with a maximum loan amount of 49% of eligible project costs. EPA and the Corps can provide up to 25% of funds for credit assistance exceeding 49% of project costs. Federal assistance cannot exceed 80% of a project's cost, except for certain rural projects. Eligible activities include project development, planning, construction, real property acquisition, and carrying costs during construction. Categories eligible for assistance by EPA and the Corps include various infrastructure projects such as wastewater treatment, energy efficiency, water recycling, flood control, environmental restoration, and navigation improvements. The WIFIA program provides loans for projects with a maximum loan amount of 49% of eligible costs. Selection criteria for project eligibility include national or regional significance, use of new approaches, and serving regions with energy or water challenges. EPA Administrator must consider applications for WIFIA assistance. The WIFIA program requires projects to use American-made iron and steel products and comply with Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements. The EPA and Corps must provide information on applications and projects receiving assistance. The Government Accountability Office will report to Congress on the program. AWIA amended WIFIA by removing its pilot designation. The amended WIFIA program, effective October 23, 2018, removed its pilot designation, authorized $50.0 million for FY2020 and FY2021 for EPA implementation, allowed EPA to administer the program for relevant agencies, required a report by the Government Accountability Office by October 23, 2021, and authorized an additional $5 million for credit assistance to state finance authorities for combined projects eligible for assistance from the CWSRF and DWSRF. The WIFIA program received funding at FY2018 levels or 105% of the previous year's funding, with a minimum of $50.0 million in appropriations. State financing authorities can use WIFIA funds to cover 100% of project costs. Congress provided $2.2 million for EPA staff and program design in FY2015 and FY2016, and $30 million for the WIFIA program in FY2017. The WIFIA program received funding through various acts, including P.L. 114-254, P.L. 115-31, and P.L. 115-141, totaling $91 million for loan subsidy costs and administrative expenses. EPA was authorized to guarantee up to $6.71 billion in direct loans for FY2018. The WIFIA program received funding through various acts, totaling $91 million for loan subsidy costs and administrative expenses. EPA was authorized to guarantee up to $7.31 billion in direct loans for FY2019. Figure 1 shows WIFIA appropriations for administrative purposes and loan subsidy costs from FY2017 to FY2019. The WIFIA program authorized funding for water resources projects, but funds have not been allocated for a Corps WIFIA program. EPA conducted public listening sessions in 2014 to prepare for implementation, and issued rules in 2016 to clarify program provisions and application guidelines. The WIFIA program established guidelines for project selection, credit assistance, and reporting requirements. Funding priority was given to projects related to extreme weather adaptation, energy efficiency, green infrastructure, and infrastructure repair. EPA also implemented a fee structure for WIFIA to recover program administration costs. The EPA's final rule for the WIFIA program requires a nonrefundable fee for project applications, with fees of $100,000 or $25,000 for small community projects. The WIIN Act amended WIFIA to allow fees to be financed as part of the loan. AWIA clarified that state financing authorities cannot pass along application fees. EPA announced its first round of funding for the WIFIA program in January 2017 after receiving appropriations for loan subsidy costs. The WIFIA program received its first round of funding in January 2017, with additional rounds following each fiscal year's appropriations. The program provides credit assistance with less impact on the federal budget compared to grants, as loans are repaid to the U.S. Treasury. The subsidy amount for WIFIA is determined by congressional appropriations and the calculation of long-term costs. The subsidy amount for Federal credit instruments is crucial in determining the amount of credit assistance available to project sponsors. It is calculated based on the estimated long-term cost to the Federal Government, excluding administrative costs and incidental effects on governmental receipts or outlays. A lower subsidy rate allows for a larger loan amount, with the Office of Management and Budget identifying a 6.30% subsidy rate for direct loans in FY2020. In FY2020, the Office of Management and Budget identified a 6.30% subsidy rate for direct loans. Proponents argue that water projects are less risky than transportation projects due to established revenue streams. However, analysts caution that some communities have had issues with borrowing and bond repayments. The Trump Administration's budget proposed a 0.91% subsidy rate for WIFIA, allowing for a $10 million appropriation to support loans totaling $1.10 billion. The subsidy rate for WIFIA implementation is project-specific and used for budgetary purposes. It provides an estimate for available loans based on future loan portfolio riskiness. Each project's actual ratio is determined at loan obligation time. Projects with higher credit quality use less subsidy. WIFIA offers low-cost capital to borrowers with taxable interest rates lower than traditional tax-exempt debt. Loan repayment can be deferred for five years, making it patient capital. The WIFIA program offers patient capital with flexible loan repayment terms and reduced investment risk due to creditworthiness. It aims to limit the government's exposure to default by encouraging private capital investment. However, the Congressional Budget Office argues that the program underestimates the cost by excluding market risk. The WIFIA program uses risk-free discount rates for present value calculations, limiting federal funding to 49% of project costs and all federal assistance to 80%. It supports larger infrastructure projects over $20 million, complementing smaller-scale projects funded by SRF programs. The WIFIA program supports larger infrastructure projects over $20 million, with a lower minimum threshold for smaller communities. Projects in less populous areas have been selected for funding rounds, but interest in WIFIA financing from these communities is uncertain due to other available options like USDA programs for rural communities. The FY2019 appropriations act requires states to use a percentage of their federal grant amounts to provide additional subsidization for clean water and drinking water projects. WIFIA financing can support smaller projects by grouping them through a single application for financial assistance. For example, Indiana's prospective WIFIA loan would provide assistance for clean water and drinking water projects. Indiana is seeking a $436 million WIFIA loan to support multiple water projects in the state. There is debate over the potential impact of WIFIA on funding for Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act SRF programs. Some state environmental groups oppose WIFIA, fearing it could reduce spending on SRF programs, while water utility groups argue that WIFIA would complement existing programs by providing funding for large water infrastructure projects. The WIFIA program offers funding for large water infrastructure projects that may not receive SRF assistance. Concerns exist about potential competition with SRFs for funding and prioritization of public health and affordability. Legislation emphasizes that WIFIA funding should be in addition to SRF funding. Congressional committees assess the budgetary impact of enacting the WIFIA program. The WIFIA program provides funding for large water infrastructure projects, with budgetary impacts assessed by Congressional committees. The initial CBO cost estimate for S. 601 concluded that WIFIA provisions would cost $260 million over five years and result in revenue loss of $135 million over 10 years. To avoid pay-as-you-go requirements, a provision was added to prohibit recipients from issuing tax-exempt bonds for non-WIFIA project costs. The WIFIA program initially allowed tax-exempt bonds for project costs, but a provision was added to prohibit this, reducing the bill's cost by $200 million over five years. This change made the program less attractive to entities relying on tax-exempt bonds for financing, leading to criticism from potential users. The WIFIA program faced criticism for its bond financing restriction and cap on assistance at 49% of project costs, making it difficult to finance needed projects. Congressional interest in addressing the tax-exempt bond restriction was evident, with proposed exceptions for states in drought emergencies. The Senate passed a bill to reauthorize highway programs, including repeal of the provision limiting WIFIA projects from using tax-exempt bonds, raising revenue questions. The repeal of the provision limiting WIFIA projects from using tax-exempt bonds would increase states' issuance of tax-exempt bonds for water projects, decrease federal revenues by $17 million over FY2016-FY2025, and increase demand for federal credit under the WIFIA program, costing $146 million over the same period. Identifying offsets for the federal revenue loss was addressed in the conference agreement on H.R. 22. The estimated federal revenue loss was addressed in the conference agreement on H.R. 22, the FAST Act (P.L. 114-94). CBO estimated that the conference agreement included offsets to fully cover the cost of the bill by reducing spending or raising revenues, thus retaining the provision repealing the tax-exempt bond financing restriction on WIFIA assistance."
