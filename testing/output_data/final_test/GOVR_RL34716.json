    "content": "If a sitting United States Senator is indicted for a felony, their status and service in Congress are not directly affected by federal laws or the Constitution. Senate party rules may require them to temporarily step aside from leadership positions, but they do not automatically forfeit their office even upon conviction. Conviction of a felony by a Member of Congress may result in loss of committee chairmanships or ranking Member status, as per party rules. Senators may face internal disciplinary proceedings, including censure or expulsion with a two-thirds majority vote. Expulsion does not impact federal pension, but certain crimes may lead to forfeiture of retirement benefits. Conviction of a felony by a Member of Congress may result in loss of committee chairmanships or ranking Member status, as per party rules. Indictment or conviction of a felony does not disqualify one from being a Member of Congress, unless for certain treasonous conduct after taking an oath of office. The only qualifications for congressional office are age, citizenship, and inhabitancy in the state when elected, as outlined in the United States Constitution. Once these qualifications are met, a person is constitutionally \"qualified\" to serve in Congress. If elected, a person indicted or convicted of a felony can still serve in Congress, but may lose committee positions based on party rules. House members convicted of offenses leading to imprisonment may face consequences. House Rule XXIII (10) instructs members convicted of offenses punishable by two or more years' imprisonment to refrain from committee participation and voting until their presumption of innocence is restored. The Senate lacks a similar provision, but both houses have the authority to discipline and expel members for disorderly behavior. Traditional practice in Congress is to wait for indictment outcomes before imposing internal discipline. In cases where a Member of Congress has been indicted, congressional discipline like expulsion or censure is typically delayed until guilt is resolved through the judicial system. Both the Senate and the House are hesitant to remove elected members based solely on charges in an indictment, but ongoing congressional inquiries can still occur alongside criminal proceedings. Attempts to mandatorily suspend an indicted or convicted Member from voting or participating in congressional proceedings raise issues as Senators are directly elected and represent their constituents. The authority of Congress to suspend a Member has been questioned as it could disenfranchise the Member's constituency and deprive them of full representation in Congress. The Senate can take internal disciplinary action, including censure or expulsion, against a Member convicted of a crime related to official misconduct. The Senate can investigate and adjudicate regardless of ongoing appeals. No specific guidelines exist for congressional discipline grounds. No specific guidelines exist for congressional discipline grounds. Each house of Congress has discretion to discipline misconduct with censure, reprimand, or expulsion. Expulsion historically involves disloyalty or criminal law violations. The Senate has expelled 15 Senators, mostly during the Civil War for disloyalty. The Senate has historically expelled relatively few Members, with none expelled since the Civil War. Senators facing recommended expulsion for misconduct have often resigned instead. The Senate can also take other disciplinary actions such as censure or fines. This disciplinary action can be taken for conduct that the Senate deems reprehensible or discrediting to the institution, even if it doesn't violate any specific laws or rules. The Senate has historically expelled few Members, with none expelled since the Civil War. Senators facing expulsion for misconduct have often resigned instead. The Senate can also take other disciplinary actions such as censure or fines for conduct deemed reprehensible or discrediting, even if it doesn't violate specific laws or rules. The Senate and House have shown reluctance to expel Members for past misconduct if the electorate knew of the behavior and still elected the Member, reflecting deference to the popular will and election choice of the people. The United States Constitution does not allow for the recall of Senators or Representatives, and no official has ever been recalled in U.S. history. Members of Congress can end their service through resignation, death, expulsion, or if they accept a public office deemed incompatible with their congressional position. The Constitution does not allow for the recall of Senators or Representatives, and no official has ever been recalled in U.S. history. The idea of placing a recall provision in the Constitution was considered but eventually rejected during the drafting and ratifying debates. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the subject of recall of Members of Congress. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the recall of Members of Congress, but it is established that the right to remove a Member of Congress before their term ends resides exclusively in each house of Congress. State rulings have consistently found that there is no power for an electorate to recall a Senator or Representative. State rulings have consistently found that there is no power for an electorate to recall a federal officer like a United States Representative or Senator. Indictment or conviction of a felony offense does not disqualify a Member of Congress from holding office, except for treasonous conduct under the Fourteenth Amendment. Congressional censure or expulsion does not permanently prevent someone from holding congressional office in the future. A person under indictment or a convicted felon can run for and be reelected to Congress if they meet the constitutional qualifications. State legislatures cannot alter these qualifications, and individuals under indictment or convicted felons can be chosen by the people to represent them in Congress. Once seated, a Member of Congress may be subject to discipline by the Senate. The Constitution allows individuals under indictment or convicted felons to run for and be reelected to Congress. State legislatures cannot bar candidates based on indictment or conviction. The qualifications to serve in Congress were intentionally kept minimal to give voters control over their representation. Members of Congress do not forfeit their pensions or retirement income upon indictment or conviction. Members of Congress may have their federal pensions affected in two instances: upon conviction of national security offenses or felony offenses related to public corruption, abuse of official position, fraud, or campaign finance laws. The \"Hiss Act\" mandates forfeiture of federal retirement annuities for crimes like disclosure of classified information, espionage, treason, or rebellion. Members of Congress may lose federal pension benefits if convicted of offenses related to national security, public corruption, fraud, or campaign finance laws. This includes crimes such as treason, rebellion, seditious conspiracy, and perjury. The forfeiture provisions apply if the criminal misconduct occurred while serving as a Member of Congress, President, Vice President, or elected official at any level of government. The pension forfeiture provisions apply to offenses related to national security, public corruption, fraud, or campaign finance laws for Members of Congress, the President, Vice President, or elected officials at any level of government. Offenses include bribery, conflicts of interest, false claims, theft of public funds, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. The loss of federal pension annuity or creditable service as a Member for retirement annuity is determined by the nature and elements of the offense committed, regardless of resignation, indictment, conviction, or expulsion from Congress."
