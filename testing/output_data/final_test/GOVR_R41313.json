The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) faced financial challenges in the 1990s, leading to budget cuts and layoffs. The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) faced financial challenges in the 1990s, leading to budget cuts and layoffs. Despite reforms after reaccreditation in 1997, UDC remained under public scrutiny. District residents enrolled in postsecondary institutions outside DC at a high rate, raising concerns about the cost for students attending college. In 1999-2000, District of Columbia students paid $7,890 per year in tuition, more than twice the national average of $3,215. This raised concerns about the cost of attending in-state higher education institutions. Supporters argued for unique remedies due to DC's status as the nation's capital. In 1973, Congress granted limited home rule authority to Washington, DC, allowing citizens to elect a mayor and city council. However, Congress retained the authority to review and approve all District laws and budgets. Federal intervention occurred in the 1990s due to troubled city services, a poor credit rating, and a budget deficit of $722 million. In the 1990s, a $722 million budget deficit led to federal intervention in Washington, DC. Legislation increased federal oversight and temporarily transferred some government functions to Congress. Concerns about postsecondary education opportunities for residents prompted the introduction of a bill to support higher education. Morella introduced a bill to create the DCTAG program, providing grants for DC residents to attend public and private higher education institutions in the US. Initially, $10,000 scholarships were for public IHEs in Maryland and Virginia, while $2,500 grants were for private colleges and HBCUs. The DCTAG program was expanded by Mayor Anthony Williams in May 2000 to provide up to $10,000 per student per year towards the difference between in-state and out-of-state undergraduate tuition and fees at all public colleges and universities. The DCTAG program, established in 1999, was expanded in 2002 to provide up to $2,500 per student per year for private HBCUs nationwide. It has been reauthorized twice, with the latest extension through FY2012 and a means-testing provision for residents with taxable annual incomes over $1,000,000. The DCTAG program, administered by the mayor of the District of Columbia, operates under a Continuing Resolution. Funds are allocated to separate accounts for federal appropriations, District government contributions, unobligated balances, and interest earned. OSSE manages short-term and long-term expenditure accounts, with the mayor required to reduce awards if funds are insufficient. The DCTAG program, administered by the mayor of the District of Columbia, operates under a Continuing Resolution. The maximum allowable grant amount is $10,000 per student per year, with a total cap of $50,000. District of Columbia residents can receive DCTAG funds to attend public Title IV eligible four-year IHEs in the United States, but cannot use the funds for UDC or the Community College of the District of Columbia. Students cannot use DCTAG funds to attend the Community College of the District of Columbia due to reduced tuition for DC residents. Private HBCUs nationwide and private IHEs in the DC metropolitan area are eligible for DCTAG funds up to $2,500 per student per year. Public two-year IHEs nationwide can also accept DCTAG funds up to $2,500 per student per year. Total per student caps are $12,500 for private institutions and $10,000 for public institutions. To be eligible for a grant under the DCTAG program, a student must be a resident of the District of Columbia, a citizen, national, or permanent resident of the United States, enrolled at least half-time in an approved program, and meet certain immigration criteria. Institutions receiving DCTAG funds must agree to reporting requirements and use the funds to supplement student assistance. To be eligible for a DCTAG grant, a student must be under 24 years old, maintain satisfactory progress in their program, not be in default on a federal student loan, have a high school diploma or equivalent, and be a resident of DC for at least 12 months before enrolling in an eligible institution. To be eligible for a DCTAG grant, a student must be under 24 years old, maintain satisfactory progress, not be in default on a federal student loan, have a high school diploma or equivalent, and be a DC resident for at least 12 months before enrolling in an eligible institution. Additionally, post-baccalaureate students who have already earned a bachelor's degree or whose family's federal taxable income exceeds $1,000,000 annually are ineligible for the program. Eligible students must submit a DC OneApp, fill out the FAFSA, and provide required supporting documents. To apply for a DCTAG grant, students must submit a DC OneApp, complete the FAFSA, and provide necessary supporting documents. Awards are paid directly to the student's institution, with a maximum grant of $10,000 per year. Grants for part-time students are prorated. Institutions must have a Program Participation Agreement to participate in the DCTAG program. In order to participate in the DCTAG program, institutions must complete a Program Participation Agreement, fill out a Minimum Requirements Invoice, and email an invoice for eligible students. DCTAG funds are not meant to cover the full cost of college attendance, so students can seek additional financial assistance from Title IV federal student aid programs. The maximum loan or grant amount for these programs is determined by various factors, including the cost of attendance and total estimated financial assistance from other sources. Funds received through DCTAG would likely be considered scholarships or state assistance, which are considered estimated financial aid. The DCTAG program provides financial aid to District of Columbia residents, funded through annual appropriations. The program's funds do not expire at the end of each fiscal year and can be used to award grants. Funding levels varied between FY2010 and FY2013. The DCTAG program allows carryover authority for funds, enabling grants to be awarded in future years. The mayor must submit an annual report to Congress detailing student eligibility, grant awards, reductions in grant size, and student credentials earned. The Government Accountability Office monitors the program for enrollment barriers and efficacy. In 2005, GAO recommended improvements in student data verification, cash balance reconciliation, and award prediction models. The District of Columbia's Office of the State Superintendent of Education has addressed all concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office regarding the DCTAG program. In AY2011-2012, $33.4 million in DCTAG funds supported 5,253 students attending postsecondary institutions. DCTAG recipients mainly choose public IHEs and public HBCUs. In 2010, 2,503 DC residents enrolled in Title IV-eligible IHEs as freshmen, with 1,448 receiving first-time DCTAG awards. Approximately 58% of recent high school graduates from Washington, DC, who enrolled at eligible IHEs in 2010 received DCTAG funds. The DCTAG program assists a large number of students pursuing postsecondary education. Data shows that 85% of DC residents in grades 9-12 attended public schools, while 15% attended private schools. From AY2006\u20132007 to AY2011\u20132012, 68% of DCTAG recipients attended DC public or charter high schools, and 27% attended private schools. Since its inception, DCTAG participation has increased, with a significant rise in recent high school graduate participants. Participation rates have somewhat leveled off in recent years. The District of Columbia is divided into eight wards, each represented by an elected councilmember. Social equity measures are often calculated by ward due to varying household income and educational attainment. OSSE data shows the distribution of awards across wards, comparing median family income and DCTAG recipients percentage. The data suggests that wards with lower median family incomes have a higher percentage of DCTAG recipients compared to wards with higher incomes. The six-year undergraduate graduation rate for DCTAG recipients is slightly below the national average. Despite an increase in funding for the DCTAG program, the maximum award size has not been adjusted to account for rising education costs, potentially leading to higher expenses for participants. The DCTAG program may not be covering the increasing costs of education, leading to higher expenses for participants. The maximum award size has not kept up with rising tuition costs, causing concerns about the program's effectiveness in bridging the gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition. Despite stable overall recipient numbers, there has been a rise in $10,000 awards disbursed annually since 2004. The maximum DCTAG award has increased annually since 2004, possibly due to rising tuition costs. In AY2011-2012, 66% of recipients enrolled in public four-year IHEs in regional states, with most attending a small number of schools like Pennsylvania State University and University of Maryland. The average in- and out-of-state tuition differential for the most-attended regional IHEs was $14,092. Increasing the maximum annual DCTAG award to cover this differential could provide greater access to postsecondary educational options for DCTAG recipients. Since AY2004-2005, tuition and fees at private not-for-profit four-year IHEs in DC have increased by 42.5%, while the percentage of DCTAG recipients attending these institutions has slightly decreased. A similar trend is seen for DCTAG participants choosing to attend private not-for-profit four-year HBCUs, with tuition and fees increasing by 34.6% since AY2004-2005. Congress could consider adjusting DCTAG funds to better match students' financial need or lowering the income cap for participation. The increase in tuition and fees at DC private nonprofit IHEs and private HBCUs nationwide has not deterred DCTAG recipients from attending, but the unchanged $2,500 award does not cover as much as it did 10 years ago. In addition to federal student aid, programs like the District of Columbia College Access Program (DC CAP) provide educational counseling and financial assistance to DC high school students. DC CAP serves DC high school students from low-income households with counseling, seminars, and preparatory programs. They offer Last Dollar Awards of up to $2,070 per student per year for college expenses. DC Adoption provides scholarships to students adopted from DC Child & Family Services Agency or affected by September 11, 2001 events. Mayor's Scholars Undergraduate Fund offers need-based grants to DC residents for their first undergraduate degree. The DC Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) provides financial assistance for DC residents pursuing their first undergraduate degree at public or private institutions in DC. Grants range from $3,000 to $10,000 depending on the institution. Recipients may also qualify for Mayor's Scholars Undergraduate Fund grants. DCTAG was established in 2012 and started operating in FY2013."
