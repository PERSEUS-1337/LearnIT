    "content": "The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) sets requirements for legislation and regulations imposing duties on governments or the private sector. It defines mandates as obligations without funding, known as \"unfunded mandates.\" UMRA excludes certain federal actions with significant financial impacts on nonfederal entities. The report aims to describe covered mandates. The report describes legislative and regulatory provisions subject to UMRA's requirements, assesses its impact on federal mandates, and examines debates on UMRA's coverage. It also outlines UMRA's requirements for establishing covered mandates, including cost estimates by the Congressional Budget Office for legislation imposing mandates on nonfederal entities. UMRA requires agencies to provide cost estimates for mandates on intergovernmental or private sectors. It establishes a point of order in Congress for legislation with intergovernmental mandates. The report focuses on mandate cost estimates for legislation and regulations, and the point of order procedure for unfunded intergovernmental mandates. The concept of unfunded mandates gained attention in response to changes in federal grant-in-aid programs and regulations. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was a shift in federal government approach towards state and local governments, moving from voluntary grant-in-aid funding to more intrusive and compulsory programs and regulations. This change was driven by the need for compliance under the threat of civil consequences. The shift in federal government approach towards state and local governments during the 1970s and 1980s led to the imposition of \"unfunded mandates\" that required compliance under the threat of penalties. State and local government advocates saw these mandates as inconsistent with traditional American federalism, based on cooperation rather than compulsion. The enactment of UMRA in 1995 was the culmination of efforts to control or eliminate unfunded federal mandates. Advocates of regulatory reform pushed for control over unfunded federal mandates, arguing that federal regulations burden private enterprise. Business organizations supported state and local government efforts to regulate unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates. Private-sector advocates sought relief from restrictive federal regulations hindering economic growth. Proposals in the early 1990s aimed to address these issues. The unfunded mandates developed in the early 1990s addressed federal intergovernmental and private-sector mandates. The legislation aimed to balance federalism by checking the imposition of unfunded mandates. Some argued that federal mandates may be necessary for achieving national objectives. UMRA's legislative history reflects Congress's commitment to reshaping intergovernmental relations through eight statutory purposes. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act aims to end the imposition of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without adequate funding. It also seeks to assist Congress in considering proposed legislation with mandates and promote informed decisions on the appropriateness of such mandates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act aims to require Congress to consider funding for State, local, and tribal governments to comply with Federal mandates. It also establishes a point-of-order vote on legislation with significant mandates without adequate funding and assists Federal agencies in considering regulations affecting these governments. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires Federal agencies to involve State, local, and tribal officials in developing regulations and consider budgetary impacts on these governments before adopting regulations. It also addresses the effects of previous Federal mandates on these governments. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires CBO to estimate costs of mandates exceeding certain thresholds and establishes a point of order against legislation with high mandate costs. Federal agencies must assess effects on state and local governments and the private sector for mandates exceeding $100 million annually. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) sets threshold amounts for intergovernmental and private sector mandates. It applies to enforceable duties on state, local governments, or the private sector in legislation, statutes, or regulations. UMRA has exceptions for voluntary federal programs, rules by independent agencies, and certain provisions like individual rights, national security, and Social Security legislation. UMRA's Title III calls for a review of federal intergovernmental mandates. UMRA's Title III called for a review of federal intergovernmental mandates by the now-defunct U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) within 18 months of enactment. ACIR completed a preliminary report in January 1996, but the final report was not released. UMRA's Title IV authorizes judicial review of federal agency compliance with Title II provisions. Congress faced defining unfunded federal mandate legislation, with Senator Judd Gregg emphasizing the need for a precise definition to avoid endless litigation. The definition of unfunded federal mandates is crucial to avoid litigation and ensure cost-effectiveness in seeking payment. Congress faced challenges in defining this concept due to disagreements among academics, practitioners, and elected officials. Disputes revolved around identifying and controlling costs incurred by state and local governments or the private sector in the legislative or regulatory process. The focus on whether costs are \"mandatory\" has overshadowed the core policy question of which costs should be subject to informational requirements or procedural restrictions like UMRA establishes. Scholars have broadly defined unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates as responsibilities imposed by constitutional, administrative, executive, or judicial action. ACIR argued against including conditions of aid in this definition, making it challenging to define unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates. Federal grant-in-aid programs often include incentives and mandates with sanctions. There is a continuum between general support grants with few conditions and costly unfunded national mandates. ACIR argued that grant-in-aid programs combine subsidy and mandate approaches. Federal grant-in-aid programs combine subsidy and mandate approaches, with grant conditions not classified as mandates due to their voluntary acceptance. ACIR argues that most conditions only affect program administration and provide significant benefits to recipients. Programs that incur federal sanctions for non-participation are considered mandates. In 1994, organizations defined unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates as requirements that compel state or local activities, resulting in additional expenditures or conditions. In 1994, ACIR introduced the term \"federally induced costs\" to replace the term 'mandates.' It identified various federal activities that lead to additional costs for states and localities, including direct orders, preemptions, grant conditions, tax provisions, court decisions, and administrative rules. ACIR defended its inclusion of grant-in-aid conditions in its list of \"federally induced costs,\" asserting that grant conditions have become more integral to state and local activities and less subject to voluntary forbearance than previously thought. John Kincaid testified that legislation on unfunded mandates should recognize a range of federally-induced costs. State and local government officials supported including ACIR's definition of \"federally induced costs\" in legislation on unfunded intergovernmental mandates. However, environmental and social groups argued that the definition was too broad, particularly for mandates related to the environment and constitutional rights. There was a general consensus on the need for clear definitions in federalism discussions. There is a general consensus among federalism scholars, state and local government officials, and other organizations that unfunded federal mandates are federal policies that impose unavoidable costs without sufficient compensatory funding. Some statutory direct orders, like the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, are considered federal mandates. However, there is a consensus that certain orders guaranteeing constitutional rights should be exempt from legislation on unfunded federal mandates. Governors oppose unfunded federal mandates but support environmental legislation and regulations to protect public health and natural resources. They emphasize the importance of upholding citizens' rights and working with Congress to enact strong environmental laws. Total and partial preemptions of state and local authority by the federal government are a concern. Total and partial preemptions of state and local spending and regulatory authority by the federal government are a contentious issue. This includes restrictions on state powers in areas such as economic regulation, retirement age policies, and bankruptcy regulations. The debate revolves around whether these preemptions should be considered federal mandates or included in legislation aimed at relieving unfunded federal mandates. The federal government can preempt a field and set national standards, allowing states to administer programs if they meet federal rules. States can opt out if they don't have a program or don't want to enforce standards, but federal standards still apply. Some argue that preemptions should be considered in legislation addressing unfunded federal mandates. Including preemptions in legislation addressing unfunded federal mandates is a contentious issue. Some argue that preemptions can have adverse effects on state and local government flexibilities and resources. Business organizations oppose including preemptions in any law involving unfunded federal mandates, as they can lead to standardized regulations across jurisdictions. Grants-in-aid conditions are generally not considered unfunded mandates. Federal grants are not considered unfunded mandates because state and local governments can refuse them to avoid costs. However, without sufficient compensatory funding, grant conditions should be seen as unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates. Some grants require significant state resources and changes in laws to comply with federal requirements. Medicaid, for example, is too large for states to turn down voluntarily. Sweeney, a Democratic Member of Ohio's state House of Representatives, testified at a congressional hearing on unfunded mandate legislation, highlighting the challenges caused by Federal entitlements and mandatory requirements for programs like Medicaid. Federalism scholars and government officials argue that federal tax policies preempting state and local authority should be considered unfunded mandates and subject to legislation restricting them. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 placed restrictions on unfunded mandates, including a moratorium on internet access taxation. The moratorium was extended multiple times and made permanent in 2015. The NCSL has raised concerns about the fiscal impact of preempting state or local government revenue sources. The NCSL has cited research suggesting that states could receive an additional $6.5 billion annually in state sales tax revenue if the moratorium on internet access taxation was lifted. Federal tax changes can impact state and local government finances, with most officials advocating for their inclusion in federal legislation placing conditions on the imposition. Officials advocate for the inclusion of federal legislation placing conditions on unfunded federal mandates. Federalism scholars, state and local government officials, and other organizations argue that court decisions and regulatory actions by federal agencies, such as delays and nonenforcement, impose costs on state and local governments. UMRA's provisions on administrative rules are discussed, with Congress defining federal mandates more narrowly than expected. The government defines federal intergovernmental mandates as provisions in legislation that impose duties on state, local, or tribal governments or reduce federal funding. Private-sector mandates are provisions in legislation that affect required services. Private-sector mandates are defined as provisions in legislation that impose an enforceable duty on the private sector or reduce federal funding. Enforceable duties such as statutory direct orders, preemptions, and federal tax policies are covered under UMRA, while grant conditions and certain federal tax policies are not considered enforceable duties. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) does not cover affected income tax provisions from the federal income tax code as they are not enforceable duties. UMRA considers a mandate unfunded unless it fully meets its estimated direct costs by providing new budget authority or authorizing appropriations. If appropriations are authorized, the mandate is still considered unfunded unless certain conditions are met, such as ensuring that the actual costs do not exceed the appropriations provided. This mechanism allows for reviewing and revising mandates based on their actual costs. The \"Byrd look-back amendment\" in UMRA revises mandates based on actual costs for intergovernmental mandates funded through appropriations. UMRA includes provisions that increase conditions of assistance or decrease federal funding for grants over $500 million annually. The Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius on June 28, 2012, regarding the withdrawal of Medicaid funds from states. The Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius that withdrawing Medicaid funds for non-compliance with health care reform violated the Tenth Amendment. CBO found that UMRA provisions generally did not apply to large entitlement grant programs like Medicaid. However, CBO now indicates that UMRA may apply to changes in program conditions or funding reductions if states lack flexibility to alter programs. UMRA's Title I does not apply to certain federal assistance conditions, duties from voluntary federal programs, and various legislative provisions. These exempted provisions are not considered federal mandates under UMRA. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs report provided reasoning for adopting these exemptions. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 exempts certain provisions and rules to recognize the President's authority in foreign affairs and national emergencies. It also exempts Federal auditing and civil rights laws due to special circumstances and history. The Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1964, along with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, rejected the States rights philosophy to ensure equal opportunity and protect against discrimination. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act exempts Federal civil rights laws from its requirements and does not mandate cost estimates for all legislative provisions with federal mandates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act exempts Federal civil rights laws from cost estimate requirements for legislative provisions with federal mandates. CBO assists congressional committees in analyzing budgetary impacts of proposed legislation affecting state, local, tribal governments, private sector, and employment. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act exempts Federal civil rights laws from cost estimate requirements for legislative provisions with federal mandates. CBO provides cost estimates for mandates exceeding predetermined amounts in the first five fiscal years. The CBO must inform the committee if a federal mandate has estimated direct costs below certain thresholds and explain the basis of the estimate. The mandate is considered unfunded unless costs are fully covered by new spending or appropriations. Tribal governments must comply with Federal intergovernmental mandates, which may require spending or prohibit revenue raising. The CBO created units to estimate costs for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates, with congressional committees required to include these estimates in reports on bills. The committee is required to publish mandate cost estimates in the Congressional Record before legislation reaches the floor for consideration. The report must assess costs and benefits, competitive balance, preemption of state laws, and funding for intergovernmental mandates. CBO has submitted over 13,000 mandate cost estimates to Congress since 1996. Since 1996, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has submitted over 13,000 mandate cost estimates to Congress, examining costs imposed by intergovernmental mandates and private-sector mandates. About 11.5% of cost estimate statements identified intergovernmental mandates, with less than 1.0% exceeding UMRA's threshold. CBO was unable to determine costs for 79 bills. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has submitted over 13,000 mandate cost estimates to Congress since 1996. About 15.3% of private-sector estimates identified costs imposed by mandates, with 3.2% exceeding UMRA's threshold. CBO was unable to determine costs for 299 bills. UMRA enforces informational requirements by establishing a point of order against consideration of measures without published mandate cost estimates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) requires CBO estimates of mandate costs for committees. A point of order can be raised if the total mandate cost exceeds UMRA's threshold. This point of order provides a means of control over mandate costs, but only on the basis of cost estimates. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) allows for control over mandate costs based on cost estimates. A point of order can be raised if mandate costs exceed UMRA's threshold, providing a means of control over mandates. This point of order applies to any measure coming to the floor for consideration, including committee reports and conference reports. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) allows for control over mandate costs based on cost estimates. A point of order can be raised if mandate costs exceed UMRA's threshold, providing a means of control over mandates, particularly against intergovernmental mandates. This control does not apply to private-sector mandates or bills reported by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) allows for control over mandate costs based on cost estimates. If a mandate exceeds the threshold, a point of order can be raised in the Senate, leading to provisions being stricken from the bill. In the House, a majority vote determines whether to consider the measure despite the point of order. The chair does not rule on the point of order but can dispose of multiple points at once with a single vote. If the Committee on Rules proposes a special rule waiving the point of order, it can be considered. The Senate consults with relevant committees to determine if a measure contains an intergovernmental mandate and if its costs meet UMRA's threshold. If no challenges are raised, the Senate can vote on waiving the point of order to consider the measure. In 2005, the Senate increased the threshold to waive an UMRA point of order to three-fifths of Senators. Two UMRA points of order were raised that year, defeating two amendments to an appropriations bill. In 2007, the threshold was returned to a majority vote. On April 2, 2009, the Senate approved an amendment to increase the vote necessary to waive an UMRA point of order to three-fifths of Senators. The Senate increased the threshold to waive an UMRA point of order to three-fifths of Senators in 2005. In 2007, the threshold was returned to a majority vote. On March 23, 2013, the Senate agreed to an amendment to restore the requirement for waiving an UMRA point of order to three-fifths of the full Senate. The House did not act on the measure, so the simple majority requirement for appealing or waiving UMRA points of order in the Senate remained in effect. The Senate increased the threshold to waive an UMRA point of order to three-fifths of Senators in 2005. In 2007, the threshold was returned to a majority vote. On March 23, 2013, the Senate agreed to an amendment to restore the requirement for waiving an UMRA point of order to three-fifths of the full Senate. The House did not act on the measure, so the simple majority requirement for appealing or waiving UMRA points of order in the Senate remained in effect. S.Con.Res. 11, the concurrent budget resolution for FY2016, included a provision that restored the requirement for waiving an UMRA point of order in the Senate to three-fifths of Senators duly chosen and sworn. A scholar familiar with UMRA argued that UMRA's enforcement procedure of waiving a point of order by majority vote meant that UMRA mattered only in the House. During UMRA's first 10 years of operation, 13 UMRA points of order were raised, all in the House. During the 111th-114th Congresses, UMRA points of order in the House were often raised not to challenge unfunded federal mandates but to challenge legislative pace, limitations on amendments, or earmarks. UMRA points of order have also been raised in the Senate four times. In the Senate, UMRA points of order were raised against amendments related to minimum wage and health care reform bills. The Senate voted to waive the point of order in both cases. UMRA points of order were also raised against intergovernmental mandates in a bill for Puerto Rico's debt, which was waived and approved. Although UMRA points of order have been sustained only three times, state and local officials believe UMRA has reduced unfunded federal mandates. UMRA has reduced unfunded federal mandates by acting as a deterrent to their enactment. It has slowed the growth of direct mandates and improved communication between federal policymakers and state/local officials. The Act has led to members seeking advice to avoid UMRA problems, showing its tangible benefits beyond just being a historical relic. The CBO report has positively changed intergovernmental discussions by increasing attention to fiscal effects of federal legislation on state and local governments. UMRA has led to modifications in legislation to avoid exceeding cost thresholds, with CBO submitting over 13,000 cost estimate statements since 1996. Since UMRA became effective in 1996, 15 laws containing 21 intergovernmental mandates have costs exceeding the statutory threshold. Some examples include the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007, costing state and local governments over $1 billion each during the first five years. The enactment of various laws, such as the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 and the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Relief Act of 2003, resulted in significant financial impacts on states. For example, the reduction in federal funding for the food stamp program was estimated to cost states between $200 million and $300 million annually. Additionally, the preemption of state taxes on certain prescription drug plans and internet services led to revenue losses of $70 million in 2006, increasing to $95 million annually by 2010, and at least $300 million, respectively. The extension of the preemption in various acts has led to significant revenue losses for state and local governments. For example, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 estimated to cost over $100 million in the final three months of fiscal year 2020 and several hundred million dollars annually thereafter. Additionally, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 imposed requirements on state and local governments for issuing certain documents. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, and the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 imposed significant costs on state and local governments, exceeding $100 million annually in some cases. Additionally, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission required rail and transit owners to train workers and submit reports to the Department of Homeland Security. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 and the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2008 imposed significant costs on state and local governments, exceeding UMRA's threshold in the first five years following enactment. Public entities handling health insurance information must comply with new regulations, pay annual fees, and meet new coverage standards. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 imposed significant costs on state and local governments, exceeding UMRA's thresholds in the first five years. The requirement for schools to provide meals that comply with new standards and the costs for Puerto Rico to comply with a federal oversight board were also highlighted. The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) enacted in 2016 exceeded UMRA's threshold, leading to concerns about unfunded mandates. CBO reports 217 laws from 2006 to 2018 imposed 443 mandates on state and local governments, with some exceeding UMRA's limits. From 2006 to 2018, 217 laws imposed 443 mandates on state and local governments, with 16 exceeding UMRA's threshold. CBO identified 2,022 private-sector mandates in 13,187 cost estimate statements submitted to Congress. State and local government officials argue that UMRA's exemptions and exclusions reduce its effectiveness in limiting unfunded federal intergovernmental mandates. They claim that federal programs in exempted areas can still impose costs on governments, with at least $131 billion shifted to states in the past five years. NCSL recommends changes to reduce these costs. NCSL recommends expanding UMRA's provisions to include all open-ended entitlement grant-in-aid programs, new conditions of federal funding, legislative provisions that reduce state revenues, and mandates that fail to meet the statutory threshold. Business interests generally support these efforts to broaden UMRA's scope. In 2005, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) gathered input from various stakeholders on UMRA, with most parties from all sectors, including business, expressing concerns about UMRA's narrow coverage of federal mandates with significant financial impacts on nonfederal entities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the business sector generally supports federal preemptions to standardize regulations across jurisdictions. Some parties opposed expanding UMRA's coverage, arguing for the importance of existing exclusions related to public health, safety, environmental protection, workers' rights, and the disabled. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the business sector generally supports federal preemptions to standardize regulations across jurisdictions. Various business organizations have advocated for extending UMRA's substantive point of order for intergovernmental mandates to the private sector, allowing a point of order against legislation with private-sector mandates exceeding UMRA's threshold. During the 114th Congress, H.R. 50 and its Senate companion bill, S. 189, aimed to expand UMRA's coverage to include both direct and indirect costs for nonfederal entities. This would include foregone profits, costs passed onto consumers, and prospective costs of legislation changing federal financial assistance conditions. The bills also proposed making private-sector mandates subject to a substantive point of order and removing UMRA's exemption for rules issued by most independent agencies. During the 116th Congress, H.R. 300, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019, was introduced on January 8, 2019. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019, introduced on January 8, 2019, requires federal agencies to prepare written statements identifying costs and benefits of mandates exceeding $164 million before proposing rulemaking. This applies to both intergovernmental and private-sector mandates. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 establishes an order mechanism in Title I for declining legislation proposing unfunded intergovernmental mandates above a certain threshold. Federal agencies must prepare written assessments for regulations, including costs, benefits, budgetary effects, and impacts on small governments. Consultations with nonfederal government officials and evaluation of comments obtained during the promulgation process are also required. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 requires federal agencies to identify small governments, provide notice, and offer technical assistance. It also mandates the development of a process for elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments to provide input on regulatory proposals. Agencies must consider multiple regulatory alternatives and choose the least costly option that achieves the rule's objectives. The Office of Management and Budget collects cost estimate statements from executive branch agencies and establishes pilot programs. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 requires federal agencies to identify small governments, provide notice, offer technical assistance, and develop a process for input from elected officers of State, local, and tribal governments on regulatory proposals. OMB collects cost estimate statements and establishes pilot programs to test innovative regulatory approaches. OMB's director delegates responsibilities to OIRA for compliance reporting to Congress. Executive Order 12866 already required agencies to assess costs and benefits of proposed rules, identify alternatives, and issue cost-effective regulations. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 requires federal agencies to issue cost estimate statements for mandates that may result in significant expenditures by state and local governments or the private sector. Exemptions apply to rules issued by independent regulatory agencies and situations where agencies are prohibited by law from considering estimates. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 requires federal agencies to provide cost estimates for mandates that could lead to significant expenditures by state and local governments or the private sector. Exemptions include rules from independent regulatory agencies and cases where agencies are legally barred from considering cost estimates. About half of final rules in the Federal Register are published without a general notice of proposed rulemaking, some with impacts exceeding $100 million annually. The Act's threshold for federal mandates focuses on expenditures, unlike Title I which considers direct costs. This means a federal rule's estimated annual effect on direct costs may meet Title I's threshold but not Title II's. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 requires federal agencies to estimate costs for mandates leading to significant expenditures by state and local governments or the private sector. Title II focuses on expenditures for federal mandates, while Title I considers direct costs. Title II does not require agencies to address federal funding availability for private sector mandate costs. Agencies lack authority to provide such funding, which would require legislative action. The differences in coverage of Title I and Title II under the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 reflect a compromise with congressional Members. Senator John Glenn argued for a focused approach to control unfunded Federal mandates on State and local governments, without expanding regulatory reform provisions beyond intergovernmental mandates. The legislation should focus on controlling intergovernmental regulatory costs and not address broader regulatory reform issues. OMB reviewed 1,060 final rules from March 22, 1995, to FY2016, with most not meeting UMRA's definition of a mandate. CBO identified more private-sector mandates than intergovernmental mandates. Table 4 shows that most mandates identified in regulations target the private sector, aligning with business advocates' original concern. During the period analyzed, 280 major rules were considered mandates on the private sector, while 15 were mandates on state, local, and tribal governments. The 15 intergovernmental rules, including 9 from the EPA, covered various areas such as municipal waste combustors and emissions guidelines, with significant estimated costs. The EPA has implemented several regulations with significant estimated costs, including Standards for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills, Drinking Water Regulations for Disinfectants, Surface Water Treatment, Water Pollution Control Program, Arsenic Monitoring, and Enhanced Surface Water Treatment. The EPA has implemented regulations with significant estimated costs, including Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment, Stage 2 Disinfection Byproducts Rule, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. These regulations have annual costs ranging from $80 million to $9.6 billion. The DHHS implemented various programs and rules, including the School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Benefit and Payment Parameters for multiple years, and the U.S. Department of Labor's revised salary thresholds for determining overtime requirements. The combined administrative costs and user fees may constitute a government mandate under UMRA, with compliance costs estimated to be over $100 million annually. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed federal agencies' implementation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act's (UMRA) Title II in response to concerns raised by Senators Fred Thompson and John Glenn. GAO found that Title II had limited impact on agencies' rulemaking due to its restricted coverage, with many economically significant rules lacking cost estimate statements. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed 80 economically significant rules published between March 22, 1995, and March 22, 1997, under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). GAO found that 78 rules did not require a written mandate cost estimate statement due to various reasons, such as no associated notice of proposed rulemaking, no enforceable duty, or not meeting expenditure thresholds. GAO identified two rules that should have had a cost estimate statement filed at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) did not significantly impact federal agencies' rulemaking actions, as agencies were not required to take specific actions under UMRA if they deemed them duplicative or if accurate cost estimates were not feasible. Most agencies did not prepare separate UMRA cost estimate statements, as Executive Order 12866 already required agencies to provide cost and benefit assessments for economically significant rules to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). OMB's director acknowledged that UMRA's Title II had not led to major changes in federal agency rulemaking, with only 80 rules requiring a separate cost estimate statement. Agencies were criticized for limiting consultation processes and not considering alternative remedies, leading to a lack of impact on state, local, and tribal governments. In 2004, GAO released a study on UMRA's implementation, finding that a small number of statutes and rules contained federal mandates above UMRA's thresholds. GAO questioned whether UMRA's procedures adequately capture federal actions imposing financial burdens on nonfederal parties. In 2005, GAO received input on UMRA's strengths and weaknesses from participating parties and held a symposium on federal mandates. Comments on federal agency consultation with state and local governments were mixed, with some parties noting improvements in collaboration. OIRA's director testified at a Senate hearing about OMB including summaries of agency consultations in its reports. The OMB includes summaries of agency consultations with state and local government officials in its annual report to Congress, showing increased engagement. However, best practices are not consistent across the federal government. State and local government officials noted some improvement in federal agency consultation but described it as sporadic. Public interest groups advocate for a broader definition of mandates under UMRA to subject more rules to Title II. The debate revolves around the definition of \"mandate\" under UMRA and the coverage of Title II's information requirements for federally induced costs. One approach suggests applying Title II's requirements to various classes of federally induced costs determined by Congress. This would not impact agencies' authority to issue regulations or the substance of the regulations. UMRA's threshold for federal mandates is limited to expenditures, unlike Title I which refers to direct costs. H.R. 300, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019, aims to broaden UMRA's coverage to include both direct and indirect costs, such as foregone profits and costs passed onto consumers. State and local government advocacy groups argue that Title II should apply to rules issued by independent regulatory agencies. OMB has included information on independent regulatory agency rules in its UMRA report to Congress. H.R. 300 would remove UMRA's exemption for rules issued by independent regulatory agencies. H.R. 300 aims to broaden UMRA's coverage to include direct and indirect costs. Advocacy groups want Title II to apply to rules from independent regulatory agencies. NACO and other groups want OMB to enforce UMRA consistently. NCSL recommends creating an office in OMB for cost estimates. Business organizations, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, advocate for independent review of agency cost estimates and early judicial challenges for UMRA compliance. During the 112th Congress, H.R. 214 proposed creating a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis to oversee federal agency cost estimates for regulations with federal mandates. Various groups have argued that UMRA has successfully strengthened partnerships. Some social groups argue that broadening UMRA's coverage would dilute its impact, as exclusions and exemptions are essential for identifying meaningful mandates. Participants at a 2005 symposium emphasized the importance of retaining existing exclusions, such as those related to constitutional and statutory rights. They also suggested adding more exclusions to include federal mandates. The need for enhanced requirements for federal agency consultation with state and local government officials during the rulemaking process has been advocated by public interest groups. The NCSL recommends amending Title II to include these enhanced requirements, citing haphazard consultation practices. OMB asserts that federal agencies have been actively consulting with states, localities, and tribal governments to ensure regulatory activities comply with UMRA requirements. OMB has guidelines in place since 1995 to assist federal agencies in complying with UMRA. The guidelines suggest early intergovernmental consultations, estimating direct benefits and costs, and seeking state, local, and tribal views on compliance methods. Effective consultation requires trust and sustained attention for frank discussions on key priorities. OMB has guidelines in place since 1995 to assist federal agencies in complying with UMRA, including early intergovernmental consultations, estimating costs, and seeking state, local, and tribal views on compliance methods. OMB often includes summaries of consultation activities in its annual UMRA reports to Congress as evidence of compliance by federal agencies. For example, in the 2015 report, agencies like the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, and Labor provided examples of consultation activities with state, local, and tribal governments to enhance the regulatory environment. Federal agencies have worked to improve the regulatory environment by consulting with state, local, and tribal governments. Some agencies, like the National Archives and Records Administration, engage in consultations even if exempt from reporting requirements. Consultations involve multiple levels of government depending on the agency's understanding of the impact of its rules or policies. H.R. 300, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019, would require federal agencies to enhance consultation with UMRA stakeholders. UMRA's enactment in 1995 was considered a historic event in American intergovernmental relations, with President Bill Clinton emphasizing the need for balance and reliance on state and local initiatives. Since UMRA's enactment, various parties and researchers have been involved in its implementation. Policy research institutes, government agencies, and federalism scholars have differing views on the impact of UMRA on intergovernmental relations. State and local officials generally see UMRA as having a limited positive impact, advocating for its broadening to include grant conditions and federal agency rulemaking. During the 111th Congress, UMRA received increased attention as Congress considered proposals to reform health care. Governors opposed proposals requiring states to contribute to expanding Medicaid, citing potential state deficits. During the 111th Congress, UMRA received attention as Congress considered health care reform proposals. Governors opposed Medicaid expansion, fearing state deficits. CBO may apply UMRA provisions to changes in program conditions or funding reductions. H.R. 300, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019, would require CBO to assess costs of changes in program conditions. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 would expand UMRA's coverage to include indirect costs, broaden reporting requirements, make private-sector mandates subject to a point of order, and establish principles for federal agencies to assess the effects of regulations on state and local governments and the private sector. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 aims to expand UMRA's coverage to include indirect costs, broaden reporting requirements, and establish principles for federal agencies to assess the effects of regulations on state and local governments and the private sector. It also includes provisions for detailed cost statements, consultation with stakeholders, and compliance with regulatory principles. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 aims to expand UMRA's coverage to include indirect costs, broaden reporting requirements, establish principles for federal agencies to assess regulation effects on state and local governments and the private sector, and require retrospective analysis of existing regulations when requested. Advocates believe these reforms will enhance congressional deliberations and identify harmful mandates, while opponents argue they threaten health, safety, and environmental protections. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 aims to expand UMRA's coverage to include indirect costs, broaden reporting requirements, establish principles for federal agencies to assess regulation effects on state and local governments and the private sector, and require retrospective analysis of existing regulations when requested. Opponents argue that these reforms would give regulated industries an unfair advantage to water down consumer protections and slow down the regulatory process. Disagreements over UMRA's future stem from different values concerning American federalism, with one view emphasizing the importance of freeing state and local government officials from federal constraints to promote innovation and efficiency. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2019 aims to expand UMRA's coverage to include indirect costs, broaden reporting requirements, establish principles for federal agencies to assess regulation effects on state and local governments and the private sector, and require retrospective analysis of existing regulations when requested. One view emphasizes freeing state and local government officials from federal constraints to promote innovation and efficiency, while another view focuses on ensuring all citizens have minimum levels of essential government services despite disagreements over fundamental values. Debates over UMRA's future involve finding the right balance for American federalism in the 21st century. Unfunded mandates became a national issue in the 1980s, with lobbying efforts to limit them led by various government officials and business organizations. During the 1980s, state and local governments faced increasing costs from unfunded federal mandates, with 63 statutes imposing major restrictions or costs. This led to lobbying efforts to limit unfunded mandates. During the 1970s, several federal statutes were enacted that imposed costly mandates on state and local governments, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 and the Fair Labor Standards Act Amendments of 1974. A study by the Clinton Administration identified 172 laws in force imposing requirements on state and local governments as of December 1992. During the 1970s, federal mandates like the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 imposed significant costs on state and local governments. The Rehabilitation Act required spending $6.8 billion over 30 years to make public transit systems accessible to the physically disabled. In the 1980s, costly unfunded mandates included the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986, estimated to cost between $2 billion and $3 billion for improving public water systems. The expansion of federal intergovernmental mandates during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s fundamentally changed the nature of intergovernmental relations in the United States. ACIR estimated that new federal mandates adopted between 1983 and 1990 cost state and local governments between $8.9 billion and $12.7 billion. In FY1991, federal mandates imposed estimated costs of between $2.2 billion and $3.6 billion on state and local governments. Additional mandates, not included in these estimates, were scheduled to take effect in the years ahead. During the 1960s and 1970s, federal regulatory controls brought state and local governments under national oversight, shifting power from states to Washington. Edward I. Koch highlighted the issue of unfunded mandates in 1980, criticizing the burden on local governments. The growth of federal mandates in the 1980s and 1990s led to increased opposition from state and local government officials. This opposition culminated in the National Unfunded Mandates (NUM) Day initiative in 1993, where local government officials criticized unfunded mandates and released a study on the costs imposed by federal mandates. The National Unfunded Mandates (NUM) Day initiative in 1993 criticized unfunded mandates and estimated that federal mandates imposed additional costs of $6.5 billion annually for cities and $4.8 billion annually for counties. Despite challenges to the methodology, NUM Day was considered successful for raising media attention and congressional awareness on the issue. The National Unfunded Mandates (NUM) Day initiative in 1993 raised congressional awareness of state and local government concerns about unfunded mandates. State and local officials conveyed the need for Federal mandate reform and relief, highlighting four major objections to unfunded Federal mandates. State and local government officials lobbied Congress for mandate relief legislation and raised public awareness about their concerns regarding unfunded federal mandates. They held town hall meetings and a rally on Capitol steps to draw media attention to the issue. The NLC and state municipal leagues also declared a specific week in 1994 to address these concerns. During the 102nd and 103rd Congress, state and local government officials pushed for federal mandate relief bills, with limited success. S. 993, the Federal Mandate Accountability and Reform Act of 1994, was reported by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on June 16, 1994. The Federal Mandate Accountability and Reform Act of 1994, S. 993, was introduced on June 16, 1994, with provisions later included in UMRA. The bill faced amendments in the Senate, including one by Senator Byron Dorgan and a Glenn amendment allowing CBO to waive private-sector cost analysis. Despite debate and amendments, the Senate did not vote on the bill, and a similar bill, H.R. 5128, sponsored by Representative John Conyers Jr., faced delays in approval. The Republican Party gained control of the House of Representatives and Senate in 1994. Mandate reform was a key provision in their agenda, with the introduction of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. Congress adjourned before the bill could be considered due to concerns about its impact on environmental and social issues. On the opening day of the new Congress, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1) was introduced. The bill was discussed in joint hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Budget Committee, with amendments made and reported out of both committees on January 9, 1995. To expedite Senate floor consideration, committee chairs submitted chairman's statements instead of committee reports. Senator Robert Byrd raised objections to the handling of the legislation during Senate floor consideration on January 12, 1995. During Senate floor debate on the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Senator Kempthorne argued for the adoption of the bill to address the strain unfunded federal mandates put on state and local governments' resources. He emphasized the need for limits on the Federal Government's ability to impose costly mandates on other levels of government. The Federal Government's practice of imposing unfunded mandates on State and local governments has become an intolerable burden due to budget constraints. With the Federal deficit growing, there is no longer enough money to fund national solutions, leading to the imposition of unfunded mandates. State legislators and Governors are aware of this financial strain. Legislators and Governors are concerned about the practice of imposing unfunded mandates by the Federal Government. They believe that legislation should be in place before ratifying a balanced budget amendment to prevent shifting costs to State and local governments. S. 1 aims to maintain federalism by balancing the imposition of mandates and recognizing exceptions. Senator Frank Lautenberg supports this approach. Senator Frank Lautenberg opposes UMRA, arguing that the federal government should set national standards to protect the environment and quality of life. He is concerned about the chilling effect on future federal environmental legislation and the benefits that states derive from federal mandates. Lautenberg believes there is a broader national interest in certain issues that transcend state boundaries. As a democratic society, we should worry about States not providing satisfactory minimum decency standards for their citizens. Policies of one State can affect citizens of another, like unfunded mandates. Turning welfare over to States without Federal guidelines could lead to disadvantaged individuals moving between States, burdening those with more generous benefits. Differing standards across States in areas like occupational safety and environmental regulation could result in factories and jobs migrating to States with lower standards. By mandating floors in environmental and workplace conditions, the Federal Government ensures States comply with minimal standards for a complex society. Strong national gun control is necessary to prevent firearms from entering States with strict regulations. The Federal Government discourages States from lowering worker health and safety standards to attract industry, preventing a race to the bottom. The Senate approved S. 1 on January 27, 1995, 86-10, after voting on 44 amendments and several cloture motions. One of the approved amendments was the \"Byrd look-back amendment,\" allowing regulation of mandates based on actual costs. This provision in UMRA considers legislation with intergovernmental mandates as funded, not subject to a point of order. Mandates considered funded under UMRA if appropriations cover estimated costs and include mechanism for further review if funds are insufficient. Federal agency to notify committees if costs not covered, recommend less costly mandate or make it ineffective. Expedited procedures for legislative recommendations within 30 days. The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 includes a mechanism for further review if funds are insufficient, with expedited procedures for legislative recommendations within 30 days. Senator Robert Byrd's amendment was adopted by the Senate on January 26, 1995, and the House companion bill was H.R. 5. Amendments to add exemptions were rejected on party-line votes. The House and Senate versions of S. 1 had differences regarding the Byrd look-back amendment and judicial review of federal agency compliance. Negotiations lasted six weeks, with a compromise allowing judicial review of mandate costs analysis but limiting the court's ability to question cost estimates. The deadlock over the Byrd look-back amendment ended when House conferees accepted its inclusion to ensure Congress retained policy-setting responsibility. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 was adopted by the Senate on March 15, 1995, and by the House on March 16, 1995. President Bill Clinton signed it on March 22, 1995.
