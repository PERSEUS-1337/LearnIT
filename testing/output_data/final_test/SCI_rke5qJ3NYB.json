    "content": "Decision-rule GPs (DRGPs) are proposed as a modeling tool to learn user behavior in decision-making settings. They apply Gaussian processes in a transformed space defined by decision rules, making the models interpretable to practitioners. Structural variational inference techniques can be used with DRGPs, showing improved out-of-sample performance compared to direct GPs. Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to learn user models by transforming state information into actions. Target GPs (TGPs) place a prior on user models and capture non-Gaussian action distributions. Decision-rule GPs (DRGPs) apply GPs in a transformed space defined by decision rules, making the models interpretable to practitioners. In a transformed space defined by decision rules, GPs are used to model user behavior. The user model takes the form g : \u03a0 k P k \u00d7 S \u2192 A, where functions h k : S \u2192 P k map from S to transformed spaces P k. This approach, known as decision-rule GPs (DRGPs), provides immediate interpretability to practitioners. To illustrate DRGPs, a real application involving a firm selling ethanol storage capacity is considered. Each user's contract specifies the maximum amount of ethanol that can be stored, influencing their behavior in injecting and withdrawing ethanol. The study focuses on using Decision Rule Gaussian Processes (DRGPs) to model user behavior in ethanol storage. DRGPs leverage threshold functions learned as GPs for injection and withdrawal decisions, instead of modeling inventory directly. The research questions address the use of Bayesian inference techniques with DRGP and compare its performance to Traditional Gaussian Processes (TGP) through numerical experiments. The study explores using Decision Rule Gaussian Processes (DRGPs) to model ethanol storage behavior, comparing its performance to Traditional Gaussian Processes (TGP) through numerical experiments. Sparse variational inference is applied to both models, showing that DRGP leads to lower out-of-sample error and is more interpretable to practitioners. This suggests that using GPs in the interpretable space of decision rule threshold functions has potential value in machine learning and optimization. The improvements in using Decision Rule Gaussian Processes (DRGPs) are highlighted, showing potential enhancements in predictive performance compared to Traditional Gaussian Processes (TGP). DRGPs involve non-invertible transformations of multiple GPs, offering interpretability in various domains like energy, health care, and transportation. Warped GPs, as discussed by Snelson et al. (2004) and L\u00e1zaro-Gredilla (2012), also play a role in enhancing predictive capabilities through non-linear transformations. Recent work has focused on balancing the modeling generality of chained GPs with the challenging inference procedure. For example, Tobar and Rios (2019) extend a warped GP using simple function compositions for closed form inference. DRGP, similar to chained GPs, involves a nonlinear transformation of multiple GPs for decision rules, with each function being interpretable and simplifying inference. In an energy storage application, functions h1 and h2 represent injection and withdrawal thresholds, respectively. The inventory update model for each user includes a transition function, exogenous variables like commodity price, and Gaussian noise. Historical data allows inference on user-specific transition functions. In an energy storage application, injection and withdrawal decisions are made using a two-threshold decision rule structure. This structure is based on findings from prior literature and involves threshold functions for user behavior. The model incorporates exogenous variables and historical data to infer user-specific transition functions. The study defines DRGP as user behavior based on threshold functions for injection and withdrawal decisions in energy storage. Data from a US ethanol storage operator is used to create datasets with varying injection and withdrawal patterns. The dataset includes information on exogenous state vector X n,t, lease capacity, spot and futures prices for ethanol, corn, and natural gas. Users can inject, withdraw, or do nothing, with inventory levels reaching thresholds f 1 or f 2. Functions f 1 and f 2 are learned based on user actions to avoid handling partial observability during inference. The dataset includes information on exogenous state vector X n,t, lease capacity, spot and futures prices for ethanol, corn, and natural gas. Users can inject, withdraw, or do nothing, with inventory levels reaching thresholds f 1 or f 2. To address the issue of ordering in the DRGP model, a classifier is trained to predict user decisions and determine inventory levels. Posteriors on f 1 and f 2 are computed using sparse GP variational inference with 10 inducing points and an Automatic Relevance Determination kernel. Transfer learning can be applied to TGP and DRGP models by assuming a common component across users and a user-specific latent variable, labeled as TGP-TL and DRGP-TL. In the first experiment, the performance of DRGP is compared to TGP by partitioning the data into training and validation sets. Posteriors for each user are obtained and used to predict inventory levels. The RMSE of DRGP is smaller than TGP across all datasets when dataset size T is 200, and this trend continues as T increases to 400. Overall, DRGP achieves lower RMSE than TGP in most cases, providing interpretability. Transfer learning's value is explored, showing mixed results due to the absence of a common user behavioral pattern in the datasets. DRGP-TL can predict out-of-sample log-inventory levels with higher accuracy and lower uncertainty compared to other models. The study shows promise in using decision rules to define non-linear transformations of GPs for user modeling in ethanol storage. Developing inference procedures tailored to DRGP and exploring the interplay between decision rule structures and interpretability are valuable research directions. Additionally, robust inference techniques for DRGP are being investigated. The ethanol application dataset includes daily inventory levels of a storage tank and ethanol prices over two years. Weekly inventory levels are used to model user behavior, with 39 companies grouped into four user types based on contract sizes. Aggregate inventory levels are broken down into four user levels using three heuristics to test user modeling approaches. The dataset includes user modeling with low, medium, and high variance of injection-withdrawal patterns. The first dataset simulates low variability, the second medium variability, and the third high volatility. Sparse GP is used for scalability in TGP and DRGP. Transfer Learning in Sparse Gaussian Process for Scalability: TGP and DRGP utilize variational sparse Gaussian process based inference with inducing point methods to approximate the posterior GP. TGP-TL modifies TGP by incorporating user-specific latent variables and a common target function for inventory updates. Transfer Learning in Sparse Gaussian Process for Scalability: TGP and DRGP use variational sparse Gaussian process inference with inducing point methods to approximate the posterior GP. TGP-TL extends TGP by incorporating user-specific latent variables and a common target function for inventory updates. The inference procedure for transfer learning extensions involves handling the joint distribution with respect to the latent variables and common functions. In TGP-TL, the variational approximation assumes independence between q(f) and q(\u0393). The evidence lower bound (ELBO) maximization is used to optimize model hyper-parameters and variational parameters."
