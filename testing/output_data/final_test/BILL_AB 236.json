The Legislature clarifies that licensed pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers are not weighmasters, following a previous administrative interpretation. Retailers weighing commodities for sale in retail stores are exempt from weighmaster regulations.

Common carriers recording weights for transportation charges and licensed milk samplers and weighers are also exempt. (e) Persons measuring oil, gas, or fuels for royalty computation, newspaper publishers weighing newspapers for sale, textile maintenance establishments measuring articles, and county sanitation districts, garbage disposal districts, and solid waste facilities are exempt from weighmaster regulations. Facilities handling medical waste must report net weights to the Department of Public Health. Persons in nonprofit recycling programs or certified recycling centers can purchase scrap metal or salvage materials. Pest control operators licensed under specific codes are also exempt from weighmaster regulations. Retailers or recycling centers redeeming empty beverage containers must weigh, measure, or count salvage materials directly from the seller. Retailers derive 90% of income from selling food or nonfood items to consumers. Log scalers performing log scaling functions are exempt from weighmaster regulations. Salvage materials include used paper products and containers made of aluminum, tin, glass, or plastic. Pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers are exempt from weighmaster regulations when they report property acquisitions as required by specific financial codes. This exemption is effective until January 1, 2017, unless extended by a later statute. Persons exempt from weighmaster regulations include retailers selling directly to consumers, agricultural producers weighing their own commodities without charge or documentation, and common carriers recording weights for transportation charges. Exempt individuals from weighmaster regulations include milk samplers, oil/gas measurers, newspaper publishers, and textile maintenance establishments.

Retailers are defined as entities deriving 90% or more of their income from selling small quantities of food or nonfood items directly to consumers. Salvage materials include used paper products and containers made of aluminum, tin, glass, or plastic. Log scalers performing log scaling functions, except weighing, are also exempt. Pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers licensed under specific sections of the Financial Code are required to report property acquisitions. This section of the Business and Professions Code will be effective from January 1, 2017. Recyclers and junk dealers must provide accurate information when applying for or renewing a license. Applicants for a license must provide their current business license, indicate their status regarding a stormwater permit, confirm equipment for nonferrous materials transactions, request theft alert notifications, and list any deputy weighmasters. The department issues licenses to junk dealers or recyclers upon receiving a complete application and fee. A thorough investigation of the application is conducted within 90 days for new licenses and within one year for renewals. If the department finds inaccuracies in the information provided by a junk dealer or recycler, their license will be revoked unless they correct the errors within 14 days. Revoked licenses can be appealed through a hearing process. The secretary can collaborate with county sealers to enforce these regulations. The section does not apply to licensed pawnbrokers or secondhand dealers. It will be repealed on January 1, 2019 unless extended by a later statute."
