    "content": "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a federal block grant program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that provides annual grants to states, territories, and tribal organizations to assist needy households with heating and cooling costs, crisis assistance, weatherization expenses, and other aid. LIHEAP was established in 1981 and has been reauthorized and amended multiple times, with annual funds authorized at $5.1 billion per year from FY2005 through FY2007. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides assistance to needy households with heating and cooling costs, crisis assistance, and weatherization expenses. Households with incomes up to 150% of the federal poverty income guidelines are eligible for LIHEAP benefits. LIHEAP funding includes regular funds allocated to states based on a statutory formula and emergency contingency funds last appropriated in FY2011. The LIHEAP funds, last appropriated in FY2011, can be released to states by the President and the Secretary of HHS as needed for home energy assistance in emergencies. The distribution of regular LIHEAP funds to states is based on a statutory formula enacted in 1984. Tribes receive funds through state allocations, while territories have a separate set-aside of funds. The LIHEAP formula was changed in 1984 under P.L. 98-558, replacing the LIEAP formula. The new formula did not prioritize home heating needs as much and required HHS to use the most recent data for allotments. The \"old\" LIHEAP formula distributed funds similarly to LIEAP. For more details on the history of energy assistance formulas, refer to Appendix D. The LIEAP formula, later adopted by LIHEAP, determined state allocations based on residential energy expenditures, heating degree days, and household income. Each state had a static percentage of funds that did not change yearly. Minnesota received about 4.0% and Florida received nearly 1.4% of total LIHEAP funds under the old formula. The \"new\" LIHEAP formula distributes funds based on low-income household expenditures on home energy in each state, calculated annually by HHS. Each state's share is determined by the ratio of its low-income household energy expenditures to the national total. For example, in FY2019, Minnesota's share under the new formula was determined. In FY2019, Minnesota and Florida's share of funds under the \"new\" LIHEAP formula was 1.9% and 4.4% respectively. The implementation of the new formula resulted in some states receiving less funding while others received more. Congress included \"hold harmless\" provisions to prevent dramatic drops in funding for states that saw decreases. In the 25 years after the \"new\" LIHEAP formula was enacted, Congress did not appropriate sufficient funds to require its use. Appropriations must exceed $2 billion for the \"new\" formula percentages to be used. Since FY2009, appropriations have ranged from $3.3 billion to $4.5 billion, but the \"new\" formula has not been fully implemented as directed by Congress. The LIHEAP program has directed that funds be distributed using both the \"new\" and \"old\" formulas. In FY2019, $716 million was distributed according to the \"new\" formula, with the remainder using the \"old\" formula. The next section of the report provides more detail on how the \"new\" formula operates, while the LIHEAP statutory formula offers three methods to calculate state allotments based on the appropriation size. The state allotments for the LIHEAP program depend on the appropriation size. If the appropriation is below $1.975 billion, the \"old\" formula percentages apply. If it exceeds $1.975 billion, the \"new\" formula percentages are used, which consider heating and cooling costs of low-income households. Appropriations below $2.25 billion use the new formula percentages with a hold-harmless level, while those equal to or above $2.25 billion also include a hold-harmless rate increase. The LIHEAP formula allocates funds to states based on home energy expenditures of low-income households, considering heating and cooling needs, energy sources, prices, and population. The \"new\" formula uses recent data and includes hold-harmless provisions for certain states. The LIHEAP formula allocates funds to states based on home energy expenditures of low-income households using the most recent data available. The process involves calculating total residential energy consumption and considering temperature variation to determine formula rates. The LIHEAP formula allocates funds to states based on home energy expenditures of low-income households using the most recent data available. To determine formula rates, the amount of energy consumed for each fuel source is adjusted by temperature variation in each state using heating and cooling degree day data. Heating degree days measure temperatures below 65\u00b0F, while cooling degree days measure temperatures above 65\u00b0F. This adjustment accounts for abnormal weather conditions that may affect energy usage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration collects data on energy usage, including heating and cooling degree day data. The EIA estimates fuel consumption specifically for heating and cooling using end-use estimation methodology. HHS adjusts these estimates using heating and cooling degree day data. The EIA estimates heating and cooling consumption using degree day data. Low-income household consumption is calculated based on Census data and adjusted using 2009 RECS data. Total spending on heating and cooling for low-income households is determined by the amount of Btus used. The total spending on heating and cooling by low-income households is calculated by multiplying the estimated Btus used with the average fuel price for each fuel source. Regional energy price variations are considered, and the data is collected by the EIA for each state. The expenditure data is then used to estimate the proportion spent by low-income households on heating and cooling in each state compared to all states, resulting in a new formula percentage. The new formula percentages calculated by HHS in 2019 are used to allocate LIHEAP funds to states if the annual appropriation exceeds $1.975 billion. These percentages are not the exact amount each state will receive, as ultimate allotments are determined by hold-harmless levels and rates. The new percentages serve as the starting point for fund allocation. The LIHEAP \"new\" formula percentages calculated by HHS do not directly determine state allotments. States may have their funds adjusted based on hold-harmless provisions, leading to some states losing funds while others gain. The application of these provisions depends on the appropriation level for the fiscal year, with no explicit trigger for the \"new\" formula rates specified in the LIHEAP statute. States must receive no less than the amount they would have received in fiscal year 1984. The FY1984 LIHEAP appropriation was $2.075 billion, not the hypothetical $1.975 billion stated in the LIHEAP statute. States receive funds based on a percentage of the hypothetical $1.975 billion appropriation level. Additional funds for training and technical assistance (TTA) and leveraging have been added to the regular fund distribution since FY1984. In FY1984, the LIHEAP appropriation was $2.075 billion, not the hypothetical $1.975 billion stated in the LIHEAP statute. States receive funds based on a percentage of the hypothetical $1.975 billion appropriation level. Additional funds for training and technical assistance (TTA) and leveraging have been added to the regular fund distribution since FY1984. For example, in FY2019, Congress appropriated $2.988 million for TTA and no funding for LI/REACH, so the equivalent of an FY1984 appropriation of $1.975 billion is approximately $1.978 billion. The LIHEAP formula in FY1984 distributed funds by giving states the same percentage of funds that they received in FY1981 under the predecessor program, the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP). In FY1984, states received funds based on a percentage of a hypothetical $1.975 billion appropriation level. If the regular LIHEAP appropriation exceeds this amount, a different distribution methodology is used. A hold-harmless level ensures that certain states do not receive less than they would have at the $1.975 billion level. Table 1 indicates which states benefit from this hold-harmless provision. In FY1984, states received funds based on a percentage of a hypothetical $1.975 billion appropriation level. A hold-harmless provision ensures that certain states do not receive less than they would have at this level. States benefiting from the hold-harmless provision are indicated in Table 1, with details on the dollar amounts received. For example, Colorado receives $31.613 million under the hold-harmless level, which exceeds its new percentage share of total funds. As appropriations increase, hold-harmless states will transition to receiving their new percentage of funds. Colorado's new percentage share of total funds exceeds $31.613 million when appropriations reach $2.25 billion. States with the greatest proportional gains may have their allotments reduced to hold harmless others. This ensures that states do not see reduced benefits despite the new formula percentages. The LIHEAP statute stipulates additional requirements for distributing funds when the appropriation is at or above $2.25 billion. At this level, a new hold-harmless rate is applied, ensuring that states that would have received less than 1% of the total appropriation are allocated the percentage they deserve. The new hold-harmless rate ensures that states receiving less than 1% of the total appropriation at $2.25 billion will get their deserved percentage. This allocation method guarantees a state-specific share of funds, with adjustments made to states with the greatest gains until there is no funding shortfall. States benefiting from the hold-harmless rate are marked with a \"Y\" in column (e) of Table 1, showing the proportion of funds they receive. The hold-harmless rate ensures states receive their deserved percentage of funds at $2.25 billion. Idaho benefits from this rate, receiving 0.580% of the total appropriation. Allocation rates show discrepancies, with some states seeing funding decrease at $2.25 billion compared to $2.249 billion. Estimated allotments at various appropriations levels are detailed in Table A-1. Regular LIHEAP funds exceeded $1.975 billion in 1985 and 1986, with consistent percentages from FY1987 to FY2005. In FY2006, the LIHEAP program started using a new formula for distributing funds, which continued in FY2008 due to an oversight. In FY2009, $4.51 billion in regular funds were appropriated, with $840 million distributed according to the new formula. In FY2009, $840 million was distributed according to the \"new\" LIHEAP formula, with the remaining $3.67 billion distributed based on the percentages of the \"old\" formula. Congress has continued to appropriate funds using a split between the \"old\" and \"new\" formulas from FY2010 to present. See Table C-1 in Appendix C for fund distribution from FY2009 to FY2019. Appendix A shows estimated state allocations at various hypothetical appropriations levels. The curr_chunk discusses estimated allotments for the LIHEAP program at various appropriations levels ranging from $2.14 billion to $5.1 billion. It also illustrates how state allotments depend on appropriation levels through graphical representation. The estimates assume 0.5% set aside for territories, as done by HHS since FY2014. The curr_chunk explains the three types of states in terms of hold-harmless provisions and appropriation levels. It details how states with \"new\" formula percentages lower than their \"old\" formula percentages are subject to only the hold-harmless level provision. The hold-harmless level remains fixed despite increases in appropriations. The curr_chunk explains the three types of states based on hold-harmless provisions and appropriation levels. States with higher new formula percentages than old ones are subject to a ratable reduction. States with lower new formula percentages are subject to hold-harmless provisions. Hold-harmless levels remain fixed despite increases in appropriations. The hold-harmless level is determined by the fixed state allotment, with a subtle jump at $2.25 billion indicating the state is subject to the hold-harmless rate provision. States with a \"Y\" in columns (c) and (e) of Table 1 are affected. Congress has directed a portion of LIHEAP funds to be distributed using the new formula, ranging from 14% to 20% of regular funds appropriated. The LIHEAP regular fund allocations to states have ranged from 14% to nearly 20% of total funds appropriated. Funds for territories, training, and leveraging grants are subtracted before distribution to states via formula. Congress directed $716 million to be distributed via the \"new\" LIHEAP formula in FY2019. Total funding distributed to states via formula is shown in Table C-1 for each year. In the mid- to late-1970s, federal energy assistance funding for low-income households began with the Emergency Energy Conservation Program (EECP). Administered by the Community Services Administration, this program aimed to assist families with energy conservation primarily through home weatherization. The Community Services Administration (CSA) provided funds for energy assistance programs focusing on heating needs, starting in 1977. This led to the creation of the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) in 1980, which prioritized heating assistance for low-income families. The predecessor programs to LIHEAP, such as the Emergency Energy Conservation Program (EECP) administered by the Community Services Administration (CSA), aimed to assist low-income individuals and families with energy conservation programs to reduce energy consumption and lessen the impact of high energy costs. President Ford signed the Headstart, Economic Opportunity, and Community Partnership Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-644) to establish the EECP in 1975. The EECP aimed to assist low-income individuals with energy conservation programs to reduce energy consumption and lessen the impact of high energy costs. Eligible activities included weatherization assistance, loans for energy conservation technologies, and fuel voucher programs. The majority of funds were used for weatherization expenses, distributed to states based on heating costs. The EECP formula allocated funds based on heating degree days, favoring cold-weather states with higher heating needs. The formula squared the population-weighted heating degree days and multiplied by the number of households in poverty that owned their homes. The CSA noted the emphasis on heating needs in the allocation, stating it heavily favored the coldest areas. In FY1976 through FY1978, the CSA allocated funds to states based on heating degree days, favoring cold-weather states. In FY1977, Congress appropriated $200 million for direct assistance to low-income households to pay energy costs. States could make payments to fuel providers for families in need. The CSA directed states to target households in dire financial need due to large energy bills, with funds allocated based on heating need factors. Congress appropriated $200 million for crisis intervention in FY1978 and FY1979, assisting households facing energy-related emergencies. In FY1979 and FY1980, Congress allocated funds for energy assistance programs to help families with increased energy costs and winter-related emergencies. $1.6 billion was appropriated in FY1980, with $400 million for the Energy Crisis Assistance Program (ECAP) and $1.2 billion for cash assistance and crisis intervention through HEW. $400 million of the $1.2 billion was designated for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. The $1.6 billion allocated by Congress in FY1980 for energy assistance programs included $400 million for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. The remaining funds were distributed to states based on factors like heating degree days, poverty levels, and energy expenditure differences. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) replaced previous programs in April 1980 under the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act of 1980. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) was introduced in 1980 under the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act to help low-income households pay their home energy costs, prioritizing heating needs over cooling needs. The program's funding distribution formula remains relevant, serving as a benchmark for LIHEAP fund distribution and state funding allocations. The LIEAP formula, developed under P.L. 96-223, prioritized areas with high home heating costs. Congress distributed LIHEAP funds using this formula, established through two laws: P.L. 96-223 and P.L. 96-369. The LIEAP formula, established under P.L. 96-223, prioritized high home heating costs. The formula arose from a Senate compromise over three proposals, with debate focusing on heating emphasis and energy expenditures. Senator Edmund Muskie supported northern states' heating needs, leading to a contentious debate on the Senate floor. The final compromise formula in P.L. 96-223 allowed states to receive funds based on four different alternatives measuring home energy need. The LIEAP formula, established under P.L. 96-223, prioritized high home heating costs. It allowed states to receive funds based on four different alternatives measuring home energy need, depending on factors like residential energy expenditures, heating degree days, and the number of low-income households in the state. The options varied in the percentage allocation based on these factors. The LIEAP formula under P.L. 96-223 prioritized high home heating costs and allowed states to receive funds based on four different alternatives. One option guaranteed a minimum benefit of $120 for households receiving AFDC, SSI, or Food Stamp benefits. Funds were not appropriated for cooling costs in FY1981, despite the authorization of $3 billion for LIEAP. Congress introduced an alternative method for computing state distribution rates before the formula in P.L. 96-223 could be used. The alternative method for computing state distribution rates was introduced by Congress in a continuing resolution (P.L. 96-369) in October 1980, allocating $1.85 billion in LIEAP funds for FY1981. The new allocation method was detailed in a House Appropriations Committee report (H. Rept. 96-1244) accompanying the FY1981 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Act. It aimed to counter the formula in P.L. 96-223, which some argued favored warmer weather states. The first step in the new formulas was to determine each state's share of funds using calculations set out in H. Rept. 96-1244. The distribution of funds to states was determined using two calculations outlined in H. Rept. 96-1244. The first formula allocated funds based on home heating expenditures and heating degree days squared times the population with income below 125% of poverty. The second formula allocated funds based on total residential energy expenditures and heating degree days squared multiplied by the number of low-income households. The greater of the two percentages calculated using the formula in H. Rept. 96-1244 was assigned to each state after adjusting allotments proportionately. The amended formula compared state allotments to 75% of the amount each state would receive under P.L. 96-223. The original formulas in P.L. 96-223 were more favorable to warm-weather states, providing a minimum benefit based on the number of low-income households. Enactment of LIHEAP in August 1981 under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, P.L. 97-35, replaced its predecessor LIEAP with less restrictive federal rules and more state flexibility. The program was authorized at $1.85 billion for FY1982-FY1984, with increased appropriations each year. The continued use of the LIEAP formula from 1980 benefitted Northeastern states with rising heating oil prices. The LIEAP formula was created in 1980 under the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act, leading to debates in the Senate. The formula provisions were added to legislation, and discussions continued up to the enactment of P.L. 96-369 in 1981. Despite disagreements over formula allocations, the enactment of LIHEAP in 1981 did not result in a different formula. States continued to receive the same percentage of funds as under the LIEAP formula from FY1982 through FY1984. In 1983, debates arose over the LIHEAP formula, focusing on its bias towards cold-weather states and outdated data used for calculations. Legislative sentiment favored changing the formula, leading to discussions in Congress. In 1983, the House considered an amendment to the Emergency Immigration Education Act (H.R. 3520) that would adjust the LIHEAP formula, impacting state allocations based on energy expenditures of poor families. The amendment, sponsored by Representative Carlos Moorhead, was eventually dropped from the bill in conference with the Senate. Efforts to reauthorize LIHEAP began with the introduction of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Amendments of 1984 (H.R. 2439) in April 1983. The Energy and Commerce committee subcommittees worked together to change the LIHEAP formula in H.R. 2439, shifting funds from Northeastern states to the South and West due to rising natural gas prices. The LIHEAP formula in H.R. 2439 was changed to benefit states in the South and Midwest, taking into account population growth and higher poverty rates. A hold-harmless provision was included to ensure states would not receive less funding than under the old formula. The bill also increased LIHEAP authorization levels for FY1984 to FY1988. The Senate passed its version of LIHEAP reauthorization as part of the Human Services Reauthorization Act (S. 2565) on October 4, 1984. The bill specified changes to the formula, including basing states' shares of LIHEAP funds on the home energy expenditures of low-income households. Hold-harmless provisions were altered to ensure no state would receive less funding than in previous years. The Senate bill, known as S. 2565, included a hold-harmless rate provision to protect small states' shares of LIHEAP funds. This provision ensured that certain states would receive increased allotments when appropriations reached $2.25 billion, with the goal of preventing small state allotments from declining even as total appropriations increased. The Senate bill, S. 2565, included a hold-harmless rate provision to protect small states' shares of LIHEAP funds, with different authorization amounts for FY1985 and FY1986. The bill, P.L. 98-558, the Human Services Reauthorization Act, was passed on October 30, 1984."
