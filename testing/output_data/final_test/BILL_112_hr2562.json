The Act defines \"burned area emergency response\" as the process to plan and implement emergency actions on Federal land post-fire to minimize threats and prevent degradation. It also defines \"Community Protection Management Area\" as areas in community wildfire protection plans and human development areas of special significance. The term \"community wildfire protection plan\" is defined as per the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003. The term \"hazard tree and commercial timber evaluation\" refers to assessing hazard trees and timber resources in the Wallow Fire Area on National Forest System land. The Wallow Fire Area terms include definitions for Indian tribe, National Forest System, Secretary, timber removal project, and the Wallow Fire itself. The Wallow Fire Area refers to the 538,000-acre fire perimeter in Arizona and New Mexico that started in the Bear Wallow Wilderness on May 29, 2011. SEC. 4. HAZARD TREE AND COMMERCIAL TIMBER EVALUATION. The Secretary must evaluate hazard trees and commercial timber in the Wallow Fire Area within 30 days after the emergency response or 45 days after containment. The evaluation report must describe forest conditions and risks to users, communities, and resources. The evaluation report must include maps of potential hazard tree removal areas, fire-damaged commercial tree removal areas, and areas not suitable for harvest. It should also contain a map of burn intensity, a preliminary assessment of anticipated receipts and costs associated with timber removal, and potential lost receipts if timely action is not taken.
