NRO designs and operates reconnaissance satellites, staffed by DOD and CIA personnel. NSA develops codes for U.S. communication security and collects foreign signals for policymakers and operational forces. The NGA, established in 1996 as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), provides geospatial intelligence to DOD users and national security officials. It analyzes foreign signals to support policymakers and operational forces, along with the NRO and NSA, which also collect intelligence for agencies outside DOD. The NGA, established in 1996, provides geospatial intelligence to DOD users and national security officials. National intelligence supports decision-makers with different needs than military consumers, focusing on broader security implications. Arms control agreements in the 1960s were based on satellite imagery, aiding U.S. policymakers. The U.S. and the Soviet Union relied on satellite imagery for military estimates. National systems now monitor WMD transfers, ethnic cleansing, and narcotics traffic. Priorities for coverage are determined by inter-agency committees under the DCI's guidance. NSA, NRO, and NGA receive funding for their efforts. The NSA, NRO, and NGA receive funding as part of the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP). The DCI has authority to transfer funds and personnel among NFIP programs with approval. The DNI is responsible for developing and determining the NIP budget and managing appropriations. The DNI has authority to manage appropriations, reprogram funds under certain conditions, and transfer intelligence personnel between agencies. Defense agencies support military forces and the Secretary of Defense is responsible for national intelligence agencies in DOD. Agencies must participate in joint training exercises and establish uniform reporting systems. The Defense Department emphasizes the importance of intelligence in supporting national security, as outlined in Joint Vision 2020. The global information grid will enable the integration of information operations and all-source intelligence to provide timely information to warfighters and policymakers. National intelligence is crucial for DOD's planning and operations, integrated into combat since the Persian Gulf War. Space-based signals intelligence was responsive in Operation Iraqi Freedom. NSA teams and Air Force units deployed to assist tactical commanders. The distinction between strategic and tactical ISR systems has blurred as military requirements evolved. The focus on national intelligence support for military operations has increased, leading to concerns about reduced support for national-level policymakers. This shift was driven by the need for precise data for targeting precision-guided munitions, with senior DOD officials emphasizing the importance of this information. The Intelligence Community failed to provide advance notice of the Indian nuclear test in May 1998. In 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld sought to establish the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, which was confirmed in March 2003 with the appointment of Stephen A. Cambone. His responsibilities include coordinating DOD intelligence efforts. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for coordinating DOD intelligence efforts and overseeing various intelligence agencies. This includes ensuring that national intelligence programs are aligned and not duplicative, supporting both national policymakers and military commanders. After the 9/11 attacks, it was found that the Intelligence Community's organization and management were inadequate, hindering the sharing of crucial information. The DCI lacked authority over intelligence community elements within the Department of Defense, limiting his control and insight into their activities. Congress tried to enhance oversight. The DCI's authority was limited despite attempts to strengthen it in 1996. The Joint Inquiry found that the DCI struggled to establish a comprehensive intelligence effort against Al Qaeda, even after the 1998 embassy bombings. The DCI prioritized Bin Ladin's network but faced challenges in resource allocation. In 1998, the Intelligence Community was at war with Bin Ladin, but there was a lack of comprehensive strategy and fragmented efforts. The DCI struggled to enforce consistent priorities and marshal resources across the Community. The Joint Inquiry recommended the need for a single senior official with the title Director of National Intelligence. The Joint Inquiry recommended the creation of a statutory Director of National Intelligence with management, budgetary, and personnel responsibilities to oversee the entire U.S. Intelligence Community, including NSA, NRO, NGA, and CIA. This official would establish consistent priorities for intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination, as well as review and manage Intelligence Community budgets. The 9/11 Commission recommended the establishment of a National Intelligence Director to manage and oversee the Intelligence Community budgets, submit a unified budget reflecting NSC priorities, allocate funds to agencies, reprogram funds for new priorities, and nominate leaders for various intelligence agencies. President Bush announced plans to establish a National Intelligence Director to oversee and coordinate intelligence activities, with the CIA managed separately. The proposed changes aimed to enhance the coordination and management of the Intelligence Community. The Administration plan did not give the NID control over agency budgets or sole authority to nominate agency heads. Two bills, H.R. 10 and S. 2845, aimed at intelligence reorganization were passed by the Senate and House with differences in budgetary authority. The Conference Committee faced challenges in reaching agreement on the language adopted by both chambers. The Conference Committee faced challenges in reaching agreement on intelligence reorganization. The 9/11 Commission criticized NSA's handling of surveillance and missed opportunities. The 9/11 Commission's list of missed opportunities for stopping the plot does not blame NSA or DOD agencies. Criticisms of establishing a DNI/NID focused on concerns about undermining the Secretary of Defense's authority over agencies closely integrated into military operations. Former DCI Robert Gates highlighted that over 80% of foreign intelligence funds are controlled by the Secretary of Defense, with agencies performing combat tasks for the military in addition to their intelligence roles. For the past decade, intelligence authority has been shifting from the CIA to the Pentagon. Bruce Berkowitz, a DOD consultant, emphasizes the importance of intelligence organizations within the Defense Department for combat operations, especially in providing electronic data to battlefield units for network-style warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. The shift of intelligence authority from the CIA to the Pentagon has been ongoing for the past decade. There are concerns about creating a new mega-organization separate from the Defense Department, as it could impact military effectiveness and operations. USD(I) Cambone testified in April 2004 about the close relationship between intelligence and operations within the Defense Department. Cambone testified about the growing closeness between intelligence and operations within the Defense Department, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the existing relationship to prevent negative impacts on the intelligence community. The Intelligence Community is concerned about potential negative impacts on military intelligence integration within the Defense Community. General Richard Myers emphasized the importance of maintaining clear lines of authority for DOD intelligence elements to support the warfighter. The appropriations for the National Intelligence Director need to be passed through the Defense Department to combat support agencies. Legislation is being considered to establish a DNI/NID with authority over all intelligence agencies. The failure to prevent the 9/11 attacks was attributed to communication barriers between foreign intelligence agencies and law enforcement. After 9/11, Congress adjusted barriers through the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and other legislation to authorize sharing of law enforcement and foreign intelligence information. The Homeland Security Act provided for the Intelligence Analysis and Infrastructure Protection component of DHS to receive and analyze foreign intelligence and law enforcement information related to terrorist threats. The Bush Administration established the Terrorist Threat Integration Center to perform integrative analytical functions, potentially lowering the \"wall\" between intelligence agencies. Such initiatives have torn down the \"wall\" between foreign intelligence and law enforcement, potentially enhancing the powers of a proposed DNI/NID. Ongoing technological innovations are also removing long-established barriers, such as stovepiping, which hinders the timely processing and analysis of intelligence data. The Defense Department has been utilizing new technologies to provide intelligence support to its forces, with real-time intelligence being crucial for precision munitions targeting specific targets while minimizing casualties. Defense intelligence agencies are enhancing their capabilities to collect comprehensive data. Defense intelligence agencies are improving data collection capabilities for instant transmission and storage, with processing and analysis done in the U.S. Observers suggest focusing on common security standards rather than revising complex statutes like Executive Order 12333. The 20-year-old Executive Order 12333 needs revision to improve intelligence reform by allowing for faster and more effective collaboration among intelligence agencies. DIA Director Jacoby emphasizes the importance of analysts having ownership of information and advocates for adopting industry standards for data storage to enhance interoperability. Interoperability at the data level is crucial for transformed intelligence environments, enabling integration of information from all sources. Technology advancements allow for rapid dissemination of operational data, promoting wider information sharing despite remaining obstacles. The Senate Intelligence Community highlighted NSA's need for improvement in 2003. The Senate Intelligence Community warned in 2003 about obstacles to information sharing within the Intelligence Community, emphasizing the need for a significant revision of current practices. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2004 established a pilot program to assess the feasibility of analysts accessing and analyzing intelligence from different databases. The 9/11 Commission recommended accelerating the process of allowing analysts in CIA and DIA to access sigint from NSA databases. It also urged the President to lead a government-wide effort to modernize national security institutions. Provisions in P.L. 108-458 directed the DNI to establish uniform security standards and resolve conflicts in sharing intelligence. The role of the NID/DNI in resolving conflicts between sharing intelligence and protecting sources received attention during intelligence reform legislation discussions in 2004. The Senate sought to give the NID more authority over major intelligence agencies, but the final bill aimed to create a stronger NID/DNI than the House bill. The conference had difficulty reaching agreement on this issue, with media accounts lacking precise details. The conference version of S. 2845 was passed by the House and Senate in December 2004, and approved by President Bush. The bill gives the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) authority over annual budgets for intelligence agencies, aiming to improve coordination and efficiency. The new law maintains the existing chain of command and ensures quick access to intelligence for military commanders. The conference report for S. 2845 authorized the DNI to provide guidance for National Intelligence Program budget, develop an annual consolidated budget, present it to the President for approval, participate in developing DOD-wide budgets, ensure effective execution, direct appropriations, and provide exclusive direction to the Office of Management and Budget. The DNI has greater budgetary authorities than the DCI, including the ability to direct allocations and allotments of funds for intelligence agencies in DOD, which some Members believe could conflict with the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities. The proposed legislation grants extensive budgetary authorities to the DNI, with other factors like personalities, administration priorities, and congressional guidance also playing significant roles. A provision requires the President to issue guidelines for effective implementation of DNI authorities within 120 days of appointment. The legislation grants budgetary authorities to the DNI, with a provision for guidelines within 120 days of appointment. Observers note issues with operational control of intelligence collection assets in DOD, but the authority to apportion funds does not automatically mean control over day-to-day operations. Military departments have distinct responsibilities for acquisition programs and operational command. The DNI has responsibilities for acquiring systems in the National Intelligence Program, with defense intelligence agencies accountable to the Secretary of Defense for operating these systems. Coordination of national systems tasking is done among various government agencies, including DOD, State Department, and the White House. The DCI has the authority to coordinate tasking in response to NSC guidance. The Source Operations and Management Directorate of NGA coordinates production priorities with agencies outside DOD. Authority to establish priorities comes from the DCI. The Intelligence Reform Act established the Joint Intelligence Community Council (JICC) to advise the DNI on requirements, budgets, and performance evaluation of intelligence agencies. Relationships among defense agencies and the Office of the Secretary of Defense are also important. The Intelligence Reform Act established a DNI with stronger budgetary authorities than the DCI. Close coordination between the DNI and DOD agencies will still be necessary, but developing coordinative procedures may take time due to the complexity of meeting different government needs."
