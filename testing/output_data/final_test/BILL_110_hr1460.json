    "content": "The \"Change the Course in Iraq Act\" recognizes the valor of US Armed Forces in Iraq and repeals the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. It also calls for the redeployment of US Armed Forces from Iraq. SEC. 4 of the \"Change the Course in Iraq Act\" requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for the phased redeployment of US Armed Forces from Iraq within 60 days. The plan should focus on defeating Al-Qaeda, training Iraqi security forces, and protecting US forces. The President appoints a Coordinator for Iraq Stabilization within 30 days of the Act's enactment. The Coordinator is tasked with developing and coordinating US initiatives in Iraq, reporting to the President and Secretary of State. Congress urges the Coordinator to work with the Government of Iraq on supporting unity, securing borders, and preventing destabilization. The President appoints a Coordinator for Iraq Stabilization to develop and coordinate US initiatives in Iraq. The Coordinator is urged to work with the Iraqi Government on promoting stability, preventing conflict spill-over, economic assistance, and national reconciliation efforts. The US appoints a Coordinator for Iraq Stabilization to work on promoting stability, preventing conflict spill-over, economic assistance, and national reconciliation. This includes supporting conferences in Baghdad for promoting national reconciliation and creating an Iraq International Support Group involving neighboring countries and key global players. SEC. 7. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ. The Iraq Study Group Report warned against increasing U.S. troop levels in Iraq, stating that violence would persist without national reconciliation. President George W. Bush's goal for Iraq is self-governance, sustainability, and defense. If the Iraqi Government fails to make progress on reconciliation, security, and governance, the U.S. should reduce support. In a November 2006 Department of Defense report to Congress, it was highlighted that Iraqi forces need to be trained, equipped, and in the lead of security operations with conditional funding to incentivize the Iraqi Government. The Iraq Study Group's recommendations for national reconciliation, security, and governance include reintegration of Baathists and Arab nationalists, disarming militia members, sharing oil revenues, and amending the Iraq Constitution. The United States has appropriated $34 billion for Iraq's reconstruction, with $21 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund. The United States should engage in robust diplomatic efforts to stabilize Iraq and ease tensions in the region, as part of the Iraq Study Group's comprehensive strategy. President Bush outlined benchmarks for the Iraqi Government to take responsibility for security, share oil revenues, invest in reconstruction, and hold provincial elections in 2007. In 2007, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections and the Iraqi Government will reform de-Baathification laws. President Bush emphasized the need for Iraq's leaders to fulfill their promises to deploy more troops, confront violent radicals, and achieve reconciliation through benchmarks. In 2007, Iraq plans to hold provincial elections and reform de-Baathification laws. President Bush stressed the importance of achieving reconciliation through benchmarks, including sharing oil revenues, rebuilding the country, re-integrating Baathists and militia members, and ensuring security in every province. Assistance to Iraq after December 31, 2007, is contingent on the Iraqi Government meeting certain conditions. The Iraqi Government has made progress in integrating militia members into civilian society, amending the constitution to guarantee rights, controlling security forces, and ensuring provincial autonomy. Assistance provided to Iraq is contingent on meeting these conditions. Assistance provided to Iraq is contingent on meeting conditions for the Iraqi security forces and reconstruction efforts. SEC. 8 of the Act defines key terms such as \"Armed Forces\" and \"congressional defense committees\" as specified in title 10, United States Code."
