    "content": "The federal government provides over $28 billion in funding for academic research at U.S. universities and colleges. Congress and federal agencies have established requirements to ensure transparency and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in research grants. Stakeholders recognize the need for oversight, but some are concerned that regulations may be hindering research productivity and potential returns on federal investments. The report discusses unintended consequences of federal regulations on academic research, including reduced productivity and discouragement of students. It provides an overview of selected issues related to federally funded academic research, emphasizing its importance in American innovation and economic growth. Federal funds, primarily from federal agencies like NIH, NSF, DOD, DOE, and NASA, contribute over half of the total R&D funds for U.S. universities and colleges. Institutional funds from universities and colleges make up a quarter of the total, with the rest coming from businesses, state/local governments, and nonprofit organizations. A 2012 survey by the Federal Demonstration Partnership found that researchers spend 42% of their time on federally funded projects meeting administrative requirements. A 2015 report by Vanderbilt University estimated compliance costs with federal research regulations at 11-25% of research expenditures. The academic community seeks to harmonize federal regulations and reduce administrative burden. The Association of American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and Council on Governmental Relations emphasized the need to minimize administrative and compliance costs to benefit the Federal government and university stakeholders. Members of Congress have also expressed concerns about the excessive time and resources spent on federal requirements. The NSF Inspector General stressed the importance of reducing investigators' administrative workloads while maintaining accountability. The Office of the Inspector General and the accountability community aim to balance reducing burden while maintaining accountability. Federal research grants have specific administrative requirements at different stages, such as post-award implementation. Academic institutions also have internal policies for managing awards. In addition to federal requirements, academic institutions develop internal policies for managing awards, which can vary based on factors like institution size and research program focus. Executive orders since the 1970s have aimed to streamline federal regulations, with E.O. 12866 directing agencies to enhance planning and coordination. President Trump signed an E.O. requiring that for every new regulation issued, two existing regulations must be identified for elimination. Various legislative efforts have aimed to minimize the impacts of federal grant requirements and monitoring efforts. The Single Audit Act of 1984 established uniform audit requirements. The Amendments of 1996 established uniform audit requirements for federal grant recipients to clarify audit guidance. The Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 simplified reporting requirements and created Grants.gov for grant-seekers. The DATA Act of 2014 included requirements for OMB and the Department of the Treasury. The DATA Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-101) required OMB and the Department of the Treasury to standardize data element definitions and pilot recommendations to reduce recipient reporting burden. The Uniform Guidance (UG) consolidated federal award circulars into a single guidance document to streamline grants management and reduce administrative burden for non-federal entities. The Uniform Guidance (UG) from December 2014 outlines requirements for federal grant applicants and recipients, with input from OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Federal agencies may have varying implementation of the UG, including agency-specific forms for conflict of interest, biosketches, and effort reporting. Additional agency-specific forms may be required alongside standard government-wide forms like Standard Form 424 Research and Related. The Standard Form 424 Research and Related is a government-wide application form, but additional forms may be required by agencies like Grants.gov or agency-specific websites. Disparities in agency processes and requirements are a concern for academic grant recipients. Evaluations have looked at the impacts of federal grant regulations on academic research, with reports from the GAO and the National Academy of Sciences in 2016 highlighting efforts to reduce administrative workloads and costs. The NAS report in 2016 emphasized the need for a new framework to streamline regulatory requirements and reduce administrative burdens for federally funded investigators. The National Science Board also highlighted concerns about excessive administrative and compliance requirements hindering scientific research. The Federal Demonstration Partnership's survey findings further supported the notion that a significant amount of researchers' time is spent on administrative tasks. The reports from 1999, 2005, and recent GAO and NAS reports highlight long-standing issues with administrative tasks for researchers. Stakeholders have identified various areas contributing to administrative workload and costs, such as grant proposal preparation, financial management, and progress reporting. Recommendations include the need for sustained attention from the federal government to reduce administrative burdens. The government is working to reduce administrative workloads for researchers by assessing and eliminating ineffective requirements, improving coordination among agencies, and implementing various recommendations. These recommendations include creating an overarching body and administrator position at OMB, using preliminary proposals and standardized progress reports, developing a central database of investigator information, standardizing grant and conflict of interest forms, changing effort reporting processes, modifying competitive bidding thresholds, monitoring award subrecipients, and improving audit processes. Congressional concerns are being taken into account. The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) signed into law on December 13, 2016, requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reduce administrative burdens on researchers by reviewing regulations related to financial conflicts of interest, streamlining subrecipient monitoring, evaluating financial reporting requirements, and clarifying procedures to avoid duplication between departments and agencies. The 21st Century Cures Act requires the review and clarification of regulations related to financial conflicts of interest, subrecipient monitoring, and financial reporting. It also mandates the reduction of administrative burdens on researchers by streamlining procedures and establishing the Research Policy Board to harmonize regulations across research funding agencies. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA) was signed into law to address administrative requirements related to academic R&D, including establishing an interagency working group to minimize regulatory burden, conducting audits on policies, and increasing procurement thresholds. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 raised the micro-purchase threshold for grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts awarded to universities and research institutions to $10,000 from $3,500. The Research and Development Efficiency Act aimed to streamline federal academic R&D regulations and reporting requirements. The University Regulation Streamlining and Harmonization Act of 2016, introduced by Representative Daniel Lipinski, addressed concerns over federal academic R&D regulations. It included provisions such as establishing a Research Policy Board and an interagency working group for a central database of researcher information. Additionally, it required the President to appoint an Associate Administrator for Academic Research Enterprise and exempted prime grant-receiving institutions from monitoring subrecipients under certain conditions. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing on Academic Research Regulatory Relief in September 2016 to address concerns about researchers' time spent on federal requirements. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to minimize regulatory requirements while maintaining transparency and accountability in federally funded academic research. Key areas of concern included federal coordination of regulations across agencies and effective stakeholder engagement. Previous efforts to improve coordination among funding agencies have been made through initiatives like the Research Business Models working group. The Research and Development Efficiency Act establishes an interagency working group to review research regulations and reduce administrative burdens on federally funded researchers. Nonfederal stakeholders have called for more effective ways to engage in the regulatory process. The WG created through the AICA and the RPB mandated by the 21st Century Cures Act aim to enhance engagement between academic stakeholders and federal agencies in reviewing policies and establishing best practices. Congressional oversight may be necessary to ensure their effectiveness and coordination. Several actions have been recommended by academic stakeholder groups to reduce the time and resources spent on compliance with various requirements, including standardizing forms, streamlining grant proposals, revising audit approaches, and updating UG policies. Researchers suggest that streamlining agency forms could improve the grant process without sacrificing important information. The creation of an Associate Administrator of Academic Research Enterprise within OMB's OIRA, as proposed in legislation, could enhance the functions of the RPB and WG, but Congress must decide if it is necessary or should be left to OMB's discretion. Researchers recommend streamlining agency forms to improve the grant process without losing important information. Standardizing forms, revising audit approaches, and updating policies are suggested actions to reduce time and resources spent on compliance. The use of a standard grant proposal form is called for, but using only one may be challenging due to varying information needs depending on funding type, research area, and agency mission. Opportunities for streamlining exist at the applicant level, such as allowing modifications to reflect current program requirements. To address concerns for both applicants and agency reviewers, reports have recommended the use of preliminary proposals for grant applications. NSF has already implemented this approach for some grants, requiring shorter preliminary proposals for initial review before inviting selected applicants to submit full proposals. Initial assessments show no negative impact on proposal quality, funding rates, or submission numbers. The AICA mandated a working group to consider recommendations for standard grant proposals and changes to the proposal process. Uncertainties surrounding the audit process add to workload and costs for researchers and administrators. Recommendations have been made to address concerns while maintaining effective oversight by federal agency Inspectors General. The AICA mandated a working group to consider recommendations for standard grant proposals and changes to the proposal process. Uncertainties surrounding the audit process add to workload and costs for researchers and administrators. Recommendations have been made to address concerns while maintaining effective oversight by federal agency Inspectors General. Recommended clarifying discrepancies between agencies and IGs when interpreting agency policy prior to conducting an audit, and revising the risk-based methodologies that IGs use to identify institutions for audits by accounting for the institution's prior compliance records. The NSF and HHS IGs asserted the need to interpret policies objectively and use innovative methods regardless of an institution's past performance. Recommendations from assessments by the GAO and others might help address researchers' concerns over individual audits, such as ensuring consistent auditor training requirements to improve uniformity and the quality of audits. The UG revisions addressed concerns about subrecipient monitoring requirements and allowed for flexibility in tracking personnel expenses. Universities argue that resources could be better utilized by focusing on high-risk subrecipients. The changes also responded to issues with the traditional effort reporting system, making it easier to measure and maintain. The Federal Demonstration Partnership initiated pilot projects using payroll certification to track expenses, resulting in reduced time and costs for universities. IG audits found accountability over federal funds at Michigan Technological University and attributed issues at George Mason University to internal policies. A comprehensive assessment for all pilots, including those at UC Irvine and UC Riverside, is expected in 2017 to improve administrative efficiency. The OMB and COFAR established administrative and audit metrics for Uniform Guidance (2 C.F.R. 200) in a 2014 memorandum. Initial evaluations of UG impacts are planned for 2017. Oversight by Congress may track UG implementation progress and impacts from recent legislation. Additional reviews by IRBs and IACUCs are required for research involving human subjects and animals. The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, known as the Common Rule, was updated in 1991 to protect participants in federally funded research studies. The Common Rule was updated in 2017 to modernize oversight, including a provision for single IRB review. Congress may direct studies to assess the impact on research grant efficiency while maintaining health and privacy protections. Animal research oversight is governed by laws like the Animal Welfare Act and the Health Research Extension Act. The Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act require standards for animal research and the formation of IACUCs. The 21st Century Cures Act directed agencies to streamline regulations. Stakeholders suggest a federal-wide Assurance system. Congress should consider impacts on agencies' ability to evaluate animal welfare in federally funded research. The 114th Congress passed legislation to address concerns regarding time and costs associated with regulations for federally funded academic research. Academic institutions can support federal efforts by improving internal policies. Congressional oversight is crucial for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of these provisions. The 114th Congress enacted legislation to address concerns about regulations for federally funded academic research. Congress may consider balancing support for research with oversight and accountability. Assessments from various efforts can inform future optimization of federal research policies."
