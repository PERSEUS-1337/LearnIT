    "content": "On July 20, 1923, the National Woman's Party met in Seneca Falls, New York to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention and celebrate the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote. NWP leader Alice Paul announced plans for a new constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women and men in the United States. The proposed \"equal rights\" amendment was introduced in December 1923 in the 68th Congress as the \"Lucretia Mott Amendment.\" The draft amendment, known as the Alice Paul Amendment, proposed equal rights for men and women throughout the United States. It was introduced in 1923 and faced a seven-year ratification deadline. Despite initial progress, only 35 states ratified it by 1977, falling short of the required 38 approvals. Supporters of the ERA tried to extend the deadline as it approached in 1979. ERA supporters capitalized on the fact that the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) had a seven-year time limit in its proposing clause, not in the body of the amendment. Congress extended the ratification period by 38 months in 1982, but no further states approved it. Despite the expiration of the extended ratification period, new versions of the ERA have been introduced in Congress, with supporters arguing that the ratification period could be extended indefinitely through congressional action. Resolutions to remove the deadline have been introduced since the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress introduced resolutions to remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, aiming to eliminate the 1979 and 1982 deadlines, reopen the proposed ERA for state ratification, and extend the ratification period indefinitely. In the 115th Congress, resolutions were introduced for a \"fresh start\" approach to propose a new constitutional amendment separate from the 1972 ERA. In 1982, resolutions were introduced in Congress to propose a new Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) separate from the original 1972 ERA. New versions of the ERA have been introduced in each Congress since then, with language similar to the original proposal. In the 115th Congress, two fresh start ERA proposals were introduced, including S.J.Res. 6 by Senator Bob Menendez in 2017. Senator Bob Menendez introduced S.J.Res. 6 in 2017, a proposal for a new Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) with 15 cosponsors. The amendment aims to ensure equality of rights under the law regardless of sex, giving Congress the power to enforce it. The proposal has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Additionally, Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced H.J.Res. 33 in the House of Representatives, with 169 cosponsors, also advocating for equal rights for women in the United States. The new ERA proposed includes language ensuring equal rights for women in the United States and its jurisdictions. This version of the Equal Rights Amendment differs from the 1972 proposal, with Section 1 amended to emphasize women's equality. Representative Maloney described this as a \"new and improved\" ERA. The new and improved Equal Rights Amendment, designed for the 21st Century, explicitly mandates equal rights for women and prohibits gender discrimination. It recalls the wording of the original ERA drafted by suffragist Alice Paul in 1923. The resolution expands enforcement authority to include the several States. The joint resolutions S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res. 33 propose an Equal Rights Amendment without a ratification deadline, requiring approval by two-thirds of Congress members. Presidential approval is not needed for constitutional amendments, and the proposed amendment would be sent to state legislatures for ratification. The proposed Equal Rights Amendment without a ratification deadline avoids expiration issues and follows the assumption that amendments remain valid for ratification indefinitely. Opponents argue for including a \"sunset\" provision to ensure contemporary approval. The proposed resolutions in the 115th Congress aim to reopen the ratification process for the Equal Rights Amendment and remove the deadline set in the preamble. These measures are based on the \"three-state\" argument, which asserts Congress's authority to alter ratification limits and considers existing ratifications valid while invalidating rescissions by some states. The resolution to reopen the ERA ratification process was introduced by Senator Ben Cardin and Representative Jackie Speier in the 115th Congress. The purpose is to remove the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, allowing it to be valid if ratified by three-fourths of the states. Senator Cardin has 36 cosponsors, while Representative Speier has 166 co-sponsors. The resolution has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) resolution, introduced by Senator Ben Cardin and Representative Jackie Speier, aims to remove the ratification deadline for the ERA. The resolution, with 166 co-sponsors, is identical to S.J.Res. 5 and has been referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. ERA proponents argue that Congress has the authority to remove the original ratification deadline and restart the ratification process at the current 36-state level. They cite Article V of the Constitution and Supreme Court decisions to support their stance. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) resolution, introduced by Senator Ben Cardin and Representative Jackie Speier, aims to remove the ratification deadline for the ERA. Proponents cite Supreme Court decisions and the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh \"Madison\" Amendment. Recent developments include Nevada and Illinois ratifying the amendment, while Arizona and Virginia failed to do so in 2018. North Carolina may vote on the ERA during the current legislative session. In March 2017, Nevada ratified the ERA proposed by H.J.Res. 208, becoming the 36th state to do so. This action raised the number of state ratifications to 37. The ratification measure passed the Nevada Senate on March 1 and the House of Representatives on March 20, with historical significance as it was proposed exactly 45 years earlier. On March 22, 1972, Nevada ratified the ERA, marking a reversal of earlier failed attempts. The three-state strategy shifted to a \"two-state strategy\" with Nevada's ratification. Illinois later became the 37th state to ratify the ERA on May 30, 2018. The Eagle Forum criticized the amendment, citing the passed deadline for ratification in 1982. The ratification measure for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was adopted by the Senate in its final form on May 30, 2018, without the need for the governor's approval. Public opinion polls consistently showed support for the ERA, with levels never dropping below 57% during the ratification period. A CBS News survey in 1999 reported 74% support for the ERA. The ERA's expiration led to a decline in related polling. In 2017, a Harris Survey showed 66% support for efforts to strengthen women's status in society. Despite advocacy efforts, nearly 50 years passed before the ERA ratification measure was adopted in 2018. Nearly 50 years passed between the introduction of the Mott Amendment in 1923 and the approval of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972. The ERA, drafted by Alice Paul, aimed to grant equal rights to men and women. Despite advocacy efforts, the proposal faced little progress in Congress for over two decades. The Equal Rights Amendment was the subject of hearings in Congress from 1923 to 1946, with the Senate first addressing it in 1946. The proposal evolved over time, with a version incorporating language on equality of rights under the law. Proponents faced opposition from traditionalists, organized labor, and some women's movement leaders. Opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment came from traditionalists, organized labor, and some women's movement leaders. The main concern was the potential loss of protective legislation for women, such as laws regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. Organized labor strongly opposed the ERA as it threatened these protective laws that they supported. Opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment came from traditionalists, organized labor, and some women's movement leaders, who feared the loss of protective legislation for women. Despite women's increased participation in the workforce during World War II, support for the ERA in Congress was slow to grow. In July 1946, a Senate vote on the amendment fell short with a 39-35 approval. The 1946 Senate vote on the Equal Rights Amendment fell short of approval with a 39-35 vote. A symbolic first step, the Hayden rider, introduced in 1950, aimed to protect existing rights of women but was seen as a tactic to divide ERA supporters. In the 1950s, the Senate passed an equal rights amendment resolution with the Hayden rider, opposed by ERA supporters. Various ERA resolutions were considered in committee over the next 16 years, but none reached the Senate floor for a vote. In the 88th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee removed the Hayden rider from future consideration, stating that it preserved unequal rights for women. The House of Representatives took no action on an equal rights amendment between 1948 and 1970. Representative Emanuel Celler was involved during this period. In the 88th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee removed the Hayden rider, preserving unequal rights for women. Representative Emanuel Celler of New York blocked consideration of the equal rights amendment in the Judiciary Committee from 1949 to 1953 and again from 1955 to 1973. Despite ongoing proposals for the amendment, there was no floor consideration for almost two decades. The concept gained visibility in the early 1970s as a key issue in the women's movement. The women's rights movement gained visibility in the 1960s, with women actively supporting enhanced legislation for themselves. By the early 1970s, the concept of an equal rights amendment had popular support, with 56% favoring it in a 1970 poll. This support remained consistent throughout the 1970s and subsequent ratification efforts. During the 1970s, favorable attitudes towards the Equal Rights Amendment remained consistent. Labor opposition began to fade, with influential unions like the United Auto Workers endorsing the concept. Congress also took steps in the 1960s to address women's equality issues, such as passing the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Proposals for the ERA gained support in various areas, with both the Republican and Democratic parties endorsing versions of the amendment. In 1970, Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan introduced an equal rights amendment in the House of Representatives, breaking a legislative stalemate that had lasted for over two decades. Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon had all endorsed the amendment by this time. In 1970, Representative Griffiths filed a discharge petition to bring the proposed equal rights amendment to the floor, obtaining the necessary 218 Member signatures by June 20. This rare move bypassed the Judiciary Committee's inaction on the amendment. The House approved the motion to discharge the equal rights amendment by a vote of 332 to 22, and approved the amendment itself by a vote of 334 to 26. The Senate had also begun to act on a similar resolution in the 91st Congress in 1970. Hearings were held in the Judiciary Committee on the Senate version of the amendment, followed by consideration on the Senate floor in early October. Floor debate focused on amendments exempting women from military service and allowing non-denominational prayer in public schools. In the 92nd Congress, Representative Griffiths introduced H.J.Res. 208 proposing an equal rights amendment. The House Judiciary Committee reported an amendment on July 14, but it included amendments unacceptable to ERA supporters. When H.J.Res. 208 came to the floor in early October, it faced opposition. In early October, the House approved H.J.Res. 208 by a bipartisan vote of 354 to 24, after stripping out committee amendments. The Senate took up the amendment in March 1972, with Senator Birch Bayh as floor manager. President Nixon reaffirmed his endorsement of the Equal Rights Amendment in a letter to Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott. The Senate approved the Equal Rights Amendment, H.J. Res. 208, with bipartisan support by a vote of 84 to 8 after rejecting amendments that would have exempted women from military service and preserved gender-specific legislation. The Equal Rights Amendment, H.J. Res. 208, was approved by the Senate and House of Representatives with bipartisan support. It proposes an amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing equal rights for men and women, with provisions for enforcement by Congress. The Equal Rights Amendment was proposed by Congress with a ratification deadline of seven years by 38 state legislatures. The Child Labor Amendment, proposed in 1924, did not have a ratification deadline and fell short of the required 36 states for ratification. The Child Labor Amendment proposed in 1924 fell short of the required 36 states for ratification by 8 states through 1937. The Supreme Court's 1941 decision in United States v. Darby Lumber Company upheld federal authority to regulate child labor, rendering the amendment moot. The Equal Rights Amendment was proposed by Congress with a time limit included in the preamble or authorizing resolution, rather than in the body of the amendment itself. States initially responded quickly to ratify the amendment, but opposition began to grow around organizations like \"STOP ERA.\" Opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment coalesced around organizations like \"STOP ERA,\" citing concerns about potential negative social and economic effects. Despite this opposition, public approval of the amendment never dropped below 54% during the ratification period. Ultimately, 35 states ratified the amendment, falling three short of the required number. In the late 1970s, the Equal Rights Amendment faced opposition and stalled in the ratification process, with 35 states ratifying it, three short of the required number. Some states also passed measures to rescind their previous ratifications, raising questions about the constitutionality of such actions. To extend the deadline for ratification, ERA supporters proposed a congressional resolution, H.J.Res. 638, in response to the approaching deadline of March 22, 1979. H.J.Res. 638 was introduced in the 95th Congress to extend the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Legal scholars debated Congress's authority to extend the deadline and the voting requirements. A compromise amendment reduced the proposed extension to three years, three months, and eight days due to controversy and opposition. The ERA supporters accepted a compromise that reduced the proposed extension to three years, three months, and eight days to ensure committee approval. The full House debated and rejected amendments recognizing states' right to rescind ratifications and requiring a two-thirds majority for the extension. The resolution was adopted by the House on August 15, 1978, with a vote of 233 to 189. The Senate took up the resolution in October for further deliberations. During the ratification period, ERA supporters failed to secure the necessary ratifications for the amendment, while opponents also had unsuccessful attempts at rescission. President Jimmy Carter signed the joint resolution on October 20, despite the constitutional procedure being solely a congressional prerogative. A Gallup Poll in August 1981 showed 63% support for the amendment, the highest percentage in any previous survey. The Equal Rights Amendment deadline expired on June 30, 1982, with 35 state ratifications. Some states attempted to rescind their ratifications, leading to legal disputes over the constitutionality of rescission. Idaho, Arizona, and Washington brought legal action asserting the right to rescind. District Court Judge Marion Callister ruled that Congress had exceeded its power by extending the ERA deadline and that states had the authority to rescind their ratifications before an amendment became part of the Constitution. The Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from the National Organization for Women and the General Services Administration, staying the Idaho District Court's judgment. Interest in the Equal Rights Amendment persisted after the extended ratification deadline expired on June 30, 1982. Efforts to reintroduce the amendment in Congress have continued, with new resolutions proposed in each succeeding Congress. One potential approach is to introduce a new joint resolution as a \"fresh start\" to revive the ERA. Efforts to reintroduce the Equal Rights Amendment have persisted in Congress, with new resolutions proposed in each succeeding session. Senator Edward Kennedy and later Senator Robert Menendez introduced fresh start proposals in the Senate, while Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced similar amendments in the House. Alternative approaches to the ratification question have also emerged over the years. In response to the three-state strategy proposed by the ERA Summit in the 1990s, Representative Andrews introduced a resolution in the 103rd Congress to verify the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment when three additional states ratify it. This resolution was based on the precedent set by the Twenty-Seventh Amendment and the extension of the ERA deadline by Congress in 1978. In 1978, Congress set a precedent allowing adjustments to time limits for proposing clauses. The influence of the Madison Amendment is discussed further in the report. In 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Equal Rights Amendment's extended ratification deadline passed, prompting new analyses on its constitutionality. The ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment in 1992 after two centuries also influenced new lines of analysis. In 1978, Congress set a precedent for adjusting time limits for proposing clauses, influencing the current status of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Resolutions in the 112th Congress aimed to repeal deadlines, reopen the ERA for ratification, and extend the ratification period indefinitely. Legislation proposing the three state/two state strategy in the 115th Congress was discussed, focusing on the validity of ratifications by Nevada. The proposed Equal Rights Amendment remains constitutionally viable, with proponents citing Congress's broad authority over the amendment process. Some scholars and observers have raised concerns about this assertion. The Constitution grants Congress the power to propose amendments, which become valid when ratified by three-fourths of the states. The Constitution grants Congress broad authority to propose amendments, with no time limits specified for approval by a two-thirds majority of Senators and Representatives. Acting Assistant Attorney General Timothy Flanigan noted the absence of time limits in Article V, emphasizing that when time periods are part of a constitutional rule, they are specified. The Constitution grants Congress broad authority to propose amendments without specifying time limits for approval by a two-thirds majority of Senators and Representatives. The Twentieth Amendment refers to specific dates, January 3rd and 20th, and does not impose a time limit for the ratification process. Article V empowers Congress to specify modes of ratification by state legislatures or ad hoc state conventions, with no role allocated to the President or federal judiciary in the amendment process. The founders granted Congress broad authority over the amendment process without specific time limits. ERA supporters argue that Congress has plenary authority, balanced by super-majority requirements and the Article V Convention alternative, allowing them to propose, alter, or terminate ratification provisions at their discretion. Advocates of congressional authority over the amendment process point out that Congress has historically asserted its preeminent authority in determining ratification procedures. For example, in 1868, Congress declared the Fourteenth Amendment ratified despite some states attempting to rescind their ratifications. Congress has historically asserted its authority over the amendment process, as seen in the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. Congress confirmed the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and the Twenty-Seventh Amendment in 1992. Opponents of ERA extension question the constitutionality of Congress's authority, citing concerns of constitutional restraint and fair play. The ERA supporters argue that states which ratified the amendment with a seven-year time limit should not be forced into a longer time limit. They view ERA ratification as a contract with agreed-upon terms, including the seven-year limit. Critics also point out that there was ample time for ratification between 1972 and 1982, questioning the need to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Critics argue that eliminating ratification deadlines for the Equal Rights Amendment would raise questions about state rescissions and the necessity of the amendment due to advancements in women's equality. They also suggest that giving the ERA another chance at ratification sets a precedent for rejected amendments. Supporters point to the Twenty-Seventh Amendment as an example of a successful late ratification, emphasizing its viability despite initial obscurity. In 1789, Congress proposed 12 amendments, with Articles III through XII becoming the Bill of Rights. Article II, regarding Members' pay changes, was ratified by six states between 1789 and 1791 but largely forgotten. Rediscovered in 1978, the Madison Amendment had no ratification deadline, leading to its potential viability. The Wyoming legislature approved a resolution in response to Congress increasing compensation for Representatives and Senators, citing concerns about setting a bad example and falling behind in compensation for citizens. This action was largely unnoticed until 1983 when a student, Gregory D. Watson, discovered the amendment and began a campaign for its ratification. In 1983, Gregory D. Watson initiated a grassroots campaign to ratify the Madison Amendment, leading to 31 additional state ratifications by 1992. In 1991, Representative John Boehner introduced a resolution in Congress urging 3 of the remaining 15 states to ratify the proposed 2nd amendment, which would delay changes to congressional compensation until after the next election. In 1992, the Michigan and New Jersey legislatures ratified the \"Madison Amendment,\" becoming the 38th and 39th states to approve it. The Archivist of the United States certified the ratification on May 18, and the amendment became part of the Constitution. Congress debated the legitimacy of the ratification, with some believing positive action by both houses was necessary to confirm it. The Madison Amendment was ratified by Michigan and New Jersey in 1992, becoming part of the Constitution. Congress debated its legitimacy, with resolutions passed to confirm it. The example of this long-inactive amendment has inspired renewed consideration of the Equal Rights Amendment. The Twenty-Seventh Amendment challenged assumptions about ratification, confirming that ratifications of proposed amendments do not need to be contemporaneous. The seven-year time limit was seen as a procedural matter separate from the amendment itself, allowing for flexibility in deadlines. Congress extended the ERA deadline based on its authority under Article V. The authors argued that ratification of the ERA could still be valid even after the deadline, citing the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment. However, some critics question the value of this precedent, suggesting that it may not be a strong model for ERA supporters. The authors questioned the potential impact of unfavorable interpretations of the Madison Amendment on the ERA's ratification. Critics also pointed out Congress's failure to adhere to the Madison Amendment's requirements. Supporters of the ERA may argue that criticisms of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment are more about its flawed application rather than its integrity. Constitutional scholar Michael Stokes Paulsen questioned the use of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment as an example in the case of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, emphasizing the need for ratification processes to be timely and based on popular agreement. He argued that permitting ratification over two centuries could erode the ideal of overwhelming popular support. Opponents of the ERA extension may argue that there is no assurance that the Twenty-seventh Amendment ever had widespread popular assent. The Twenty-Seventh Amendment was adopted without precedent for Congress promulgating an amendment based on state ratifications after two deadlines. The Archivist of the United States announced ratification, followed by congressional confirmation, superseding constitutional principles since the 1920s. The Supreme Court's 1921 decision in Dillon v. Gloss allowed Congress to determine ratification conditions within reasonable limits. The Supreme Court's decision in Dillon v. Gloss allowed Congress to set a definite period for ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment. The Court concluded that both proposal by Congress and ratification in the states are steps in a single process, and that ratification is the expression of the people's approval and must be effective presently. The need for contemporaneity in ratification of constitutional amendments was discussed by the Supreme Court in relation to the congressional apportionment amendment and the Madison Amendment in 1921. The Court maintained that ratification scattered over a long period of time would not reflect the will of the people effectively. Some scholars dispute this position, arguing that the contemporaneity doctrine is not supported by the text of Article V or the deliberations of the Philadelphia Convention. The Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller ruled that Congress has the sole power to determine the contemporaneity of constitutional amendments for ratification, implying that ratification should reflect a nationwide consensus within a reasonable time frame. The Supreme Court ruled in Coleman v. Miller that Congress has the sole power to determine the contemporaneity of constitutional amendments for ratification, emphasizing the need for a nationwide consensus within a reasonable time frame. The Court stated that if Congress does not specify a time period for ratification, it is not the Court's role to decide. This \"political question\" interpretation supports the constitutional doctrine claimed by ERA advocates. The Supreme Court's ruling in Coleman v. Miller emphasized Congress's sole power to determine the contemporaneity of constitutional amendments for ratification. Some suggest that the Court may have been influenced by political struggles with President Franklin Roosevelt, leading to an overreaction. Michael Stokes Paulsen questioned the decision, arguing that it could give Congress unchecked authority over the ratification process. The proposed Equal Rights Amendment faces constitutional challenges, including the issue of the ratification deadline set by Congress. Originating from the Eighteenth Amendment, the deadline was suggested as a political tactic by Senator Warren Harding. This historical background raises questions about the validity of the deadline and potential for revival through additional ratifications. The proposed Equal Rights Amendment faces challenges regarding the ratification deadline set by Congress, suggested as a political tactic by Senator Warren Harding. State ratification surprised even the Anti-Saloon League, leading to adoption in just 13 months. Supporters argue the deadline's recent origin and failed political maneuver, while opponents may emphasize its historical significance. Opponents of extending the ratification deadline argue that it has become a standard element in proposed amendments, ensuring broad and contemporaneous support. They believe these time limits are crucial for checks and balances in the amendment process. The issue of rescission would likely resurface in a contemporary revival of the Equal Rights Amendment, as some states previously attempted to rescind their ratifications. The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho ruled in 1981 that states could rescind their ratifications of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment before its certification. The Supreme Court later vacated this decision after the ERA ratification deadline expired in 1982. ERA supporters argue that Congress has the ultimate authority over the ratification process and rescission. The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho ruled in 1981 that states could rescind their ratifications of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment before its certification. The Supreme Court later vacated this decision after the ERA ratification deadline expired in 1982. Congress has broad authority over the amendment process, as seen in the 1868 action directing Secretary of State William Seward to declare the Fourteenth Amendment ratified despite state rescissions. Rescission remains a potentially viable constitutional issue that could arise in response to an ERA revival. Congressional promulgation of ratified amendments is not necessary, as noted in the 1992 Memorandum for the Counsel to the President concerning the Twenty-Seventh Amendment. The Twenty-Seventh Amendment clarifies Congress's role in the amendment process, allowing Congress to propose amendments and specify ratification. Article V indicates that once amendments are proposed, they become part of the Constitution when ratified by three-fourths of the States. Constitutional scholar Walter Dellinger also supports this viewpoint. The ratification of an amendment is declared valid without the need for further action by Congress or anyone else. The idea of Congress promulgating an amendment has no basis in the Constitution. Advocates of the Equal Rights Amendment may question if Congress has authority over the amendment process, including routine procedures like promulgation. Congress has only proposed one amendment since the ERA process began in 1972, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment. The Twenty-Third Amendment, ratified in 1961, granted the citizens of Washington, DC, the right to vote in presidential elections. President Lyndon Johnson established an appointed mayor and city council for the District of Columbia in 1967. In 1973, President Richard Nixon signed legislation establishing an elected mayor and council for the District of Columbia, while Congress retained ultimate authority over legislation. Voting representation in Congress was seen as a crucial step towards full self-government. The proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States would treat the District of Columbia as a state for representation in Congress and the election of the President. The rights and powers conferred by this amendment would be exercised by the people of the District, as provided by Congress. The twenty-third article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is repealed. Hearings were held in 1977, and on February 15, 1978, the Judiciary Committee reported the measure to the House. An amendment was adopted to incorporate a seven-year ratification deadline in the resolution. This provision aimed to prevent the deadline from being extended by a simple majority vote of Congress. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah highlighted the importance of the ratification deadline in the D.C. Amendment to avoid controversies similar to those seen with the Equal Rights Amendment. The resolution included a provision stating that ratification by three-fourths of states must occur within seven years of submission. This provision was added as Section 4 of the amendment to ensure its validity. The District of Columbia Congressional Representation Amendment was passed by the House and Senate in 1978 but ultimately expired in 1985 after failing to be ratified by enough states. ERA supporters argue for its revival based on constitutional principles. Article V grants broad discretion to Congress over the constitutional amendment process, with no requirement of contemporaneity in ratification. ERA proponents cite Coleman v. Miller for Congress's wide ratification authority. The seven-year deadline for amendments originated as a political maneuver against Prohibition. A later Congress can rescind a ratification deadline and revive proposed amendments. The Twenty-Seventh Amendment is questioned as a model for reviving the Equal Rights Amendment due to differences in ratification deadlines. Congress has largely ignored the Twenty-Seventh Amendment since ratification. Despite an extension, the Equal Rights Amendment failed to gain approval from three-fourths of the states. Opponents argue that attempting to revive the ERA is unfair and goes against the founders' intentions. Revivification opponents caution against a broad interpretation of Coleman v. Miller. Congress acknowledged its mistake on the ratification deadline for the Equal Rights Amendment and included a similar requirement in the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment. The issue of rescission remains unresolved and could be revisited by Congress or the judiciary if the ERA is reopened for ratification. Some supporters advocate for a three-state strategy to revive the ERA. In the 115th Congress, there are proposals to repeal the ratification deadlines for the Equal Rights Amendment. One approach is a \"one-state strategy\" following ratification by Nevada and Illinois. Another option is to propose a new ERA without a time limit, requiring approval by two-thirds of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. The proposal suggests a new Equal Rights Amendment without a time limit, similar to the Madison Amendment, which would remain current and eligible for ratification indefinitely if approved by Congress."
