It adjudicates appeals of adverse actions and can order relief for employees. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) lacks sitting members as of March 2019, raising concerns about its ability to function. The report discusses the MSPB's adjudicatory authority, structure, and the role of the Office of Special Counsel. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) was established over a century ago to address political patronage in federal government employment. The Civil Service Act of 1883, also known as the Pendleton Act, created a merit-based system for hiring federal employees in response to corruption and inefficiency. The Civil Service Act of 1883 established a merit-based system for hiring federal employees through the creation of the Civil Service Commission (CSC). The CSC aided the President in preparing civil service rules for open, competitive examinations. Congress enacted additional measures over the years addressing issues such as merit hiring and due process rights. However, concerns were raised about the regulatory structure of the civil service system, particularly regarding the CSC's handling of managerial and adjudicatory matters. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) has conflicting roles as a management agent for a partisan-elected President and protector of the merit system. It also provides services to agency management and adjudicates disputes. However, its credibility in these roles has diminished. In response, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) to address these issues and reform the federal civilian workforce. The Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) split the functions of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) between two new agencies, OPM and MSPB. OPM handles personnel management functions like training, position classification, and pay administration, while MSPB focuses on hearings, adjudication, and appeals. MSPB has the authority to develop adjudicatory processes, issue subpoenas, call witnesses, and enforce compliance with its decisions. The Board consists of three members\u2014a Chairman and two others. The MSPB Board consists of three members appointed by the President with Senate approval. Members must be \"especially qualified\" and serve a nonrenewable seven-year term. They have for-cause removal protection and decisions are made by majority vote. The Chairman is the chief. The Board members make decisions by majority vote. The Chairman is the chief executive officer responsible for organizational issues. The Vice Chairman acts in the Chairman's absence. If both are unavailable, the remaining Board member assumes the Chairman's duties. The CSRA and Board regulations do not address a scenario with a completely vacant Board. The Office of Special Counsel protects employees from prohibited practices and is led by the Special Counsel appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Special Counsel, appointed by the President with Senate approval, investigates and addresses prohibited personal practices within agencies. The Special Counsel can petition the MSPB for corrective action and seek disciplinary measures against employees involved in such practices. The OSC was established as an independent agency in 1989, with the MSPB maintaining jurisdiction over related matters. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) has original jurisdiction over actions brought by the Special Counsel for corrective and disciplinary action, specified removals of persons in the Senior Executive Service (SES), and certain adverse personnel actions taken against administrative law judges (ALJs). The MSPB also has appellate jurisdiction to review any action appealable under any statute, rule, or regulation by an employee or applicant for employment, such as agency decisions to remove or suspend employees for more than 14 days. Cases may be heard by Board members directly or referred to ALJs or administrative judges for adjudication. Administrative judges adjudicate cases and issue initial decisions under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. Unlike ALJs, administrative judges do not have the same tenure and job protections and can be removed without cause. The MSPB's jurisdiction is not solely based on the nature of the action but also considers the party involved, such as specified employees in the competitive service. The Merit Systems Protection Board's jurisdiction includes preference eligibles in the excepted service with one year of service, non-preference eligible individuals with two years of service, and cases involving reprisal for whistleblowing. The Board can review actions like major disciplinary measures for union-represented employees. The Merit Systems Protection Board's jurisdiction covers appealing major disciplinary actions, such as removal or reduction in grade or pay, to the MSPB or through a collective bargaining agreement's grievance procedure. The U.S. Supreme Court has limited the Board's jurisdiction, stating it cannot review the substance of security clearance determinations, only the process followed in making such determinations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit expanded on the Egan ruling, stating that the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) cannot review agency determinations on security clearances or eligibility for sensitive positions. The MSPB has jurisdiction over cases involving prohibited personnel practices, where the Special Counsel can seek corrective action. If the Special Counsel believes a prohibited practice occurred, they can request a stay of the action from a Board member. The Special Counsel can request a stay of action from a Board member if they believe a prohibited practice occurred. If corrective action is required, the Special Counsel will report their determination to the MSPB, the agency, and OPM. The Board may order corrective action if the prohibited practice is proven to have occurred. The Board may order corrective action if the Special Counsel proves that a prohibited practice occurred. Corrective action may include reinstatement, reimbursement for attorney's fees, back pay, medical costs, travel expenses, and other compensatory damages. Judicial review is available for those affected by the Board's decision. The MSPB has original jurisdiction over actions brought by the Special Counsel to discipline an employee for prohibited practices or misconduct. The employee has the right to respond to a written complaint and provide supporting evidence, and is entitled to legal representation. The MSPB has jurisdiction over disciplinary actions for prohibited practices or misconduct. An employee has the right to be represented by an attorney, attend a hearing before the MSPB or an ALJ, and receive a written decision with disciplinary actions such as removal, suspension, or reprimand. Judicial review can be sought in the Federal Circuit for final orders. Career appointees removed from the SES for performance issues are entitled to an informal hearing but removal is not delayed. The MSPB has jurisdiction over disciplinary actions for prohibited practices or misconduct. An ALJ facing adverse actions has rights to answer the agency's complaint and be represented in an MSPB hearing. The MSPB upholds disciplinary actions against an ALJ if good cause is established. Employees who are not ALJs or part of the SES can be disciplined for misconduct to promote efficiency. ALJs can seek judicial review of agency actions. Employees can appeal actions like removal or suspension to the MSPB. Unacceptable performance can also lead to removal or grade reduction appealable to the MSPB. An individual who appeals a personnel action to the MSPB is entitled to a hearing and legal representation. The case may be heard by the Board, an ALJ, or an administrative judge. The initial decision becomes final unless a petition for review is filed within 30 days. One Board member may grant a petition for review. An agency's personnel action must be supported by substantial evidence to be sustained. An agency's personnel action must be supported by substantial evidence in cases of unacceptable performance or by a preponderance of evidence in other cases. The action may not be sustained if there is harmful error, prohibited personnel practices, or non-compliance with the law. The agency must prove the charged conduct, establish a nexus with civil service efficiency, and show that the penalty is reasonable to withstand a challenge. The MSPB can mitigate penalties imposed by agencies for misconduct. In Douglas v. Veterans Administration, the Board has the authority to modify or reduce penalties imposed on employees. The Board must apply the same standards of proof as arbitrators in collective bargaining units when appealing personnel actions. The MSPB has the authority to mitigate penalties imposed by agencies for misconduct, including when penalties are deemed excessive, disproportionate, or unreasonable. Factors considered include the nature of the offense, the employee's duties, and past disciplinary record. Penalties for unacceptable performance under chapter 43 of title 5, U.S. Code, cannot be mitigated by the MSPB. The MSPB can mitigate penalties for misconduct but not for unacceptable performance under chapter 43 of title 5, U.S. Code. The Federal Circuit in Lisiecki v. MSPB emphasized that chapter 43 actions should not be subject to penalty mitigation, as it would give agencies more authority than intended by Congress. The court highlighted that chapter 43 has specific standards that do not apply to misconduct cases, such as a lighter burden of proof for agency actions. The MSPB can mitigate penalties for misconduct but not for unacceptable performance under chapter 43 of title 5, U.S. Code. Cases involving adverse personnel actions and discrimination allegations may be reviewed by both the MSPB and the EEOC. In \"mixed cases,\" the Board decides on both discrimination issues and appealable actions, which can be further appealed to the EEOC. If the EEOC does not review the Board's decision, it becomes judicially reviewable. An employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice involving discrimination can raise the matter under a statutory or negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. If the employee chooses a negotiated grievance procedure, they can request MSPB review of an arbitrator's final decision. Federal employees adversely affected by an MSPB final order can seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit within 60 days. The Federal Circuit reviews these cases deferentially to the MSPB's determination. The Federal Circuit reviews MSPB decisions deferentially, upholding them in 93 to 96 percent of cases. The court can only set aside agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence. The Supreme Court has emphasized the narrow scope of review, stating that the Federal Circuit should not substitute its judgment for that of the Board. The Federal Circuit reviews MSPB decisions deferentially, affirming them in 93 to 96 percent of cases. The CSRA grants the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of MSPB final decisions, except for \"mixed cases\" involving federal antidiscrimination laws. In mixed cases, affected employees can seek judicial review in federal district court under a de novo standard, bypassing the Federal Circuit. This special jurisdictional rule has led to challenges in its application. Two recent Supreme Court decisions, Kloeckner v. Solis and Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board, highlight issues courts face in reviewing MSPB decisions on mixed cases. In Kloeckner, the Court addressed the appropriate forum for review when the Board dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds. Different courts have reached varying conclusions on cases dismissed for procedural reasons. In Kloeckner, a former Labor Department employee's discrimination claim was dismissed by the MSPB as untimely. In Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board, the Supreme Court held that when the MSPB decides a mixed case, the proper forum for review is the district court, regardless of the reason for dismissal. The case involved a U.S. Census Bureau employee who appealed to the MSPB after reaching a settlement with the agency. Traditionally, lower courts had considered the Federal Circuit as the appropriate court for such cases. The employee appealed to the MSPB after separation from service, but the Board found it voluntary and outside its jurisdiction. The case was transferred to the Federal Circuit, where the Supreme Court, in a 6-2 decision, reversed the judgment. The Court's decision was based on the interpretation of statutory language in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702 regarding district court review of mixed cases. The Court's decision in a mixed case appeal hinges on the nature of the employee's claim, not the MSPB's jurisdiction. Previous rulings show that jurisdictional dismissals in mixed cases are not treated differently, and employees can seek judicial review if they allege serious adverse actions due to federal antidiscrimination violations. In cases involving the agency's violation of federal antidiscrimination laws, judicial review is typically done in the district court. Recent legislation has expanded judicial review of MSPB decisions for certain cases, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 and the All Circuit Review Act of 2018. These laws allow employees to appeal MSPB decisions to the Federal Circuit or federal circuit court of appeals in specific circumstances. The new Act extends the jurisdiction of federal circuit courts to hear whistleblower protection cases, promoting robust implementation of whistleblower laws. This expanded accountability aims to prevent circuit splits and strengthen whistleblower protections. The MSPB currently has no sitting members. Board member Mark A. Robbins, who served as the MSPB's Acting Chairman, ended his term on February 28, 2019. The Board has lacked a quorum since January 8, 2017, hindering decision-making and finalizing cases. Approximately 1,800 cases were pending as of December 31, 2018, with the absence of a quorum also limiting the Board's ability to publish reports or promulgate new regulations. In 2018, President Trump nominated three individuals for leadership positions at the MSPB, but they were not confirmed by the Senate before the adjournment of the 115th Congress. In 2019, the nominations were resubmitted for consideration by the 116th Congress. Two nominees were approved by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, but the nominee for Vice Chairman withdrew from consideration. The committee's chairman stated that he will not advance the two nominees until a third member is nominated and supported by the committee."
