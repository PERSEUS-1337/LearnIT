    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the significant impact of housing and transportation costs on family incomes in California. Los Angeles County voters have approved multiple sales tax measures for transportation projects to improve commuter and transit services. In 1980, Los Angeles County voters approved Proposition A, a sales tax of 0.5% on retail sales. 25% of proceeds go to cities for transportation, 35% for rail development, and 40% for discretionary purposes, mainly funding bus services. In 1990, voters in Los Angeles County approved Proposition C, adding a 0.5% sales tax on retail sales. The MTA allocates 20% of proceeds to cities for transportation, 40% for bus transit and rail system, 5% for security, 10% for commuter rail and transit centers, and 25% for freeway improvements. In 2008, voters in Los Angeles County approved Measure R, a sales tax increase of 0.5% to fund traffic relief and rail expansion. The tax became effective in 2009 and will last for 30 years. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is responsible for using the funding according to voter-approved rules. The ordinance imposing the tax for transportation projects must include an expenditure plan, conform to tax laws, and limit administrative costs to 1.5% of total tax revenues. The net revenues from the tax must be used by the MTA to fund transportation projects and programs identified in the expenditure plan. The net revenues from the tax must be used by the MTA to fund transportation projects and programs identified in the expenditure plan. A percentage of these revenues will be allocated to municipal transit operators in Los Angeles County and the MTA, specifically from the tax imposed by this section and not from local discretionary sources. The funds allocated by the MTA to itself and municipal operators must be used for transit operations and cannot replace funds from other sources allocated for public transit. The MTA shall allocate funds to municipal transit operators for public transit operations. The MTA shall allocate funds to municipal transit operators for public transit operations. The MTA shall notify the Legislature prior to adopting amendments to the expenditure plan. The ordinance for the tax shall be adopted by the MTA board and submitted to voters for approval.
