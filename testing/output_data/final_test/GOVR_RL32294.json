President Pr\u00e9val has been praised for efforts to bring Haiti out of conflict and into development by both USAID and President Bush. There is bipartisan support in Congress, as shown by the passage of the HOPE Act of 2006 for Haiti. The HOPE Act of 2006 (H.R. 6142) was included in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 as Title V (P.L. 109-432). Supporters believed it could create 20,000 jobs in Haiti, with 4,500 jobs already generated. Haitian officials and business leaders are hoping for an expansion of the benefits to attract new investors and create more jobs. The U.S. government is providing close to $4 million to support Senate elections in Haiti. In Haiti, elections were postponed due to accusations of embezzlement within the electoral commission. President Pr\u00e9val expressed concerns about the cost of multiple elections required by the constitution. There have been debates on constitutional reform since October 2007. The Pr\u00e9val Administration published a Poverty Reduction Strategy in November 2007 to meet IMF conditions for debt relief. Haiti still needs to meet certain conditions before receiving roughly $1.54 billion in foreign aid. Haiti needs to meet certain conditions before its $1.54 billion foreign debt is cancelled, mostly owed to the IMF and World Bank. The UN Security Council extended the mandate of the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti, focusing on securing borders and increasing police presence. During his August 2007 visit to Haiti, he praised President Pr\u00e9val's efforts to fight corruption and reform the country's police, judiciary, and prison systems. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized 1,056 pounds of cocaine and arrested three drug smugglers near Hispaniola. Concerns are rising about Haiti and the Dominican Republic becoming major drug transhipment points. Some Members of Congress are calling for more joint interdiction efforts and counternarcotics assistance, as outlined in H.R. 4986. In 2008, an Administration report to Congress on counternarcotics assistance to Haiti was required. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest of the radical left, won a landslide victory in the 1990 elections. Facing serious social, economic, and political problems, Aristide received mixed reviews after eight months in office. He was credited with curbing crime and reducing the number of state employees. Jean-Bertrand Aristide faced criticism for his handling of democracy, appointments, and the judicial system during his tenure as president of Haiti. Despite reducing human rights violations, he was accused of condoning mob violence and contributing to political polarization. During his presidency, Jean-Bertrand Aristide faced criticism for his handling of democracy and the judicial system. He was overthrown by the military after allegedly threatening the bourgeoisie. Aristide's administration was praised for improving human rights and addressing the needs of the poor majority. However, progress was undone by the military regime that followed, leading to an increase in disappearances. Aristide's term was credited with creating a greater sense of security in Haiti. The military coup in Haiti led to international sanctions and pressure to restore constitutional democracy. The US government under Presidents George H. W. Bush and William J. Clinton cut off assistance, imposed trade embargoes, and supported diplomatic efforts by the OAS and UN. The collapse of the Governors Island Accord in Haiti led to increased pressure on the Clinton Administration to restore democracy. Tougher sanctions were imposed, leading to a military intervention that resulted in Aristide's return to power in September 1994. President Aristide returned to Haiti in October 1994 under the protection of 20,000 U.S. troops. The U.S. transferred responsibility for the mission to the United Nations in March 1995. Aristide worked to break the association of the military-dominated police force with human rights abuses by demobilizing the old military, establishing an interim police force, and training a civilian Haitian National Police force. Violence, refugee flight, and alleged assassinations decreased significantly under his administration. Aristide also took steps to hold democratic elections in 1995. In 1995, President Aristide organized democratic elections with help from the US and international community. Despite some irregularities, pro-Aristide candidates won many seats in parliamentary and municipal elections. Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, an Aristide supporter, won the presidential election with 89% of votes but faced low voter turnout and party boycotts. Pr\u00e9val took office in February 1996 and initiated privatization efforts despite public protests. In 1997, Haiti faced economic reforms and privatization laws despite public protests. Former President Aristide criticized austerity measures and formed a new party for the 2000 presidential bid. The 2000 parliamentary elections aimed to resolve disputes from 1997, leading to a year and a half without a prime minister and unresolved election controversies. In January 1999, President Pr\u00e9val declared Parliament's term expired and ruled by decree until February 2001. He signed a new electoral law in July 1999, annulling disputed elections and organizing new ones with US aid. The provisional electoral council registered voters and held elections for legislative and municipal positions in May 2000. In May 2000, Haiti held elections for all elected positions except for president and eight Senate seats. The results were marred by irregularities, leading to protests against the ruling Lavalas party. Efforts to broker an agreement between Lavalas and the opposition failed, and presidential elections were held in November 2000. The November 26, 2000 elections in Haiti saw low turnout and opposition boycotts due to earlier contested results. Despite winning with 91.5% of the vote, Aristide promised reforms in a letter to outgoing President Clinton. The Bush administration accepted these reforms, and Aristide took office on February 7, 2001. During President Aristide's second term, concerns over security and police effectiveness increased. In 2001, Aristide announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy towards suspected criminals, leading to extrajudicial killings by the Haitian National Police and lynchings by mobs. The government's respect for freedom of the press deteriorated, with reports of serious abuses and corruption charges. The interim government (2004-2006) accused the ousted Aristide Administration of embezzling millions of public funds, with illegal transfers to private institutions and personal foreign accounts. A lawsuit was filed in U.S. federal court alleging Aristide and others broke U.S. law. Allegations of corruption and misuse of public funds plagued Aristide's second term, with Haiti being labeled as one of the most corrupt countries by Transparency International. Haiti was labeled as one of the most corrupt countries by Transparency International. Efforts to resolve electoral disputes frustrated the international community for years. The OAS mediated talks between the Aristide government and the opposition, leading to an agreement for new elections but with disagreements on the schedule. Tensions and violence escalated in Haiti after Aristide's second term began. In January 2002, the OAS established a mission in Haiti to ensure security for free elections. A report in July 2002 revealed that the opposition was not involved in an attack on the National Palace, and accused the government of arming militants who targeted opposition members. Despite calls for new elections, all OAS member states recognized Aristide as Haiti's legitimate leader. In September 2002, the OAS passed Resolution 822 to address the political impasse in Haiti by recognizing the government's electoral prerogatives. The resolution aimed to facilitate legislative and local elections in 2003, with the establishment of a new Provisional Electoral Council. Haiti failed to meet the deadline for setting up the council by November 4, 2002. Haiti missed the deadline to establish a neutral CEP by November 4, 2002, due to the Democratic Convergence's refusal to name a representative until security issues were addressed. Aristide appointed a partial CEP in February 2003, but elections did not occur in 2003 despite OAS Resolution 1959 urging the government and opposition to fulfill their obligations. The U.S. Ambassador to Haiti in November 2003 expressed concerns about the country's state of poverty, insecurity, and lack of development. The human rights situation in Haiti has deteriorated, with ongoing impunity for violators, dysfunction in the justice system, and violent suppression of freedom of expression. The U.S. Secretary of State supported a proposal for a council of advisors to help govern until new elections, but the opposition accused the government of corruption. In January 2004, CARICOM secured Aristide's agreement to disarm political gangs, appoint a new prime minister, and form an advisory council. Opposition groups refused to negotiate unless Aristide resigned. Armed rebels seized Gonaives, leading to street battles and dozens dead. CARICOM continued to try to negotiate a solution to the crisis. The Bush Administration sought a peaceful solution to the crisis in Haiti, increasing pressure on Aristide to resign as rebel forces moved towards the capital. Aristide resigned the next day and flew into exile. Following Aristide's resignation, Chief Justice Boniface Alexandre was sworn in as President of Haiti on February 29. The United Nations authorized an international force to restore order, initially comprising U.S. Marines, French, and Canadian forces, later replaced by U.N. peacekeepers in June 2004. A tripartite commission was formed to help run an interim government, while CARICOM called for an investigation into Aristide's resignation. During a demonstration in March 2004, protesters called for exiled Aristide to stand trial for corruption and human rights violations. Six people were killed by suspected Aristide loyalists, and U.S. Marines killed at least six Haitians. Aristide, speaking from exile in the Central African Republic, asserted his presidency and called for peaceful resistance. After visiting Jamaica, Aristide's presence was deemed disruptive to Haiti's fragile order. Aristide agreed not to campaign for reinstatement as president during his visit. Aristide went into exile in South Africa on May 31, 2004, making the formation of a legitimate transitional government difficult. Boniface Alexandre was named interim President on February 29, 2004, without confirmation by a functioning legislature. A tripartite commission helped establish an interim government headed by Prime Minister G\u00e9rard LaTortue. The interim government in Haiti, led by Prime Minister G\u00e9rard LaTortue, included representatives from Aristide's Lavalas Family party, the civil opposition, and the international community. The new minister of Interior and National Security was H\u00e9rard Abraham, a former head of the Haitian army during Aristide's first term. Elections were delayed but eventually took place in February and April 2006, with a new president taking office on February 7, 2006. Colin Powell visited Haiti to show support for the interim government. During his visit to Haiti in April 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell announced several U.S. initiatives to support the interim government. These included deploying a team to advise on security, implementing an employment generation program, providing technical assistance to the Finance Ministry, and funding democracy building activities. Additionally, the U.S. pledged $9 million to the OAS Special Mission for Strengthening Democracy in Haiti and $500,000 for elections-related activities. Relations between the U.S. and Caribbean governments were strained during the interim government's tenure in Haiti. CARICOM nations did not recognize the LaTortue government and maintained that Aristide was the legitimate leader. The Bush Administration reiterated its support for democracy in Haiti during congressional hearings in 2004. Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega defended the decision not to send troops while Aristide was in Haiti, citing his continued support for violence. Several Members of Congress criticized the Bush Administration for its role in Aristide's departure from Haiti, questioning the lack of assistance provided to stop escalating violence until Aristide resigned. Concerns were raised about the dangerous precedent set by the ouster of a democratically elected government and calls were made for independent investigations into the coup d'\u00e9tat. Observers also expressed worry about the impact of Aristide's resistance call on efforts to restore order and stability in Haiti. Concerns were raised about the civil opposition in Haiti and their rejection of political solutions not involving Aristide's resignation. Questions were raised about the opposition's unified agenda and their relationship with armed rebels. International donors pledged over $1 billion to help Haiti rebuild. Donors pledged over $1 billion to assist Haiti in rebuilding its infrastructure and improving basic services. The U.S. committed $230 million for FY2004-FY2005. An agreement was signed with the U.N. and OAS for elections in 2005, leading to concerns about political persecution and military actions after Aristide's departure. After Aristide's departure, former military personnel demanded reinstatement of the disbanded Haitian army. The U.S. government and human rights organizations objected to armed rebels having a formal role in Haitian security forces. In April 2004, Prime Minister LaTortue referred to rebels as \"freedom fighters,\" and negotiations were held with former paramilitary leaders for their fighters to join the police force. Chamberlain and Guy Philippe, both with controversial backgrounds, were involved in these discussions. In June 2004, concerns were raised about the LaTortue government's handling of former soldiers and armed rebels in Haiti. Critics described the government as weak and partisan, pointing out rushed trials and difficulties in organizing elections. The State Department and Amnesty International voiced concerns about ongoing violence and human rights violations hindering political participation. The interim government in Haiti faced criticism for human rights abuses against Aristide supporters, with many being jailed without charge. Despite this, some reforms were enacted, such as preparing a budget for FY2005 and making progress on objectives outlined at the International Donors Conference on Haiti in July 2004. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) took over authority on June 1, 2004. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) took over authority on June 1, 2004, with a mandate to ensure a secure environment, support democratic governance, and protect human rights. Despite initial troop shortages, the mission aimed for a force of 8,000 personnel, including military troops and civilian police from various countries. The United States contributed four military advisers and 25 civilian police to the mission. MINUSTAH was established in April 2004 to assist Haiti after flooding and hurricanes. The mission helped deliver emergency aid and urged donors to disburse $1 billion in aid. Despite complaints from both the Haitian government and MINUSTAH about security efforts, joint operations in October 2004 improved the situation. A disarmament program was initiated in late summer 2006. The U.N. Security Council visited Haiti in April 2005 to address poverty and instability, emphasizing the need for long-term development and elections. They called for the implementation of a disarmament program and extended MINUSTAH's mandate until February 2006, with support for a continued U.N. presence in Haiti. MINUSTAH, consisting of 800 military personnel and 275 civilian police, was restructured to enhance security for the upcoming elections. Despite crackdowns on street gangs in 2005, gangs still operate in Port-au-Prince. U.N. Special Envoy reported stabilization in Haiti but warned of potential election disruptions by violent groups. Some violence occurred during the February 7 elections, but the situation calmed down, and subsequent elections were relatively peaceful. Human rights activists accused U.N. peacekeepers of civilian killings and the U.S. government of arming abusive security forces. MINUSTAH's mandate must be renewed every six months, with debates in Brazil and Chile about their troops' role in the mission. President Pr\u00e9val requested the mission to stay, emphasizing the need for security until Haiti is ready to take over. The interim government signed an agreement with foreign forces despite calls for their removal. The interim government in Haiti signed an agreement with the U.N. and the OAS in August 2005 to hold elections in fall 2005. The U.N. established a trust fund for the elections, starting with $9 million in U.S. funds. Elections were postponed multiple times due to concerns about the conditions for free and fair elections. Technical preparations such as ballot preparation and voter registration were cited as reasons for the delays. Former President Aristide's party threatened to boycott the elections. Members of former President Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party faced political persecution by the interim government, with arrests of party members including Aristide's former Prime Minister. Reverend G\u00e9rard Jean-Juste was arrested for alleged involvement in a journalist's abduction and murder, which many viewed as dubious. His release in 2006 for leukemia treatment in Miami raised suspicions of an attempt to prevent him from running for President. The electoral council later revised the slate of presidential candidates. Former President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, a popular candidate, ran as an independent with support from grassroots Lavalas members. The Lavalas party, split over its nomination, had priest G\u00e9rard Jean-Juste disqualified and supported coalition candidate Marc Bazin. Leadership supported coalition candidate Marc Bazin, a technocrat who once worked for the World Bank. Critics labeled Bazin an opportunist for running under Aristide's party after criticizing him. Other notable candidates included historian Leslie Manigat, businessman Charles Henri Baker, and rebel leader Guy Philippe. Philippe, a former member of the Haitian military, fled the country. Three candidates ran for President in Haiti. Guy Philippe, a former member of the Haitian military, fled into exile after being accused of involvement in a coup attempt. Dany Toussaint, former Head of the interim National Police, lost U.S. support due to perceived political bias. Dumarsais Simeus, a wealthy businessman, was barred from running for not meeting citizenship requirements. In October, Haiti's supreme court overruled a decision barring Dumarsais Simeus from running for president due to dual nationality. Former President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val won the first round of elections in February 2006, causing protests due to not reaching the necessary 50% to avoid a second round. In February 2006, former President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val won the first round of elections in Haiti but did not reach the necessary 50% to avoid a second round. His supporters launched protests, and after negotiations, the count was retabulated by distributing blank ballots among the candidates. This pushed Pr\u00e9val's total to over 51%, and he was declared the winner on February 16. Former President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val won the legislative runoff elections in Haiti with high voter turnout and limited violence. Despite controversies such as missing and illegible ballots, international observers deemed the elections fair. Pr\u00e9val, estranged from former mentor Aristide, acknowledged as president but faces challenges with Aristide's supporters expecting his return from exile. The legislative elections in Haiti saw former President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val winning with high voter turnout and limited violence. Despite controversies, international observers deemed the elections fair. Pr\u00e9val's party, Lespwa, won the most seats in the legislature, but only two out of 1,300 legislative candidates secured a post in the first round. Runoff elections were held for the remaining seats on April 21. Publicly, Pr\u00e9val acknowledged Aristide's constitutional right to return but privately agreed with foreign diplomats that Aristide's return would be destabilizing. Lespwa (\"Hope\" in Creole) won the most seats in the legislature but not enough for a majority. Voter turnout was high for the presidential election but low for the second round determining the legislature composition. Allegations of fraud in the second round were dismissed by international observers. President-elect Pr\u00e9val emphasized the need for a strong parliament to address the country's issues. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val's main missions for his government are to build institutions and create conditions for private investment to generate jobs. He seeks international support for Haiti, emphasizing the need for long-term assistance. The international community has pledged continued support through the Interim Cooperation Framework. The international community pledged support for Haiti's newly elected officials, discussing technical and material assistance for various institutions. They also planned to help develop a long-term Poverty Reduction Plan to succeed the Interim Cooperation Framework. The Pr\u00e9val Administration created an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2007-2009, focusing on macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction, and sustainable growth driven by private initiative. The Haitian government's Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2007-2009 focuses on infrastructure, energy, education, health, and security as key priorities. President Pr\u00e9val has criticized slow fund dispersal by international donors and has prioritized improving security due to high crime and kidnapping rates. The country's failing justice system, overcrowded prisons, and corrupt police force are identified as top areas in need of reform. President Pr\u00e9val has identified insecure prisons, weak and corrupted police force, and the need for reform in Haiti. He has requested the U.N. mission to stay in Haiti, emphasizing the importance of not withdrawing prematurely. Pr\u00e9val plans to dissolve the Haitian army and invest the funds in education and infrastructure. He has urged MINUSTAH to enhance training for the Haitian police force and secure the country's borders. U.S. government reports from 2007 also highlighted challenges in combating narcotics and improving human rights in Haiti. The 2007 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report stated that Haiti is a major transit country for cocaine due to weak institutions and corruption. Drug smuggling flights from Venezuela to Haiti increased by 167% from 2005 to 2006. The State Department's human rights report noted some improvements but stated that Haiti's human rights record remained poor in 2006. The Bush Administration expressed support for President Pr\u00e9val, with top officials meeting with him and offering assistance for public works. In March 2006, President-elect Pr\u00e9val sought U.S. support for public works projects and cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts. Legislation for preferential trade treatment for Haiti was introduced in September 2006 and approved in December 2006. President Pr\u00e9val visited the U.S. in May 2007, where President Bush praised his efforts to improve Haiti's economic conditions and rule of law. President Pr\u00e9val has restored Haiti and is seeking American investors. He announced an anti-corruption campaign at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but some U.S. officials are concerned about ties with Venezuela. U.S. priorities for Haiti include improving security, economic development, and democratic processes. An interim assistance strategy is being implemented to address Haiti's needs. The challenge is to boost public and investor confidence with short-term projects while pursuing long-term development. President Pr\u00e9val is working to restore Haiti and attract American investors, focusing on anti-corruption measures and addressing ties with Venezuela. U.S. priorities for Haiti include security, economic development, and democratic processes. International donors have pledged over $1 billion to support Haiti's long-term development plans and improve living conditions for the poor population. The challenge lies in Haiti's transition to democracy, with political parties driven by personalities rather than platforms, and a lack of political compromise. Analysts emphasize the need for a consensus on political development and poverty reduction to move beyond the current political stalemate. At a July 2004 conference on Haiti, international donors pledged more than $1 billion over the following two years to help Haiti rebuild its infrastructure, strengthen institutions, and improve basic services. The U.N. and OAS played major roles in supporting the Haitian election process, with financial and technical support from the United States and other donors. OAS activities included registering voters, setting up polling sites, monitoring the election, and certifying results. In July 2006, international donors pledged $750 million to bridge Haiti's needs. In July 2006, international donors pledged $750 million to support Haiti's reconstruction projects and budget gap. The international community, including the Bush Administration and Congress, is committed to ensuring free and fair elections in Haiti, with the U.S. government providing close to $4 million for the senate elections in 2008. In November 2007, the U.S. government allocated nearly $4 million to support senate elections in Haiti, which were delayed due to accusations of embezzlement. President Pr\u00e9val expressed concerns about the country's ability to afford multiple required elections. The Clinton Administration provided significant foreign assistance to Haiti from FY1996 to FY1999, and the Bush Administration redirected humanitarian aid through NGOs in response to election disputes. The Bush Administration redirected humanitarian aid through NGOs in response to election disputes in Haiti. Aid decreased at the end of the Clinton Administration and the first two years of the Bush Administration, but increased in subsequent years, reaching $187.6 million in FY2005. This aid included health care, nutrition, and education support. After the collapse of the Aristide government, U.S. aid in Haiti focused on job creation, government infrastructure support, improved security, and elections. The Bush Administration supported adding more military and civilian police to MINUSTAH to enhance security and disarmament efforts. The expansion of the U.N. mission was estimated to cost the U.S. additional funds. The U.S. estimated that expanding the U.N. mission in Haiti would cost an additional $16-18 million in FY2006. U.S. assistance to Haiti in FY2006 totaled $225.7 million, including funds for HIV/AIDS and supplemental assistance. In FY2007, assistance was around $214.8 million, and the FY2008 request was nearly $223 million, with allocations for HIV/AIDS and urban crime prevention. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided at least $201.5 million in economic and military assistance to Haiti. Military Financing for Haiti is subject to regular notification procedures and includes restrictions on certain INCLE funding. The joint explanatory statement recommends $68.4 million in ESF assistance and $5 million in development assistance for USAID's reforestation program. Aid allocated to Haiti for FY2008 will be available with the FY2009 budget request. Haiti receives legislative-strengthening assistance from the House Democracy Assistance Commission. Congress closely monitors aid to Haiti and has set conditions on assistance over the years. The FY2000 foreign aid act (P.L. 106-113) outlined congressional priorities for assistance to Haiti, including support for the Haitian National Police, free and fair elections, human rights monitoring, privatization, agricultural development, and economic development fund. The FY2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-429) prohibited aid to Haiti until free and fair elections were held and cooperation with U.S. efforts to combat drug trafficking. The FY2002 foreign aid appropriations law (P.L. 107-115) had conditions related to aid for Haiti. The FY2003 foreign assistance appropriations act (P.L. 108-7) allocated \"not less than $52.5 million\" in food assistance program funds to Haiti, with no other conditions on aid. The FY2004 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 108-199, Division D) allowed Haiti to purchase defense articles for the Coast Guard, prohibited visas for individuals involved in extrajudicial killings, and allocated funds for healthcare and education for Haitian refugees. The FY2005 consolidated appropriations act (P.L. 108-447, Conference Report H.Rept. 108-792) allocated funds for various programs in Haiti, including child survival, development assistance, judicial reform, police training, national elections, and maternal and child health activities. It also allowed Haiti to purchase defense articles for its Coast Guard and expressed disappointment in the Haitian government's handling of human rights issues. The FY2005 consolidated appropriations act (P.L. 108-447, Conference Report H.Rept. 108-792) allocated funds for various programs in Haiti, including child survival, development assistance, judicial reform, police training, national elections, and maternal and child health activities. It also allowed Haiti to purchase defense articles for its Coast Guard and expressed disappointment in the Haitian government's handling of human rights issues. Additionally, a portion of an additional $100 million appropriated by Congress in supplemental disaster assistance for the Caribbean region (P.L. 108-324) was allocated to Haiti. The emergency supplemental appropriations act for FY2005 (P.L. 109-13) provided $20 million in Economic Support Funds for Haiti. In FY2006, $116.215 million was made available for Haiti, with funds allocated for various programs including Child Survival and Health Programs, Development Assistance, Economic Support Funds, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Foreign Military Financing, and International Military Education and Training. The government of Haiti was allowed to purchase defense articles for the Coast Guard under the Arms Export Control Act. The 109th Congress prohibited the transfer of excess weapons to Haiti until certain conditions were met, including vetting senior levels of the Haitian National Police and suspending those accused of serious crimes. This was in response to bipartisan support for Haitian development after Pr\u00e9val's 2006 election. The supplemental bill (H.R. 4939, P.L. 109-234) signed into law on June 15, 2006, provided an additional $20 million for Haiti, including funds for Child Survival and Health, police and judicial reform, and job creation programs. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill allocated roughly $182.3 million for Haiti, with aid conditions from FY2006 continued. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act stipulated restrictions on certain funds for Haiti, following similar restrictions in previous foreign operations laws. The FY2006 foreign operations law (P.L. 109-102) included funding for Haiti. Various trade preference bills were introduced in Congress, with the Senate passing the HERO Act of 2004 (S. 2261) for Haiti's trade benefits. The House Ways and Means Trade subcommittee held a hearing on the issue in September 2004. Supporters introduced new HERO bills in the 109th Congress in fall 2005. In fall 2005, the 109th Congress sought Administration support for the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act of 2006 (H.R. 6142), which aimed to generate 40,000 jobs in Haiti. The bill had more restrictive rules for apparel components than the HERO bills and was included in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 as Title V (P.L. 109-432). Some U.S. textile interests opposed the bill due to preferences for garments with components from China and Asia. New legislation in the 110th Congress (H.R. 1001 and S. 222) aimed to delay the implementation of the HOPE bill. Additionally, concerns were raised about human rights and security conditions in Haiti. Haiti made progress in protecting human rights by demobilizing the military and establishing a professional police force with U.S. assistance. Despite improvements, political tensions and impunity threatened these gains. President Aristide's \"zero tolerance\" policy towards criminals led to concerns over security and police effectiveness. After President Aristide's departure in February 2004, Haiti faced numerous extrajudicial killings by the National Police and lynchings by mobs. The government's respect for press freedom deteriorated, with officials implicated in serious abuses. The interim government struggled with security amid prison destruction and prisoner escapes in early 2004. Gangs linked to former army and pro-Aristide forces remained armed, while the understaffed police force struggled to maintain stability. Amnesty granted to convicted criminals in January 2005 added to the instability. The Haitian National Police are understaffed and under-equipped, facing human rights abuses. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) initially lacked troops and police. U.N. peacekeepers struggled to establish law and order due to resource diversion for emergency assistance. Prime Minister LaTortue requested U.S. troops in 2004, but only 4 were stationed in Haiti. The U.S. Department of Defense did not send troops to Haiti, but approximately 250 U.S. military personnel participated in a civic assistance program to support Latortue's government. Concerns over human rights violations were raised by leaders of the armed rebellion, including Louis Jodel Chamblain and Guy Philippe, both former members of the Haitian military. Chamblain, accused of leading death squads responsible for violence in Haiti, was acquitted in a retrial in 2004, prompting deep concern from the Bush Administration about the rule of law in Haiti. Louis Jodel Chamblain and Guy Philippe, former members of the Haitian military, were involved in accusations of human rights violations and coup attempts. Philippe fled into exile after being accused of a coup attempt in 2000 and later declared himself the head of the Haitian army in 2004. The disbandment of the Haitian army in 1995 led to protests by former soldiers demanding its restoration. President-elect Pr\u00e9val planned to finalize the dissolution of the army through a constitutional amendment. Several Aristide supporters faced persecution, with some committing human rights violations. Militant supporters threatened violence if Aristide was not restored to office. Lavalas party officials denied inciting violence and blamed the government. Human rights abuses against Aristide supporters were reported by the State Department and Amnesty International. Hundreds of Aristide supporters were jailed without charge, including former Prime Minister Yvon Neptune held for 16 months. Calls were made for the release of Neptune and others held without charge. Yvon Neptune was charged in September 2005 with masterminding political opponents' murder in St. Marc. A U.N. expert stated there was no massacre, just confrontations leading to deaths. Neptune was indicted without a jury, deemed unconstitutional, and the case was sent to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. He was released in July 2006. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern over alleged serious misconduct by Haitian National Police officers. In August, National Police officers were allegedly involved in the summary execution of nine individuals at a football game. Haiti's Chief of Police announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy for police involvement in criminal activities on November 2. Over 20 officers were arrested for drug trafficking, kidnapping, and extrajudicial murders. In 2005, kidnapping became frequent and deadly, leading to warnings for U.S. citizens to leave Haiti. The Peace Corps withdrew its volunteers in June. The U.S. State Department modified its travel warning on November 22, allowing some personnel to return to Haiti. The State Department warns visitors and residents of Haiti to remain vigilant due to the absence of an effective police force. The warning was updated in 2007 to highlight the chronic danger of kidnappings, with over 60 U.S. citizens kidnapped in 2006. The interim government's poor human rights record in 2005 included arbitrary killings, prolonged detention, excessive force, corruption, abuse of women and children, and trafficking. The interim government in Haiti made progress in judicial and police reform, but arbitrary killings continued by various actors, including former army members, political party members, and street gangs. President Pr\u00e9val acknowledged the need for MINUSTAH due to weak institutions. A disarmament program was initiated in 2006, but the State Department's report highlighted ongoing human rights abuses by the government. In 2005, there were incidents of HNP committing extrajudicial killings of civilians in Haiti. Other human rights issues included arbitrary arrests, overcrowded prisons, discrimination against women and children, child trafficking, and ineffective measures against gang-related crime. The United States has maintained an arms embargo on Haiti since 1991, with exceptions considered on a case-by-case basis. Haiti remains on the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations list. The Bush Administration has transferred and allowed the sale of arms to the Haitian government since President Aristide's departure. Concerns have been raised about these transfers to security forces with a history of human rights abuses. In 2004, excess U.S. law enforcement weapons were given to the Haitian National Police, followed by arms sales worth $1.9 million in 2005. The U.S. government approved the sale of $1.9 million worth of arms to the interim Haitian government, including various types of weapons. The arms were delivered to Haiti in 2005 but were held by the U.S. government for registration and police training. The FY2006 foreign operations appropriations act prohibited the use of funds for transferring excess weapons to Haiti. The FY2006 foreign operations appropriations act prohibited the transfer of excess weapons to Haiti until certain reforms were carried out by the United Nations Mission in Haiti and the interim Haitian government for the Haitian National Police and judicial system as called for in UN Security Council Resolution 1608. The Bush Administration partially lifted the arms embargo against Haiti in October 2006 to allow the government to purchase arms for the Haitian National Police. In December 2006, the Haitian government started vetting police recruits to exclude those involved in serious crimes. Haiti, a key conduit for cocaine trafficking, faces challenges due to its uncontrolled coasts and dysfunctional legal system. The police academy graduated a class of 500 with U.S.-supported training and arms provided since 2005. The country has experienced a surge in air smuggling of cocaine from Venezuela. Haiti's judicial system is dysfunctional, with authorities inexperienced and lacking resources to control drug trafficking. Despite some efforts by the Aristide government, drug trafficking organizations still operate with impunity in the country. According to the State Department's March 2004 report, high-level government and police officials in Haiti were allegedly involved in drug trafficking. Former President Aristide was also implicated in drug trafficking. Despite poor counter narcotics performance, President Bush continued providing aid to Haiti due to national interest. The Administration attributed Haitian involvement in the drug trade to poverty and hopelessness. President Bush determined in 2004 and 2005 that Haiti remained a major drug transit country. In 2004 and 2005, President Bush determined Haiti as a major drug transit country. The interim government took limited counternarcotics actions, but concerns remained about sustained efforts. President Pr\u00e9val criticized U.S. anti-drug efforts but pledged cooperation with the DEA. In 2006, President Bush acknowledged Haiti's mandate to control crime and drug trafficking. Admiral Stravidis pledged more support at a regional summit in 2007. In March 2007, Admiral James Stravidis pledged increased U.S. assistance to secure the Haiti-Dominican Republic border, leading to a decline in drug shipments from Venezuela. The Haitian government recorded a record drug bust in June 2007. Current immigration policy focuses on migrant interdiction at sea and mandatory detention of undocumented Haitians. Congressional debate centers on whether interdicted Haitians are economic migrants or refugees fearing persecution. Some Members and human rights advocates are concerned about the treatment of Haitians seeking asylum in the United States. President Bush stated that Haitian \"refugees\" intercepted at sea will be sent back to Haiti. Attorney General John Ashcroft ruled in 2003 that unauthorized Haitian migrants can be detained indefinitely due to national security reasons. The Administration aims to deter mass migration from Haiti and protect border security priorities. There are concerns that terrorists may pose as Haitian asylum seekers, a claim disputed by immigrant advocates and some U.S. consular officials. In October 2004, the Haitian government requested Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians in the United States to prevent deportation of undocumented Haitians. A bill was introduced in Congress in May 2005 to make Haitians eligible for TPS, following the precedent of Central Americans granted TPS after Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The Department of Homeland Security continues to monitor events in Haiti. The Department of Homeland Security continues to monitor events in Haiti. A bill seeking TPS for Haitians has been filed in Congress, offering resident status and work papers for up to 18 months.

Despite challenges like lack of security and road conditions, progress is being made in building health networks. The international effort in Haiti is making progress in building health networks and providing food assistance, but more support is needed for sustained shelter, food security, and health care. Concerns also exist for Haitians in the Dominican Republic receiving adequate humanitarian assistance. Various international humanitarian actors, including MINUSTAH, U.N. agencies, and USAID, are involved in relief efforts. Congress approved $100 million in emergency assistance for Caribbean countries affected by natural disasters, including Haiti. The United States and other donors are providing ongoing humanitarian assistance to Haiti, with a two-year plan extended through September 2007. Donors are helping Haiti develop a long-term Poverty Reduction Strategy due to its agricultural economy's challenges. Haiti's limited arable land makes it vulnerable to natural disasters. Haiti faces challenges in its farming sector due to insufficient arable land. Farmers resort to unsustainable methods like deforestation for wood fuel, leading to soil erosion and decreased agricultural production. The country's high deforestation rate of 5.7% from 1990 to 2000 is a concern, with only 3.2% of land remaining forested by 2000. The government and international donors prioritize promoting sustainable resource use and halting land degradation to address environmental issues in Haiti.
