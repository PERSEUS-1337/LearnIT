The biological sequence of proteins is crucial for the formation and functioning of cells in the human body, with DNA and RNA playing key roles in carrying genetic instructions. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of RNA in biological processes, specifically in the CDRE of genes for communication in organisms. It highlights the significance of proper feature extraction for machine learning algorithms in gene studies. The focus is on protein family classification using existing data and unsupervised methods. This work focuses on protein family classification using public data from Swiss-Prot. It applies keras embedding and n-gram techniques to map protein sequences into numeric vectors for classification using traditional machine learning and deep neural networks. The paper discusses related works, background information, dataset description, proposed architecture, results, conclusions, and future directions in protein classification using deep learning and natural language processing. Features are extracted using n-grams and Bio-vec. The text mainly focuses on extracting features from biological sequences using n-grams, Bio-vec, and Prot-v to identify protein structures. Deep neural networks are then used to find n-dimensional vectors BID3 and BID4. Various methods like CBOW, skip-gram, word2vec, DM, and DBOW are used for feature extraction. Supervised learning is employed for classification, and predictive performance is evaluated. Random forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision tree methods are used for prediction based on extracted features. The text discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for protein classification based on sequence analysis. A new algorithm called ELM (Extreme machine learning) outperformed the existing BNN (Backpropagation neural network) method in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The ELM algorithm outperformed the BNN method in terms of accuracy and efficiency for protein classification. It requires less time and training, with no automatic parameter control. Various classifiers like GE and Fuzzy ARTMAP are used in deep learning to improve accuracy. Protein classification is now done by machines to avoid the tedious and time-consuming process for humans. Proteomics involves the study of proteins, focusing on their expression and functions within cells or organisms. Various machine learning techniques like SVM, RF, K-NN, and Fuzzy K-NN are used for protein classification based on amino acid sequences. Proteins play crucial roles in catalytic reactions, DNA replication, and cellular transport. The proteome, representing all proteins in an organism, tissue, or cell, varies with time and cellular stresses. Proteomics involves the analysis of proteins and their functions, while genomics focuses on the study of genomes and genetic material. Genomics deals with the structure, evolution, and mapping of genomes, which consist of the complete set of genetic material in an organism. Genetics, on the other hand, is the study of individual genes and their functions. Genetics focuses on individual genes and their functions, while genomics studies collective genes and their qualifications. Computers communicate with users through algorithms, similar to how humans communicate. Computational linguistics has emerged from teaching computers linguistics through algorithms and probability. Many algorithms are created for feature extraction. N-Gram is a feature extraction method used in linguistics and probability, involving sequences of text or speech such as syllables, words, or corpus. It is classified based on the number of items taken at a time, like unigram, bigram, etc. N-Grams are widely used in Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition for extracting phonemes and their sequences. Word embedding involves dense vector representation, which is more accurate than traditional methods. The Keras library allows for the use of word embeddings, which are more accurate than traditional bag of words methods. The embeddings are initialized with random weights and have shown better performance compared to n-grams in various applications. Naive Bayes is a classifier in machine learning that uses probabilistic methods and the Bayes theorem, making it efficient with a linear number of parameters. The algorithm discussed is a very efficient method for classifiers in machine learning, focusing on dependent attributes and parametric attributes. It utilizes closed form evaluation expressions for training, assigning labels to problem instances represented as vectors. This algorithm is suitable for supervised machine learning and offers high accuracy. Decision trees are a popular machine learning tool that require minimal training data compared to other algorithms, resulting in greater accuracy. They rely on conditional statements and control structures to make decisions based on possible outcomes, event chances, and resource costs. This algorithm is widely used in research operations for various types of analysis. The decision tree algorithm is used in research operations for decision analysis, identifying problems, and reaching goals. It resembles an influence diagram and is similar to the VAD method for calculating values of competing alternatives. Data is described as a point in space with infinite dimensions. The random forest tree algorithm is used for studying and dealing with large amounts of data in this data-centric century. It is effective for classifying data with regression techniques and is part of the ensemble technique in data mining, which combines multiple classifiers for improved accuracy. Random forest is a popular ensemble technique in data mining, consisting of many classifiers to classify data and create new instances. The errors in random forest trees are reduced as the number of trees increases, and they depend on the strength and relation between individual trees in the forest. ADABOOST is a method used in machine learning to boost the performance of decision trees in binary classification problems. It splits features to reduce error rates and noise, and is also known as Adaptive Boosting. This algorithm is suited for boosting the performance of weak learners, particularly decision trees. AdaBoost algorithm enhances decision trees by using short decision stumps. Weight is assigned to each instance in the dataset during training. AdaBoost classifiers fit classifiers on original datasets and adjust weights for misclassified instances. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier in machine learning. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression and classification analysis in high dimensional spaces. It follows the supervised learning approach with labeled datasets and uses support vectors as decision functions for training points. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric method used for data classification and regression. It involves training with the k closest examples in the feature space, storing feature vectors and class labels. The output depends on whether KNN is used for classification or regression. Deep learning, a sub-model of machine learning, utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to learn complex non-linear functions from input data, reducing error cost. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) store sequential data in internal memory to address vanishing error gradient issues during learning. LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is a key component of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that addresses vanishing error gradient issues. It consists of gates like input, output, and forget gates, along with self-recurrent connections with fixed weights. Proteins belonging to the same family share evolutionary relationships and structural or functional similarities, with G-protein coupled receptors being a prominent example. These protein families are classified as \"Pfam\" under categories like \"Family\" and \"Domain.\" The classifier used for classifying protein family is SVM based on primary structures. SVM is a supervised learning method used for data analysis and regression-based classification. The main objective is to create a distributed representation of sequences in biology. The data is divided into training and test data for system training. The system is trained using training data and verified using test data. Various processes like ten cross ten and algorithms like BID3 are used to improve accuracy. A large set of training data is needed for the machine to learn protein sequences. The n-gram algorithm uses protein information for window lapping. Two cross fold cross validation results in accurate predictions for different window sizes. Protein space analysis is utilized for various purposes. The protein space analysis involves using n-gram algorithms to analyze physical and chemical properties in a dimensional space. Properties like volume and mass are considered for data classification. Family information of 40433 protein sequences from Swiss-Prot is gathered from the Protein family database (Pfam). The curr_chunk discusses the protein sequences in Swiss-Prot from the Protein family database (Pfam), containing 200 distinct families. Swiss-Prot is a curated database of primary protein sequences that are manually annotated and reviewed. It contains 84753 protein sequences. The architecture includes protein representation layers transforming proteins into numeric vectors using n-gram and Keras embedding methods. Deep learning layers like DNN, RNN, LSTM, and CNN are used for feature extraction. The DNN model has 5 hidden layers with 128 hidden units each. The DNN model has 5 hidden layers with 128 units each, while RNN and LSTM layers also have 128 units and memory blocks. CNN has 128 filters with a filter length of 4, followed by a maxpooling layer of length 3. Fully connected layers with softmax activation function are used for classification, with categorical cross entropy for loss reduction. TensorFlow with Keras framework is used for implementation on GPU machines. The paper proposes a deep learning method for protein classification using Keras embedding, which outperforms n-gram with deep neural network due to its ability to preserve sequential information. This methodology can be applied to other biology tasks like genomics and DNA classification, showing promise for future research."
