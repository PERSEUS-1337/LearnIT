    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gateway to Democracy Act of 2004\". Congress finds that voter participation is a fundamental right and it is the responsibility of governments to enhance voter registration. Young adults have low voter turnout rates, with only 45.4% registered and 32.3% voting in the 2000 general election. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 aims to increase voter registration by allowing simultaneous application for voter registration with a driver's license. Some states require registration before the election, making it difficult for young adults to vote on Election Day. Removing this barrier can help increase voter turnout. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 aims to increase voter registration by allowing simultaneous application for voter registration with a driver's license. Some states have implemented successful pre-registration programs for young adults to register before meeting all eligibility requirements. This Act aims to expand categories of individuals eligible for registration. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 aims to expand voter registration by including young adults who do not meet the minimum age requirement and to promote civic engagement among them. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 aims to expand voter registration by allowing individuals under the minimum legal voting age to complete voter registration application forms. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 allows individuals under the minimum legal voting age to complete voter registration forms by providing an attestation that they will reach voting age before voting. Amendments to various sections of the Act include adding this requirement for applicants under the minimum legal voting age. Amendments to the National Voter Registration Act now require applicants under the minimum legal voting age to provide an attestation that they will reach voting age before voting. This includes adding a question and checkboxes for applicants to certify their understanding. Amendments to the National Voter Registration Act now include a rule stating that states are not required to accept voter registration forms from individuals who have not reached the minimum age to apply for a driver's license in the state. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to require states to maintain information on individuals who have applied for voter registration before reaching the minimum legal voting age, and make this information available to election officials. The amendments made by this Act will apply to voter registration applications for elections in a State after the State complies with the requirements of the Help America Vote Act of 2002."
