    "content": "The bias-variance decomposition for Boltzmann machines using an information geometric formulation reveals that the variance may not increase with more parameters, while the bias consistently decreases. This result provides theoretical evidence for the generalization ability of deep learning architectures by increasing representation power without inflating variance. Despite attempts to understand this phenomenon, the complete comprehension remains elusive due to the complex structure of deep learning. Theoretical analysis of Boltzmann machines and their generalization, including higher-order models, focuses on bias-variance decomposition. Information geometric formulation is used to explore hierarchical probabilistic models, revealing the Fisher information of parameters in Boltzmann machines. This analysis provides insights into the generalization ability of deep learning architectures. The bias-variance decomposition in Boltzmann machines reveals a unique phenomenon where variance may not increase as more parameters are added due to the hierarchical structure. This suggests the potential for designing deep learning architectures that reduce both bias and variance, improving generalization ability while maintaining representation power. The paper further discusses the log-linear model of hierarchical probability distributions and presents the bias-variance decomposition for Boltzmann machines. In Section 3, the paper discusses the learning of Boltzmann machines and introduces an information geometric formulation of the log-linear model of hierarchical probability distributions. The model is based on a partially ordered set (poset) with specific properties. The theoretical lower bound of the variance is empirically evaluated in Section 4, and the paper concludes by summarizing its contributions in Section 5. The text discusses the zeta and M\u00f6bius functions on a finite set S, with the M\u00f6bius inversion formula being fundamental in enumerative combinatorics. A log-linear model on S is introduced to give a discrete probability distribution, with probabilities assigned to each element in S. The text introduces probability distributions on a set S using the M\u00f6bius inversion formula. It discusses dual coordinate systems \u03b8 and \u03b7 connected by the Legendre transformation, forming a dually flat Riemannian manifold. The Riemannian metric g(\u03be) is defined for \u03be = \u03b8 or \u03b7, corresponding to the gradient of \u03b8 or \u03b7. The set S is in the exponential family, with \u03b8 as the natural parameter and \u03b7 as the expectation parameter. Submanifolds are specified by functions \u03b1 and \u03b2 on S. The text discusses probability distributions on set S using the M\u00f6bius inversion formula and introduces submanifolds specified by functions \u03b1 and \u03b2. It mentions that S \u03b1 has constraints on \u03b8 while S \u03b2 has constraints on \u03b7, with S \u03b1 being e-flat and S \u03b2 being m-flat. The intersection S \u03b1 \u2229 S \u03b2 always uniquely exists, and a Pythagorean theorem holds for any P \u2208 S \u03b1 and R \u2208 S \u03b2 in a Boltzmann machine represented as an undirected graph. The Boltzmann machine G is defined by vertices (bias) and edges (weight) with a probability distribution p(x; b, w) for each x \u2208 {0, 1} n. It is a special case of the log-linear model with a parameter set and a Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the log-linear model. The set of Boltzmann distributions S(B) is a submanifold of S. The Boltzmann machine aims to approximate an empirical distribution P by minimizing the KL divergence. The learning equation involves maximizing the log-likelihood, leading to the unique m-projection of P onto the Boltzmann distributions S(B). The parameter set B is fixed in traditional Boltzmann machines. The loglinear formulation allows for flexibility in parameter selection in Boltzmann machines, with the ability to include or remove elements. Previous studies have explored higher order interactions to enhance representation power. The Boltzmann distribution in arbitrary-order machines is defined by Equation (12), with MLE given by Equation FORMULA4. A sequence of parameter sets B1, B2, ..., Bm leads to a hierarchy of submanifolds and decreasing KL divergences. The Boltzmann distribution can be approximated using parameter sets B, with extremes being an empty set resulting in a uniform distribution and the full set representing the empirical distribution. Bias-variance tradeoff is analyzed, and hidden variables like RBMs and DBMs can increase representation power. The main result of the paper is bias-variance decomposition for Boltzmann machines, focusing on the squared KL divergence from the true distribution to the empirical distribution. The study suggests future work on bias-variance decomposition for Boltzmann machines with hidden variables like RBMs and DBMs. The paper presents bias-variance decomposition for Boltzmann machines, focusing on the KL divergence. It uses information geometric properties to decompose set B and MLE P * B. Theorem 1 discusses the true distribution P * and empirical distribution P, with a proof involving error covariance and variance. The irreducible error in Equation FORMULA4 is the variance term, as shown by the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. The bias decreases with more parameters, but the variance may not always follow this trend. An example illustrating this non-monotonicity is provided. The variance in the example is illustrated with a non-monotonic trend. True distribution P* is randomly generated from a uniform distribution. Parameter sets B1, B2, and B3 are evaluated for tightness of the lower bound. Empirical estimation of variance is done by generating samples from P* using a Boltzmann machine. Mean and standard deviation of the variance are reported. The study presents the bias-variance decomposition of the KL divergence for Boltzmann machines, showing a nonmonotonic trend in variance with respect to parameter set growth. The theoretical lower bound is tight for large sample sizes and consistent across different numbers of variables. The model is a generalization of traditional Boltzmann machines, capable of incorporating arbitrary order interactions of variables. The study explores the bias-variance decomposition of the KL divergence for Boltzmann machines, revealing a nonmonotonic variance trend with increasing parameter sets. Including higher-order parameters in deep learning architectures can reduce bias and variance, aiding in generalizability. The deep Boltzmann machine example illustrates the input and hidden layers, showcasing the parameter set relationships. The parameter set B in Boltzmann machines includes nodes and edges, with hidden variables represented as G = (V \u222a H, E). Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are commonly used in deep learning applications, where hidden variables are divided into disjoint subsets. The set of Boltzmann distributions is obtained based on the domains of the distributions. The learning process of Boltzmann machines with hidden variables involves double minimization of the KL divergence between two submanifolds, S \u2032 (B) and S \u2032 (P ). The EM-algorithm can achieve a local optimum, but due to computational complexity, approximation methods like Gibbs sampling are often used. Approximation methods like Gibbs sampling are used in Boltzmann machines with hidden variables to minimize KL divergence between submanifolds S \u2032 (B) and S \u2032 (P ). The representation power of RBMs is demonstrated by the result that S \u2032 (B) \u2286 S \u2032 (B \u2032 ) when B \u2286 B \u2032."
