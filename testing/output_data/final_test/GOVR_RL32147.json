    "content": "The federal government has had programs dealing with energy efficiency and climate research for over 20 years, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. government policies addressing climate change date back to the mid-1980s, with a heavy emphasis on scientific research. The Policy Act of 1992, along with the U.S. ratification of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, influenced U.S. efforts towards energy efficiency, renewable energy, and R&D to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Change Action Plan announced in 1993 by the Clinton Administration included over 40 federal programs to collaborate with various entities. Programs like the 1997 Climate Change Technology Initiative built upon earlier efforts. The Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI) was announced by President Clinton in October 1997 as a cornerstone of efforts to develop renewable energy technologies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through R&D, tax incentives, and industry consultations. Stage 1 included funding for R&D, tax incentives, and federal government energy initiatives. Stage 2 was planned to review and continue the initiative around 2004. The Kyoto Protocol aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2008-2012 through domestic and international emissions trading. The United States signed but did not ratify the protocol, with the Clinton Administration supporting it and the Bush Administration rejecting it. Congress has passed bills prohibiting funds for the protocol. The Congress passed budget resolutions and appropriations bills with provisions prohibiting funds for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States has not ratified. Controversy arose over funding proposals linked to the Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI) and Kyoto Protocol goals. Despite initial concerns, Congress mostly funded R&D elements. Programs related to CCTI and climate research predated the Kyoto Protocol and were influenced by voluntary commitments under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The government's efforts on climate change have involved various programs and agencies, with coordination being a challenge. The National Climate Program Act of 1978 aimed to centralize planning and improve interagency coordination for delivering climatic information and services. The National Climate Program Act of 1978 aimed to centralize planning and improve interagency coordination for delivering climatic information and services. However, by the early 1990s, the program faced criticisms for lack of funding and concerns about compromising agency responsibilities. It eventually faded as the U.S. Global Change Research Program gained prominence and legislative support. The Global Change Research Program (GCRP) was established in 1990 under the Global Change Research Act to address complex global change issues through integrated efforts of multiple government agencies. It supports scientific research on global change, including climate change, through coordination and joint activities among various departments such as Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Interior. The Global Change Research Program (GCRP) coordinates and funds research on natural fluctuations of earth processes, impacts of human activities on the environment, and improving climate change models. Mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 1990, it conducts scientific assessments of potential consequences for the United States of global change. The Global Change Research Program (GCRP) conducts research on the effects of global change on various aspects such as the natural environment, agriculture, energy production, and human health. The National Assessment Synthesis Team (NAST) led the writing of the Assessment, which consists of an Overview report and a more detailed Foundation report. The research conducted by the GCRP serves as the scientific foundation for the Assessment, with approvals given by the NSTC. The Foundation report is more detailed than the Overview and is a national-level, peer-reviewed document that synthesized results from studies conducted by regional and sector teams. The Bush Administration issued the White House Initial Review on Climate Change, which included the U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) and the National Climate Change Technology Initiative (NCCTI) to address greenhouse gases. The Bush Administration initiated efforts to advance climate change science and technology through new organizational structures and activities announced in 2002. This included priorities such as understanding the North American carbon cycle, improving climate modeling, and ensuring high-quality climate data records. An organization chart was released at a meeting of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research, outlining these initiatives. The CENR's GCR Subcommittee meeting on April 1, 2002 summarized information in Table 1. The CCRI merged with the GCRP in January 2003 to form the Climate Change Science Program. President George W. Bush announced the NCCTI on June 11, 2001. The FY2004 budget requests $1.2 billion for climate change technology. The FY2004 budget requests $1.2 billion for climate change technology within the President's NCCTI. The Climate Change Policy Panel (CCPP) combines concerns of various councils and reports to the president. The Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration (CCSTI) continues its functions of recommending climate change activities and fund movement. The CCSTI recommends climate change science and technology activities, coordinates fund movement, and oversees the Interagency Working Group on Climate Change Science and Technology. The group reviews programs related to climate change science and provides recommendations to the CCSTI. The CCSTI oversees climate change science and technology activities, coordinates fund movement, and reviews programs related to climate change science. The CCRI and GCRP were combined into the CCSP, separate from climate change technology work. The FY2004 budget seeks $1.75 billion for scientific research managed by the CCSP, with $182 million allocated to the CCRI, a 355% increase from FY2003. The CCSP reports a significant increase in funding from $40 million in FY2003 to $182 million in FY2004, raising concerns about the source of the increase. The CCSP is to be staffed by interagency detailees, with the Director coming from the Department of Commerce. The program will review all climate change science programs, not just the GCRP, and reports to the chair of the Interagency Working Group. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) was established in 2002 within the DOE to develop and implement climate technology programs consistent with the National Climate Change Technology Initiative. It works towards recommending priority programs to achieve an 18% reduction in energy intensity by 2012. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) aims to reduce energy intensity by 18% by 2012. Comparisons of technology programs and funding before and after FY2003 are challenging. The Administration plans to release a draft plan for CCTP's activities in 2004, highlighting priorities like the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, \"FutureGen,\" and fusion energy in the FY2005 budget. The Administration is focused on long-term technologies like fusion energy and the Climate Change Research Initiative to accelerate climate change research over the next five years. The National Academy of Sciences was asked to review the draft Strategic Plan in September 2002. The draft Strategic Plan for climate change research was reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences in February 2003. Recommendations included the need for a clear vision statement, specific goals, priorities, and effective management processes. The plan should align activities with goals, emphasize near-term decisions, and establish links between different research initiatives. The Strategic Plan for climate change research should include mechanisms for coordinating and linking activities, developing models for decision-making, addressing human, economic, and ecological dimensions, establishing an integrated observing system, enhancing decision support capabilities, and reducing uncertainties. The Administration released its new CCSP Strategic Plan on Climate Change in July 2003, outlining five major research goals to improve knowledge of past and present climate, understand forces causing climate change, reduce uncertainty in future projections, study ecosystem sensitivity to climate change, and manage risks related to climate variability. Specific research targets accompany each goal. The Administration released its new CCSP Strategic Plan on Climate Change in July 2003, outlining five major research goals related to climate variability and change. The plan includes schedules for research papers and synthesis reports, with specific targets for resolving temperature data differences and studying abrupt climate change. Critics argue that the plan overemphasizes uncertainties in climate science and delays actions to curb greenhouse gas emissions, while proponents believe it will focus research more sharply with clearer goals and schedules. The Administration's FY2004 budget seeks $1.7 billion for scientific research managed by the CCSP, including $182 million for the Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI). The FY2004 budget requests $1.2 billion for climate change technology as part of the NCCTI. Funding for climate change research and technologies has remained consistent across administrations, with about $1.7 billion for research and $1.2 billion for technologies each year. Climate change research is specified in the budgets for thirteen federal entities. The testimony on January 8, 2003 by Assistant Secretary of Commerce James Mahoney mentioned an additional $1.3 billion for climate change research conducted by thirteen CCSP collaborating agencies. Funding for climate change science and technology programs by agency is summarized in Tables 4 and 5, with NASA's Global Change Research Program focusing on various aspects of climate change. The National Science Foundation, an independent government agency, funds climate change research including studies on carbon cycling, Antarctic ecosystems, climate modeling, sea-level changes, and ecological impacts. The FY2003 budget for these activities was over $1.1 billion, with the FY2004 request slightly under $1.1 billion. The FY2003 funding level for climate change research was $203 million, with a $213 million request for FY2004. The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has programs addressing climate change issues, including research on climate variability and its impacts on ecosystems. NOAA's research is part of the Global Change Research Program (GCRP) and focuses on various climate-related topics such as water cycling, ozone depletion, greenhouse gas dynamics, and solar influences. The FY2003 funding for climate change research was $203 million, with a $213 million request for FY2004. The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has programs addressing climate change issues, including research on climate variability and its impacts on ecosystems. NOAA's funding for climate change research activities in FY2003 was $118 million, with a $136 million request for FY2004. The Department of Energy focuses on carbon dioxide emissions from combustion. The Department of Energy receives the majority of interagency climate change funding, with a focus on research, development, and deployment of energy efficient and renewable technologies. Funding for DOE's efforts includes projects related to buildings such as low-power sulfur lamps, advanced heat pumps, fuel cells, and insulation. The federal component of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) aimed to produce a prototype midsized family car with 80 miles per gallon gasoline efficiency and a two-thirds reduction in carbon emissions by 2004. This involved research, development, and deployment of more efficient technologies in industries such as aluminum, steel, mining, agriculture, chemicals, forest products, and petroleum, as well as in transportation. The Bush Administration cancelled the PNGV program and started the Freedom CAR program focusing on fuel cell vehicles. Efforts are being made to remove and sequester carbon from fuels, and conserve energy through coordinated management and outreach. The Department of Agriculture received $66 million in FY2003 for climate change research, with a $73 million request for FY2004. Research includes improving carbon inventories and developing methods for optimizing agricultural productivity and greenhouse gas emissions. $3 million was allocated in FY2001 for technology development related to managing the carbon cycle. No funds were specified for Agriculture Department climate change technology. The National Institutes of Health and the Department of the Interior conducted research related to climate change, receiving $59 million in FY2003 and requesting $61 million for FY2004. The United States Geological Survey within the Department of the Interior conducted global change research, receiving $26 million in FY2003. The Environmental Protection Agency received $26 million for climate change research in FY2003 and requested the same amount for FY2004. They have budget categories for Science and Technology (S&T) and Environmental Programs and Management (EPM), making it challenging to separate R&D from technology assistance efforts. In the Buildings Sector, building owners can use EPA's benchmarking tool for energy reduction by trying various activities like plugging leaks and replacing lights. The EPA's climate change research and technology funds are not highly controversial, with activities focused on research, technology diffusion, and assistance. Funding for basic R&D predating the CCTI and Kyoto Protocol is less controversial, while new programs for technology deployment and consumer education can be more contentious. EPA's climate change research and technology funds are detailed in Table 7. Activities related to EPA's climate change research and technology funds, including the \"Buildings\" component, focus on R&D, information dissemination, and energy efficiency efforts through programs like ENERGY STAR. EPA aims to provide objective information to help consumers make energy-efficient choices. The EPA evaluates and certifies energy-saving building-related products through programs like ENERGY STAR. They also support transportation initiatives such as incentives for commuters to use alternative modes of transportation and efforts to reduce vehicle miles traveled. The EPA collaborates with industries to identify greenhouse gas emission sources and develop reduction strategies. They also work with the Departments of Agriculture and Energy on carbon removal efforts, studying ways to increase environmental storage of carbon and provide incentives to landowners and crop growers. The EPA collaborates with industries, state and local governments, and international partners to provide incentives for landowners and crop growers to increase carbon storage on agricultural and forest lands. This includes programs like the Cities for Climate Protection program and New Jersey's state carbon bank program. EPA also works on international capacity building and partnerships to provide technical assistance for greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. The EPA and other agencies are studying ways to assist developing countries in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries currently emit over half of the global total and emissions are increasing rapidly. The Smithsonian Institution conducts research on atmospheric processes, ecosystem dynamics, and climate change, with activities totaling $6 million in FY2003. The US Agency for International Development works with foreign governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and vulnerability to climate change impacts. The Department of Transportation will conduct research on greenhouse gas models for the surface transportation sector, with a budget request of $4 million for FY2004. The Department of State issued a joint statement with European Union environmental policy makers on possible cooperative research areas related to climate change. The Department of State announced a government-industry partnership for a pollution-free coal-fired power plant. The facility will cost $1 billion over 10 years. Climate change research funds were requested for FY2004. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is involved in climate change research and technology programs. Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH) research under CCTI aimed to develop affordable, durable, disaster-resistant, and energy-efficient housing. HUD administers PATH operations despite no funding requests since FY2001. US government policies since the 1980s address climate change through energy R&D and climate research, guided by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Global Change Research Act. The United States has various initiatives to address climate change, including the Climate Change Action Plan, the Clinton Administration's CCTI, and the current Bush Administration's U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative. The Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan outlines research goals to improve knowledge of past and present climates, understand climate change forces, and manage risks and opportunities. The evolving organizational structure of climate change programs makes it difficult to determine interrelationships among science and technology programs. Critics call for sharper goals, better priorities, and clearer objectives for climate change R&D funding. The total CCSP request for spending in FY2004 increased slightly, with a significant rise in funding allocated to the embedded CCRI. Congress faces the issue of determining if the large CCRI increase represents new money or existing funds. The CCRI increase in funding for climate change programs is being questioned as to whether it represents new money or a reclassification of existing funds. Proponents argue that further research is needed to justify climate change management strategies and reduce uncertainties for better policymaking."
