The program provides price guarantees to sugarcane and sugar beet processors, controlled by the USDA to limit sugar supply for food use. Four tools are used to maintain market prices above guaranteed levels, including price support loans and marketing allotments. The U.S. sugar program includes price support guarantees and supply management for domestic production and imports. It uses tools like price support loans, marketing allotments, sugar-to-ethanol backstop, and import quotas to maintain market prices. Agreements with Mexico also limit sugar exports and establish minimum prices. The program originated from the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981. The 1981 farm bill established the sugar program to support U.S. sugarcane and sugar beets prices through purchases and nonrecourse loans. It also allowed the President to impose duties on foreign sugar to prevent domestic price drops. The Senate Committee highlighted the importance of sugar imports due to volatile world market prices affecting U.S. sugar prices. The U.S. lacked an effective government price support program compared to other sugar-producing nations, leading to political controversy. The sugar program, a source of political controversy, has critics like the Coalition for Sugar Reform arguing it keeps domestic prices high, leading to job losses in the food manufacturing sector. The American Sugar Alliance supports the program, consisting of sugarcane and sugar beet producers. The sugar program, supported by sugar beet producers, ensures a reliable supply of sugar at reasonable prices without government cost. It protects the domestic industry from unfair competition from heavily subsidized foreign sugar. Nonrecourse loans provide short-term financing for processors until sugar is sold. The sugar program offers nonrecourse loans to processors for short-term financing until sugar is sold. Processors can forfeit sugar as collateral if market prices are below the support level. Loan rates for raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar differ, with the raw sugar rate lower due to further processing needed. The raw sugar loan rate is lower because raw sugarcane needs further processing by a cane refinery to match the value of refined beet sugar for food use. Loan rates are national averages adjusted by region for marketing cost differentials. The effective support level, or loan forfeiture level, includes the loan rate, interest, and marketing costs. For 2015-crop, raw cane sugar's effective support level is 20.87\u00a2/lb, while refined beet sugar ranges from 24.4\u00a2 to 26.04\u00a2/lb depending on the region. The USDA records a budgetary expense if market prices fall below loan forfeiture levels, leading to USDA gaining title to sugar. Suspension agreements with Mexico may raise the effective support level, as Mexican sugar is a significant source of the U.S. sugar supply. Imports of sugar from Mexico in 2014/2015 represented 11% of total U.S. production plus imports. Suspension agreements set minimum prices for Mexican sugar imports above U.S. support levels. Market prices for raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar were higher than loan forfeiture levels until mid-year 2013. In FY2013, market prices below support levels led processors to forfeit 381,875 tons of sugar to USDA, valued at $172 million. Government actions to prevent forfeitures and dispose of acquired sugar are detailed. Annual limits on domestic sugar sales for human use and import restrictions aim to prevent low prices and forfeitures. Sugar marketing allotments also limit sales to balance supply and demand. The USDA sets sugar marketing allotments to limit domestic sugar sales and prevent prices from falling below loan forfeiture levels. The overall allotment quantity (OAQ) is set at not less than 85% of estimated U.S. human consumption of sugar for food each year. This is to ensure that permitted sales of domestic sugar, combined with imports, do not depress market prices. In recent years, U.S. sugar production has consistently fallen short of the OAQ, averaging 88% of the threshold from FY2013 through FY2015. This has led to substantial imports to cover the shortfall between domestic output and human consumption, impacting market price levels. Market participants focus more on USDA's decisions on import quotas rather than marketing allotments. The national OAQ is divided between beet and cane sectors and allocated to processing companies based on sales and production capacity. USDA can reassign import quotas if sectors cannot meet their allotment. Imports account for 30% of U.S. sugar used in food and beverages. The U.S. imports sugar to meet total food demand and fulfill trade agreements. USDA manages sugar supply to prevent market prices from falling below support levels, including the WTO quota commitment of 1.256 million tons. The United States allows 1.256 million tons of sugar to enter the domestic market from 40 countries, with additional import quotas for DR-CAFTA countries, Colombia, Panama, and Peru. Duty-free access to Mexican sugar is also granted under NAFTA. Since 2008, U.S. imports of Mexican sugar have varied from 800,000 tons to 2.1 million tons annually due to factors like drought in Mexico's sugarcane-producing regions and U.S. exports of high-fructose corn syrup displacing Mexican sugar consumption. Mexico supplied 55% of total U.S. sugar imports on average from FY2013-FY2015, benefiting from duty-free access under NAFTA until December 2014. Mexico's annual sugar shipments to the United States varied from 2.1 million to 1.5 million short tons, comprising 66% to 43% of U.S. imports from FY2013 to FY2015. Tariff-rate quota programs accounted for 36% of all imports, with DR-CAFTA countries supplying nearly 4%. The 2008 and 2014 farm bills introduced policies to regulate Mexican sugar imports, setting WTO quotas at 1.256 million short tons at the beginning of each marketing year. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized the sugar program intact for five years through 2018 crops, but events since then have significantly impacted the program. A major change in late 2014 involved the treatment of imported sugar from Mexico, which had been a significant source of U.S. sugar imports. The treatment of imported sugar from Mexico changed significantly in late 2014 due to two suspension agreements altering trade dynamics. These agreements were a result of countervailing duty and antidumping investigations initiated in 2014 in response to a petition filed by the American Sugar Coalition. The Tariff Act of 1930 provides legal authority for CVD and AD suspension agreements. Preliminary findings showed Mexican sugar exports were subsidized and dumped into the U.S. market below fair value. The DOC imposed duties ranging from 2.99% to 47.26% on U.S. imports of Mexican sugar. In December 2014, suspension agreements were entered into with Mexico and Mexican sugar industry interests. The DOC entered into agreements with the Government of Mexico and Mexican sugar industry interests to suspend CVD and AD investigations and remove duties on Mexican sugar imports. In exchange, Mexico agreed to limit sugar exports to the U.S. based on U.S. needs. This has reshaped U.S.-Mexico sugar trade. The U.S. market assessment for sugar is now limited to U.S. needs, with Mexico's sugar exports restricted to 53% of allowable quantity. Mexican sugar faces minimum reference prices, and the DOC recalculates the quantity of Mexican sugar allowed into the U.S. throughout the marketing year. The agreement with Mexico suspending countervailing duties limits Mexican sugar exports based on U.S. needs, calculated using a sugar carryover ratio. Some U.S. sugar users argue that the current ratio of 13.5% is too restrictive and could lead to shortages, suggesting a higher ratio of 14.5% to 15.5% would be more appropriate. The agreement also imposes limits on the quantity of Mexican sugar that can be imported into the U.S. market. The suspension agreements with Mexico limit the concentration of Mexican sugar imports into the U.S. market to 30% of U.S. needs from October 1 to December 31 and 55% from October 1 to March 31. The initial export limit of Mexican sugar was increased to 1,383,969.68 metric tons raw value in 2014/2015. These changes aim to help the USDA operate the sugar program at no cost to the government, as directed by Congress in the 2014 farm bill. The USDA's ability to administer the sugar program at no net cost has been a concern since 2012/2013 when government outlays spiked to $259 million due to forfeited domestic sugar. The Food and Agricultural Policy Institute projected zero net government outlays for the sugar program with suspension agreements in place from 2016 to 2024. The USDA projected zero net government outlays for the sugar program from 2016 to 2024 with suspension agreements in place. The Congressional Budget Office projects outlays totaling $115 million from FY2020 through FY2025, reflecting potential policy uncertainty over Mexican sugar imports. The Coalition for Sugar Reform argues that suspension agreements will lead to higher sugar prices for U.S. users and consumers, while the American Sugar Alliance supports the agreements for fostering free and fair trade in sugar. The pricing on Mexican sugar should be well above U.S. loan levels as long as suspension agreements remain in effect, with transportation costs adding several cents per pound. The agreements have no termination date but can be ended at any time, affecting the trade framework. The CVD and AD investigations on Mexican sugar imports can be terminated at any time and are subject to review after five years. Two U.S. sugarcane refiners challenged the agreements in court, with the ITC determining in March 2015 that the agreements eliminate the injurious effect of Mexican sugar imports. The refiners then filed petitions with the U.S. Court of International Trade, contesting the ITC's decision. In early April 2016, AmCane's action was dismissed at the company's request, while Imperial Sugar's action continued to be under review. The DOC determined that Mexican sugar exports were subsidized and dumped into the U.S. market at prices below fair market value, with dumping margins ranging from 40.48% to 42.14%. The DOC found dumping margins on Mexican sugar ranged from 40.48% to 42.14%, with government subsidies on exported sugar ranging from 5.78% to 43.93%. The ITC reaffirmed the U.S. sugar industry's injury due to these practices, keeping suspension agreements in force pending a U.S. Court of International Trade decision. USDA has policy mechanisms to prevent prices from falling below effective loan forfeiture levels, including offering CCC sugar to processors in exchange for surrendering rights to import quota sugar and purchasing sugar from processors in exchange for surrendering quota sugar. The farm bill authorizes USDA to transfer ownership of CCC-owned sugar in exchange for rights to purchase tariff-rate quota sugar, or certificates of quota entry, to prevent loan forfeitures. USDA completed four sugar exchanges from July to September 2013 to bolster market prices and avoid loan forfeitures. Exchanges involved bids from refiners and brokers for sugar acquired by USDA from processors, as well as USDA purchasing sugar from processors for resale to ethanol producers for fuel ethanol production. The USDA implemented initiatives to reduce sugar supply in the U.S. market by exchanging import rights with cane refiners and brokers. The Feedstock Flexibility Program aims to divert surplus sugar into ethanol production to avoid loan forfeitures. The USDA implemented initiatives to reduce sugar supply in the U.S. market by diverting surplus sugar into ethanol production through the Feedstock Flexibility Program. Competitive bids are used to purchase and sell sugar to bioenergy producers, with an exception for emergency sugar shortfalls. The sugar program has been controversial among lawmakers and within the sugar market. The sugar program in the U.S. market has sparked controversy, with the American Sugar Alliance arguing that domestic producers struggle to compete with foreign subsidies leading to dumped surpluses. A 2015 study by ASA showed that U.S. retail sugar prices were below the average for developed countries. The Sugar Users Association criticizes the U.S. sugar program, arguing that TRQ allocations are outdated and distort the market, leading to job losses in sugar-using industries. An analysis from Iowa State University in 2013 found no evidence of higher sugar prices harming consumers. The U.S. sugar program, including marketing allotments and import restrictions, could be eliminated to benefit consumers by $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion annually and support increased employment in the food processing industry. The removal of import restrictions would lead to a decline in U.S. sugar production and employment but a significant increase in total sugar imports. The U.S. sugar program, including marketing allotments and import restrictions, could be eliminated to benefit consumers by $1.66 billion over 2012-2017, with yearly gains of $277 million. Specific dates and actions for managing the program are outlined in the text box."
