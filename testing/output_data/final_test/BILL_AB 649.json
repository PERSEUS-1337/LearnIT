    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 117748 defines a \"pharmaceutical incinerator\" as a device that incinerates pharmaceutical waste to render it as solid waste. Section 118215 of the Health and Safety Code requires medical waste to be treated by approved methods, such as incineration, before disposal. Treatment options for medical waste include alternative technology with high temperatures approved by the department, or steam sterilization at a permitted facility following specific operating procedures. Thermometers must be checked to ensure sterilization of medical waste at 121\u00b0C for at least half an hour during each cycle. Monitoring devices should be calibrated annually, with records kept for two years. (C) Heat-sensitive tape or another approved method must be used on biohazard bags or sharps containers processed onsite to indicate heat treatment. If placed in a liner bag within the autoclave, tape only needs to be on the liner bag, not each individual bag or container. (D) A biological indicator must be placed in the center of a load monthly to confirm sterilization. (E) Records of specified procedures must be kept for at least two years. Alternative medical waste treatment methods must be approved by the department and destroy pathogenic micro-organisms. The department evaluates and approves or rejects proposed methods based on specific criteria. Any treatment solely for pharmaceutical waste needs department approval by June 1, 2017. The department evaluates and approves alternative medical waste treatments, including a pharmaceutical incinerator, in consultation with relevant environmental agencies. Fluid blood or products can be discharged to a public sewage system if it meets waste discharge requirements set by the regional water quality control board. Medical waste that is biohazardous laboratory waste can be treated with chemical disinfection if liquid or semiliquid, following recognized methods. If not treated chemically, other specified methods must be used. Medical waste can be discharged to the public sewage system after chemical disinfection if it meets waste discharge requirements. If the waste becomes hazardous, it must be managed according to specific regulations. Law enforcement agencies running drug takeback programs can use approved pharmaceutical incinerators up to four times a year."
