    "content": "Table 1 outlines ACA provisions affected by H.R. 3762 and the Senate amendment. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) established under ACA Section 4002 had its annual appropriation reduced by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Senate bill proposes funding changes for various fiscal years, including repealing PPHF appropriations for FY2016 onwards and providing additional funds to the Community Health Center Fund for FY2016 and FY2017. The Senate bill proposes adding $235 million for each of FY2016 and FY2017 to the Community Health Center Fund through a mandatory appropriation. ACA Section 1323(c) provides funding to territories that establish health insurance exchanges, with $1 billion available from 2014 to 2019. The HHS Secretary is to allocate $925 million to Puerto Rico and divide the remaining $75 million among other territories. If a territory does not establish an exchange, it is entitled to an increase in Medicaid funds. The Senate bill proposes changes to ACA Section 1323(c) regarding funding for territories. It includes provisions for a reinsurance program to help compensate health insurers for high-risk individuals. The bill also addresses Medicaid funding for territories. The Senate bill proposes changes to ACA Section 1323(c) regarding funding for territories and includes provisions for a reinsurance program. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration supports community-based substance abuse and mental health treatment and prevention services through grants authorized under the Public Health Service Act. The Senate bill proposes funding for states to address substance abuse and mental health needs, including improving prescription drug monitoring programs, prevention activities, practitioner training, and access to services. Funding of $750 million for each of FY2016 and FY2017 is authorized. The ACA authorizes federal tax credits to help individuals pay for health insurance through exchanges. The credits are based on prior year's income tax returns and are refundable and advanceable. Individuals may receive the credits in advance to coincide with monthly insurance premiums, with reconciliation at tax filing. The ACA authorizes federal tax credits to assist individuals in paying for health insurance through exchanges. These credits are based on prior year's income tax returns and are refundable and advanceable. If a tax filing unit's income decreases during the tax year, any additional credit amount will be included in the tax refund, while excess amounts overpaid in credits must be repaid to the federal government. The ACA imposes limits on excess amounts to be repaid for households with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level. Section 201 of the Senate bill would not apply limits on excess amounts to be repaid with respect to premium tax credits for taxable years ending after December 31, 2015, and before January 1, 2018. The ACA authorizes federal premium tax credits based on household income to assist individuals in paying for health insurance through exchanges. The credits are refundable and advanceable, with eligibility and amount determined by income levels. Excess amounts of credits overpaid must be repaid to the government, with limits imposed for households below 400% of the federal poverty level. The credits are designed to provide more assistance to individuals with lower incomes. The ACA provides federal premium tax credits based on income to help pay for health insurance. These credits can be received in advance and are refundable. Cost-sharing subsidies are also available to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for eligible individuals. The Senate bill proposes to repeal authorization for these credits and subsidies starting in 2018. The Senate bill proposes to repeal ACA provisions for premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies starting in 2018, including eligibility determinations and disclosure of taxpayer information. It also aims to amend IRC Section 45R for small business health insurance tax credits. The small business health insurance tax credit is available for employers with fewer than 25 FTE employees and average annual wages below a specified cap. Employers must cover at least 50% of employees' self-only health insurance. The credit is only available for two consecutive tax years, starting when coverage is obtained through a SHOP exchange. The Senate bill proposes to eliminate this tax credit starting in 2018. The ACA's individual mandate, established by Section 1501, requires most individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty. This mandate took effect in 2014 and applies to those without exemptions, who must pay a penalty for each month of noncompliance. The penalty is based on a percentage of income or a flat dollar amount, increasing over time. The Senate bill aims to eliminate the penalty for not having health insurance under the individual mandate retroactively from 2015. Employers with at least 50 full-time equivalent employees may face tax penalties if their employees receive premium tax credits through a health insurance exchange. The Senate bill aims to eliminate the penalty for not having health insurance under the individual mandate retroactively from 2015. Transition relief in 2015 limits the penalty to employers with at least 100 FTE employees based on full-time employees averaging 30 hours or more per week. The PPFA, supported by government funding, operates health centers across the United States. CBO estimates federal funds accounted for about one-third of PPFA's total revenue in 2013. PPFA's largest federal funding source is Medicaid reimbursements, totaling approximately $390 million in 2013. GAO found that PPFA also received funds from discretionary programs and direct spending. PPFA's funding sources include Medicaid reimbursements, discretionary programs, and direct spending from various government programs such as SNAP and CHIP. Grants programs provide funds to PPFA entities for services, but federal funds generally cannot be used for abortions except in specific cases. Restrictions like the Hyde Amendment have been in place since 1976, with similar provisions in other appropriations measures. Section 206 of a Senate bill would prohibit federal funds from going to prohibited entities for one year. The Senate bill's Section 206 would prohibit federal funds from going to prohibited entities, including Planned Parenthood, for one year, regardless of Medicaid program rules. The criteria for a prohibited entity include being a not-for-profit engaged in family planning and reproductive health services, providing non-Hyde amendment abortions, and receiving over $350 million in Medicaid expenditures. The Senate bill's Section 206 would prohibit federal funds from going to prohibited entities, including Planned Parenthood, for one year, regardless of Medicaid program rules. The criteria for a prohibited entity include being a not-for-profit engaged in family planning and reproductive health services, providing non-Hyde amendment abortions, and receiving over $350 million in Medicaid expenditures. CBO determined that PPFA would likely be the prohibited entity due to the bill's language. Medicaid funding to territories is subject to annual federal spending caps, with $378.3 million allotted in FY2015. The ACA provides $6.3 billion in additional Medicaid federal funding to territories between July 1, 2011, and September 30, 2019. The territories receive Medicaid funding based on capped amounts available prior to the ACA, totaling $2.4 billion from 2011 to 2014. The Senate bill aims to extend $6.3 billion in Medicaid funding to territories until September 30, 2017. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state laws, with criteria including categorical and financial requirements, residency, immigration status, and citizenship documentation. The ACA established new Medicaid eligibility criteria, including the Medicaid Expansion which set 133% of the Federal Poverty Level as the minimum income-eligibility level for most non-elderly individuals. The Supreme Court made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional for states, leading to 24 states and the District of Columbia implementing it on January 1, 2014. States can apply for waivers to expand health coverage beyond mandatory and optional groups listed in federal statute. Medicaid expansion is optional for states. 24 states and the District of Columbia implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion on January 1, 2014, with six additional states following suit. The ACA also allows for an optional Medicaid eligibility category for non-elderly individuals with income above 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. The ACA changed the mandatory Medicaid income eligibility level for poverty-related children aged 6 through 18 from 100% to 133% of FPL, known as stairstep children. The ACA extends and expands the maintenance of effort provisions for Medicaid and CHIP programs until January 1, 2014 for adults and September 30, 2019 for children. States must maintain eligibility standards or face loss of federal matching funds. Senate bill provisions would repeal the ACA Medicaid expansion. The Senate bill would repeal the ACA Medicaid expansion and state options for coverage, specifying end dates for certain provisions. It also changes the end date for the Medicaid and CHIP MOE for children. Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal government and states through the FMAP rate. The ACA introduces exceptions to the regular FMAP rate for Medicaid, including the newly eligible federal matching rate, the expansion state federal matching rate, and a six-percentage-point increase for services covered under the Community First Choice Option. The ACA increases the Medicaid FMAP rate for territories to 55% from 50% starting July 1, 2011. Sections of the Senate bill would repeal various matching rates and FMAP increases on January 1, 2018. Presumptive eligibility allowed certain groups to enroll in Medicaid before completing applications. The ACA expands Medicaid presumptive-eligibility determinations, allowing more entities to make determinations for eligible populations. This includes all Medicaid-participating hospitals starting January 1, 2014. States can also provide presumptive-eligibility periods for specific groups like the ACA Medicaid expansion group and mandatory foster care coverage group. The ACA requires states to coordinate eligibility and enrollment systems for low-income subsidy programs. The Senate bill would terminate state ACA presumptive-eligibility elections and prohibit future elections, but states can still enroll certain populations based on preliminary Medicaid provider determinations. The Senate bill would repeal the state option for presumptive-eligibility period for certain Medicaid groups after December 31, 2017. It also eliminates the requirement for states to coordinate eligibility and enrollment systems for low-income subsidy programs starting January 1, 2018. States have the option to enroll specified groups in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage instead of traditional Medicaid benefits. The ACA Medicaid expansion requires states to provide Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) to eligible individuals, including the 10 essential health benefits. States can also offer ABP coverage to additional subgroups. The ACA Medicaid expansion mandates states to offer Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) with essential health benefits, including prescription drugs and mental health services. States must make disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals treating low-income patients, with federal matching funds capped by annual DSH allotments. The ACA directed reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments from FY2014 to FY2020, but subsequent laws have modified these reductions. The Medicaid DSH allotments were reduced from FY2014 to FY2020, with subsequent laws amending these reductions. Currently, the reductions are set to impact FY2018 through FY2025, after which allotments will be recalculated without the reductions. Section 208 of a Senate bill aims to repeal these reductions. Additionally, the ACA includes a provision for a new excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage, known as the Cadillac tax, which was initially scheduled to take effect in 2018 but was delayed until 2020. Section 209 of the Senate bill would repeal IRC Section 4980I, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Taxpayers can use various tax-advantaged health accounts for qualified medical expenses, with Section 9003 of the ACA amending IRC provisions to specify that only prescribed drugs and insulin qualify as expenses. Section 210 of the Senate bill would repeal the requirement for prescribed drugs or insulin in IRC Sections 106, 220, and 223. The Senate bill would reduce the tax rates on distributions from Archer MSAs and HSAs for non-medical expenses from 20% to 15% and 10% respectively, effective after December 31, 2015. Employers can establish cafeteria plans under IRC Section 125 for employees to choose between cash and nontaxable benefits. The ACA amends IRC Section 125(i) to limit health FSA contributions to $2,500 per year, indexed for inflation. The Senate bill proposes to repeal this limit starting in 2016. The ACA imposes fees on manufacturers/importers of branded prescription drugs and a tax on certain medical devices. The Senate bill proposes to repeal these fees starting in 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax, effective from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. The ACA imposes an annual fee on certain health insurers, with amounts set for different years and indexed to U.S. premium growth after 2018. The ACA imposes an annual fee on certain health insurers based on their net premiums written, with exemptions for certain types of insurers and insurance arrangements. Insurers are not subject to the fee on their first $25 million of net premiums written, with varying percentages imposed on net premiums above $25 million. The ACA imposes an annual fee on certain health insurers based on their net premiums written, with exemptions for certain types of insurers and insurance arrangements. Section 9010(j) of the ACA made these provisions effective for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2013. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provides a one-year moratorium on the tax for calendar year 2017. Section 215 of the Senate bill would repeal the annual fee on certain health insurance providers, effective beginning calendar year 2016. Employers providing Medicare-eligible retirees with prescription drug coverage meeting federal standards are eligible for federal subsidy payments. The Medicare Part D prescription drug program created subsidies for employers to maintain drug coverage for retirees. Employers can exclude retiree prescription drug plan subsidies from gross income for tax purposes. The ACA amended IRC Section 139A to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree drug coverage. The Senate bill would repeal the ACA change and reinstate the previous deduction rules. The Senate bill would repeal the ACA change and reinstate business-expense deductions for retiree prescription drug costs without reduction by federal subsidy. It would also reduce the AGI threshold for medical expense deductions to 7.5% for all taxpayers starting in tax year 2016. The ACA imposes a Medicare Hospital Insurance surtax of 0.9% on high-income taxpayers. The Senate bill proposes to repeal this surtax starting in tax year 2016. Additionally, the ACA introduces a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services. The Senate bill proposes repealing the tax on indoor tanning services and the net investment tax for high-income taxpayers starting in tax year 2016. Additionally, a statutory limitation is added for certain health insurance providers regarding deducting remuneration paid to employees as business expenses. The Senate bill proposes repealing the tax on indoor tanning services and the net investment tax for high-income taxpayers starting in tax year 2016. Additionally, a statutory limitation is added for certain health insurance providers regarding deducting remuneration paid to employees as business expenses. The economic substance doctrine, codified under HCERA Section 1409, requires transactions to have meaningful economic impact and substantial purpose beyond federal tax effects. HCERA Section 1409 imposes penalties on tax underpayments related to transactions lacking economic substance and affects the application of penalty provisions in IRC Sections 6662 and 6676. The Senate bill proposes repealing IRC Section 7701(o) and penalty provisions in IRC Sections 6662(b)(6) and 6662(i). The provision in IRC Sections 6662(b)(6) and 6662(i) would repeal provisions in IRC Section 6664 and IRC 6676 related to noneconomic substance transactions. It would apply to transactions after December 31, 2015. Medicare Part A is funded by a 2.9% payroll tax split between employers and workers, with an additional 0.9% tax on high-income earners imposed by the ACA. The HI trust fund for Medicare Part A is funded by various sources, including premiums from voluntary enrollees, federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, and interest on federal securities. In 2015, the fund is expected to bring in $278 billion in revenues and spend $276 billion on benefits and administration. It is projected to have an asset balance of $200 billion by the end of the year. If the fund cannot cover all expenses, it would be considered insolvent. The Medicare Trustees project the HI trust fund will be insolvent by 2030, covering only 86% of Part A expenditures. The Senate bill aims to transfer $379.3 billion from the Treasury to the trust fund to address on-budget savings during fiscal years 2016-2025."
