    "content": "On November 26, 2007, President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki signed the Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship between Iraq and the United States. This agreement paved the way for negotiations on a status of forces agreement (SOFA) and a strategic framework agreement to govern the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq post-2008. The Declaration of Principles signed by President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister paved the way for negotiations on a status of forces agreement (SOFA) and a strategic framework agreement. Lieutenant General Douglas Lute stated that the planned agreement would cover every aspect of the future U.S. military role in Iraq, with the goal of concluding it by July 31, 2008. Executive branch officials led by Ambassador Ryan Crocker finalized two agreements with the government of Iraq on November 17, 2008. Ryan Crocker finalized two agreements with the government of Iraq on November 17, 2008, after unanimous approval from Prime Minister al Maliki's cabinet on November 16. The agreements were the \"Strategic Framework Agreement for a Relationship of Friendship and Cooperation between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq\" and the \"Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq.\" The Iraqi approval process required three additional steps before the agreements could be signed. The Iraqi government had to approve the final version of the agreements on November 16. The Iraqi Council of Representatives had to vote to approve the agreements, and the Iraqi Presidency Council had to give its approval. A session in the COR on November 19 to approve the agreements was disrupted by a dispute over parliamentary process. Members argued about the constitutionality of the approval process. The Iraqi Council of Representatives passed the law approving the Iraq Agreements on November 27, 2008, despite opposition and criticism. A national referendum was also proposed for July 2009 to allow the Iraqi people to vote on the Agreements. Iraq's Presidency Council approved the Agreements on December 4. The Iraq Agreements were approved by Iraq's Presidency Council on December 4, 2008, and came into force on January 1, 2009. The Strategic Framework outlines the relationship between the United States and Iraq, emphasizing cooperation and the non-permanent presence of U.S. forces in Iraq. preparations for the July 2009 referendum have not been made yet. The Strategic Framework between the United States and Iraq outlines cooperation in various areas such as culture, economics, energy, health, environment, information technology, and law enforcement. It establishes committees to monitor implementation and allows for further agreements as necessary. The Framework came into force on January 1, 2009. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq regulates the temporary presence and activities of US forces in Iraq. It includes common provisions found in SOFAs, but also expands the scope by addressing the authority of US forces to conduct military operations within Iraq. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq governs the temporary presence and activities of US forces in Iraq. It allows US forces to conduct military operations within Iraq with approval from the Iraqi government and coordination through a Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee. The agreement also authorizes military operations to deter threats or aggression against Iraq and sets timelines for the withdrawal of US troops by December 31, 2011. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq sets timelines for the withdrawal of US troops by December 31, 2011, with an earlier deadline on June 30, 2009 for troop withdrawal from Iraqi cities and towns. It also allows for the withdrawal of US armed forces at any time upon request from Iraq. Additionally, the agreement establishes mechanisms for implementation and interpretation, as well as the creation of a Joint Ministerial Committee and Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee. Further mechanisms for implementation may be created under the agreement. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq sets timelines for troop withdrawal by December 31, 2011. President Obama's administration intends to abide by the terms of the Security Agreement and the Strategic Framework, with plans to withdraw the majority of troops by August 2010. The Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq sets timelines for troop withdrawal by December 31, 2011. Despite difficulties in implementation, some U.S. troops will remain beyond August 2010 to support Iraqi security forces and provide training. Negotiations are ongoing to extend the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq. The United States and Iraq are negotiating to extend the presence of U.S. troops in Baghdad and Mosul past the June 30, 2009 deadline. General Odierno and an Iraqi government spokesperson mentioned the possibility of renegotiating the timetable for overall withdrawal by the end of 2011 if needed. Iraqi commanders have criticized U.S. forces for not pre-coordinating their activities with Iraqi officials as required by the Security Agreement. Prime Minister al Maliki condemned a U.S. raid in Kut in April 2009 for lack of coordination. In late April 2009, a raid in the town of Kut occurred without Iraqi approval, leading to Prime Minister's condemnation as a breach of the security pact. Congress proposed legislation requiring formal approval of Iraq Agreements and conducted hearings on the matter. The Bush Administration and Iraqi legislature addressed concerns about the Iraq Agreements at congressional hearings, with the Administration defending its right to execute the Agreements without formal congressional approval. Congress received promises to be kept informed on the negotiations progress. At a June 4, 2008 hearing before the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, members of the Iraqi Council of Representatives testified that they believed no U.S.-Iraq agreement was proper at the time due to Iraq's lack of full sovereignty. Congress's response to the Iraq Agreements has highlighted the importance of congressional involvement, with some members arguing for Senate approval as a formal treaty or congressional approval through legislation. Some Members argue that any agreement with Iraq should involve meaningful consultation from Congress, regardless of its legal form. There are concerns that the Iraq Agreements, negotiated without congressional oversight, could restrict the Obama Administration and Congress, potentially involving U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the 2002 authorization. President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Secretary of State Clinton have all emphasized the need for congressional involvement in these agreements before they can take effect. Some Senators, including Vice President Biden and Secretary of State Clinton, introduced legislation for congressional approval before finalizing Agreements with Iraq. President Bush completed the Iraq Agreements as sole executive agreements, arguing it was within his inherent powers. Concerns were raised about legal protections for U.S. troops, withdrawal timetables, and the U.S. commitment to Iraq's security after the Agreements were finalized. The report discusses Congress's actions regarding the planned Iraq Agreements, including legislative initiatives and hearings. Enacted and proposed legislation aim to ensure a congressional role in the agreements through various provisions. Several hearings focused on the Iraq Agreements, congressional involvement, and concerns of the Iraqi parliament. Legislation has been proposed in the 111th Congress regarding the Agreements, with Representative Barbara Lee introducing two bills. Representative Barbara Lee introduced two bills in the 111th Congress regarding the Iraq Agreements, one reiterating demands from previous legislation and the other stating that the Agreements should not be binding. The Obama Administration plans to uphold the Agreements as international obligations despite congressional pressure. The bill introduced by Representative Lee on January 8, 2009, mirrors previous bills from the 110th Congress. Biden introduced a bill on August 1, 2008, which may have language issues due to the Strategic Framework and Security Agreement finalized in November 2008. The sense of Congress provision in the bill no longer holds true as of December 31, 2008. Section 5 requires consultation on negotiations that ended on November 17, 2008. Committees may want a briefing on the completed negotiations. Section 5 encourages the Secretary of State to provide the text of any agreement, including a U.S.-Iraq security commitment, before finalization. This provision may be useful for future agreements based on the Security Agreement or Strategic Framework. Section 6(a) prohibits agreements with security commitments without congressional approval. The Strategic Framework and Security Agreement with Iraq entered into force on January 1, 2009. Section 6(a) of the bill allows for potential future agreements between the United States and Iraq. The resolution introduced by Representative Barbara Lee addresses Congress's constitutional role in international agreements, war powers, and the lack of involvement in the Security Agreement negotiations. The resolution introduced by Representative Barbara Lee questions the legality and binding nature of the Security Agreement with Iraq, calling for Congressional hearings to consider its acceptance or rejection based on concerns about U.S. military operations, private security contractors, and Iraqi approval. The resolution introduced by Representative Barbara Lee questions the legality and binding nature of the Security Agreement with Iraq, calling for Congressional hearings to consider its acceptance or rejection based on concerns about U.S. military operations and private security contractors. H.Res. 72 also addresses the jurisdiction of private military contractors in Iraqi courts and the impact on Iraqi and foreign nationals held by U.S. forces. Congress enacted provisions during the 110th Congress regarding the use of defense appropriations for agreements subjecting U.S. troops to the Iraqi judicial system and requiring detailed reports on U.S.-Iraq agreements. No overall funding prohibition regarding Iraq was passed. Congress did not pass any overall funding prohibition regarding the Iraq Agreements, nor did it enact legislation requiring the Agreements to be submitted to Congress for approval as a treaty or a congressional-executive agreement. Legislation in 2008 and 2009 placed restrictions on implementing U.S.-Iraq agreements that subject U.S. forces to Iraqi jurisdiction or punishment under Iraqi law. Reports to Congress are required on any completed U.S.-Iraq agreement related to the legal status of military personnel, access to military bases, and rules of engagement for U.S. armed forces. The section requires a report to be transmitted not later than 90 days after enactment of the act (October 14, 2008) regarding U.S. combat operations, constraints on personnel, legal immunities, detainment authority, and intelligence collection. Updates are required for any substantially revised agreements related to these matters. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for detainment, interrogation, and intelligence collection in Iraq, as well as U.S. security commitments and payments for the use of bases. It also includes provisions for resolving disputes, applying the agreement to Coalition partners, and termination procedures. The reporting requirement ends on December 31, 2009, or earlier if the President submits any agreements to Congress. Several bills introduced during the 110th Congress regarding the Iraq Agreements highlighted Congress's concerns about oversight and its exclusion from the agreements. The bills aimed to define which agreements should require congressional approval, demand a consultative role for Congress in negotiations, and ensure briefings for relevant committees within 30 days of transmission. Several bills introduced during the 110th Congress regarding the Iraq Agreements aimed to define which agreements should require congressional approval, demand a consultative role for Congress in negotiations, and ensure briefings for relevant committees within 30 days of transmission. Members included provisions expressing concerns over the legal status and protections of U.S. troops under U.S. and international law, emphasizing the war powers of Congress in granting authority for U.S. troops to fight in Iraq. Certain bills stated that the Iraq Agreements would not be valid without congressional approval, with one bill providing for termination if Congress did not approve within a specified time period after execution by the executive branch. The Obama Administration is implementing the provisions of the Iraq Agreements despite previous opposition. Hearings during the 111th Congress show their intentions to meet the obligations of the Agreements, with Senator Clinton stating that withdrawal activities will continue under the Security Agreement. Senator Clinton confirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to withdrawing troops from Iraqi cities and towns by June 2009, as outlined in the Security Agreement. She mentioned the State Department's involvement in activities related to the Strategic Framework, such as rule of law, education, health care, and technical assistance for the energy industry. Senator Jim Webb asked Ambassador Christopher Hill to comment on the Security Agreement's provisions regarding troop withdrawal. Senator Webb raised concerns about the Security Agreement between the United States and Iraq, highlighting provisions for U.S. troop withdrawal by December 31, 2011, but also noting exceptions for external or internal threats. He suggested that Congress not approving the agreement could impact its effectiveness under U.S. constitutional law. Ambassador Hill reiterated the Obama Administration's commitment to withdrawing all forces by the specified date. Congress conducted hearings during the 110th Congress regarding the Iraq Agreements and expressed concerns about the lack of involvement in planning and negotiation. Members raised issues about the critical nature of the agreements to U.S. foreign policy and national security. The Bush Administration should have sought formal approval from Congress for the Iraq Agreements, as they could restrict the next President's Iraq policy. Congress may use its power of the purse to ensure its viewpoint is considered due to lack of consultation. The Security Agreement's vague provisions could lead to amendments without congressional oversight. Expert witnesses provided opinions on the Agreements during hearings. Many expert witnesses asserted that Congress should have had a greater role in the conclusion of the Iraq Agreements, stating that agreements involving U.S. commitment to Iraq's security or the authority of U.S. forces to fight in Iraq should be formally approved by Congress. The State Department's Circular 175 regulations require meaningful consultation with Congress before such agreements are signed. With the end of the U.N. mandate and Iraq's threat to U.S. national security, there is no current authorization under U.S. law for U.S. involvement in Iraq. The U.N. mandate for the use of force in Iraq has ended, leaving no authorization under U.S. law for military operations in Iraq. The extension of the U.N. mandate would have eliminated the need for quick conclusion of the Iraq Agreements, but it was not in the best interest of the U.S. and would weaken Iraq's sovereignty. The creation of the Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee (JMOCC) under the Security Agreement grants decision-making authority over U.S. military operations to Iraqi officials, requiring formal approval by Congress. Several Bush Administration officials made assertions about the negotiation and contents of the Iraq Agreements. The Bush Administration stated that the Iraq Agreements, including the Security Agreement, would not commit the US to defend Iraq's security or bind the next Administration to a specific Iraq policy. The agreements, termed as status of forces agreements (SOFA), outlined the legal status of US troops in Iraq and did not require congressional approval. The President was authorized to execute the agreements as sole executive agreements under his constitutional powers. The 2002 authorization for the use of force in Iraq remained effective due to the ongoing security situation. The Bush Administration asserted that the Iraq Agreements, including the Security Agreement, did not obligate the US to defend Iraq or tie the next Administration to a specific Iraq policy. The agreements, referred to as status of forces agreements (SOFA), defined the legal status of US troops in Iraq and did not need approval from Congress. The President could execute the agreements as sole executive agreements under his constitutional powers. Many Members of Congress had not seen the text of the Iraq Agreements as of November 17, 2008, when they were finalized. The Security Agreement contained provisions typical of SOFAs but also included unusual provisions, such as Article 27 regarding the authorization of U.S. military actions. Congress has options for further action to shape its involvement in the implementation of the Iraq Agreements, such as holding hearings, passing legislation, or defining the President's authority and Congress's role. Some Members may choose not to take further action. Congress could also choose to do nothing more if satisfied with its current measures to monitor the Agreements. The hearings conducted by congressional committees have produced evidence on the intentions of the Bush and Obama Administrations regarding the Iraq Agreements. Sworn testimony has been given on bases, security commitments, troop levels, legal immunity, and withdrawal timelines. Congress may continue to hold hearings to further investigate the future of the U.S.-Iraq relationship. The Bush and Obama Administrations' intentions on the U.S.-Iraq relationship and agreements have been discussed in congressional hearings. Congress should continue oversight by comparing previous assertions with the actual provisions of the agreements and seeking explanations from current Administration officials. Some Members of Congress may push for legislative action in response. The legislative approaches introduced in response to the Iraq Agreements fall into four main categories: executive-branch reporting, consultations with Congress, congressional approval requirements, and funding prohibitions. The consultation provisions are no longer operative. While reporting requirements are useful for informing Congress, they do not allow Congress to shape the implementation of the Agreements. The Obama Administration may argue for the President's constitutional authority within Article II for approval of the Agreements. The President may argue for his constitutional authority to conclude the Iraq Agreements as sole executive agreements, potentially conflicting with past positions. Legislation requiring congressional approval could lead to a constitutional confrontation, while funding prohibitions would not pose the same issues. The Iraq Agreements present constitutional issues within Congress's appropriations power. Cutting off funds may impact U.S. interests in Iraq and foreign policy in the Middle East. Administration officials cite past authorizations for the President's authority. Congress could consider legislation to clarify the President's authority for the Iraq Agreements. Legislation may be considered to define the President's authority for implementing the Iraq Agreements by adding specific language to existing use-of-force authorizations. This could include directives to reshape the authorization to use force in Iraq, such as consultation and reporting requirements, and specific interpretations or conditions related to security commitments and joint operational command. The Security Agreement addresses security commitments, joint operational command, and withdrawal timelines for U.S. armed forces in Iraq. Congress may need to approve any agreement replacing the U.N. mandate as the legal basis for the military presence in Iraq. The Security Agreement with Iraq may require approval from Congress to ensure legal validity and continued oversight. Introducing legislation for approval could reaffirm the 2002 authorization of the use of force and establish a framework for the Agreements within the legislative process. In November 2008, the conclusion of the Agreements with the government of Iraq could potentially transform sole executive agreements into \"ex-post congressional-executive agreements.\" Legislation approving the Agreements could strengthen Congress's role in their execution and approval, without requiring changes to the Agreements or the Administration's plans for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. Legislation approving the Iraq Agreements could provide Congress with the opportunity to attach conditions and interpretations, require consultation and reporting, and strengthen its role in the execution and approval process. Congress may require the President to consult or report on any amendments, new agreements, or implementation arrangements, submitting them for approval. Legislation approving the Iraq Agreements could give Congress a more active role in implementation and approval. This could involve creating a joint congressional-executive decision-making mechanism, mandating direct inclusion of Members of Congress in negotiations, and establishing a monitoring body to review implementation. An example is the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, established by Congress to oversee the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act, could potentially involve Congress in the approval and implementation of the proposed Iraq Agreements. This would raise constitutional issues regarding Congress's role in foreign policy, as outlined in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The proposed legislation reacting to the Iraq Agreements includes powers governing militia employed in the service of the United States and rules concerning captures on land and water. This could create conflict between the branches regarding the apportionment of constitutional power regarding war and foreign policy. Senator John Warner submitted an amendment requiring the President to direct the Secretary of State to initiate negotiations on a Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq. The proposed amendment to H.R. 1585 (110th Congress) aimed to initiate negotiations for a status of forces agreement with Iraq within 120 days. However, the amendment was not formally proposed, and H.R. 1585 was vetoed by President Bush. As a result, H.R. 4986 became the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 without similar language. Senator Hillary Clinton introduced the Congressional Oversight of Iraq Agreements Act of 2007 (S. 2426) on December 6, 2007. The bill focuses on the constitutional role of Congress in approving international agreements, specifically regarding a potential U.S.-Iraq security agreement. It requires a report from the Legal Advisor to the Secretary of State on the justification for the anticipated Iraq agreements. The Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act of 2008 (H.R. 4959) introduced by Representative Rosa L. DeLauro defines a long-term security, economic, or political agreement with the Government of Iraq as one lasting more than a year and involving U.S. bases, defense commitments, security assurances, and training. The bill requires Senate or congressional approval for any such agreement to receive funding. The Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act of 2008 (H.R. 4959) introduced by Representative Rosa L. DeLauro defines long-term security, economic, or political agreements with the Government of Iraq as lasting more than a year and involving U.S. bases, defense commitments, security assurances, and training. The bill requires Senate or congressional approval for any such agreement to receive funding. The bill includes provisions for security commitments, training or equipping of Iraq's security forces, economic and diplomatic arrangements, and consultation requirements for executive officers with congressional committees and leadership. The Iraq Strategic Agreement Review Act of 2008 (H.R. 4959) introduced by Representative Rosa L. DeLauro defines long-term security, economic, or political agreements with Iraq as lasting more than a year and involving U.S. bases, defense commitments, security assurances, and training. The bill requires Senate or congressional approval for any such agreement to receive funding. It includes provisions for security commitments, training or equipping of Iraq's security forces, economic and diplomatic arrangements, and consultation requirements for executive officers with congressional committees and leadership. Additionally, a bill (H.R. 5128) introduced by Representative Barbara Lee on January 23, 2008, disapproves any agreement based on the Declaration of Principles without an act of Congress. Barbara Lee introduced legislation on January 23, 2008, regarding U.S. bases in Iraq. The bill requires any agreement from the Declaration of Principles to be approved by the Iraqi legislature and Congress. It states that agreements must be approved by an Act of Congress and prohibits funds from being used without congressional approval. The bill was referred to the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Service Committees. The Protect Our Troops and Our Constitution Act of 2008 (H.R. 5626) was introduced by Representative Bill Delahunt on March 13, 2008. It raises concerns about inconsistencies in the Iraq agreements and prohibits the use of funds for establishing permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq. The Protect Our Troops and Our Constitution Act of 2008 prohibits the establishment of permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq without Senate approval or Congressional authorization. It emphasizes that long-term U.S.-Iraq relations should be decided by the next administration and calls for consultation with Congress, the government of Iraq, Coalition partners, and Iraq's neighbors. The bill also urges the renewal of the U.N. mandate for Iraq to ensure legal authority for the U.S. presence and immunity for U.S. armed forces. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (H.R. 5658) requires a report on U.S.-Iraq agreements related to military personnel, bases, rules of engagement, and security commitments. Introduced in March 2008 and passed by the House in May 2008, this bill addresses the legal status of U.S. forces in Iraq. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 mandates reports on U.S.-Iraq agreements regarding military personnel, bases, rules of engagement, and security commitments. These reports must include details on limits on U.S. combat operations, legal protections for personnel, detainee interrogation authority, and security assurances against threats to Iraq. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 requires reports on U.S.-Iraq agreements concerning military personnel, bases, rules of engagement, and security commitments. The reports must cover payments to Iraq for base use, claims of damages by U.S. personnel, restrictions on U.S. personnel, approval process by the Iraqi government, dispute resolution, application to Coalition partners, and termination procedures. H.R. 5658, related to U.S.-Iraq agreements, was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar in 2008 but saw no further action. S. 3433 and H.R. 6846, introduced by Senator Biden and Representative Lee, respectively, outlined findings and definitions regarding U.S.-Iraq negotiations for security commitments. The curr_chunk discusses the obligations of the United States in security arrangements with other countries, emphasizing the need for joint decision-making. It also mentions the extension of the U.N. mandate for U.S. forces in Iraq and the requirement for annual reports on security commitments. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for annual reports on security agreements with Iraq, including details of each agreement and the need for consultation with relevant committees. The curr_chunk outlines prohibitions and exceptions regarding security commitments or arrangements with Iraq, emphasizing the need for constitutional approval and restrictions on funding. No legislative action was taken on S. 3433 or H.R. 6846. The curr_chunk discusses the Sense of Congress Provision Concerning Extension of the Mandate of the Multinational Force in Iraq and Congressional Role in a U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement and Status of Forces Agreement. Senator Jim Webb submitted an amendment to seek an extension of the mandate for the MNF-I past December 31, 2008. No further action was taken on H.R. 6846. The curr_chunk discusses the need for the Bush Administration to provide full texts of the U.S.-Iraq strategic framework agreement and status of forces agreement to Congress before their entry into force. Any finalized agreement should be approved by Congress within 180 days. This amendment was not considered prior to the enactment of S. 3001 into law. Policy (H.Res. 1028) introduced by Representative Barbara Lee encourages legislative approval over certain international agreements that involve the use of armed forces or financial resources by the U.S. government. Resolution H.Res. 1123, introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, addresses the costs of the continued U.S. presence in Iraq and the need for Iraq to agree to pay these costs in any bilateral agreement. It emphasizes the importance of legislative approval for agreements that involve U.S. financial resources or armed forces. Resolution H.Res. 1123, introduced by Representative Dana Rohrabacher, focuses on the costs of maintaining U.S. forces in Iraq and the requirement for Iraq to reimburse the United States for these expenses in any agreement involving U.S. armed forces. The resolution highlights the necessity of congressional approval for agreements involving U.S. financial resources or military presence. The summaries of congressional hearings on the Iraq Agreements include key details relevant to Congress's role in the agreement-making process for the Strategic Framework and SOFA. Concerns and opinions of Members and expert witnesses are highlighted, representing salient issues regarding the Iraq Agreements and congressional involvement. The summaries do not claim to reflect the views of all Members or experts, nor do they encompass all policy positions on the Iraq Agreements. The House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight held a hearing on the extension of the United Nations mandate for Iraq, focusing on the implications for political relations between Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki and the Iraqi Council of Representatives. Witnesses discussed the U.N. Security Council's Resolution 1790, which extended the mandate for coalition forces in Iraq until December 31, 2008, and the Declaration of Principles signed by President Bush and Prime Minister al Maliki. The Research Service testified at a hearing on the main issues for negotiation of Agreements with Iraq, including legal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel and facilities, freedom of action for U.S. forces, troop strength, duration, and political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural issues. Some committee members expressed concern about the lack of congressional approval for the proposed Agreements. At a joint hearing in January 2008, organizations and House Subcommittee members questioned the Bush Administration's negotiation of agreements with Iraq without consulting Congress. Legal scholars discussed the need for congressional approval and opportunities for increased congressional involvement. Concerns were raised about violations of State Department regulations and constitutional requirements. The Bush Administration's negotiation of agreements with Iraq without consulting Congress has raised concerns about binding future presidents, the potential weakening of the United States' reputation as a trustworthy partner, and the need for congressional involvement to ensure implementation. Congress may need to use its power of the purse to challenge the President's authority in making executive agreements, potentially leading to a constitutional crisis. Certain Members believe the President has the authority to enter into Iraq Agreements as sole executive agreements, and congressional attempts to limit that power may be unconstitutional. Legal scholars provided opinions on the need for congressional approval, stating that a \"security commitment\" would require Senate approval, while agreements for U.S. bases in Iraq must not conflict with earlier legislation. The Administration should adhere to State Department regulations. The Administration should adhere to State Department regulations for the Iraq Agreements, even if executed as executive agreements, would still have to work within congressional parameters. Secretary Gates did not rule out submitting an agreement with Iraq to the Senate for advice and consent as a treaty, based on the agreement's contents. Secretary Gates testified that the Iraq Agreements will not include a U.S. commitment to defend Iraq or a \"security component\". The Administration does not seek permanent bases in Iraq and the agreements will outline rules for U.S. forces post-UN Security Council resolution expiration. Legal immunity for U.S. contractors and detainee rules will be included. Any agreement with Iraq will not bind future administrations and transparency is emphasized. The hearing on the Iraq Agreements emphasized the need for transparency in the negotiation process, congressional oversight, and review of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) before implementation. Key questions included the authorization of U.S. forces to engage in combat, congressional approval for agreements involving U.S. defense commitments, required consultation with Congress on Iraq Agreements, and necessary procedures to be followed. The hearing on the Iraq Agreements highlighted the importance of transparency in negotiations, congressional oversight, and review of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) before implementation. Key issues discussed included the authorization for U.S. forces to stay in Iraq beyond the U.N. mandate, the need for approval from both Congress and the Iraqi COR, and concerns about misleading signals from the Declaration of Principles. Expert testimony emphasized that a defense commitment cannot be part of a status of forces agreement and raised questions about the level of security obligations outlined in the Declaration of Principles. The Declaration of Principles may impose a greater obligation on the United States than mutual defense treaties, involving defense against internal threats and automatic use of force in Iraq's defense. The proposed SOFA may expand presidential prerogatives regarding immunity for security contractors, but the specific 2002 authorization for the use of force against Iraq no longer applies, requiring a new national commitment of U.S. armed forces that necessitates congressional approval. The FY2009 foreign affairs budget hearings included questions to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the proposed Iraq Agreements. She clarified that the agreements do not involve permanent bases, defense obligations, or specific troop levels, and are intended to allow legal operation of U.S. forces after the U.N. mandate. The Administration will consult with Congress during negotiations, and the SOFA will not restrict actions. The Administration will consult with Congress as negotiations progress for the proposed Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in Iraq, which does not bind the next president. The House Subcommittee emphasized the need for Congress to review and approve the SOFA due to its significance to U.S. foreign policy. Professor Michael J. Matheson suggested that Congress define the scope of authority for military operations in Iraq. Ambassador David Satterfield stated that the Iraq Agreements will not include a binding commitment to defend Iraq. The hearing took place before a joint session of the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight and the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia on March 4, 2008. The Iraq Agreements will not create permanent U.S. bases or specify troop numbers in Iraq. Any arrangement fulfilling the Declaration of Principles will be made public. The Strategic Framework is not legally binding. The Administration has clarified to Iraqi officials that there is no obligation to enter combat if Iraq is attacked. The Agreements do not commit U.S. forces to remain in Iraq, relying on the 2002 authorization for the presence of troops. The Administration's position on the Iraq Agreements is that they do not require congressional approval, but they will comply with constitutional requirements. Background briefings have been held with Members of Congress, and will continue, although negotiating positions will not be publicly disclosed. Secretary Rice reiterated that the Administration is not seeking permanent bases in Iraq during a hearing on the International Affairs Budget for Fiscal Year 2009. The Administration's position on the Iraq Agreements is that they do not require congressional approval. Secretary Rice stated that the SOFA being negotiated does not set troop levels or make commitments to specific operations. The President's authority to continue the U.S. presence in Iraq was mentioned without citing specific legal basis during hearings on the Iraq Report Regarding the U.S. Troop Surge. Ambassador Ryan Crocker testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Committee on April 9, 2008, discussing the U.S. troop surge in Iraq and the Iraq Agreements. He explained that the Agreements were requested by Iraqi leaders in 2007 as a affirmation of their sovereignty, with no provisions for permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. Crocker stated the intention to conclude the SOFA as a sole executive agreement. The Administration intended to conclude the SOFA as a sole executive agreement, with the Strategic Framework seen as a political agreement rather than a legally enforceable international agreement. Ambassador David Satterfield testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 10, 2008, reiterating key points such as no permanent U.S. bases, no troop level requirements, and no binding commitment to defend Iraq. The Administration's position was to treat the SOFA as an executive agreement, not a treaty. The Administration intended to conclude the Strategic Framework as an executive agreement, not a treaty, with no legally binding commitments. Ambassador Satterfield cited the President's authority for the U.S. presence in Iraq post-UN mandate expiration. The House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight heard from Iraqi Parliament members on the U.S. presence in Iraq. The Iraqi Parliament members expressed concerns about the U.S. presence in Iraq and the proposed Iraq Agreements, stating that Iraq lacks full sovereignty to enter into agreements with the U.S. as an equal party. They emphasized the need for approval by the COR for any agreement and called for a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. forces. Chairman Delahunt proposed an interparliamentary dialogue mechanism between the U.S. and Iraq legislatures. The Iraqi Parliament members expressed concerns about the U.S. presence in Iraq and the proposed Iraq Agreements, emphasizing the need for approval by the COR and a timetable for U.S. forces withdrawal. Chairman Delahunt proposed an interparliamentary dialogue mechanism between the U.S. and Iraq legislatures to better inform themselves. Hearings were held on the status of negotiations with Iraq on agreements and the possible extension of the U.N. mandate if agreements were not finalized by December 31, 2008. Members of Congress discussed these issues in July 2008. Several Members of Congress expressed concerns over the Bush Administration's ability to finalize the Iraq Agreements before the U.N. mandate expiration on December 31, 2008. They emphasized the need for consultation with Congress and approval of the Agreements. Witnesses presented differing views on the issue, with some arguing that executing the Security Agreement and Strategic Framework would better serve U.S. national security interests than extending the U.N. mandate. The extension of the U.N. mandate in Iraq is seen as a way to maintain legality and protection for U.S. troops, amidst difficulties in negotiations over the Iraq Agreements. Iraqi officials and the population welcome non-military U.S. assistance but seek a timetable for troop withdrawal in any bilateral agreement. Congress can play a role in strengthening the execution of the agreements. Congress can enhance its role in overseeing the Iraq Agreements by collaborating with the Iraqi COR, ensuring transparency in the process, and involving both U.S. and Iraqi populations. Dr. Ayad Allawi, former Iraqi prime minister and current COR member, emphasized the need for transparency and COR approval of the Agreements in line with the Iraqi constitution. Opposition within the COR stems from a lack of information on the Agreements. The House Armed Services Committee held a hearing on July 23, 2008, where Mr. Gene Dodaro testified about the Iraq Agreements and the termination of the U.N. mandate. He emphasized the need for COR approval and transparency in the process. The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on September 23, 2008, where Secretary of Defense Robert Gates discussed the challenges in negotiating the Iraq Agreements. The Iraqi government's concerns about sovereignty were highlighted, and Secretary Gates assured that Congress would be consulted before signing the Agreements. Senator Warner emphasized the need for full consultation with Congress regarding the finalized Iraq Agreements, with Secretary Gates confirming the commitment to reach out to members before finalizing the agreements. This discussion took place during a hearing before the House Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight on November 19, 2008. The hearing focused on renewing the U.N. mandate for Iraq, but discussions centered on the bilateral U.S.-Iraq Agreements. Chairman Delahunt expressed frustration with the Bush Administration's lack of consultation with Congress and opposition to extending the UN mandate. Members were surprised by the Administration's insistence on finalizing the Security Agreement before December 31, 2008. Members at the hearing expressed concerns about the provisions of the Security Agreement, including Iraqi reimbursement of U.S. costs, multilateral cooperation in Iraq's reconstruction, legal immunity for private security contractors, and vague provisions. Thomas Donnelly recommended Congress approve the Agreement to support U.S. interests in Iraq. Congress should approve the Security Agreement to aid the President by clarifying the legal status of U.S. troops and bolstering Iraq's stability. It would weaken Moqtada al Sadr's supporters, reject Iran's influence, and improve Iraq's self-image. Concerns were raised about the U.S. forces' withdrawal from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and uncertainty about future operations post-December 31, 2011. The Agreement does not require Iraq to reimburse the U.S., but the U.S. should strengthen Iraq's budgetary process. The United States should strengthen Iraq's budgetary process to enhance its ability to take over security responsibilities. Discussions were held regarding Iraqi courts' jurisdiction over U.S. forces and contractors. Professor Oona Hathaway raised constitutional concerns about the Security Agreement, arguing that certain provisions exceeded the President's constitutional powers. The Security Agreement raised constitutional concerns as it granted U.S. forces the ability to fight in Iraq without prior congressional approval, required Iraqi approval of U.S. military operations, and included timetables for troop withdrawal. Professor Hathaway argued that such agreements should be treated as treaties requiring Senate approval, and that the war in Iraq would become illegal under U.S. law as Iraq is no longer a threat. Professor Hathaway argued that without an extension of the UN mandate or congressional approval of the Security Agreement, the war in Iraq would lack legal authority. She stated that if Congress does not approve the Security Agreement, it would be unconstitutional. She suggested that legislation from Congress requiring approval of the Security Agreement could protect congressional powers. Professor Hathaway explained that the President may submit the Security Agreement to Congress for approval, creating an \"ex post congressional-executive agreement.\" She emphasized that any changes to the agreement must be agreed upon by the President. Testimony from Issam M. Saliba outlined the Iraqi constitutional requirements for ratification of international agreements. Mr. Saliba explained that the ratification of international treaties in Iraq requires a two-thirds majority vote by the COR. He mentioned that a specific law for ratification has not been passed yet, making it unclear if the Iraq Agreements can be ratified by a simple majority. Chairman Delahunt and Speaker of the COR, Dr. Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, agreed that a two-thirds majority vote would be legally valid for approving the agreements. Raed Jarrar, Iraq consultant to the American Friends Service Committee, testified that many political factions within the COR oppose entering into the Iraq Agreements at this time, arguing that the COR has not been adequately involved in the negotiation and needed more time to consider the agreement. Concerns were raised about Article 29 of the Security Agreement, which allows for additional implementation agreements without parliamentary approval. Political parties aligned with the Prime Minister suggested the agreement could be passed by a simple majority, a move seen as politically motivated by Mr. Jarrar. Raed Jarrar, Iraq consultant to the American Friends Service Committee, highlighted concerns about the proposed law on ratifications for the Iraq Agreements, emphasizing the need for a two-thirds vote in the COR. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's insistence on COR approval was noted, with fears of potential splits among Iraqi groups. The absence of the Iraqi constitutional court was mentioned, raising the possibility of the Security Agreement being deemed invalid. Professor Michael Matheson discussed the extension of the U.N. mandate for Iraq through resolution procedures. Professor Matheson discussed the extension of the U.N. mandate for Iraq through resolution procedures, including the possibility of passing a new Security Council resolution as a Chapter VII or Chapter VI mandate. He explained that a Chapter VI mandate would not affect Iraqi sovereignty and would allow U.S. forces to continue operating in Iraq with legal status and protections. Certain Chapter VII resolutions would still be in effect, such as those regarding Iraqi oil assets and compensation for Kuwaiti victims of the first Gulf War."
