    "content": "In this paper, the learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (LISTA) is studied for solving sparse coding problems. A gated mechanism is introduced to address lower than expected code components in its estimations, inspired by convergence analyses. Gain gates and overshoot gates are designed to compensate for insufficient step size in LISTA. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the method in various machine learning applications. Sparse coding aims to recover a sparse vector from noisy observations using an over-complete basis matrix. The challenge lies in incorporating the nonconvex sparse constraint and determining the non-zero elements. Convex functions like the l1-norm penalty are used to relax the sparsity constraint. Traditional solvers like Lasso and ISTA are commonly used but suffer from limitations. Deep learning methods have shown success in various tasks, including sparse coding. Deep neural networks are trained to approximate the optimal sparse code, improving upon traditional solvers like ISTA. In this paper, the authors explore weaknesses in LISTA, a neural network-based approximator inspired by ISTA for sparse coding. Previous studies have shown LISTA's tendency to learn large biases for linear convergence, but this leads to lower magnitude of code components compared to ground-truth. Further enhancements are needed in LISTA. The authors analyze weaknesses in LISTA, propose gain and overshoot gates to improve optimization, and provide convergence analyses for LISTA with or without gates. The authors propose gain and overshoot gates to enhance LISTA optimization, providing convergence analyses for LISTA with or without gates. Their method outperforms state-of-the-art sparse coding networks, including LFSITA and ALISTA variants. Insightful expressions for the gates are presented, along with conditions for guaranteed performance. Sparse coding involves solving a problem where the residual of approximating y with a linear combination of features in A is calculated. The function f(x, y) is convex with respect to x, with a Gaussian vector \u03b5 leading to f(x, y) = Ax - y^2. The term \u03bbr(x) acts as a sparsity regularizer, with various algorithms applicable for solving the problem. In the paper, the focus is on the (L)ISTA algorithm for solving optimization problems. By introducing a scalar \u03b3 > 0, an upper bound of the objective function can be optimized using ISTA. The update rule involves a shrinking function and can be iteratively performed until convergence, although ISTA is known for slow convergence. ISTA is known for slow convergence, and DNNs can accelerate the procedure. LISTA follows ISTA's main procedure but learns parameters in an end-to-end manner from data. The inference process of LISTA is similar to an RNN, with learnable parameters set. Works have shown constraints for W(t) and U(t). Parameters in \u0398 are learned by minimizing the difference between code estimations and ground-truth. In this paper, the advocated gain gates and overshoot gates are introduced for theoretical analyses. The sparse vector x and noise vector \u03b5 are sampled from a set X (B, s, 0). The convergence is guaranteed by ensuring bias terms are large enough to eliminate false positives in the generated codes. The paper introduces gain gates and overshoot gates for theoretical analyses, ensuring convergence by eliminating false positives in the generated codes. Proposition 1 highlights the importance of enforcing gains on code components for more accurate estimations in LISTA. The paper introduces gain gates and overshoot gates to improve LISTA convergence by enlarging code components. The gain gate, similar to a reset gate in GRU, enhances estimation accuracy by adjusting the input. The gated mechanism ensures convergence to the ground-truth x_s by entangling U(t) and W(t) in the estimation process. The paper introduces gain gates and overshoot gates to improve LISTA convergence by enlarging code components. The gated mechanism modifies the update rule in neural networks, raising questions about guaranteed convergence. Theoretical analyses are conducted to explore the entanglement of learnable matrices and properties required for fast convergence. Theorems 1 and 2 provide insights based on specific assumptions, with Theorem 1 stating conditions for x_s to be a fixed point of the modified update rule. The paper introduces gain gates and overshoot gates to improve LISTA convergence by enlarging code components. Theoretical analyses explore the entanglement of learnable matrices and properties for fast convergence. The gain gate function converges to a constant matrix to guarantee performance. Splitting the gate function into an identical and residual one is advocated for convergence. Theoretical results are presented based on Proposition 1, showing conditions for gate function performance. Theorem 2 provides an upper bound for LISTA with gain gates. Expressions for the gate function are derived, with parameters for learning capacities. Different choices for the function f t (x (t) ) are evaluated. In experiments, different choices for the function f t (x (t) ) are evaluated, including the piece-wise linear function and the inverse proportional function with parameters to be learned. The performance of LISTA can be improved by using a gain gate, but practical results show that using the inverse proportional function in lower layers may degrade performance, possibly due to impractical assumptions. In this subsection, assumptions about \"false positive\" are relaxed to achieve a tighter bound. The inverse proportional gain function is suggested for adoption only in higher layers. A definition is introduced to characterize the relationship with the false positive rate. The convergence of LISTA without gates is analyzed based on similar assumptions. In this subsection, assumptions about \"false positive\" are relaxed to achieve a tighter bound. The error bound of LISTA without gates is re-deduced with a different requirement for b(t) from Proposition 1, leading to a lower error bound when the threshold b(t) is reduced. The theoretical results show that the previous bound of LISTA with gain gates may not be lower than the tighter bound of a standard LISTA, explaining the contradiction between theoretical and empirical results. The error bound of gated LISTA with the inverse proportional function is derived in Theorem 4, suggesting the application of a gain gate expressed by the inverse proportional function. In the implementation of gated LISTA, gain gates expressed by the inverse proportional function are applied to deeper layers. Other functions show consistent performance gains on both lower and higher layers. ReLU-based piece-wise linear function is used on the first 10 layers, while overshoot gates act as adjustments to outputs. Different gain gate functions will be empirically compared in Section 4.1. The overshoot gates in LISTA act as learnable boosts to the outputs, with \u03b7 = 1 being questioned as the most suitable choice. The update rule of ISTA is analyzed theoretically, suggesting a need for a boost in \u03b7 for superior performance, inspiring the design of specific overshoot gates for LISTA. Boost in \u03b7 for superior performance leads to the design of specific overshoot gates for LISTA, aiming for the output of the gate function to be greater than or equal to 1. Different expressions, like the sigmoid-based function, are considered to achieve this goal. The overshoot gate design in our method differs from momentum-based methods like FISTA and LFISTA by considering the scaling factor to be time-and-input-varying. This design enhances the sparse coding network's learning capability. Experimental comparisons confirm the superiority of our method, and convergence analyses generalize to cases with \u03b7 > 1. In this section, experiments are conducted to validate theoretical results and assess the performance of gated sparse coding networks on synthetic and real data. Parameters such as m = 250, n = 500 are set, and dictionary matrix elements are randomly sampled. Sparse vector elements are determined using Bernoulli sampling, with noise levels and condition numbers varied in simulations. In the sparse coding simulations, random synthesis of input data is done for training, validation, and test sets. The proposed gated LISTA method sets parameters and constraints for deep learning-based methods. Training batch size is 64, Adam optimizer is used, and learnable parameters are initialized accordingly. The training batch size is 64, Adam optimizer is used with specific parameters, and hyper-parameters are tuned on the validation set. The sparse coding network is trained progressively, with learning rate adjustments based on validation loss. Training stops when validation loss no longer decreases. More details can be found in Section 8 of the appendix. The sparse coding network in the LISTA model includes parameters in gate functions. Training involves minimizing an empirical loss, and the evaluation metric is normalized MSE. An auxiliary loss is introduced to prevent false positives, with a focus on achieving no \"false positive\" rates. LISTA-nfp shows minimal false positives but slower convergence in practice. In Figure 4, the convergence of the gated LISTA with ReLU-based gain gate function is slower without \"false positive\". The output of the gate function is expected to converge to 1, leading to D becoming an identity matrix. The convergence to zero confirms the theorem. Three types of gated LISTA models are tested with a gain gate. The results confirm the theorem by applying three types of gated LISTA models with different gain gate functions. The models show superior performance compared to standard LISTA without \"false positive\". Despite the presence of \"false positives\" in lower layers, the evaluated false positive rate approaches zero in higher layers, consistent with theoretical conclusions. Empirical analyses of the gate functions are also conducted. Analyses were conducted on different gate functions for LISTA models, showing improved convergence and performance. Gain gates were tested, with the removal of certain terms leading to performance degradation. Various activation functions were also explored, with closer outputs to boundary conditions showing better performance. When gain gates are combined with overshoot gates in LISTA models, faster convergence on lower layers is achieved without affecting overall performance. This approach shows superior performance in shallow models and similar final performance in deep models compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our GLISTA model, incorporating gain gates, outperforms competitive methods like LISTA and LAMP under various noise levels and condition numbers. The introduced gates significantly improve LISTA performance, with NMSE decreasing fastest using GLISTA. Results show that using gain gates alone can already yield better performance. Using gain gates alone can outperform existing state-of-the-arts, while incorporating overshoot gates can further boost performance. The gain gates are incorporated into variants of LISTA, such as LFISTA and ALISTA, resulting in GFLISTA and AGLISTA. Experiment results show that models with gain gates perform significantly better under different noise levels, verifying the method's generalization ability. The method of using gain gates outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques, especially when combined with overshoot gates. This is validated by experiments showing better performance under various noise levels. Moving on to a practical task of photometric stereo analysis using sparse coding, the goal is to estimate the norm vector of a 3D object's surface under different light conditions. The process involves representing observations as a vector and solving for the norm vector using known light directions. The estimation of noise can be treated as a sparse coding problem, with a recovery method outlined in Xin et al.'s paper (2016). In the sparse coding problem, the dictionary matrix Q, sparse code e, and observation Qo are defined. GLISTA is used to estimate e, with the final result calculated as L \u2020 (o \u2212 e * ). Comparison is made with LISTA and traditional methods in Table 2 using the bunny picture for evaluation. In this paper, the authors study LISTA for solving sparse coding problems and introduce gated mechanisms to address potential weaknesses. They prove that LISTA with gain gates achieves faster convergence and lower reconstruction errors. The effectiveness of the introduced gates is verified in various experiments, leading to state-of-the-art performance. Future work aims to extend the method to convolutional neural networks for more complex tasks. The authors study LISTA for sparse coding, introducing gain gates for faster convergence and lower errors. Gates are effective in experiments, aiming to extend to convolutional neural networks for complex tasks. Key notations and definitions are provided for clarity. The update rule of LISTA is proven using Mathematical Induction to show that the support set of x(t) is always a subset of S. This ensures a \"false positive\" property.

The l2 error bound of the t-th layer in LISTA is calculated using a specific formula, where the convergence is linear and the support set of x(t) is always a subset of S. In Eq. (37), m ij = 0 if i = j, and g \u03ba (x s ) i is a constant for i \u2208 S. The conclusion of Theorem 1 is that g \u03ba (x s ) is a constant vector with D as a constant diagonal matrix. Substituting b (t) and diag(g \u03ba (x s )) into Eq. (32) yields the final form of the equation. The proof of Theorem 2 for the update rule of LISTA with gain gates involves simplifying equations and ensuring a \"false positive\" property. By analyzing the gain gates and applying specific formulas, the non-zero values of the index i are calculated, leading to a conclusion about the support set of x(t+1). The update rule of LISTA with gain gates involves analyzing equations to determine the support set of x(t+1) based on non-zero values of the index i. The relationship between x(t) and x(s) is deduced for the last layer using specific formulas and calculations. The LISTA update rule involves analyzing equations to determine the support set of x(t+1) based on non-zero values of the index i. The relationship between x(t) and x(s) is deduced for the last layer using specific formulas and calculations. Using Eq. (44), Eq. (26), and Eq. (27), Eq. (53) is deduced, where c = log((2s \u2212 1)\u00b5(A)). The inequality sign holds due to Eq. (52), and the last equation holds because of c = log((2s \u2212 1)\u00b5(A)). The number of false positives is controlled by k t+1, with |S(t+1)| \u2264 k t+1. The l2 error bound of the t-th layer is also discussed.

Select b(i) such that \u03c9i(ki|\u0398) \u2264 1. The conclusions in Theorem 4 have been proven, and experimental results validate Proposition 2 regarding ISTA with adaptive overshoot for sparse coding. The adaptation of ISTA for sparse coding involves enlarging the step size through backtracking line search. Comparison with similar methods like LFISTA and LIHT shows that the overshoot gates offer faster convergence in lower layers. In deeper layers, LFISTA converges slowly while the overshoot gates still perform well, indicating the benefit of the time-varying property. The overshoot gates continue to perform well, showing the benefit of their time-varying property. Our gated LISTA (GLISTA) outperforms other methods in sparse coding under less challenging settings, with significant improvements in results. The model is trained progressively by including more layers in stages with different learning rates. Training on each layer is split into three stages, with performance monitored on the validation set. An adaptive overshoot is performed to confirm Proposition 2. Algorithm 1 ISTA with adaptive overshoot is used to update the step size for sparse coding in the experiment. The algorithm is similar to backtracking line search, with \u03c4 as the step size for line search. The objective function f(x, y) + \u03bbr(x) is updated until no further decrease is observed."
