    "content": "The FY2017 NDAA has sparked debates on U.S. security sector assistance to foreign countries. Congress is expected to reconcile differences in the NDAA, potentially changing security cooperation policies. The State Department has historically led U.S. security assistance efforts, funded through congressional appropriations. The U.S. Department of Defense has increasingly engaged in security cooperation with foreign militaries and security forces, following new authorities granted by Congress since 9/11. This expansion has elevated DOD's role in foreign policy decision-making. The U.S. Department of Defense has seen an increase in its role in foreign policy decision-making due to Congress granting new authorities since 9/11. However, the numerous provisions created by Congress have created a complex and unwieldy \"patchwork\" that complicates the management and oversight of these engagements. This has led to challenges in planning and executing DOD's objectives. The FY2017 NDAA seeks to address concerns about security cooperation functions and improve Congress's ability to evaluate DOD's application of security cooperation authorities. Provisions in the bill could alter how DOD conducts security cooperation programming and impact oversight of related funding and programming. In April 2016, DOD submitted 10 proposals for the FY2017 NDAA to consolidate security cooperation authorities and standardize statutory language for clarity and effectiveness in using existing authorities. The proposals aimed to organize and consolidate existing authorities while improving security cooperation planners' ability to utilize them more effectively. DOD proposed consolidating and modifying security cooperation authorities in the FY2017 NDAA. The House and Senate had different responses, with the House including minor changes and the Senate incorporating most of DOD's proposals into a new security cooperation chapter in the U.S. Code. S. 2943 proposed new measures to align DOD's programs with strategic requirements, centralize security cooperation programs under a new funding mechanism, create a professionalized workforce, and require assessment of activities. It also aimed to alter the State Department's role in overseeing security cooperation programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee's markup of the FY2017 NDAA proposed reforms to modernize and streamline DOD's security cooperation enterprise, aiming to reduce legal authorities and funding sources, improve operational outcomes, program management, oversight, and transparency. These reforms would align security cooperation activities with strategic objectives. The FY2017 NDAA conference report is expected to be addressed during the lame duck session in November. Proposed changes in security cooperation provisions may differ from previous House and Senate versions. Nearly 60 existing provisions in Title 10 may be affected, including modifications to DOD's authority and scope of activities. The FY2017 NDAA conference report is expected to be addressed during the lame duck session in November. Proposed changes include broadening DOD's authority, creating a Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund, and enhancing security cooperation management. S. 2943 proposes replacing existing authority with a new, broader permanent authority for training and equipping foreign security forces. S. 2943 proposes expanding DOD's authority for training and equipping foreign security forces, including operations such as counter-WMDs, counter-illicit drug trafficking, and humanitarian assistance. This new authority would be codified at 10 U.S.C. 333 within a proposed security cooperation chapter. The proposed new Section 333 under S. 2943 expands DOD's authority to provide lethal equipment globally, train and equip foreign forces for humanitarian and disaster assistance, support foreign national territorial defense, and sustain previously provided equipment to foreign partners. It also mandates human rights training and defense institution building for all foreign capacity building programs. Under 10 U.S.C. 2282, DOD programs must be \"jointly formulated\" with the State Department, requiring the Secretary of State's approval before implementation. S. 2943 retains the Secretary of State concurrence but removes the joint formulation requirement. It is unclear if this change will affect the State Department's input in planning. The SASC report on S. 2943 explains the new Section 333 authority for DOD to provide lethal equipment, train foreign forces, support territorial defense, and mandate human rights training for foreign programs. The consolidation of assistance programs aims to enhance DOD's ability to train and equip foreign partners while maintaining State Department oversight. The Senate provisions seek to balance DOD's authority with State Department involvement in security cooperation programs. S. 2943 would increase DOD's flexibility by removing limitations in current legislation. S. 2943 aims to enhance DOD's ability to train and equip foreign partners by removing limitations in current legislation and establishing the SCEF. It also proposes quarterly reports to Congress on Section 333's use and authorizes over $2.1 billion in FY2017 for foreign capacity building efforts. Additionally, DOD's proposals include transferring existing authority to a new chapter on security cooperation in Title 10 of the U.S. Code. H.R. 4909 and S. 2943 propose changes to DOD's security cooperation programs, including expanding the purposes for which security cooperation is authorized. S. 2943 would modify the purpose of DOD's Regional Centers for Security Studies and broaden the purpose of the Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program. The \"Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program\" (10 U.S.C. 2249c) is being expanded to include operational support for military or stability operations benefiting U.S. national interests, even if the U.S. is not participating. Additionally, small-scale construction projects up to $750,000 per project may be authorized. The geographical scope of security cooperation is being broadened to include paying for personnel expenses for theater security cooperation. DOD's proposals and S. 2943 aim to expand security cooperation by authorizing support to \"friendly foreign countries\" and allowing exchanges with non-military foreign personnel. They also seek to redefine \"other security forces\" for training purposes and change funding limits. The proposed changes in S. 2943 would impact funding caps, conditions on fund availability, and congressional notification requirements for security cooperation. It also introduces the Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund (SCEF) to alter the administration of security cooperation funding. Additionally, there are proposals that could affect the Secretary of State's decision-making role in DOD's use of certain security cooperation authorities. The proposed changes in S. 2943 would impact funding caps, conditions on fund availability, and congressional notification requirements for security cooperation. It also introduces the Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund (SCEF) to alter the administration of security cooperation funding. DOD's proposals and S. 2943 would authorize the Secretary of Defense to include non-defense foreign personnel in certain security cooperation authorities, with differing views on the role of the Secretary of State in these decisions. S. 2943 also aims to consolidate and modify existing authorities to allow U.S. special operations forces and general purpose forces to train and conduct military exercises with foreign forces. S. 2943 proposes changes to security cooperation authorities, including removing specific references to a State Department role and adding a provision for Secretary of State concurrence. This has sparked debates over the DOD-State Department relationship and their roles in security cooperation programs. The Obama Administration supports strengthening the State Department's role in these matters. The Obama Administration and some Members of Congress support strengthening the State Department's role in security cooperation programs. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Senator Bob Corker and Ranking Member Ben Cardin sought to amend a bill to reinsert Secretary of State concurrence requirements. S. 3117 on FY2017 appropriations for the Department of State reiterates the Secretary of State's responsibility for military assistance programs. The committee report expresses concerns over the lack of State Department oversight of Department of Defense programs. The failure to integrate foreign and military policies has led to competing assistance programs, particularly at the Department of Defense. S. 2943 raises concerns about the balance of powers between departments in determining U.S. military engagement with foreign countries. The growing presence of the Department of Defense in regions like sub-Saharan Africa is shifting power away from traditional foreign policy committees towards defense committees. S. 2943 proposes establishing a Special Defense Cooperation Fund (SCEF) as the primary funding mechanism for DOD security cooperation programs. The Special Defense Cooperation Fund (SCEF) would hold funds until expended, with up to 4% authorized for administration of DOD security cooperation programs. Funds would come from existing sources and transfers from other DOD accounts. The Secretary of Defense could accept contributions to the SCEF from outside entities, with quarterly reports to Congress required. The Special Defense Cooperation Fund (SCEF) would hold funds until expended, with up to 4% authorized for administration of DOD security cooperation programs. Funds would come from existing sources and transfers from other DOD accounts. The Secretary of Defense could accept contributions to the SCEF from outside entities and provide quarterly reports to congressional defense committees regarding SCEF obligations and expenditures. All unobligated balances from specified funds would be transferred into the SCEF, and all security cooperation programs authorized in the new security cooperation chapter in Title 10 of the U.S. Code would be executed through the SCEF. The committee proposes consolidating funding for the Department's security cooperation programs to increase transparency, flexibility, and oversight. They believe a central fund will allow strategic allocation of resources, addressing the lack of coordination in the Department's activities in this area. The committee proposes consolidating funding for the Department's security cooperation programs to increase transparency, flexibility, and oversight. They expect the Department to prioritize engagements using a central fund and implement new measures to improve the execution and administration of security cooperation programs. This includes assigning responsibility for oversight to specific officials within the Department. The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for the administration of security cooperation programs involving training, equipping, and defense services. This includes issuing joint regulations with the State Department, submitting a consolidated annual budget to Congress, developing a workforce for security cooperation, and maintaining assessment and monitoring programs. Funding is consolidated in a Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund for these activities. Some practitioners and observers have concerns about modernizing and streamlining DOD's security cooperation enterprise. Some question the feasibility of implementing Senate's provisions for modernizing DOD's security cooperation enterprise within required timeframes and resource constraints. Longer timeframes may be needed for developing regulations, administering changes, and establishing a central funding mechanism for building foreign security forces capacity. The proposed security cooperation provisions in the FY2017 NDAA, including workforce development and budget transparency measures, have broad appeal. A debate over DOD's role in security cooperation has emerged, with some advocating for enhancing DOD's toolkit while others caution against militarization of U.S. foreign policy. The Obama Administration welcomed some of these provisions. In response to S. 2943, the Obama Administration approved some Senate proposals but cautioned against potential harm to security cooperation and force readiness efforts. They emphasized the importance of maintaining State Department oversight mechanisms in collaboration with the Department of Defense. Concerns have been raised about the impact on U.S. diplomacy and foreign policy. The U.S. military's involvement in security development and stabilization activities is concerning to Representative Adam Smith. Representative Ed Royce is advocating for the House's approach in international security programs over proposals in S. 2943. Member concerns were expressed in a closed SFRC hearing about DOD security cooperation programs potentially hindering foreign policy goals. Senators raised concerns about the lack of State Department oversight in security cooperation and assistance programs. They opposed provisions in S. 2943 that did not strengthen coordination with the State Department. Senators Corker and Cardin submitted an amendment to modify the bill, but it was ultimately tabled with no further action taken. The amendment to S. 2943 was tabled without further action, signaling foreign policy concerns in the legislation. Proponents argue for changes in security cooperation proposals to enhance DOD-led authorities for better strategic and military objectives. DOD emphasizes the importance of defense security cooperation in military strategy for mitigating security risks, deterring adversaries, and enabling successful military operations. The SASC aims to improve DOD and State Department integration on security cooperation efforts through provisions in S. 2943. The bill also seeks to professionalize the security cooperation workforce and provide tools for DOD to manage its programs effectively. The FY2017 NDAA is expected to address critiques of DOD's current security cooperation programs. The conference report is pending release, with changes to DOD's security cooperation authorities likely to be implemented during the lame duck session. The House and Senate versions of the FY2017 DOD appropriations do not include funding for the Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund (SCEF) or additional changes to DOD's security cooperation authorities. The Senate version does provide for $850 million in Defense-wide funds for support and assistance to foreign security forces for counterterrorism and security enhancement activities. Security cooperation policy questions are expected to persist beyond the FY2017 NDAA, with a focus on reviewing U.S. security sector assistance and exploring interagency collaboration. Key questions include whether the current statutory framework meets today's strategic needs, how security cooperation contributes to national security objectives, and what legislative proposals may be anticipated in future NDAAs. Security cooperation's contribution to U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives, implications of unsuccessful programs, measuring effectiveness, and balancing military and diplomatic objectives are key questions. Differences between security assistance under Title 22 (State Department) and Title 10 (DOD) authorities, potential duplicative authorities, and challenges faced by the State Department are also important considerations. The State Department faces challenges in overseeing military assistance programs and security sector assistance. Changes in DOD's security cooperation authorities could impact interagency relations and global perceptions. The appropriate role for DOD in training foreign security forces and potential risks associated with such engagements are key considerations. Proposals in the FY2017 NDAA may alter the scope of DOD's security cooperation mission and funding distribution among combatant commands. The Senate-passed FY2017 NDAA may change DOD's security cooperation mission and funding distribution among combatant commands. Questions arise about the feasibility of implementing these provisions within required timeframes, potential delays, and implications for congressional oversight. Congress may need to consider placing limits on DOD's assistance to foreign security forces to support oversight. The next Administration's management of security sector assistance could also be influenced by future appropriations decisions and funding constraints. The Administration's management of security sector assistance could be impacted by future policy decisions. Debate on this issue may lead to new proposals for FY2018 and beyond."
