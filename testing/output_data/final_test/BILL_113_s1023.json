    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013\". Congress acknowledges the urgent need to boost economic growth, create jobs, and maintain a strong national security through global engagement. The US is facing competition from other countries in attracting foreign direct investment, which is crucial for domestic prosperity and security. Foreign direct investment from global companies benefits the economy and workforce of every State and Commonwealth in the United States. US subsidiaries of foreign companies provide jobs for nearly 5.6 million people, often in high-skilled, high-paying industries, and employ nearly 15% of the US manufacturing sector workforce. Foreign direct investment from global companies benefits the economy and workforce of every State and Commonwealth in the United States. US subsidiaries of foreign companies establish operations in the US to sell goods and services globally, contributing to 18% of US exports. They also promote innovation through $41 billion in annual research and development activities, pay 14% of US corporate income taxes, and purchase goods and services from local suppliers and small businesses. These companies account for 5.8% of US private sector GDP. The Department of Commerce and the Department of State are involved in overseeing these activities. President Barack Obama issued a statement in 2011 reaffirming the open investment policy of the United States and established the SelectUSA initiative to promote business investment in the country. The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness recommended a National Investment Initiative to attract $1 trillion in foreign direct investment over five years. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of attracting foreign direct investment for long-term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and security. It highlights the need to remove barriers to foreign investment and promote policies that enhance the competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States. The United States aims to maintain its position as a top global destination for investment, innovation, and manufacturing. Open investment policies benefit the economy and help open new markets for US companies. Policies on foreign direct investment should prioritize national security without disadvantaging domestic investors. SEC. 4. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT REVIEW. The Secretary of Commerce, with other federal agencies, will review the global competitiveness of the US in attracting foreign direct investment. This includes assessing the economic impact, trends in investment flows, and government policies affecting the ability to attract and retain foreign investment. The United States aims to attract and retain foreign direct investment through federal and local government efforts, as well as initiatives by other countries to increase global competitiveness. The review will not address laws and policies related to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct a review and report to Congress on findings and recommendations to enhance the United States' competitiveness in attracting foreign direct investment, while maintaining domestic labor, consumer, and environmental protections. The review will be published in the Federal Register for public comment."
