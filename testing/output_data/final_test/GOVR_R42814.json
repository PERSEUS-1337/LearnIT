Some producers want to export natural gas in liquefied form to sell at higher world prices, while consumer groups fear it will raise domestic prices. Low prices could potentially boost U.S. manufacturing, especially in petrochemicals and other industries. The U.S. energy landscape has seen significant changes due to the rapid expansion of natural gas resources, particularly from shale gas. There is a debate among environmentalists about the environmental impact of natural gas compared to coal. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to address both the supply and demand of natural gas, including bills targeting LNG exports and transportation. The report examines changes in the natural gas industry, focusing on demand and economic benefits in the U.S. without addressing negative consequences. U.S. natural gas reserves have significantly increased, mainly due to shale gas development. The development of shale gas in the U.S. has significantly increased natural gas reserves, with shale gas making up 32% of reserves in 2010. Conventional reserves declined, highlighting the importance of shale gas. Industry analysts expect shale gas reserves to continue rising unless new restrictions are imposed. In 2011, the U.S. produced and consumed record amounts of natural gas at low market prices. The United States is the world's leading producer and consumer of natural gas, with shale gas accounting for 25% of production by 2010. Reserves and production data do not fully capture the U.S. transformation in the natural gas sector. It is more appropriate to consider reserves and estimates for undiscovered, technically recoverable resources (UTRR) to understand the changes. UTRR is an estimate of what can be extracted using current technology regardless of price. The United States has a natural gas resource base of 1,809 tcf, enough for approximately 79 years of production at 2011 levels. U.S. UTRR for natural gas has increased by almost 25% since 2006, with technology advancements allowing for a tripling of recoverable gas. In 2011, natural gas surpassed coal as the most produced fuel in the United States, driven by the success of shale gas development. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projected in 2012 that overall U.S. natural gas production will continue to rise. The United States is projected to significantly increase natural gas production by 28% between 2010 and 2035, with shale gas making up almost half of the production. The country is expected to transition from a net importer to a net exporter of natural gas by 2022, with shale gas being the main driver of production growth. Conventional natural gas is forecasted to decline in both percentage and absolute terms over the same period. The decline of conventional natural gas sources from 41.5% in 2010 to 22.7% in 2035 shows that natural gas is a finite resource. The rapid increase in natural gas supply has led to downward pressure on prices, with U.S. spot natural gas prices being relatively low compared to domestic and international prices. Historically, natural gas prices in the United States have been volatile, with significant price spikes in the past. In 2005, natural gas prices spiked, but started to decline in 2008 due to the recession. Despite lower recent prices and optimistic expectations for domestic supply, some industry participants remain cautious about making financial commitments. The price of natural gas is driven by supply and demand, affected by various factors like the economy, weather, and seasonality. Demand peaks in winter for heating and in summer for electricity generation. Storage is crucial for balancing the demand cycle in the United States. In Spring 2011, underground storage facilities were filled, but warmer winter months led to high storage levels and lower natural gas prices. In Spring 2012, high storage levels continued to pressure prices down to $2.00/MBtu. Producers only halt production if prices fall below operating costs for an extended period due to costs and technical issues. The rise of shale gas has contributed to the decline in U.S. natural gas prices. The decline in U.S. natural gas prices due to the rise of shale gas has attracted global attention, with countries trying to replicate U.S. success in developing unconventional gas resources. Despite other countries touting their resources, only the U.S. and Australia have achieved significant development. Canada is also progressing with shale gas but lags behind. Natural gas prices worldwide dropped from 2008 to 2009 due to decreased demand, with U.S. shale gas impacting prices from 2010 onwards. The rise of shale gas in the U.S. has significantly impacted natural gas prices globally. While the rest of the world saw higher prices in 2011, the U.S. experienced a 9% decline. This trend has continued, with analysts predicting low U.S. natural gas prices for the foreseeable future. The growing price differential between the U.S. and other major markets highlights the insulation of the U.S. natural gas market from external events. The decline in natural gas prices in the United States has led to changes in the industry, with companies focusing more on oil-rich areas like tight-oil formations. This shift has increased U.S. oil production but has also resulted in a lack of infrastructure for natural gas, leading to flaring in some areas. Despite this, natural gas is displacing coal in electric generation, reducing emissions. Companies are also looking to export natural gas as LNG to further expand their markets. The decline in natural gas prices in the United States has led to a shift towards producing more wet gas to increase value. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) have gained importance with shale gas production, including ethane, propane, butane, and pentanes. NGLs are separated from natural gas at processing plants, with \"hot\" or \"wet\" gas containing NGLs and methane, while \"dry\" gas is methane only. Companies are focusing on producing more wet gas to offset the drop in dry gas prices and increase value. Some companies have shifted production to tight oil formations like the Bakken to capitalize on shale gas experience. NGL products historically priced against oil, driving wet gas production despite low dry gas prices. Drilling rigs moved to wet gas and oil fields for higher value extraction. The price differential between oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) is varying due to the changing composition of NGLs in gas fields. Ethane and propane prices are no longer closely tied to oil prices, driven by their own market fundamentals. As natural gas production increased, so did the amount of gas being flared or vented. This issue has become more prominent with the development of tight oil resources. The development of tight oil resources, aided by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, has led to an increase in oil production. The Bakken formation is notable for its rising oil production and significant flaring of natural gas. However, the infrastructure for transporting associated gas has not kept pace with oil production growth. The location of shale formations has altered the movement of natural gas supplies in the United States, impacting traditional gas flow patterns. The discovery and production from the Marcellus Shale formation has changed the need for gas from the Gulf Coast as it is closer to Northeast markets, requiring new infrastructure like gathering and transmission pipelines. Reconfiguration of supply centers and consuming markets is ongoing, with the industry potentially spending billions to achieve greater efficiencies. The energy industry may need to spend billions to improve efficiencies, especially in water usage for shale gas development. Data gaps make it challenging to assess water needs accurately. Fracture treatments can use over 500,000 gallons of water for a single zone, with wells needing 3-5 million gallons or more. The shift towards natural gas is increasing, with it comprising 28% of the U.S. primary energy mix in 2011. Natural gas consumption in the United States is increasing, driven by its diverse usage in electricity generation, industrial, and residential/commercial sectors. Unlike oil and coal, natural gas has a more balanced distribution across these sectors. Natural gas consumption in the United States is driven by diverse usage in electricity generation, industrial, and residential/commercial sectors. All sectors increased in 2011 except residential consumption due to warmer weather. Opening new regional markets for residential and commercial use will require investment and infrastructure. Electric power generation is the largest component of U.S. natural gas consumption, followed by industrial use. In the early part of the decade, industrial consumption in the United States declined due to rising prices, leading to a shift overseas. However, with decreasing natural gas prices and increased supply, natural gas-fired generation saw a resurgence. Some industrial sectors are considering returning to the U.S. due to projected low natural gas prices. In April 2012, electricity generation from natural gas equaled that of coal for the first time in history, each accounting for about 32% of the market. Natural gas use in electric generation has been growing over the previous decade and is expected to continue, especially if prices remain low. The shift to more natural gas-fired electric power generation in 2012 led to a decrease in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by almost 8%. This was attributed to reduced household heating and gasoline demand, along with the retirement of coal-fired electricity generation. The relative price variability of natural gas compared to coal is highlighted, with a significant decrease in the spread between their prices. Low long-term prices are needed for a shift to natural gas in the U.S. economy, but increased demand may lead to higher prices, potentially affecting the economic advantages of using natural gas. If prices remain low, industry may struggle to sustain production, leading to a slowdown in exploration and development activities. Market forces are expected to find a balance between demand and supply. Market forces are expected to establish a balance between demand and supply in the market. If natural gas were to replace oil and coal, it would require a significant increase in consumption and production. This would necessitate a massive investment in new technologies and infrastructure, particularly in the transportation sector for natural gas vehicles. The transportation sector alone would need almost 24 tcf of natural gas, which is close to the total U.S. consumption in 2011. Less than 1% of U.S. natural gas was used in transportation in 2011. The transportation sector consumed a significant amount of gas in 2011, raising questions about US natural gas production and its potential impact on the economy. Increased supply and low prices could lead to growth in output, employment, investment, income, competitiveness, and a reduction in the trade deficit. Certain industries using natural gas directly or indirectly would benefit from these market conditions. The economic benefits of natural gas production extend to industries like petrochemicals, fertilizers, and steel. Other sectors, such as construction and capital goods producers, also benefit indirectly. Increased spending by workers in these industries can boost consumer goods and retail firms. Shale gas development opens up new areas for production, like the Marcellus field in several states. The U.S. industries in Virginia, Maryland, and New York are likely to gain a competitive advantage from low natural gas prices, leading to increased exports and decreased imports. This could improve the U.S. trade deficit position, but the advantage may diminish if natural gas prices align with global markets. Changing traditional contract terms to market-oriented methods could impact the industry's advantage. Low natural gas prices benefit consuming industries but depress the natural gas industry itself. Production continues to increase due to efficiency gains and contract provisions, despite potential reductions in exploration. Extracting natural gas liquids from wells can support production even in a low-price environment, especially if oil prices remain high. Actions that reduce supplies tend to raise gas prices. The U.S. petrochemicals industry benefits from the price advantage of using natural gas liquids for ethylene production compared to European producers using naphtha. Natural gas is expected to increase its share in electricity generation due to supply increases, low prices, lower carbon emissions, and lower capital investment costs compared to coal-fired plants. Natural gas-fired plants offer cost advantages and flexibility compared to coal-fired plants, leading to an expected increase in their share of new generating capacity in the United States. Job creation from this shift is projected to be minimal, with construction and capital equipment jobs being temporary. The shift towards natural gas in electric power generation may lead to job losses in coal-fired plants and mining, but coal will still have a significant market share. Some facilities have scrubbing equipment to reduce emissions and are located near coal mines for low transportation costs. However, constructing new natural gas pipelines may be necessary for the switch. If natural gas prices rise, coal-fired generation could become more competitive again. The macroeconomic effects of natural gas expansion are expected to be significant, despite minimal direct job creation. The shift towards natural gas in electric power generation is expected to have significant macroeconomic effects, with potential cost savings passed on to consumers leading to increased household disposable income. Commercial natural gas consumers and the petrochemicals industry could also benefit from lower electricity costs. Industrial demand may see benefits as well, although to a lesser extent. The chemicals industry heavily relies on natural gas for fuel and raw materials, such as ethane for producing ethylene used in plastics. In 2012, several chemical companies announced significant investments in new plant capacity near shale gas supplies, like Dow Chemical's $4 billion expansion in Texas and Shell Chemical's plans for a $2-4 billion ethane cracking unit in Pennsylvania. Chevron also announced a $1 billion investment. Several chemical companies, including Chevron, Phillips Chemical, and Westlake Chemical, have announced multi-billion dollar investment plans related to low-cost shale gas availability. These investments are expected to result in new production capacity over the next five years, indicating a belief in sustained low natural gas prices and growing supply in the United States. The American Chemistry Council conducted a study on natural gas prices in the market. The American Chemistry Council conducted a study on the effects of a $16.2 billion investment in petrochemical plant and equipment related to low-cost natural gas availability. The study projected the creation of 17,000 new high-paying jobs in the chemical industry and 395,000 jobs outside the industry, with tax revenues of $4.4 billion annually. The investment could increase the output of the U.S. chemicals industry by $32.8 billion and generate a total output of $132.4 billion for the economy. The global ethylene production balance has shifted from 80:20 in favor of naphtha to 50:50, impacting the naphtha market negatively. U.S. refiners are facing an excess of naphtha, leading to a supply glut and falling prices in the European market. European refiners are also suffering due to the euro crisis and recession, facing new competition from the United States. European refiners, already impacted by the euro crisis and recession, are facing further losses due to new competition from the United States. The high price of naphtha compared to gasoline exacerbates the economic damage. Natural gas, crucial for nitrogen-based fertilizer production, accounts for 70-90% of production costs. Rising natural gas prices led to the closure of ammonia plants, affecting fertilizer production. Reinstating U.S. capacity would require time and investment. Reviving U.S. fertilizer production could lower food and ethanol costs, benefitting farmers and the fertilizer industry. In the short-run, the fertilizer industry is cautious about investing in capacity expansion due to uncertain natural gas prices. High and volatile gas prices in the U.S. market have led to a wait-and-see approach. Despite cost savings from low gas prices, producers are benefiting more than consumers. The demand for corn is keeping fertilizer demand high, with planted corn acreage increasing from 79 million in 2000 to 92 million in 2011. The expansion of shale gas and tight oil exploration has boosted the U.S. steel industry. Demand for tubular goods used in gas drilling equipment has increased, while costs have decreased. Steel facilities near shale gas development areas, like in Ohio, are growing with investments in production space. Companies like Timken, United States Steel, and Vallourec & Mannesmann are expanding their operations. The steel industry in Ohio, including Timken, United States Steel, Vallourec & Mannesmann, and a joint venture project, is expected to create 630 jobs due to shale gas expansion. These companies plan to increase exports of energy industry related steel components. The demand for steel is tied to drilling and infrastructure development, with a focus on balancing short-run demands with long-run capacity expansion to avoid excess capacity in the future. The steel industry in Ohio is expected to create jobs due to shale gas expansion, with a focus on increasing exports of energy industry related steel components. While gas-driven increases in demand are important, the large supplies of low-cost natural gas have less direct impact on the industry. Cost reductions in steel production from cheap natural gas are likely to be small, as the primary cost category is scrap steel, unaffected by gas prices. Concerns about U.S. energy security revolve around reducing oil imports, with a target of a one-third reduction by the end of the decade. Natural gas consumption in transportation is low, with less than 1% of U.S. natural gas consumption used by vehicles. The commercial truck industry is considering incorporating more natural gas due to its low price. However, even in the most aggressive scenario, natural gas will only make up less than 9% of the highway vehicle fuel mix by 2035. Various forms of natural gas can be used as transportation fuel, with LNG and CNG being the primary options for long-distance trucking. The transportation sector is making inroads in using natural gas as a fuel, with fleet trucks like Waste Management and UPS taking advantage of low prices. New vehicles and infrastructure will need to be developed, with options for trucks to run on either LNG or diesel. The market for natural gas as a fuel for trucking is large. The market for natural gas as a fuel for trucking is significant, with approximately 3.2 million big-rig trucks using about 25 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually. The price spread between diesel fuel and natural gas is a key factor in the adoption of natural gas as a transportation fuel. The cost of diesel fuel is largely dependent on the cost of crude oil, historically costing about six times more than natural gas. This price spread has resulted in diesel fuel being twice as expensive as compressed natural gas (CNG) on a diesel-gallon-equivalent basis. The competitive advantage of natural gas can be affected by fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas. The market for natural gas as a fuel for trucking is significant, with approximately 3.2 million big-rig trucks using about 25 billion gallons of diesel fuel annually. A switch to natural gas-powered trucks could lead to expansion in various industries. Shell plans to add LNG pumps at 100 locations for truck refueling to enable LNG trucks to travel across the country. Currently, city buses and local delivery trucks are primary users of natural gas in transportation. Residential use of natural gas is not projected to increase significantly. Natural gas demand may decline by 2035, requiring new infrastructure for consumers and industry. New York City plans to phase out certain heating oils by 2030 in favor of cleaner-burning fuels like natural gas, but additional infrastructure and approvals are needed. New York State and New England consume significant amounts of distillate for heating. Connecticut is developing a plan to increase natural gas consumption, aiming to utilize low prices and proximity to the Marcellus Shale formation. Increased sales of natural gas appliances could change perceptions and integrate natural gas into the economy, with potential for appliances like air conditioners to run on natural gas. Energy Star ratings on appliances may need to be reevaluated for natural gas use. Exports of natural gas have been increasing, while imports have been decreasing. The United States was expected to be a growing importer of natural gas, but with the rise in exports, particularly as LNG, there is now a new demand center for U.S. supplies. LNG import capacity in the United States is currently almost 14 billion cubic feet per day. The United States currently has LNG import capacity of almost 14 billion cubic feet per day, but higher domestic production has made imports less necessary. Import terminals are operating below capacity, and the country is expected to become a net LNG exporter by 2016. Industry interest is shifting towards constructing LNG export terminals, with 18 companies applying for permits to build facilities with a capacity of 27.4 bcf/d. Increased pipeline exports to Canada and Mexico may also rise. The potential rise in LNG exports to Canada and Mexico due to declining domestic production and increasing demand is uncertain. The impact on domestic prices is a key point of debate, with potential upward pressure. The oil industry has benefited indirectly from shale gas development and low natural gas prices, using similar techniques to increase U.S. oil production. Other sectors like petroleum refining may also benefit from natural gas as a fuel and feedstock. The petroleum refining sector stands to gain from using natural gas as a fuel and feedstock. The airline industry has tested synthetic aviation fuels derived from natural gas, with Qatar Airways conducting the first commercial flight in 2009. The shipping industry is exploring the use of natural gas as a bunker fuel. The paper and aluminum industries, which heavily rely on natural gas, may benefit from expansions and greenfield projects. Market forces and regulatory changes could increase the role of natural gas in the U.S. economy. Congress has shown interest in various aspects of this debate through legislation, hearings, and interactions with government agencies. Many producers and consumers of natural gas are confident in abundant supplies despite risks. Companies are investing in the natural gas market, while others are waiting to see how the debate unfolds. Domestic prices will react to market conditions, with rising demand putting pressure on prices. Market and regulatory factors could impact the economic benefits of expanded natural gas supplies in the United States. The prospect of increasing U.S. LNG exports is also being considered. The Department of Energy (DOE) must issue permits for U.S. LNG exports to non-FTA countries, pending completion of a study on the impact on domestic prices. Approval for export permits is on hold until the study is finished, with FTA countries like South Korea being the main importers of LNG from the U.S. Increasing energy exports could benefit U.S. trade overall. Increasing U.S. LNG exports could improve the U.S. trade balance and expand its role in international natural gas markets. The United States, already the largest producer and consumer of natural gas, could potentially become the world's largest LNG exporter. Proposed construction of LNG export terminals on the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast could further solidify the U.S. position in the global natural gas trade. The United States could become a major player in the global natural gas trade, benefiting its balance of trade. Unlike other countries, the U.S. natural gas sector is driven by the private sector and market forces. This shift could enhance national security priorities by diversifying European gas supply and countering the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. Other effects include market reforms, technology transfers, and environmental benefits. Major U.S. companies are increasingly investing in shale gas assets, making them more gas-oriented. Many U.S. companies are investing in shale gas assets to become more natural gas oriented. Foreign companies are also buying into U.S. shale gas areas to gain experience and bring the technology back to their countries. A decision on energy security will determine whether to rely on domestic supplies or participate in the global market. An expansion of LNG exports will increase domestic demand, potentially leading to price rises and diminishing the economic advantage of U.S. LNG. The use of natural gas as a cleaner burning fuel has led to environmental concerns and controversies, despite its benefits over coal and oil. If LNG exports are restricted, foreign trade benefits may not materialize, leading to higher costs for consumers. The increase in shale gas development has positioned natural gas as a bridge fuel to a low carbon economy. The environmental concerns surrounding hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs have led to various issues such as water quality, land use changes, induced seismicity, infrastructure requirements, and air pollutant emissions. This has sparked grassroots movements, political opposition, and calls for regulatory actions at different levels of government. Oil and gas producing states are revising their rules in response to technological advancements in the industry. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented new regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for air emissions standards in hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas production activities. Additionally, the EPA has issued draft guidance under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for permitting hydraulic fracturing with diesel fuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 revised the SDWA definition of underground injection to exclude fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations. EPA is developing regulations under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharge from natural gas extraction. BLM proposed revisions to oil and gas regulations in May 2012. EPA plans to propose regulations for coalbed methane effluents in 2013 and shale gas extraction in 2014. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposed revisions to oil and gas development rules in response to increased hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The proposal includes public disclosure of chemicals used, tighter well-bore integrity requirements, and managing water used in operations. Tighter regulations may slow supply growth and lead to price spikes, impacting market confidence. Tighter regulations on oil and gas development may lead to price spikes and impact market confidence, especially in the industrial sector. Some companies have invested heavily in anticipation of low prices, but regulations vary by state. The EPA projects that capturing natural gas could benefit producers. The evolving position of the United States with respect to natural gas supply can positively affect U.S. industry due to the low current price and the expectation of continued low prices in the future. Historical price data does not easily align with the expectation of low and stable natural gas prices. Previous assumptions of high and increasing prices were based on a trend of high consumption and a declining resource base. Earlier beliefs that natural gas had little value have been proven wrong, showing that future paths for natural gas markets can quickly change. The uncertainty surrounding the size and cost of U.S. shale gas resources can significantly impact future natural gas prices. Shale gas wells vary in production rates and ultimate recovery, leading to price volatility. Despite this uncertainty, natural gas demand has remained relatively stable across different sectors. The demand for natural gas is relatively price inelastic, except in the industrial sector where there is significant price elasticity. Small variations in quantity can have large effects on price due to inelastic demand. Price is crucial for the supply expansion of natural gas, as low prices can lead to stagnation in exploration and development. The price of natural gas is crucial for supply expansion, as low prices can lead to stagnation in exploration and development. If prices rise, demand may be discouraged, so the market must incentivize consumers to use more natural gas and producers to produce more. Factors like the price of oil and coal also play a role in determining the state of the market. Consumers may continue using oil-based products due to habit and established infrastructure. The uncertainty in natural gas demand growth may deter investment in new supply infrastructure. Coal may regain market share if natural gas prices increase. Plans for increased natural gas consumption exist, but demand expansion varies among segments and typically occurs after a lag. Demand for natural gas typically experiences a lag before expansion, with new construction and transportation being key drivers of incremental and long-term growth. Once investments are made in infrastructure, it is unlikely to be reversed, leading to permanent increases in demand. Demand for natural gas is expected to grow incrementally and permanently, driven by vehicle conversions, dedicated power plants, and a well-established supply infrastructure. While household and commercial demand may show steady growth, rapid expansion is possible in electric power generation and industrial sectors. Industrial demand is sensitive to price changes and has contracted during periods of high prices. The export of LNG could also contribute to increased demand. Increases in demand from power generators and industrial users could lead to a demand level surpassing supply growth, causing price volatility and potential market destabilization. Legislative or regulatory policies, such as carbon emission limits for power generators, could further impact the natural gas market. Price increases due to demand growth would stimulate resource development and supply expansion, potentially leading to falling prices if offshore drilling opportunities are expanded. The price of natural gas may fall as domestic supplies increase, benefiting consumers in the short-term but potentially hindering on-shore shale resource development in the long-term. Unintended consequences of policy decisions could impact natural gas markets, affecting the calculation of net economic benefits from expanded shale gas resources. Overall, changes in the natural gas industry are seen as positive for the U.S. economy, with falling prices benefiting industries using natural gas as an input and prompting producers to innovate and drive down production costs. Environmental concerns are also pushing companies to be more proactive. In response to environmental concerns, major natural gas and oil producing states have revised rules without hindering production. Investment decisions are being made based on market realities and future perceptions. Efforts to address environmental concerns are expected from industry, governments, and the market. Production efficiencies and extraction improvements, especially in water use, are likely in the next five years. Congressional actions may impact natural gas supply by opening federal lands and offshore areas for exploration. Legislation and regulations are being introduced to impact natural gas production and demand. This includes opening up federal lands for exploration, providing incentives for production, limiting regulations, and promoting infrastructure. Some legislation may inhibit production or delay LNG exports. Efforts are also being made to address environmental effects of natural gas production. Regulations are being proposed at federal agencies like the Departments of Energy and Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency, potentially requiring congressional input."
