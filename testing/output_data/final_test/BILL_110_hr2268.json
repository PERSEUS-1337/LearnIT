The Congress finds that Anna Jarvis, founder of modern Mother's Day, was born in Webster, West Virginia on May 1, 1864. She dedicated her life to honoring her mother, Anna Reeves Jarvis, leading to the official proclamation of Mother's Day in 1908. Governor William Glasscock issued the first Mother's Day Proclamation in 1910, and in 1914, the Sixty-Third Congress designated the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day. Res. 263 designates the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and encourages displaying the American flag as a public expression of love for mothers. President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation in 1914 for government officials and the public to display the flag on this day. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
