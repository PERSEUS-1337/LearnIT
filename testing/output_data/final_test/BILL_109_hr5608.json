    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keeping Seniors Safe From Falls Act of 2006\". Congress finds that falls among older adults are a significant issue, leading to a high number of injuries and deaths. In 2003, falls accounted for a large number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, with unintentional falls being the primary cause of nonfatal injuries for individuals aged 65 and older. Falls also result in a high percentage of fractures among older adults, with a significant portion suffering moderate to severe injuries such as hip fractures or head injuries. Hospital admissions for hip fractures among the elderly have increased significantly over the years, with projections showing a continued rise due to the aging population. These fractures can lead to reduced mobility, independence, and serious health issues, with a high percentage of older adults requiring institutionalization or being unable to return home after their injury. The cost of fall injuries for adults age 65 and older is significant, with projections showing a rise to $43.8 billion annually by 2020. A national approach to reducing falls among seniors is necessary to improve their daily life in various settings. Amendments to the Public Health Service Act include the addition of a new section, 393D, focusing on the prevention of falls among older adults. The new section 393D of the Public Health Service Act aims to develop public education strategies, intensify services, support demonstration projects, and evaluate the impact of falls on healthcare costs among older adults. The new section 393D of the Public Health Service Act focuses on reducing falls among older adults through national and state-level education campaigns and grants to qualified organizations. The new section 393D of the Public Health Service Act aims to reduce falls among older adults by supporting national and state-level education campaigns and providing grants to qualified organizations for educating healthcare professionals on falls risk assessment and prevention. The Secretary will award grants to organizations for research on improving identification of older adults at high risk of falling, data collection for fall risk factors, effective fall prevention interventions, medication management interventions, and proven strategies. The Secretary will award grants for research to improve fall prevention strategies tailored to specific older adult populations, maximize dissemination of effective interventions, intensify proven interventions, enhance diagnosis and treatment of elderly fall victims, and assess fall risk in different settings. Conducting research on barriers to adoption is also included. Research will be conducted to identify barriers to adopting proven fall prevention interventions for older adults, develop effective approaches for high-risk older adults in long-term care facilities, evaluate community programs for preventing falls in assisted living and nursing homes, study home modifications for reducing falls, and establish a web repository for falls research and activities. The Secretary will oversee demonstration projects to reduce falls in frail older adults through collaborations between health care providers and the aging services network, targeting at-risk populations with functional limitations to enhance independence and quality of life. Demonstrations will assess the effectiveness of clinical risk factor screening and management linked to community-based programs supporting behavior change and interventions. Feasibility and effectiveness of offering evidence-based behavior change and physical activity interventions addressing falls risk in non-medical settings will be assessed. Private sector and public-private partnerships will develop technology to prevent falls. Partnerships are being formed to develop technology aimed at preventing falls among older adults and reducing injuries from falls. The Secretary will award grants to research organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of these projects. Additionally, collaborations between healthcare providers and various settings will be overseen by the Secretary. The Secretary will oversee demonstration projects to reduce falls and injuries in frail older adults, focusing on collaboration between healthcare providers and residential/institutional settings. This includes a multi-State project to implement fall prevention programs for older adults in multifamily residential settings. The Secretary will award grants for demonstration projects assessing clinical risk factor screening and management integrated with the Aging Services Network to improve independence and quality of life for individuals with functional limitations. The Secretary will award grants for programs promoting healthy behaviors, physical activity, and technology development to prevent falls among older adults. The Secretary will conduct a review on the effects of falls on health care costs and strategies to reduce them. A report will be submitted to Congress within 36 months. Authorization of Appropriations: $35,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2007 to 2010 for the purposes outlined in this section."
