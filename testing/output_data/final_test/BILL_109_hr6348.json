    "content": "The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish risk-based performance standards for security of chemical facilities within six months of this Act. Regulations will require vulnerability assessments and site security plans for facilities with high security risks. Facilities can choose layered security measures to address these standards. The Secretary cannot reject a security plan based solely on the presence or absence of a certain element. The Secretary may disapprove a site security plan if it does not meet risk-based performance standards. Alternative security programs can be approved if they meet the requirements. Vulnerability assessments and security plans must be reviewed and approved. Regulations do not apply to certain regulated facilities. Public Law 107-295, as amended, applies to Public Water Systems, Treatment Works, Department of Defense or Energy facilities, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission-regulated facilities. Interim regulations will be in effect until superseded by other laws, with a termination clause after three years. Information developed under this section is subject to specific provisions. The information developed under this section, including vulnerability assessments and site security plans, is protected from public disclosure similar to chemical facilities under section 70103 of title 46, US Code. The Secretary can share this information with State and local officials with security clearances for enforcement purposes, but it cannot be disclosed under State or local laws. The Secretary of Homeland Security treats information obtained under this section as classified material. Violators of orders issued under this section may face civil penalties. The Secretary is responsible for auditing and inspecting chemical facilities for compliance. This section does not override any existing federal laws regulating chemical substances. If a chemical facility is found to be noncompliant with security regulations, the Secretary of Homeland Security will notify the owner/operator with details of deficiencies and a deadline to comply. Failure to comply may result in an order to cease operations until compliance is achieved."
