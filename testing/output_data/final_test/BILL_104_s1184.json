    "content": "The Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act of 1995 may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act of 1995''. The Congress finds that older business sites in urban areas are less likely to comply with government regulations, leading to new development being pushed away from areas in need of economic growth. Federal regulations in urban areas often have unintended negative consequences, such as impacting economic stability, causing the loss of existing businesses, and hindering new economic development. The Congress finds that older business sites in urban areas may undermine new economic development, create economic hardships, fail to protect human health, and contribute to social deterioration, posing risks to urban residents' well-being. The purpose of the legislation is to address the negative impacts of older business sites in urban areas on economic development, human health, and social well-being. The Act aims to empower qualifying cities to improve the well-being, safety, and economic development of distressed areas by obtaining relief from certain Federal regulations. Federal agencies can waive specific regulations in designated urban relief zones upon application by an economic development commission. Federal agencies can waive regulations in urban relief zones if it does not endanger health or safety. Eligibility for waivers in urban relief zones is determined by federal agencies, ensuring that regulations do not pose a risk to health or safety. The mayor of a city with a population over 200,000 can establish an economic development commission. A distressed area in a city is defined by specific criteria related to poverty levels, employment, and families with children. In a distressed area, specific criteria include a high percentage of families with unmarried parents or receiving public assistance income. SEC. 5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS. The mayor or chief executive officer of a qualifying city may appoint an economic development commission to designate urban regulatory relief zones and apply for waivers of specific Federal regulations. The commission should include residents representing the city population and members of the business community. The economic development commission in a qualifying city includes residents representing the city population and members of the business community, private civic organizations, employers, employees, elected officials, and regulatory authorities. Only one commission is allowed per city. Before designating an area as an urban regulatory relief zone, the economic development commission must hold a public hearing to gather opinions and suggestions from those affected. Individuals can also submit requests for specific Federal regulations to be included in the commission's waiver application. The commission must make a list of designated areas publicly available before submitting any waiver applications to the Office of Management and Budget. The city must provide a list of designated urban regulatory relief zones, regulations for which waivers are requested from Federal agencies, and the rationale for how waiving regulations would benefit residents' health, safety, and economic well-being. SEC. 7. WAIVER OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS. An economic development commission within an urban regulatory relief zone can select Federal regulations for waiver if they are burdensome, discourage economic development, create hardships, or contribute to social deterioration without endangering health or safety. The commission must submit a waiver request to the Office of Management and Budget, identifying the designated zone and regulations to be waived. The economic development commission in an urban regulatory relief zone can request waivers for regulations that hinder economic growth. The Office of Management and Budget reviews the waiver request within 60 days and submits it to the relevant Federal agency for consideration. The economic development commission can request waivers for regulations hindering growth. The Office of Management and Budget reviews and submits the request to the Federal agency. The agency must make a waiver determination within 120 days. Federal agencies must provide written notice to the economic development commission when granting or denying a waiver request. Waivers can only be denied if they substantially endanger health or safety. If granted, the agency must describe the extent of the waiver and provide guidance for business concerns within the urban regulatory relief zone. If denied, the agency must explain the reasons for the denial. (f) Automatic Waiver: If a Federal agency fails to provide written notice within the 120-day period required, the waiver will be automatically granted. (g) Limitation: This Act does not authorize any Federal agency to waive regulations or Executive orders that protect against discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. (h) Applicable Procedures: A waiver under subsection (e) is not considered a rule or regulation under title 5, and the agency must publish notice in the Federal Register. If a Federal agency amends a regulation with a waiver, the waiver cannot be changed to add more requirements. Waivers do not expire unless the agency determines it endangers health or safety. SEC. 8.
