    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Electronic Freedom of Information Improvement Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act is to make agency information available for public access, leading to the disclosure of government operations, waste, fraud, and abuse. The Freedom of Information Act aims to ensure public access to agency records, improve transparency, and promote democracy by using new technology to enhance access to valuable information held by government agencies. SEC. 3. PUBLIC INFORMATION AVAILABILITY. Section 552(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to include electronic means for accessing information, a list of statutes allowing agencies to withhold information, and a description of the information covered. SEC. 4. MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT AND INDEX OF RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. Section 552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for electronic access to agency records and the creation of an index of major information systems containing agency records.

The amendment to Section 552(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code includes provisions for agencies to provide records in any form or format requested by a person, including electronic format. Agencies must make reasonable efforts to search for records in electronic form and honor format requests. The amendment allows agencies to provide records in any form or format requested by a person, including electronic format. SEC. 6. DELAYS. Amendments are made to sections 552(a)(4)(A) and 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code, regarding fees collected for document requests. One-half of the fees collected will be credited to the agency if they comply with document request requirements, while the remaining fees will be remitted to the Treasury. Additionally, provisions are added for demonstrating circumstances causing delays in document processing. Amendments to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act include extending the period for agency decision compliance with requests to twenty days and defining \"exceptional circumstances\" for delays in document processing. Amendments to the Electronic Freedom of Information Act include extending the period for agency decision compliance with requests to twenty days and defining \"exceptional circumstances\" for delays in document processing. The amendments also require notifications of denials to include names and titles of responsible individuals and the total number of denied records. Additionally, agencies must adopt a first-in, first-out (FIFO) processing system for requests. The Electronic Freedom of Information Act amendments require agencies to adopt a first-in, first-out (FIFO) processing system for requests, with separate tracks for simple and complex requests. Simple requests must be decided within 10 days, while complex requests take longer. Maintaining FIFO processing within each track is crucial for demonstrating due diligence. Each agency must establish regulations for expedited access to records based on compelling need. Requests granted expedited access must be processed promptly, while denied requests follow standard processing time limits. A person whose request for expedited access has not been decided within 10 days or has been denied must exhaust administrative remedies. Requests can be appealed to the agency head within specific timeframes. If the agency head denies, affirms denial, or fails to respond to an appeal, a court can be approached. Upon appeal of a denied expedited access request, a court with jurisdiction may require the agency to justify the denial. The burden of proving a compelling need for expedited access lies with the requester, who must show that a delay would threaten life or safety or result in substantial harm. The denied expedited access request may result in the loss of due process rights and affect public assessment of governmental actions under media scrutiny. SEC. 7 amends Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, to require indicating deletions on released records. SEC. 8 provides definitions. Section 552(f) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to define 'agency' and 'record' for the purposes of the section. The term 'agency' includes various government entities, and 'record' encompasses various types of information but excludes library and museum materials used for reference or exhibition purposes. The term 'record' is defined in Section 552(f) of title 5, United States Code, to exclude library and museum materials used for reference or exhibition purposes. Additionally, the term 'search' is defined as a review of agency records to locate responsive documents. The Senate passed S. 1090 on September 17, 1996, amending the Freedom of Information Act to provide public access to information in an electronic format."
