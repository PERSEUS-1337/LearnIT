    "content": "Congress has a longstanding interest in revitalizing distressed areas through business and employment opportunities, with significant federal expenses and foregone tax revenue allocated for community and regional development. Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities are federally designated areas with high poverty levels, offering federal grants and tax incentives to eligible businesses and local governments. This report aims to compare these programs in targeting and providing incentives to economically distressed zones. The report discusses federal programs targeting economically distressed zones, including Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities. Congress has authorized multiple rounds of these programs since 1993, each with different benefits and eligibility criteria. The report discusses federal programs for economically distressed zones, including Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Renewal Communities (RCs). EZs received grants while RCs benefited from wage credits and tax incentives. Tax incentives for EZs and RCs were extended multiple times, with the latest extension in 2010. In 2009, legislation provided broadband education, training, and equipment for selected facilities in Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Renewal Communities (RCs). $3 million in appropriations were also provided for EZs and ECs. Federal agencies held competitions to designate communities, with 184 selected out of 993 applicants. Designated communities received funding through legislation and annual appropriations laws from 1999 to 2009. Designated communities received funding through annual appropriations laws from 1999 to 2009. Federal block grant funds for Round I were available until December 31, 2004, while Round II funds are available until expended. Tax incentives expired on December 31, 2009. Four federal agencies administer the EZ and EC programs, with grants mostly expended. Congress has provided funding for selected EZs and ECs through annual HUD appropriations. Congress has provided funding for selected EZs and ECs through annual HUD and USDA appropriations, as well as legislation like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HHS is responsible for providing grants under the Social Services Block Grant program to promote self-sufficiency and prevent neglect. HUD administers urban programs under its CDBG program for economic development activities. The USDA oversees the EZ and EC program in rural areas, providing grants for economic development projects targeting persistent poverty and unemployment. The IRS administers tax benefits for the programs, and a Community Empowerment Board coordinates the EZ, EC program with 26 members from federal agencies. The Community Empowerment Board, consisting of 26 members from federal agencies, coordinated resources for EZs and ECs to implement strategic plans. They encouraged other agencies to give preference points to EZs and ECs in federal program competitions. The board was disbanded before Round III of the EZ program in 2004. Communities nominated for EZ, EC, or RC designations had to meet eligibility criteria based on socioeconomic characteristics. The eligibility criteria for EZ, EC, or RC designations were based on socioeconomic characteristics, geographic size, and economic distress. Indian reservations were excluded from Round I EZ or EC designation. Only census tracts within nominated areas designated by HUD were eligible for tax credits. The enterprise zone concept originated in Great Britain in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s, government tax relief initiatives were introduced in economically distressed areas. Enterprise zones were established in England and the United States, with legislation proposed in Congress. By the late 1980s, over two-thirds of states had implemented their own enterprise zone programs. The Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities, and Renewal Communities programs were authorized by Congress in three rounds with different eligibility criteria and benefits. The legislation provided grant and tax incentives to companies in economically distressed neighborhoods. Economically distressed neighborhoods were identified based on poverty, unemployment rate, and total population. Areas had to be nominated by local governments or economic development corporations for EZ and EC programs. By the end of 1994, 104 EZs and ECs were designated by HHS, HUD, and USDA. The Empowerment Zone program, established in 1993, allocated $1 billion in federal grant funding for designated communities over a 10-year period. Businesses in these zones were provided with tax credits, including wage credits, expensing for qualifying property, and tax-exempt financing for certain facilities. In addition to EZs and ECs, Supplemental Empowerment Zones and Enhanced Enterprise Communities were created in 1994 through Executive Order 13005. Clinton authorized HUD to designate two communities as Supplemental Empowerment Zones and four communities as Enhanced Enterprise Communities, receiving $300 million in federal grant funding. Congress later authorized two more rounds of competitions for EZs and ECs, with tax incentives included. Round II EZs and ECs, unlike Round I communities, also received federal grant funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year Ending September 2001 authorized a third round of Enterprise Zones and Enterprise Communities, providing tax incentives but no federal grant funding for Round III communities. A new program called \"Renewal Communities\" was also authorized in 2001, offering incentives for local businesses to hire residents and expand in designated areas. The Renewal Community legislation authorized public schools in enterprise communities and empowerment zones for qualified zone academy bonds (QZABs) to finance school modernization and renovation. QZAB holders receive annual tax credits instead of interest payments, with the federal government effectively paying the interest for issuers in economically distressed areas. The RC legislation provided tax benefits for qualified businesses in designated regions, including wage credits, capital equipment expensing, and deductibility of qualified buildings. Tax incentives for the District of Columbia included wage tax credits, tax-exempt bond financing, and first-year expensing of equipment in Enterprise Zones with poverty rates of 20% or more. Zero capital gains tax rates were also available for business sales in areas with 10% poverty rates. These provisions were in effect until December 31, 2009. The legislation provided tax benefits for businesses in designated regions, including wage credits, capital equipment expensing, and deductibility of qualified buildings. Tax incentives for the District of Columbia included wage tax credits, tax-exempt bond financing, and first-year expensing of equipment in Enterprise Zones with poverty rates of 20% or more. Zero capital gains tax rates were available for business sales in areas with 10% poverty rates, extended through various acts until 2011. EZs, ECs, and RCs offer tax and grant incentives for economic development. Federal tax incentives for community development have historically taken the form of either employment or investment incentives. The number of tax incentives offered has grown while the value of grant incentives has declined. Tax incentives are equivalent to entitlement spending and remain in the tax code until changed by congressional action. Tax incentives for businesses in Empowerment Zones and Renewal Communities aim to promote economic development by offering employers incentives to hire workers. Both programs provide employment credits based on similar criteria, calculated as a percentage of eligible employee wages. The Empowerment Zone employment credit is 20% of the first $15,000 in wages for residents working within the zone. The Renewal Community employment credit is 15% of the first $10,000 in wages for residents working within the community. Employers can claim the credit, and investment incentives are also utilized to boost economic development in designated areas. Businesses can expense the cost of new and used qualified property under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. The maximum expensing allowance for qualified assets placed in service in 2010 is $250,000 for firms outside Empowerment Zones and Renewal Communities. Firms within these zones can claim an additional $35,000, totaling $285,000. The commercial revitalization deduction accelerates capital cost recovery for commercial construction within a Renewal Community by allowing taxpayers to deduct half of the expenditures in the year the building is placed in service or amortize them over a 120-month period. No depreciation is allowed for amounts deducted under this deduction. The commercial revitalization deduction allows taxpayers to deduct half of commercial construction expenditures in the year the building is placed in service or amortize them over 120 months. No depreciation is allowed for amounts deducted under this provision. Empowerment zone bonds are tax-exempt private activity bonds issued for qualified economic development projects in Empowerment Zones. Each round of EZ and RC programs is subject to different tax-exempt debt rules, with limits on the amount of EZ bonds outstanding for each zone and borrower. Lifetime caps apply to Round II EZs based on urban/rural designation and population. For the lifetime of the EZ designation, rural EZs can issue up to $60 million; urban EZs with population less than 100,000 can issue up to $130 million; and urban EZs with population greater than 100,000 can issue up to $230 million. There are no limits on the amount any one entity can borrow for Round II EZs. Qualified RC assets held for more than five years are eligible for an exclusion from capital gains taxes. Taxpayers can defer recognition of gain on the sale of a qualified EZ asset held for more than one year and replaced within 60 days by another qualified EZ asset. Taxpayers can defer recognition of gain on the sale of qualified small business stock held for more than five years. The exclusion for qualified small business stock acquired after December 21, 2000, in a qualified business entity is increased to 60%. Grant incentives for EZ, EC, and RC programs totaled nearly $1.8 billion from 1993 to 2009, with $1 billion provided in grants. Grant incentives for Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Enterprise Communities (ECs) totaled $1.8 billion from 1993 to 2009. $1 billion was provided in grants for the first round in 1994, while Round II communities received over $480 million in annual HUD and USDA appropriations. Round III communities only received tax incentives. The Community Empowerment Board recommended giving preference points to EZs and ECs for federal benefits, which several agencies followed. The Community Empowerment Board recommended providing preference points for EZs and ECs in federal economic development programs, education grants, low-income housing repair grants, rural development loans, and crime reduction programs. Other communities competing for EZ or EC status also received preferences for federal technical assistance programs. The USDA named communities that did not win EZ or EC designation as \"Champion Communities,\" eligible for technical assistance and preferences for government programs. 118 Champion Communities were named. EZs and ECs received preferences from state and local economic development programs. Legislation like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided preferences for broadband education in ECs. Data on the use and impact of these preferences is lacking. GAO suggested preferences may have decreased after the Community Empowerment Board disbanded. Limited data exists on the preferences. The Community Empowerment Board disbanded, and studies have failed to link EZ and EC designation with community improvement. Non-governmental economic studies also question the effectiveness of zone incentives. The inability to connect these programs to better community outcomes raises concerns about their cost-effectiveness. The EZ, EC, and RC programs did benefit businesses and investors, but studies have not shown a general improvement in economic conditions at the community level. The size of the programs may be a factor in this lack of generalization. HUD's progress report on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Communities programs presented mixed results, with no conclusive evidence of community improvement. No final report has been published to date. HUD's interim assessment of urban EZs and ECs found positive impacts, including accelerated job growth, increased resident and minority-owned businesses, and successful workforce development activities. Applicants for empowerment zone designation had to incorporate economic opportunity, community-based partnerships, sustainable community development, and strategic vision for change into their strategic plans. The interim assessment of urban EZs and ECs showed positive impacts on job growth, resident and minority-owned businesses, and workforce development activities. However, the effectiveness of the programs was questioned due to the difficulty in separating their impact from the overall economic upturn and low take-up rate of tax incentives. The GAO was mandated to audit the effectiveness of the EZ, EC, and RC programs. The 2004 GAO report examined the effectiveness of EZ, EC, and RC programs, focusing on tax benefits claimed by corporations and individuals. Data on other tax benefits was not available, so the impact on community outcomes was not determined. The 2006 GAO study analyzed the impact of Round I EZ and EC designation on community level outcomes. The 2006 GAO study analyzed the impact of Round I EZ and EC designation on community level outcomes. Researchers used multiple methods but were unable to conclude that community designation improved outcomes. Descriptive statistics showed improved outcomes, but limitations in methodology prevented attributing changes to the programs. Econometric analysis also failed to determine causality between the programs and economic development. Data limitations were identified in the 2004 report, further complicating the assessment. The 2004 report and 2006 report highlight data limitations in evaluating the impact of federal empowerment zones. Studies by federal agencies and academic researchers suggest modest effects, questioning the cost-effectiveness of these programs. Evaluators face challenges in isolating the programs' effects from overall economic conditions. Tracking individuals, households, businesses, and local governments receiving benefits is essential, along with matching them with similar entities not receiving benefits. Studies have found no statistically significant effect of federal empowerment zones on income, unemployment, or poverty. Some research suggests that the program had no impact on economic indicators, with conflicting results on the housing market. Studies have found that owner-occupied housing increased by 22-25% with zone designation, while renters in empowerment zones are negatively affected as rents outpace earnings. Congress has shown interest in extending and reforming empowerment zone programs, with bills introduced in the 111th Congress proposing changes such as extending tax benefits, revising requirements, and adjusting boundaries. Some proposed legislation aimed to expand empowerment zone programs by involving the Department of Commerce, creating new grant programs, and offering tax incentives for clean energy and agriculture. One bill suggested targeting funds to manufacturing and clean energy enterprises, while another aimed to improve air and health quality in designated zones. One bill proposed creating an Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone under the EPA. H.R. 4213, the Tax Extenders Act of 2009, aimed to extend tax benefits for EZs and ECs but was enacted as the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2010 without these incentives. The legislation would have extended Empowerment Zone and Renewal Community tax incentives. Community tax incentives were extended through various bills in the 111th Congress, with some extending designations through 2015, 2019, and 2020. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended Empowerment Zone tax incentives through December 31, 2011. In 2010, the expiration of RC and EZ tax incentives led to pending projects being put on hold, awaiting renewal. The Obama Administration requested Congress to extend these benefits in FY2010 and FY2011 budget documents. Legislation addressing unemployment issues used to extend these benefits due to competing economic priorities. In the 111th Congress, legislation was proposed to address unemployment by extending EZ and RC tax incentives. The bills aimed to revise job creation criteria and eliminate residency requirements for tax credits within empowerment zones. Expansion of EZ and EC boundaries was also considered. Several legislative proposals in the 110th and 109th Congress aimed to modify the boundaries of Empowerment Zones, including rural areas. Changing eligibility requirements for EZ, EC, and RC programs could encourage more businesses to invest in distressed communities and create full-time jobs, boosting economic activity. The creation of full-time jobs may boost economic activity, but geographically targeted incentives could lead to businesses relocating. Advocates suggest adjusting boundaries of EZs, ECs, and RCs to target federal aid more effectively as economic distress changes over time. Critics argue against allowing changes in designated census tracts for federal aid targeting. Selected legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to make changes to tax and grant incentives available in economically distressed areas. For example, H.R. 1677 and S. 1222 proposed modifications to tax benefits for businesses in Empowerment Zones (EZs) and Renewal Communities (RCs), including allowing carryovers of unused expensing allowances and offering payments in lieu of tax benefits. Additionally, local governments would have been able to issue tax-exempt rural EC bonds and EZ facility bonds to finance projects in EZs and RCs. Selected legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to modify tax and grant incentives in economically distressed areas, including EZs and RCs. S. 3787 proposed establishing a program for grants to States for revolving loan funds for manufacturers to improve energy efficiency. H.R. 3500 aimed to expand the use of tax-exempt bonds in urban areas and provide grants for businesses in enterprise zones. Several bills suggested adjustments to tax benefits for businesses in distressed areas. In the 111th Congress, bills were proposed to adjust tax and grant incentives for economically distressed areas like EZs, ECs, and RCs. Supporters believe these changes could boost economic activity. Critics are concerned about potential challenges in coordinating federal efforts and increasing the federal deficit in the long term. H.R. 5296, the Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone Designation Act of 2010, was introduced by Representative Jerry McNerney. The Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone Designation Act of 2010, introduced in the 111th Congress, aimed to designate areas for grants to improve air and health quality by replacing or retrofitting polluting vehicles. Critics question the effectiveness of geographically targeted incentives, while supporters argue for potential benefits. The 2010 GAO report highlighted challenges in evaluating economic development programs, specifically in linking tax benefits to distressed communities. Critics question the effectiveness of geographically targeted federal benefits, while supporters argue for their potential to aid areas in economic distress. The effectiveness of tax benefits in distressed communities can be assessed by combining tax-related information with poverty and employment data. Congress has options to consider for EZ, EC, and RC programs, including extending them or allowing them to expire. Permanently extending the programs could support economic recovery but worsen the fiscal outlook, while allowing them to expire might marginally improve the nation's fiscal condition. Other options or combinations are also available. The fragmented national economic development policy is a result of competing federal programs without unifying principles. Current policy uses metrics like unemployment and poverty rates to identify economic distress. Supporters argue that multiple programs allow for targeted policy tools, while detractors criticize the lack of unifying principles. Detractors argue that the absence of unifying principles in current federal economic development efforts hinders effectiveness and oversight. They suggest consolidating or replacing existing programs with a single set of principles to address this issue. Detractors suggest implementing a new program with unified economic development principles to improve targeting of resources and address current economic needs more efficiently. The existing economic development programs could be redesigned to better target areas in need of assistance, as recommended by the GAO. Improved oversight and data collection could help evaluate program effectiveness, with the option of a limited term extension for reevaluation. Congress will reevaluate economic development programs for effectiveness. List of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in various cities and states.
