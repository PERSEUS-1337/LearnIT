The new section 3532A allows for accelerated payment of educational assistance for approved high technology education programs lasting less than two years, leading to employment in growing sectors of the economy. The amount of accelerated payment for an eligible person is the lesser of 60 percent of the established charges for the program or the remaining educational assistance allowance under this chapter. The established charges for a program of education are determined based on tuition and fees for the term, quarter, or semester for individuals enrolled in the program. For programs not offered on a term basis, charges for the entire program are considered. Accelerated payment of educational assistance is provided for high technology education programs under two years in duration. An eligible person electing accelerated payment of educational assistance must certify the established charges for their education program to the Secretary. The payment must be made by the last day of the following month after enrollment certification. Entitlement to basic assistance is granted for each accelerated payment. When an eligible person chooses accelerated payment of educational assistance, the amount charged to their entitlement is determined by dividing the accelerated payment by the full-time monthly rate of educational assistance allowance. If the monthly rate increases during the program, the charge is prorated accordingly. The Secretary may not make an accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance for a program of education if the eligible person has already received an advance payment for the same enrollment period. The regulations for this section also cover programs pursued at tribally controlled colleges or universities. The regulations for accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance include requirements for request, issuance, delivery, certification, and recovery of overpayment. The regulations may incorporate elements from section 3014A. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 35. Accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance is addressed in section 3532A."
