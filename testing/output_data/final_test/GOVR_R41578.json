    "content": "The economy experienced the longest and deepest recession from December 2007 to June 2009, with the unemployment rate peaking at 10.1% in October 2009. Despite some growth in economic output since then, the labor market remained weak with unemployment rates averaging 9.6% in 2010 and 8.9% in 2011. By the fourth quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate fell to just under 8.0% for the first time since January 2009. The unemployment rate fell to 7.8% in December 2012, reaching 7% by November 2013. Long-term unemployment remains high, with 4.1 million workers jobless for over six months. Job losses during the recession totaled over 7 million, but employment has since increased by 3 million between June 2009 and October 2012. Total employment rose by more than 3 million between June 2009 and October 2012. Job gains in the private sector offset losses in the public sector from October 2010 to July 2012. The public sector started contributing to the net increase in nonfarm payroll employment in the second half of 2012. In the last year, from November 2012 to November 2013, employment continued to increase. Employment growth shifted to the private sector in the last year, while the public sector saw a decline. A \"hands off\" policy approach suggests patience as a decrease in unemployment is expected. Strong economic growth is crucial for reducing unemployment after a recession, but it may take several years for the rate to return to pre-recession levels. For example, after the 1982 recession, it took about six years for the unemployment rate to fall by half. During the current recovery, economic growth has been slow, and concerns about unsustainable long-term debt led to spending caps and the fiscal cliff. Further stimulus could help the economy but worsen the debt issue. The government has already taken steps like TARP, Fed policy actions, and fiscal stimulus to stabilize the economy. Proponents argue that further policy steps may not significantly reduce unemployment due to diminishing returns. However, an interventionist policy approach could be justified to minimize the costly impact of high unemployment in the short run. The debate also considers the cost of financing these additional policy steps during a time of large budget deficits. Mainstream economic theory suggests that the business cycle has no lasting effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Policy steps could temporarily improve well-being, but market forces would eventually return unemployment to its long-term equilibrium rate. Some economists argue for \"hysteresis,\" where high unemployment can lead to permanent increases in the natural rate. This could result from workers losing skills during long bouts of unemployment. The potential hysteresis effects of long-term unemployment on workers' skills and employability are a concern. Policy steps to reduce unemployment early could prevent permanent economic damage. There are fears of a \"double-dip\" recession, but historically, such occurrences are rare. In the past, tight monetary policy played a role in causing a quick return to recession. A new economic shock would likely be needed to derail the current expansion. The current economic crisis in Europe could potentially provide a large shock to the economy, similar to the fiscal cliff scenario projected for early 2013. The combination of tax increases and spending cuts is expected to have a significant impact on output. If no action is taken, there could be long-term stagnation or a deflationary trap, leading to overall spending constraints. Stagnation, also known as a deflationary trap, occurs when overall spending fails to grow enough to reduce economic slack. Evidence supporting this includes weak expansion, businesses and consumers deleveraging to reduce debt, and potential effects of the fiscal cliff. Japan's post-1990 experience shows stagnation is possible in a modern economy, with GDP growth dropping significantly and unemployment rising. Japan's unemployment rate rose from 1991 to 2002. Japan experienced 10 years of deflation from 1995 to 2009, indicating slow growth due to inadequate demand. Despite low interest rates and large budget deficits, Japan couldn't escape deflation. Some economists blame premature withdrawal of stimulus for prolonging the deflationary trap. The 2008 financial crisis led to shrinking prices and output. Japan's liquidity trap was prolonged by its failure to address financial system problems. The liquidity trap in Japan was prolonged due to its failure to address financial system problems after the 2008 financial crisis. Policy actions, including monetary and fiscal measures, were taken to contain damages from the crisis. These actions included a $150 billion economic stimulus package and financial sector interventions. Legislation was enacted in October 2008 to grant the Treasury Department authority to purchase up to $700 billion in assets through TARP. The Treasury Department was granted authority to purchase $700 billion in assets through TARP. Various programs were created under TARP to aid banks, automakers, and troubled financial firms. Additional policies included FDIC guarantees for bank debt, Treasury guarantees for money market funds, and support for government-sponsored enterprises. In response to the deepening recession, larger stimulus packages were proposed in 2009, leading to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion package with tax cuts and spending on infrastructure, revenue sharing, and middle-class tax cuts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included infrastructure spending, revenue sharing with states, middle-class tax cuts, business tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and food stamps. The largest budgetary effects were projected to occur in FY2010, equaling 2.2% of GDP. The Senate adopted a provision for payroll tax credits and income tax credits for employers in H.R. 2847. The Senate passed S.Amdt. 3310, a package costing $13 billion, including payroll tax relief and retention credit. Other provisions included converting tax credit bonds to Build America Bonds, extending small business expensing, and delaying worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. The bill was signed into law on March 18, 2010 (P.L. 111-147). The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312) reinstated the estate tax, extended Bush-era tax cuts, alternative minimum tax relief, and bonus depreciation. It also cut the employee portion of the payroll tax by 2 percentage points until the end of 2011, increasing the deficit by $797 billion. President Obama proposed a $447 billion tax cut and spending package in September 2011, larger than the 2008 stimulus but smaller than the 2009 stimulus. The American Jobs Act was subsequently introduced in response. The American Jobs Act, introduced in response to President Obama's proposal, included provisions such as cutting the employee's share of the Social Security payroll tax by 50% for 2012 and providing tax cuts to employers, including cutting the employer payroll tax in half for the first $5 million in wages. These provisions aimed to stimulate employment and support small businesses, costing a total of $175 billion. The American Jobs Act proposed tax cuts for employees and employers to stimulate employment and support small businesses, costing $175 billion. Additional provisions included $65 billion for various tax incentives, $140 billion for spending on education, infrastructure, and unemployment insurance expansion. The House Republican proposal, H.R. 3630, included extensions for the employee-side tax cut, bonus depreciation, unemployment compensation, welfare, and the \"doc fix\" for Medicare payments to doctors. It also proposed offsetting revenue losses and spending cuts by extending the freeze on federal employee pay and increasing. The House Republican proposal, H.R. 3630, included various provisions such as extending the freeze on federal employee pay, increasing retirement contributions, revising Medicare, limiting discretionary spending, and making changes to unemployment benefits and welfare payments. The Senate adopted an amended version that extended the payroll tax by two months, leading to the introduction of the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (H.R. 3765). On December 23, 2011, the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (H.R. 3765) was introduced, passed by the House, Senate, and signed into law by the President. A compromise for H.R. 3630 was announced on February 16, 2012, extending the payroll tax cut, unemployment benefits, and \"doc fix\" through 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Measure Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96) was enacted on February 22, 2012. This legislation prevented tax increases and spending cuts that were set to take place at the end of 2012 or start of 2013 without congressional action. In 2012 or the start of 2013, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted a significant reduction in economic growth due to budget deficit reductions. CBO projected a 3.9% decrease in growth and an expected recession in 2013. The fiscal restraint of $607 billion in FY2013 was mostly policy-related, with 80% being tax increases, including the expiration of tax cuts and the AMT patch. Other provisions included the expiration of the temporary Social Security payroll tax reduction.

The fiscal restraint of $607 billion in FY2013 was mostly policy-related, with 80% being tax increases, including the expiration of tax cuts and the AMT patch. Other provisions included the expiration of the temporary two-percentage-point reduction in the employees' Social Security payroll tax, other tax cuts, spending reductions, and legislative proposals focused on expiring tax provisions. The proposal aims to extend tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, except for high-income individuals, and parts of the 2009 tax cuts expiring in 2012. S. 3521, approved by the Senate, extends the AMT for two years and most \"extenders\" for a year. Other legislative proposals address spending cuts mandated by the Budget Control Act, such as H.R. 5652 canceling a sequester of about $98 billion in funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (P.L. 112-240) eliminated fiscal cliff provisions for FY2013, accounting for $329 billion. It extended income tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, except for high-income taxpayers, and the estate tax exemption. Unemployment insurance benefits, the doc fix, and bonus depreciation were also extended through 2013. The fiscal cliff provisions for FY2013 were eliminated by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which extended income tax cuts, unemployment insurance benefits, the doc fix, and bonus depreciation through 2013. The fiscal cliff elements that will reduce the deficit in 2013 include payroll tax reduction, individual income tax cuts for high-income individuals, tax increases from health reform, budget cuts, and non-policy-related effects. The remaining provisions, such as the payroll tax increase and budget cuts, could reduce growth by one to two percentage points. Congress's failure to agree on a budget resolution led to a partial government shutdown in October. The shutdown in October may have reduced the growth rate by 0.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Unemployment increased by 0.2 percentage points but is expected to be temporary. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 increased discretionary spending by $48 billion with offsetting effects. Temporary provisions expiring in 2013, like extended unemployment benefits and tax extenders, have not been addressed yet. The Senate may consider extending unemployment benefits in January. Unemployment benefits, doc fix, and tax extenders cost billions annually. Unemployment benefits have a larger stimulus effect compared to other expiring provisions. The Fed used conventional and unconventional tools to stimulate the economy, including reducing interest rates to near zero and quantitative easing. The Fed implemented various measures to stimulate the economy, including increasing its balance sheet through purchases of securities such as mortgage-backed securities, GSE debt, and Treasury debt. It also announced additional purchases of Treasury securities to further boost the economy. The Fed continued its policies of purchasing Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, along with maintaining low interest rates through 2013. In December 2013, it announced a plan to slow the pace of purchases while keeping interest rates low. Fiscal policy options for stimulating the economy include government spending, transfers to state and local governments, direct transfers to individuals, tax cuts, and incentives for businesses. Job credits for hiring the long-term unemployed have been discussed as supply-side subsidies. The fiscal stimulus aims to reduce the cost of hiring workers to induce more hires, rather than increasing total spending. Concerns about debt and deficit may hinder the effectiveness of traditional fiscal policies. The effectiveness of fiscal stimulus is judged based on its impact on aggregate demand. The size of the proposal and how it is financed are crucial factors. Only deficit-financed proposals are seen to have a significant positive effect on aggregate demand. Fiscal policy is often viewed as less effective than monetary policy in an open economy due to potential reactions that can offset increases in demand. The reduction in export demand due to the increased dollar price offsets the initial demand boost from stimulus. Questions arise on the effectiveness of further monetary stimulus after interest rate cuts. Fiscal stimulus can involve tax cuts or government spending increases, with tax cuts potentially being less effective at boosting overall spending. Transfer payments have a similar effect as tax cuts but are more likely to be spent by lower-income individuals. Tax subsidies for business tax cuts are generally not very effective. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has provided multipliers for various policy options, with income tax cuts having a range between 0.1 and 0.4, payroll tax cuts between 0.3 and 1.2, and infrastructure spending between 0.5 and 1.2. Mark Zandi's estimates for one year indicate similar multipliers for elements of the fiscal cliff. The multipliers for elements of the fiscal cliff, according to a forecaster for Moody's Analytics, are as follows: extension of unemployment benefits at 1.5, automatic spending cuts under the Budget Control Act at 1.1, Bush tax cuts for those below $250,000 and the payroll tax at 0.9, Bush tax cuts for those above $250,000 and the AMT at 0.5, and taxes imposed under health care, depreciation, \"extenders\" and doc fix at 0.2. Increased unemployment benefits have the largest effects, followed by spending, while tax cuts and payments to high income individuals have the smallest effects. The government may cut back on spending in downturns due to balanced budget requirements, but aid can help prevent these cuts. Tax cuts may be delayed if delivered through changes to withholding or delayed refunds. Stimulus benefits may be limited if enacted as the economy is recovering. Investment subsidies aim to increase aggregate demand but may not be very effective due to businesses with losses unable to take advantage and firms already having excess capacity. The small business investment subsidies face challenges due to lack of demand and mixed effects on investment. Employment tax credits aim to directly increase employment through labor cost subsidies, but a general subsidy to labor could significantly reduce tax revenue. The tax code includes permanent tax credits for certain types of workers, with a proposal for an incremental jobs tax credit to incentivize small business hiring. This credit would provide benefits for hiring employees above a base amount, similar to the historical New Jobs Tax Credit in 1977 and 1978. The New Jobs Tax Credit proposed in 1977 and 1978 aimed to create jobs by reducing labor costs. Estimates suggested a 10% reduction in labor costs could increase employment by 3%. Studies on the credit's impact yielded mixed results, with Bishop attributing 150,000 to 600,000 jobs out of a 1 million increase to the credit. The New Jobs Tax Credit proposed in 1977 and 1978 aimed to create jobs by reducing labor costs. Studies on the credit's impact yielded mixed results, with Perloff and Wachter comparing firms who knew about the credit with those who did not. Tannenwald surveyed Wisconsin and New England firms and found that the effect was smaller than predicted, with an increase of only 0.4% in labor demand. The New Jobs Tax Credit proposed in 1977 and 1978 aimed to create jobs by reducing labor costs. Studies on the credit's impact yielded mixed results, with an increase of only 0.4%, less than a quarter of the projected effects due to lack of product demand. Concerns about the effectiveness of the credit in industries with slack demand were raised, with discussions on the complexity and potential avoidance of incremental subsidies. The Carter Administration opposed an incremental subsidy due to complexity and unfairness. Sunley discussed various distortions arising from an incremental credit. Sunley discusses distortions that arise from incremental credit, favoring firms that are growing and leading to geographic differentials. Fiscal stimulus is typically deficit financed, but a deficit-neutral stimulus could be designed with high multiplier proposals offset by low multipliers. The choice of financing impacts the macroeconomic impact and cost-benefit tradeoff. Deficit-financed proposals have the maximum impact on employment in the short term. Increasing the budget deficit can boost total spending in the economy during a deep recession, helping to reduce high unemployment by utilizing idle resources. Deficit-neutral proposals may not have the same stimulating effect, as they could offset job creation provisions by cutting other spending or raising taxes. This could even have a mildly contractionary effect, as the increase in consumption from tax cuts may not fully offset the decrease in government spending. Increasing the budget deficit can boost total spending in the economy during a deep recession, helping to reduce high unemployment by utilizing idle resources. Deficit-neutral policies might lower the cost of labor but without an increase in demand for products, employers may not increase their labor force. The short-term economic cost of increasing the deficit may be low in a large output gap. Deficits can crowd out private investment spending by raising interest rates, but in the current context with reduced investment spending, there is less chance of crowding out in the short run. Increasing the budget deficit can boost total spending in the economy during a deep recession, helping to reduce high unemployment by utilizing idle resources. Unusually low Treasury bond rates suggest crowding out is not significant currently. Deficits can also be financed through foreign capital inflows, which may increase the trade deficit. However, the decline in the trade deficit since 2007 may lessen this impact. While increasing the deficit could have short-term benefits, political constraints may make it difficult to reverse the deficit increase when economic conditions normalize. The current deficits are not sustainable in the long run as they would cause the national debt to continually rise relative to output, leading to a fiscal crisis where investors may refuse to finance it. Investors are willing to hold federal debt as long as they believe the government will reduce the deficit to a sustainable level. Policy changes increasing the deficit move it further from sustainability."
