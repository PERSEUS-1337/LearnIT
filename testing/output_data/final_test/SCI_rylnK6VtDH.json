    "content": "The role of multiplicative interaction is explored as a unifying framework for various neural network architectural motifs like gating, attention layers, hypernetworks, and dynamic convolutions. Multiplicative interaction layers enrich neural network function classes, offering a powerful bias for combining multiple streams of information. They outperform simple concatenation in complex tasks like RL and sequence modeling, showcasing their potential for state-of-the-art results. This work focuses on the role of multiplicative interactions in designing neural network architectures, providing new evidence to support their importance. Despite being an older concept, multiplicative interactions have reappeared in modern architectural designs, connecting with recent developments like hypernetworks and dynamic convolutions. The study explores the significance of multiplicative interactions in neural network architectures, showing their effectiveness in representing functions for algorithmic operations and contextual information integration. Empirical evidence supports the use of multiplicative interactions in improving performance on various reinforcement learning and sequence modeling tasks. Multiplicative interactions are argued to provide a better inductive bias in neural networks, leading to more efficient learning and improved performance. The study aims to re-explore these interactions, demonstrate their efficacy in representing solutions, and apply them to sequence modeling and reinforcement learning tasks with state-of-the-art results. The study focuses on formalizing multiplicative interactions in neural networks to improve learning efficiency and performance. It aims to model an unknown function that involves interactions between different variables, such as hidden activations or input modalities. The standard approach involves using a neural network with a single layer of weights, but by stacking multiple layers with nonlinearities, the network can approximate any target function. The study explores the use of multiplicative interactions in neural networks to enhance learning efficiency and performance. By incorporating a specific form involving 3D weight tensors and regular weight matrices, the network gains flexibility to learn various functions. Additionally, techniques like generating weights using a neural network and affine networks are related to this multiplicative form. The text discusses the use of multiplicative interactions in neural networks to improve learning efficiency. It explains how equations can be decomposed to generate input-conditional weight matrices and bias vectors. The concept of hypernetworks as variations of multiplicative interactions is also explored, along with diagonal forms and gating mechanisms for projected weights. The text discusses the use of multiplicative interactions in neural networks for efficient learning. It explains how equations can be decomposed to generate input-conditional weight matrices and bias vectors, resembling commonly used gating methods. Additionally, attention systems in sequence modeling also utilize multiplicative interactions to scale different parts of the input effectively. The text discusses the potential benefits of considering higher order interactions in neural networks, specifically focusing on generating a vector mask for attention systems. It also mentions the use of low-rank approximations to generate scalar matrices for scaling and bias parameters. In metric learning, the focus is on finding the most suitable metric to measure similarity between objects in a parametrised space. Unlike traditional approaches, this method aims to learn a metric internally without direct supervision. Multiplicative interactions play a key role in this process, which can be viewed in terms of tensor approximation, projected context, or combining weights and input. The general bilinear form and diagonal 3D tensor in neural networks are equivalent to hypernetworks that generate weights and context for specific operations. Vanilla MLPs are universal approximators capable of representing any continuous function with a small error. Adding new modules does not affect the approximation power of neural nets but can impact the hypotheses space and the compactness of the estimator. Adding multiplicative interactions to vanilla MLPs enlarges the hypotheses space, allowing for perfect representation of new functions. This expansion includes basic functions necessary for mimicking systems of interest. The addition of exotic activation functions can achieve similar results, but the key benefit lies in extending coverage to essential functions for composing solutions. The learnability of simple two input functions against the number of parameters needed is shown in Figure 2. Summation, gating, and dot products are basic building blocks for operations like conditional statements or similarity metrics. Multiplicative models have quadratic growth in complexity for learning, while gating and dot-product functions require exponential growth in MLPs. Summation is easier for an MLP, suggesting that multiplicative interactions add an important class of functions to the hypothesis set. Using multiplicative interactions as context-integration layers leads to performance gains across various tasks. The history of these interactions dates back to the foundational era of connectionism. Early models leveraging multiplicative interactions include higher-order Boltzmann machines and autoencoders. Currently, the most common usage is through a factorised or diagonal representation of the necessary 3D weight tensor. The LSTM cell and its variations employ multiplicative interactions in gating units for memory stability. Enhanced versions combine previous hidden states and current inputs through element-wise products. Bilinear layers, like in computer vision, and squeeze-and-excitation networks also utilize similar concepts. In visual-question answering systems, models like FiLM and class-conditional batch norm are prominent. In visual-question answering systems, models like FiLM or class-conditional batch norm use diagonal forms to generate per-channel scales and biases based on context. This approach effectively captures relationships between text and vision modalities, allowing a single network to specialize on multiple tasks. Bilinear models and attention systems are commonly used in multimodal domains like VQA. Gating mechanisms, such as those in pixelCNNs and Highway Networks, also employ diagonal approximations with non-linearities or softmaxes. Hypernetworks, including Multiplicative interactions and HyperLSTMs, are used for model compression in feed-forward nets. Dynamic convolutions and Bayesian forms have also been explored in generating parameters for convolutional nets. These techniques allow for the generation of weights and biases based on context, enabling specialization on multiple tasks within a single network. The incorporation of multiplicative interactions in various models, such as Bayesian forms and architecture search, has shown to boost performance across different domains. These interactions play a key role in attention mechanisms and have been used in reinforcement learning works like Feudal Networks for better conditioning of information. Multiplicative interactions allow for better routing and integration of different types of information, enhancing the integration of latent variables and task/contextual information in decoder models. The text discusses the integration of latent variables in decoder models, task/contextual information in multitask learning, and recurrent state in sequence models using neural process regression, multitask RL, and language modeling. Implementation details and terminology are provided, including the use of M(x, z) to represent a specific function and the 2D output of projecting contextual information. In the context of integrating latent variables in decoder models and multitask learning, the text discusses the use of 2D-contextual projection and \"generated weights\" in hypernet terminology. It explores boosting performance by learning context or task-conditional layers with multiplicative interactions, emphasizing the trade-off between parameter count and task-specific tuning for better results. Context-conditional layers offer a best-of-both-worlds approach by allowing transfer between tasks while limiting interference. A toy example demonstrates regression of affine and sine functions with one model. Results show that a standard MLP with multiple heads or task ID input does not improve performance, highlighting the effectiveness of context-conditional layers. The results show that a task-conditioned M(x, t) layer allows the model to learn multiple tasks better with less interference and increased data efficiency. This improvement is more significant as the number of tasks increases. Moving on to a larger scale problem, multitask RL is applied to the DeepMind Lab-30 domain, consisting of 30 tasks in a 3D environment. The architecture used is similar to the original works, involving convolutional layers within the Impala framework. The original works proposed a multi-headed agent architecture with one policy and value head per level to boost performance. Using multiplicative layers to integrate task information improved data efficiency and reduced interference between tasks. Using multiplicative layers to integrate task information improved data efficiency and reduced interference between tasks. A further boost in performance was achieved by generating policy layers from a learnt embedding of the task ID. Interestingly, similar or greater performance gains were obtained without using task information by replacing the task ID with a learnt non-linear projection of the LSTM output. In a study, a t-SNE plot of the LSTM state showed the model's ability to detect task information as levels progress. The use of multiplicative interaction with a learnt embedding improved task conditioned behavior, leading to state-of-the-art performance in the domain previously using the PopArt Method. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a domain previously using the PopArt Method, simplifying the process by reducing the number of extra hyper-parameters to zero. We suggest that these methods can be combined in future work and leave for future analysis the ability of hyper-value functions to implicitly learn different reward scales. Additionally, we explore combining semantically different features using multiplicative interactions. In this study, the integration of contextual latent variables into neural decoders for few-shot regression is investigated. Neural Processes are used to predict function values at new observations by learning a distribution over functions consistent with previous observations. Context points are embedded individually to obtain latent variables that represent the function mapping x to y. The study investigates integrating contextual latent variables into neural decoders for few-shot regression. The decoder aims to improve conditioning on latent information by using multiplicative forms instead of the standard additive approach. Results show that multiplicative forms outperform baseline MLPs in conditioning on latent information. Additional details are provided in the appendix.

Experimental details are in appendix F. Word-level language modeling with recurrent models involves predicting the next word in a sequence using LSTM and output embeddings. The model computes output embeddings with multiplicative interactions to better consider recurrent context. The curr_chunk introduces a non-linear pathway in the network and reduces parameter count by using a diagonal form. It also discusses integrating recurrent information into LSTM through multiplicative input embeddings. Results on Wikitext-103 are reported for this model. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of using multiplicative output embeddings and a diagonal form for input embeddings in the network architecture. It highlights the performance boost achieved by adding these embeddings and the potential for better integration of information. The authors suggest that these embeddings can complement existing advances in the field and propose future integration with Transformer models. The curr_chunk explores the integration of multiplicative interactions in Transformer models, connecting them to various architectures like Hypernetworks and multiplicative LSTMs. The study empirically tests the hypothesis that these networks can better represent algorithmic primitives and fuse multiple streams of data. Results show matching state-of-the-art performance with LSTMs and multiplicative units, advocating for broader consideration of such methods by practitioners. The curr_chunk discusses the broader understanding and consideration of methods like Hypernetworks and multiplicative LSTMs in Transformer models. It suggests exploring various approximations, efficient implementations, and applications to newer domains. The study aims to integrate higher order interactions for better information integration in attention systems. The proof of inclusion in the theorem is shown by splitting input into arbitrary parts. The inclusion in the theorem is proven by showing that a single layer MLP with a multiplicative unit can represent a 1D function exactly. For a regular MLP, at least one hidden layer is needed to ensure non-linearity. The proof involves satisfying conditions related to weights and biases of the layers, ultimately demonstrating the strict inclusion. The curr_chunk discusses the impossibility of representing a Weierstrass function with a relu network due to their differentiability properties. It also highlights the strict inclusion of hypotheses classes by showing that only some activations are replaced in a single layer MLP, leading to equality. The curr_chunk provides a code snippet using the Sonnet framework to add a multiplicative layer to a model. It involves generating implicit 3D weight tensors W and b instead of using a standard linear layer. For experiments modeling two-input functions, MLP and MI models are considered with different architectures. The models are trained using Adam optimizer for 6,000 steps with Mean Squared Error loss on mini-batches. The number of parameters is plotted against the input hidden size for both models. In multitask toy regression, models are trained using Adam optimizer for 10,000 steps with Mean Squared Error loss on mini-batches. Tasks involve fitting affine functions and scaled sine waves. Models are trained in a multitask setup with T tasks sampled. The training process involves multi-task training on DeepMind lab levels using Impala architecture with population based training (PBT). Models are trained for 10 billion frames of data with specific architecture details. Human normalized scores are calculated for each level. The training process involves multi-task training on DeepMind lab levels using Impala architecture with population based training (PBT). Models are trained for 10 billion frames of data with specific architecture details. ReLU, Conv2D, Linear layer, LSTM, and Policy layers are used with various parameters and functions, including concatenation with one hot encoded last action and last reward. Gaussian observation noise is added with a fixed sigma value and a random draw for each function. Deterministic transformation of context is provided in addition to latent variable z using separate encoder networks. The benefits of adding an additional deterministic path are discussed in Kim et al. (2019). The deterministic encoder in Kim et al. (2019) consists of deep MLPs for h and 3 hidden layers for z. The decoder network for new target inputs x* has 4 layers. Training involves a single layer LSTM with 2048 hidden units, using relu activations and Adam optimizer. Input and output embeddings are tied, with a training sequence length of 128. The multiplicative model uses a training sequence length of 128. The output embedding is calculated with an MI layer and a linear layer with output size 32 followed by a relu. A dropout rate of 0.3 and learning rate of 0.001 are used for all models trained with the Adam optimizer. The multiplicative encoder uses a diagonal form of the M(.) layer, while the multiplicative decoder uses the full M(.) form. This results in a 6 perplexity improvement in performance compared to adding 1000 hidden units. The parameter count could be reduced by considering diagonal or low rank approximations, but this is not specifically optimized for in this work."
