The \"Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act\" defines key terms related to athlete representation, including agency contracts and athlete agents. An agency contract is an agreement where a person negotiates on behalf of a student athlete for professional sports or endorsement contracts. An athlete agent is an individual who enters into such contracts or recruits athletes, excluding certain family members or legal representatives. The \"Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act\" defines terms related to athlete representation, including agency contracts and athlete agents. An agency contract involves negotiating for professional sports or endorsement contracts on behalf of a student athlete. Key terms like athletic director, Commission, endorsement contract, and intercollegiate sport are defined within the Act. The term \"intercollegiate sport\" refers to collegiate-level sports with eligibility requirements set by a national association. \"Professional sports contract\" involves employment as a player on a professional team. \"State\" includes various U.S. regions. \"Student athlete\" is defined as a student participating in sports. A student athlete is defined as an individual eligible to participate in intercollegiate sports, excluding those permanently ineligible for a specific sport. Regulation of unfair and deceptive acts and practices in contact between athlete agents and student athletes. It is illegal for an athlete agent to recruit a student athlete using false information or promises, provide anything of value before signing a contract, fail to provide a disclosure document, or manipulate contract dates. An athlete agent must provide a disclosure document to a student athlete or their parent/legal guardian before entering into an agency contract, separate from any state law requirements. The document must be signed by the student athlete or their guardian, and must contain specific language. The disclosure document for student athletes must include a warning about the potential loss of eligibility if they agree to be represented by an agent. The document must be signed by the student athlete or their parent/guardian, and must be submitted to the educational institution's athletic director within 72 hours of signing the contract. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. Violations of this Act are treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission enforces this Act with the same powers as the Federal Trade Commission Act. SEC. 5. ACTIONS BY STATES. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action in a district court of the United States to enjoin, enforce compliance, or obtain compensation for residents if an athlete agent violates the Act. Before filing the action, the attorney general must provide notice to the Commission. The attorney general of a State must provide written notice and a copy of the complaint to the Commission before filing a civil action against an athlete agent for violating the Act. If it is not feasible to provide notice before filing, the attorney general must provide notice and the complaint to the Commission at the same time as filing the action. The Commission has the right to intervene in civil actions related to athlete agent violations. The Commission can be heard in the action and file a petition for appeal. State attorney generals can still conduct investigations and compel witnesses in civil actions under the Act. The Commission can intervene in civil actions for athlete agent violations. States cannot initiate actions during Commission's case. Actions can be filed in a US district court under specific venue rules. Process serving can occur where the defendant resides or can be found. SEC. 6. PROTECTION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. Within 72 hours of signing an agency contract, the athlete agent and student athlete must notify the educational institution. The institution has the right to take legal action against the agent for any damages caused by violating this rule, with damages limited to actual losses and expenses incurred. The educational institution can take legal action against an athlete agent for damages caused by violating the Act, including being penalized or suspended from athletics. The court may award costs and attorneys fees to the prevailing party, and this section does not limit other rights, remedies, or defenses under law or equity. SEC. 7. LIMITATION.\n\nIndividuals can seek remedies under existing State law or equity.\n\nSEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\nStates should enact the Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 to protect student athletes and amateur sports integrity from unscrupulous agents. Key provisions include registration of agents, contract requirements, athlete's right to cancel, disclosure requirements, and reciprocity among States."
