    "content": "The United States government employs many individuals and contractors overseas, some of whom may commit crimes that are not easily prosecutable under current federal law. The Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (H.R. 2136 and S. 1145) aims to address these gaps in jurisdiction. Introduced in both the House and Senate, the bills are similar but not identical, and have faced objections in the past. The 112th Congress did not take further action on these proposals before adjourning. The extraterritorial application of US law to crimes committed by individuals associated with the government's activities overseas is governed by various laws such as the UCMJ, MEJA, USA PATRIOT Act, and legislation on human trafficking offenses. Concerns were raised in 2007 about the adequacy of these provisions in addressing misconduct allegations in Iraq. The House passed H.R. 2740 (110th Congress) to extend MEJA to contractors working for any US agency in areas where the Armed Forces are conducting operations. The Administration objected, citing vagueness and potential burdens on the Defense Department. The Senate did not act on the bill, but modified proposals were reintroduced in the 111th Congress. The 110th Congress passed H.R. 2740 to extend MEJA to contractors working for any US agency in areas where the Armed Forces are conducting operations. Modified proposals were reintroduced in the 111th Congress, but no further legislative activity occurred. The Constitution grants the federal government and Congress generous powers regarding matters overseas, including the President's role as commander in chief and Congress's power to define and punish felonies on the high seas. The Constitution grants the federal government and Congress powers to define and punish felonies on the high seas and regulate commerce with foreign nations. Curtiss-Wright supports the idea that extraterritorial jurisdiction may be based on sovereignty when Congress's enumerated powers are lacking. MEJA has withstood constitutional challenges, showing that its exercise of power is limited by the law of nations and due process. The Sixth Circuit rejected challenges to MEJA, stating it did not violate separation of powers principles. Green's equal protection and due process arguments were also dismissed as lacking evidence of arbitrary or malicious conduct. The district court in Williams found that there was no constitutional bar to the extraterritorial application of penal laws, but needed to consider whether it would violate general principles of international law. The court's reasoning for this consideration was unclear, as it could have been to confirm congressional intent, establish Congress's power, or guide a due process analysis. The court cited cases addressing the extraterritorial application of statutes, but MEJA explicitly applies overseas, making reference to international law unnecessary. The court considered international law principles but ultimately found MEJA's application consistent with them. The court found that the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) was consistent with international law principles and Congress's intent for extraterritorial application. The House Judiciary Committee report on MEJA cites constitutional authority under Article I, Section 8. Congress may rely on a wider range of enumerated powers to enact bills' proposals, based on legislative authority for contracts, offenses, or locations. The Constitutional Authority Statement for H.R. 2136 identifies three justifications: power to tax and spend for defense, power to define and punish offenses, and power \"to make all laws necessary and proper.\" The House and Senate bills in the 112th Congress propose a new Section 3272 under MEJA, outlawing criminal conduct outside the US by individuals employed by or accompanying US departments or agencies other than the Department of Defense. This includes employees, contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and their dependents, but excludes nationals and residents of the host country. The bills in the 112th Congress propose a new section under MEJA to address criminal conduct outside the US by individuals working for US departments or agencies other than the Department of Defense. The bills aim to include employees, contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and their dependents, expanding the scope beyond MEJA which only covers a limited range of crimes committed by employees and contractors supporting the Department of Defense overseas. The bills in the 112th Congress propose expanding MEJA to cover criminal conduct outside the US by individuals working for US departments or agencies other than the Department of Defense. This includes employees, contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and their dependents. Prosecutors would have the option to proceed under either MEJA or the proposed section for cases involving civilian agencies supporting a Defense Department mission. MEJA applies to individuals associated with US departments or agencies other than the Department of Defense, covering offenses punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year within US jurisdiction. The 110th Congress considered expanding coverage for non-Defense Department contractors but specified offenses like drug trafficking and terrorism for extraterritorial provisions. The House and Senate bills propose exceptions for US intelligence activities abroad, with slight differences in wording. Both bills aim to avoid limiting extraterritorial jurisdiction or the authority of chiefs of mission. MEJA includes procedural provisions to minimize impact on those involved in military activities. MEJA authorizes overseas U.S. military law enforcement personnel to arrest individuals charged with violations, with provisions to avoid arbitrary return to the U.S. Those arrested must be brought before a federal magistrate promptly, who may appoint military counsel for indigent defendants and set bail. The magistrate can dismiss charges for lack of probable cause or order the accused returned to the States. The bills propose vesting the Attorney General with authority to regulate arrest, detention, delivery, and removal of individuals. The House bill includes regulations for cases involving serious offenses, while the Senate bill does not. The bills aim to shift investigative burdens from the Defense Department to the Attorney General and other covered departments and agencies. The bills propose giving the Attorney General authority to investigate overseas violations, with resources from other agencies. The Attorney General would report to Congress annually for six years and adjust the statute of limitations for prosecutions. The statute of limitations for federal crimes is typically five years, with some offenses having longer limits like arson at 10 years. It aims to restrict prosecution time to prevent unfairness due to faded memories and encourage prompt investigations by law enforcement. The statute of limitations for federal crimes is typically five years, with some offenses having longer limits like arson at 10 years. Certain offenses like capital crimes, terrorism, and sex offenses have no time limit for prosecution. The statute of limitations can be suspended under certain circumstances, such as during wartime or when the suspect is fleeing. Proposals have been made to suspend the statute of limitations for suspects abroad to allow for overseas investigations. The Senate proposal aims to extend the statute of limitations for certain offenses, including human trafficking, by not counting the time the offender is outside the United States. This would ensure that the statute of limitations only runs while the suspect is in the country, potentially aiding in prosecution. The Senate proposal aims to extend the statute of limitations for certain offenses, including human trafficking, by not counting the time the offender is outside the United States. This would ensure that the statute of limitations only runs while the suspect is in the country, potentially aiding in prosecution. The Constitution allows Congress to determine where federal crimes committed overseas may be tried, giving the government the ability to choose the forum for trial based on the defendant's location. The Senate bill proposes extending the statute of limitations for certain offenses, including human trafficking, by excluding time spent outside the United States. It allows the government to choose the trial venue based on the defendant's location, potentially disadvantaging the accused in some cases. The option of choosing trial venue based on defendant's location may lead to additional expenses and inconvenience, but could also increase the likelihood of a plea agreement. It may also benefit witnesses assigned to duties in the headquarters of the employing agency.
