    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 17 (Section 50897) of the Health and Safety Code establishes the Workforce Housing Pilot Program to assist low or moderate-income individuals in areas with unaffordable housing prices. Eligible recipients will receive funds to address rising home and rental prices, enabling individuals to live closer to their workplaces. In Chapter 17 of the Health and Safety Code, the Workforce Housing Pilot Program defines \"eligible recipients\" as cities in high-cost counties or experiencing rising home and rental prices, or charitable nonprofit organizations operating housing trust funds in partnership with qualifying cities. The Workforce Housing Pilot Program, established in the Health and Safety Code, provides grant funding through a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) to eligible recipients, including cities in high-cost areas or charitable nonprofit organizations. Eligible recipients must meet specified criteria to receive funding from the Department of Housing and Community Development. An eligible recipient of the Workforce Housing Pilot Program grant funds must use the money for predevelopment costs, construction, or rehabilitation of rental housing projects for low or moderate-income individuals. The affordability of all assisted units must be maintained for at least 55 years. Additionally, a public hearing must be held to discuss the project, following the Ralph M. Brown Act guidelines. If a charitable nonprofit organization is awarded funds, the city must hold the public hearing. The eligible recipient of grant funds must file periodic reports with the department. The funds can be used for downpayment assistance for low or moderate-income individuals, with limits set by the department. All grant funds awarded must be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis, except for recipients facing hardships unable to generate matching funds. The Department of Finance determines hardship for eligible recipients who must provide requested information. A report is submitted to the Legislature annually on grants awarded, projects funded, units supported, and matching funds received. The program continues until all funds are awarded. The program will operate until all funds are awarded. Upon depletion of funds, a report evaluating the need for housing in areas that received grant funds will be submitted to the Legislature. The report will include a recommendation on whether the program should continue. Reports must be submitted in compliance with the Government Code."
