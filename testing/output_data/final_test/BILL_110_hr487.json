    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2007\". The Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, including the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, aimed to boost the US economy. However, the project flooded Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, causing economic and cultural harm to the tribe. Compensation has been provided to some affected individuals. Congress provided compensation to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe for injuries caused by the Pick-Sloan projects. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act created a Tribal Recovery Trust Fund, but did not offer additional compensation for tribal members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Recovery Trust Fund compensates Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project and capitalizes the Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe receives equitable compensation. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to address fair compensation for land acquired for the Oahe Dam and Reservation project. The Equitable Compensation Act (Public Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365) is amended to define \"member landowner\" as a Tribe member who owned land on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation acquired for the Oahe Dam project. Additionally, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund section is revised. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2007 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit specific amounts into the Fund on designated capitalization dates, including interest calculations. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2007 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to deposit specific amounts into the Fund on designated capitalization dates, including interest calculations related to investments. The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest the Fund only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States issued directly to the Fund, in accordance with specific investment requirements. The Fund's principal account earns interest which is transferred to a separate interest account and reinvested. The interest earned from investing amounts in the principal account is credited to the interest account. Amounts in the principal account are initially invested in eligible obligations with the shortest available maturity. Subsequent investments follow the same principle. Subsequent investments from the principal account are divided into three equal portions and invested in Treasury obligations with 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year maturities. Subsequent investments from the principal account are divided into three equal portions and invested in Treasury obligations with 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year maturities. When eligible obligations mature, the principal is reinvested in identical Treasury obligations with corresponding maturities. If the Department of the Treasury discontinues issuance of obligations, adjustments may be necessary. If the Department of the Treasury stops issuing 2-year, 5-year, or 10-year obligations, the maturing principal will be reinvested equally in similar longer-term Treasury obligations. Amounts in the interest account of the Fund will be invested before each capitalization date. The Fund's account will be invested in eligible obligations identical to publicly-issued Treasury obligations with maturities matching the capitalization date. Amounts in the interest account will also be reinvested in similar Treasury obligations after each capitalization date. The Fund's account will be invested in eligible obligations matching Treasury obligations with maturities aligned with withdrawal dates. The purchase price of an eligible obligation shall not exceed its par value to preserve the principal amount. The Fund's account will be invested in eligible obligations matching Treasury obligations with maturities aligned with withdrawal dates. Any discount from par in the purchase price of the eligible obligation shall be treated as interest paid at maturity. Eligible obligations purchased shall be held to their maturities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall review investment activities and financial status of the Fund annually. If investing according to the specified guidelines is not feasible, modifications may be made. The Secretary of the Treasury may modify requirements if not practicable or if adverse consequences to the Fund would result. Consultation with the Tribe is required before making any modifications. Beginning on the first day of each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall withdraw interest. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds from the interest account of the Fund to the Secretary of the Interior for use in the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, with additional compensation for member landowners. The Reservoir Project determines heirs of member landowners according to the Tribe's probate code. Additional compensation payments during a fiscal year cannot be deposited into the member landowner's Individual Indian Money account or any other fund held by the United States. The Secretary of the Interior will provide records to the Tribe to help process claims of heirs of member landowners for land acquired for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project within 90 days of the request. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to allow member landowners to receive compensation within 90 days of a request from the Tribe. Additionally, the Act is amended to include any member landowner in eligibility for certain programs and services. Claims under the Act are extinguished and amended accordingly. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to extinguish all monetary claims against the United States for land taken for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. Acceptance of payment by member landowners or heirs extinguishes their claims as well. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act was passed by the House of Representatives on May 7, 2007."
