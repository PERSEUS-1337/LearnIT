The \"Public Rangeland Grazing Reform Act of 1993\" aims to manage Federal rangelands in Western States to achieve healthy ecosystems with diverse plant and animal species. Despite efforts by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, many areas remain in poor condition. The \"Public Rangeland Grazing Reform Act of 1993\" aims to improve management of grazing on rangelands in Western States managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The fee formula established in 1986 has not provided adequate returns for citizens utilizing affected rangeland for livestock grazing. The \"Public Rangeland Grazing Reform Act of 1993\" aims to improve grazing management on Western States' rangelands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. The fee formula established in 1986 has not adequately compensated citizens using affected rangeland for livestock grazing. The \"Public Rangeland Grazing Reform Act of 1993\" seeks to enhance grazing management on Western States' rangelands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. It involves amending Section 401 of the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 to establish annual domestic livestock grazing regulations. The \"Public Rangeland Grazing Reform Act of 1993\" establishes annual domestic livestock grazing fees based on fair market value starting from March 1, 1994. Fair Market Value calculation formula includes Appraised Base Value and Forage Value Index divided by 100. The Forage Value Index (FVI) is computed annually by the Economic Research Service, USDA, with the 1991 FVI set at 100. The Appraised Base Value refers to the 1983 Appraisal Value conclusions for mature cattle and horses, adjusted for advanced payment and indexed to 1991. Executive Order 12548 from 1986 does not apply to grazing fees set by this Act. The Act allows for alternative grazing fees on designated land to improve ecosystems. Grazing advisory boards are abolished, and their functions are transferred to established councils. Funds appropriated for grazing on public lands in Western States shall be used for habitat restoration, riparian area management, and enforcement of land use regulations. Distribution of funds will be determined by the Secretary after consulting with advisory councils and interested parties. The Taylor Grazing Act Amendment under Section 10 (43 U.S.C. 315i) involves consultation with advisory councils and interested parties. \"SEC. 10. RECEIPT SHARING.\" From the money received by the US for grazing livestock on public lands in Western States, the Treasury Secretary pays 12.5% under section 3 and 50% under section 15 to local governments. These payments are in addition to other payments and can be used for various governmental purposes, excluding support or opposition to pending legislative proposals. The proposal pending before Congress relates to the management of domestic livestock grazing on public lands or National Forest lands. It defines the term 'unit of local government' and specifies that payments to local governments with lands in grazing districts should be proportional to the area within their jurisdiction. The proposal pending before Congress addresses the management of domestic livestock grazing on public lands. It amends the term of grazing permits from ten years to five years and includes provisions for nongrazing use. Section 402 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to allow holders of grazing permits or leases to refrain from using forage for livestock grazing for conservation or wildlife enhancement purposes, placing the forage on nonuse status for a specified interval of at least 2 years. The amendment allows holders of grazing permits or leases to place forage on nonlivestock-use status for conservation purposes. The unavailability of forage for livestock grazing will be considered in land management plans. Holders opting for nonuse status will have priority for new permits or leases after expiration. Fees for grazing permits may still apply. The grazing of forage under a grazing permit or lease may be reduced if the forage is on nonuse status for conservation purposes. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION OF SUBLEASING. Section 402 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 is amended to prohibit subleasing of grazing permits on public lands or National Forest lands. Subleasing is defined as grazing domestic livestock not owned and controlled by the permit holder. Grazing permit refers to a permit issued by the Secretary for grazing domestic livestock on public lands. The Secretary requires holders of grazing permits to annually file an affidavit confirming ownership and control of livestock grazing on public or National Forest lands. Any voluntary action that removes privately owned property covered by the permit will terminate the grazing permit within 30 days. Grazing under the permit is not allowed after termination unless certain conditions are met. The termination of a grazing permit can occur if the party obtaining control of the property does not submit an application for a new permit. In the case of a permit holder's death, grazing may continue for up to 2 years to manage the estate. The grazing permit terminates upon involuntary transfer of the property. Grazing may continue for up to 1 year after transfer to facilitate property disposition. Any continuation of grazing requires a new permit and is at the Secretary's discretion. The grazing permit terminates upon involuntary transfer of the property, and grazing may continue for up to 1 year after transfer to facilitate property disposition. Any holder of a grazing permit who knowingly allows subleasing on public lands covered by the permit shall forfeit the dollar equivalent of any value in excess of the grazing fee paid to the United States and be disqualified from further grazing privileges. Any person other than the permit holder who engages in subleasing will be subject to penalties specified in the Act."
