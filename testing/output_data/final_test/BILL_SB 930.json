    "title": "SB 930",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 115843.6 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to restrict bodily contact with water in Bear Lake Reservoir for recreational uses. The water undergoes complete treatment, including oxidation, filtration, and disinfection, to meet board regulations for domestic use. Treatment must inactivate organisms like viruses, cryptosporidium, and giardia, and comply with state and federal laws, including the EPA Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. The Lake Alpine Water Company monitors for cryptosporidium, giardia, and bacteria at the reservoir intake and post-treatment. Bodily contact at Bear Lake Reservoir is allowed for up to four months per year, with additional restrictions to protect public health and safety. The Lake Alpine Water Company must submit a biennial report to the Legislature and the board detailing recreational uses at Bear Lake Reservoir and the water treatment program. The report includes monthly recreational use estimates, monitoring for cryptosporidium, giardia, and bacteria, sanitary surveys, water quality monitoring, and evaluations of recommendations for inactivation and removal of pathogens. Annual reports required by the water permit must also be provided. The entity operating the water supply reservoir must provide annual reports to the board as required by the water permit. This includes evaluating the impact of recreational activities on water quality, optimizing water quality in recreational facilities, and submitting reservoir and operations plans. If there are changes in the treatment facility or water quantity, a report must be filed to ensure water quality is not adversely affected. The board annually reviews monitoring data from Bear Lake Reservoir for compliance. Non-compliance results in immediate cessation of exemption and potential permit suspension, amendment, or revocation. Failure to comply is considered a violation subject to fines and penalties under Chapter 4. The \"board\" refers to the State Water Resources Control Board. The State Water Resources Control Board reviews Bear Lake Reservoir data annually for compliance. Non-compliance leads to exemption cessation and permit consequences. A special law is deemed necessary due to unique circumstances at Bear Lake Reservoir. Recreational activities at Bear Lake Reservoir are allowed under certain conditions per Health and Safety Code. The Lake Alpine Water Company will maintain water treatment to ensure safe bodily contact. Information will be provided to the Legislature to prevent any impact on domestic water provision. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, as outlined in the Government Code and California Constitution."
