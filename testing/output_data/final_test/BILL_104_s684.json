    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research, Assistance, and Education Act of 1995\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Parkinson's disease affects 1,500,000 Americans, with 40% under 60 years old. The cause is unknown, but it involves degeneration of dopamine-producing cells, leading to tremors and loss of motor function. The disease eventually leaves individuals unable to care for themselves, causing strain on family and loved ones. Parkinson's disease imposes emotional, financial strain on families and society, costing nearly $6 billion annually. Federal research funding is inadequate, with only $26 million allocated for Parkinson's research. The Act aims to expand research, improve care for individuals and family caregivers. The Act aims to expand research on Parkinson's disease by amending the Public Health Service Act to include a new section dedicated to biomedical research on the disease. The Director of NIH will establish a program for research, training, and health information dissemination on Parkinson's disease. An Interagency Coordinating Committee will be formed to coordinate activities and federal health programs related to Parkinson's. The Interagency Coordinating Committee for Parkinson's disease will ensure the adequacy, effectiveness, and technical soundness of programs and activities related to the disease. It will be composed of directors of national research institutes, representatives from relevant federal departments, and individuals affected by the disease. The Coordinating Committee for Parkinson's disease, chaired by the Director of NIH, meets annually to report on activities and progress. Additionally, Core Center Grants are awarded by the Director of NIH to promote innovative research at Morris K. Udall Research Centers. Center Grants are awarded by the Director of NIH to support multidisciplinary research and training on Parkinson's disease. Each center funded under these grants is designated as a Morris K. Udall Center for Research on Parkinson's Disease and must meet specific requirements, including conducting basic and clinical research and providing patient care services. Each Morris K. Udall Center for Research on Parkinson's Disease funded by NIH conducts training programs for scientists and health professionals, provides information to health professionals and the public, and may develop a brain bank for research and treatment purposes. The NIH-funded Morris K. Udall Center for Research on Parkinson's Disease can provide stipends for scientists and health professionals in training programs for up to five years, with possible extensions. The Director of NIH will establish the National Parkinson's Disease Data System for data collection. The Director of NIH will establish the National Parkinson's Disease Data System and Information Clearinghouse to collect, store, analyze, and disseminate data on the disease. Additionally, a grant program will be created to support scientists in Parkinson's research. The Director of NIH will establish a national education program for Parkinson's disease to improve care and provide technical assistance. Grants will support researchers in Parkinson's research to encourage new investigators in the field. The Director of NIH will establish a national education program for Parkinson's disease and provide technical assistance to organizations supporting individuals with Parkinson's and their families. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1996, with additional funding for subsequent years to establish Morris K. Udall Centers."
