    "title": "SB 526",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19006 of the Revenue and Taxation Code states that spouses who control or receive community income are jointly liable for taxes on that income. When a joint return is filed, the tax liability is joint and several, but a court in a dissolution proceeding can determine individual responsibility for the tax liability. The order for tax liability revision must be served to the Franchise Tax Board to take effect. There are limitations on the effectiveness based on income and tax liability amounts, with annual adjustments starting in 2018. The court order for tax liability revision shall not relieve a spouse of tax liability if assets are transferred for tax avoidance or if the liability becomes uncollectible due to bankruptcy or nonresidency within three years. The court order allows for revision of tax liability for a nonresident spouse in a joint return, with exceptions for income under exclusive management. To relieve a spouse of liability below the amount actually paid on the liability prior to the granting of relief, including credit from any other taxable year available for application to the liability. The liability may be revised only if the spouse establishes they did not know of, and had no reason to know of, the nonpayment at the time the return was filed. \"Reason to know\" means whether a reasonably prudent person would have had reason to know of the nonpayment. The Franchise Tax Board will determine if liability should be revised for one spouse based on the circumstances surrounding the nonpayment. The decision will become final after 30 days unless appealed. This provision applies to all taxable years except those closed by statute of limitations or other legal means. The determination of income attribution to a spouse is not affected by community property laws. Amendments to this section apply to court orders served after the effective date of the act."
