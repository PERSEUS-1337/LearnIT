    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act.\" It includes findings related to the protection of endangered salmon and fisheries. Congress finds that there are 13 groups of salmon and steelhead listed as threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act that migrate through the lower Columbia River, including Chinook, Chum, and Coho salmon and winter-run steelhead. The people of the Northwest are united in their desire to restore healthy salmon and steelhead runs due to their cultural and economic importance. The Columbia River Treaty tribes retain important rights with respect to these species, and billions of dollars have been spent by governments to assist in their recovery in the Columbia River basin. The population of California sea lions has increased significantly in the last 30 years, with approximately 300,000 animals as of June 2017. During peak spring salmonid runs, up to 3,000 sea lions have been foraging in the lower Columbia River. This increased predation by sea lions is negatively impacting salmonid populations in the Columbia River basin. The predation of California sea lions at the Bonneville Dam has increased significantly since 2002, with sea lions consuming a significant portion of the Columbia River spring chinook and Willamette River steelhead runs. Sea lions have been congregating near the dam and entering fish ladders, impacting the salmon populations. The Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994 have not effectively addressed the predatory behavior of California sea lions impacting threatened salmon runs near the Bonneville Dam. Management efforts to reduce sea lion predation have been insufficient, with a need to focus more on the lower Columbia River and Willamette Falls areas according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In order to protect threatened and endangered salmonids in the Columbia River and its tributaries, there is an urgent need for a temporary expedited procedure to remove California sea lions. The sense of Congress is that preventing sea lion predation on salmonids in the Columbia River, recovering threatened and endangered salmonid species, and avoiding future listings of fish species under the Endangered Species Act are crucial priorities. The Federal Government should continue funding measures, both lethal and nonlethal, to prevent such predation. Additionally, there is a need to take action to protect endangered and threatened salmon and other nonlisted fish species in the Columbia River and its tributaries by removing California sea lions. Section 120(f) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to grant temporary removal authority for marine mammals on the Columbia River and its tributaries to specific eligible entities, including states and tribes in the region. The Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to grant removal authority for specific eligible entities, including states and tribes in the region, to lethally take individually identifiable sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries. The Marine Mammal Protection Act is amended to allow eligible entities to lethally remove individually identifiable sea lions in the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered salmon species. Eligible entities can apply for a permit from the Secretary, who must approve or deny the application within 30 days. The permit issued under the amended Marine Mammal Protection Act is effective for up to 1 year and can be renewed by the Secretary. The permit limits the lethal taking of sea lions to 100 during the permit period, with an annual limit of 10 percent of the total sea lion population. The permit issued under the Marine Mammal Protection Act allows for lethal removal of sea lions, with a limit of 10 percent of the population. Permit holders must be trained in natural resource management, and permit authority can be delegated to other entities. The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to permits issued under this subsection for 5 years. The Secretary may suspend permits for lethal removal of sea lions if, within 5 years of the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, it is deemed unnecessary to protect fish species from sea lion predation. SEC. 5. Treaty rights of Indian tribes are not affected or modified by this Act or its amendments."
