    "content": "The 108th Congress did not reauthorize the TANF block grant, leading to short-term funding extensions. The House passed H.R. 4 in February 2003, but the Senate did not take final action. Welfare reauthorization is expected to be addressed in the 109th Congress. The differences between the House-passed and Senate Finance Committee-approved versions of welfare reauthorization legislation in the 108th Congress were highlighted by contentious issues. The Senate approved an amendment adding $6 billion over five years for child care funding. Both bills extended basic funding at current levels through FY2008 and included President Bush's proposal for categorical \"marriage promotion\" grants. They also raised TANF work participation standards, with differences in requirements and activities counting towards participation standards. The report compares the TANF provisions of H.R. 4 as passed by the House and reported from the Senate Finance Committee. It focuses on funding differences, with the Senate bill revamping TANF contingency funds while the House bill makes minor revisions. The 1996 welfare reform law established basic TANF block grants based on pre-1996 welfare program expenditures. During FY1992 to FY1995, a maintenance of effort requirement was established for states to spend at least 75% (80% if work participation requirements were not met) of their FY1994 welfare program expenditures. The basic TANF grant and MOE remained fixed without adjustments for inflation or changes in caseloads. Proposed legislation would have continued funding levels through FY2008 without adjustments. Supplemental grants were provided to 17 states in FY2003, totaling $319 million. These grants were given to states with high population growth or historically low grant levels. The House-passed and Senate Finance Committee bills aimed to continue these grants for the same states through FY2007. The TANF program includes a contingency fund to provide extra matching grants to states in need during economic downturns. The House and Senate bills differed in their revisions to the fund, with the House bill making minor modifications and the Senate bill fully revamping it. The TANF program's contingency fund was revised in the Senate Finance Committee bill to base grants on estimated cash assistance caseloads and set a threshold for unspent balances. Federal TANF grants can be used for various benefits and services to assist low-income families and promote TANF goals. Up to 30% of the grant can be transferred to the Child Care and Development Fund. Up to 30% of the TANF grant can be transferred to the Child Care and Development Fund and the Social Services Block Grant, with a limit of 4.25% for SSBG transfers. The House bill proposed raising the overall transfer limit to 50%, while the Senate Finance Committee bill would have kept it at 30%. Both bills aimed to ease rules on TANF fund usage, allowing states to use carryover funds for any TANF benefit and service. The House-passed and Senate Finance Committee bills aimed to revise TANF work participation requirements, raising the states' work participation rates from 50% to 70%. They also sought to exclude child care and transportation aid from the definition of \"assistance,\" freeing nonworking families from certain program requirements. The House-passed and Senate Finance Committee bills aimed to revise TANF work participation requirements by raising the states' rates from 50% to 70%. They also included the \"universal engagement\" proposal and required states to develop self-sufficiency plans for all TANF adult recipients. The House bill additionally mandated ending benefits for families not complying with work rules. The participation rate standards for TANF work activities may be reduced for caseload reduction, affecting the standard considerably. In FY2002, the standard was reduced to 0% for 21 states. Both the House-passed and Senate Finance Committee bills aimed to raise the work participation standard for all families to 70% by FY2008 and eliminate the separate standard for two-parent families. They also proposed revisions to credits that reduce these standards. The House-passed bill revised the caseload reduction credit to measure change from a more recent year, with an additional credit for states achieving a 60% reduction from FY1995 to FY2001. The Senate Finance Committee bill proposed replacing the caseload reduction credit with a credit for employed welfare leavers starting in FY2006. Credits against the participation standard would have been capped, with minimum rates increasing each year from FY2004 to FY2008. The House-passed and Senate Finance Committee bills raised the hours standards for families to qualify as participating in welfare programs. The House bill set a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, with partial credit for 24 hours of participation. The Senate bill allowed single parents with preschoolers to receive full credit at 24 hours per week. The House bill set a 40-hour workweek standard for full credit, with partial credit for 24 hours of participation. Single parent families would have been given full credit at 34 hours per week, and partial credit at 20 hours per week. Higher hours requirements would apply to two-parent families. Current law lists 12 activities that may be counted toward TANF work participation standards, with a focus on core activities such as work, job search, vocational training, and community service. Educational activities are countable only for families participating in at least 20 hours per week of core activities. The House bill proposed changes to TANF work participation standards by narrowing the definition of \"core\" activities and setting a 24-hour per week participation requirement. Job search and vocational training were removed from the list of countable activities, with states allowed to define activities for a limited period. Educational activities were only countable for families participating in at least 20 hours per week of core activities. The Senate Finance Committee bill proposed changes to TANF work participation standards by allowing states to determine activities for recipients, including job search and vocational training as \"core\" activities. Additional activities could be allowed for three months in a 24-month period, with options for rehabilitation activities. The Senate Finance Committee bill proposed changes to TANF work participation standards, allowing states to include job search and vocational training as core activities without time limits. States could also enroll up to 10% of their caseload in a special program for undergraduate education or vocational training. This program is based on the \"Parents as Scholars\" program in Maine. TANF funds can be used for activities promoting marriage and two-parent families. Both the House-passed and Senate Finance Committee versions of H.R. 4 proposed marriage promotion grants using TANF funds. They included $100 million for competitive matching funds for states, territories, and tribes. States could use other federal TANF funds or state funds as a match. Additional funds were allocated for research and demonstrations, with the House bill emphasizing marriage promotion and the Senate bill requiring 80% of funds for marriage promotion activities such as advertising campaigns and education on marriage values. The House-passed and Senate Finance Committee versions of H.R. 4 proposed marriage promotion grants using TANF funds, allocating $100 million for competitive matching funds for states, territories, and tribes. Additional funds were designated for research and demonstrations, with a focus on marriage promotion activities such as education on marriage values and advertising campaigns. Both bills included language on consulting organizations familiar with domestic violence issues and clarifying that marriage promotion activities are voluntary. The House-passed and Senate Finance Committee versions of H.R. 4 proposed amendments to TANF provisions, including state plans, data reporting, tribal TANF programs, and other provisions. A detailed bill comparison table is provided. The amendments to the Child Care and Development Fund, child support enforcement, abstinence education program, and transitional Medicaid are not addressed. The comparison table shows references to current law provisions in the Social Security Act and section numbers in each bill. The Senate Finance Committee made amendments to TANF provisions in H.R. 4."
