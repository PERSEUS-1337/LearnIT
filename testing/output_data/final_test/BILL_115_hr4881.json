    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act of 2018\". Precision agriculture technologies enable farmers to increase crop yields, reduce input costs, and automate field management. Studies show that these technologies can decrease operational costs by $25 per acre and boost farm yields by 70% by 2050. Reliable broadband Internet access is crucial for realizing the cost savings and productivity benefits of precision agriculture. The deployment of broadband Internet access service to unserved agricultural land in the United States is crucial for the economy and global food production. Despite growing demand, broadband access is not consistently available where needed for agricultural operations. The Federal Communications Commission plays a vital role in promoting precision agriculture through the deployment of broadband Internet access service on unserved agricultural land. The task force is established to promote precision agriculture by deploying broadband Internet access service to unserved agricultural land in the United States. In this section, \"broadband Internet access service\" is defined as a mass-market retail service that transmits data to and from all or most Internet endpoints. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Communications Commission, and \"Department\" refers to the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture is defined as the Department, the Secretary as the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Task Force as the Task Force for Reviewing the Connectivity and Technology Needs of Precision Agriculture in the United States. The Commission is tasked with establishing the Task Force within a year of the Act's enactment. The Task Force will collaborate with stakeholders to identify and measure gaps in connectivity and technology in agriculture. The Task Force aims to identify gaps in broadband Internet access on agricultural land, develop policy recommendations for expanded deployment by 2025, promote adoption of broadband on farms, and suggest new rules for the Commission. The Task Force aims to recommend specific steps for the Commission to obtain reliable data on broadband availability for unserved agricultural land and ensure expertise from the Secretary and farm data are considered in future programs. The Task Force recommends steps for the Commission to gather accurate broadband data for unserved agricultural land and incorporate expertise from the Secretary and farm data into future programs without requiring duplicate reporting. The Task Force recommends utilizing the expertise and resources of the Department to identify agricultural areas for broadband development. The Secretary and the Commission are required to submit a list of available federal programs and resources to the Task Force within 180 days. The Task Force, composed of up to 15 members, will identify federal programs for expanding broadband on unserved agricultural land. Members include agricultural producers from diverse regions and farm sizes. The Task Force, consisting of up to 15 members, will include representatives from various sectors such as tribal agriculture, Internet service providers, electric cooperatives, satellite industry, and precision agriculture equipment manufacturers. The Task Force, with up to 15 members, will include representatives from drone manufacturers, autonomous agricultural machinery manufacturers, farming robotics technologies, State and local governments, and experts in broadband network data collection and geospatial analysis. The Task Force aims to be balanced in terms of technologies, points of view, and fields represented. The Task Force appointed members serve for a single 2-year term, vacancies do not affect its powers and are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Secretary serves as an ex-officio, nonvoting member. The Task Force must submit annual reports detailing its activities. The Task Force appointed by the Chairman receives a report every 2 years until it terminates on January 1, 2025. The report includes details on broadband Internet access coverage on agricultural land, future connectivity needs of farmers, and steps to measure availability accurately. No additional funds are authorized for this Act, and it will be carried out using existing authorized amounts."
