The U.S. is the largest donor for global HIV/AIDS efforts, but international funding has started to level off. HIV is an infectious disease that leads to AIDS, damaging human immune cells. HIV is an infectious disease that damages human immune cells, leading to AIDS if left untreated. It is primarily spread through unprotected sexual intercourse, needle sharing, and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. High-risk groups include sex workers, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users. Prevalence measures the number of people living with HIV, with over 60 million infected since the beginning of the epidemic. In 2010, an estimated 34 million people were living with HIV, with women accounting for 50% of all adults with the virus. The number of new HIV infections peaked in 1996 at 3.5 million and has since decreased by more than 25% in 33 countries. In 2010, 2.7 million people contracted HIV, including 390,000 children under 15. HIV remains a leading cause of death globally, with 1.8 million AIDS-related deaths in 2010, including 250,000 children. In 2010, an estimated 1.2 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa died from AIDS, with the region accounting for 68% of all people living with HIV worldwide. Southern Africa has the highest HIV prevalence rates, with Swaziland having the world's highest prevalence rate at 25.9% and South Africa having the largest population with HIV at 5.6 million. In 2010, an estimated 4.8 million people were living with HIV in Asia, with 360,000 new infections. The region saw approximately 310,000 AIDS-related deaths, the highest outside of sub-Saharan Africa. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 1.7 million people were living with HIV, with 112,000 new infections. The epidemic in Latin America has stabilized, while rates of new infections and AIDS-related deaths in the Caribbean have slowed. Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) has experienced the largest regional increase in HIV cases. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), HIV prevalence has significantly increased, particularly in Russia and Ukraine. The number of people living with HIV in the region has risen by 250% since 2001, reaching 1.5 million in 2010. AIDS-related deaths have also grown, totaling 83,000 in 2010. The use of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) has helped lower AIDS-related deaths globally, with ART coverage increasing from 7% in 2003 to 47% in 2010. Access to ART has extended the lifespan of infected individuals, leading to higher HIV prevalence but also reducing transmission risks. Care activities for individuals infected and affected by HIV/AIDS include support for ART adherence, treatment of opportunistic infections, nutritional counseling, mental health services, prevention education, and livelihood activities. Prevention efforts include male circumcision, PMTCT, behavior change programs, HIV testing, blood supply safety programs, harm reduction programs, and increased provision of antiretroviral therapy to reduce transmission risks. Prevention research has shown progress in developing new prevention technologies. In 2010 and 2011, progress was made in developing new prevention technologies for HIV/AIDS. Antiretroviral therapy has shown significant preventive benefits, reducing transmission by at least 96% in couples with one infected partner. Efforts are also underway to develop HIV preventive vaccines and microbicides. A study in South Africa in 2010 funded by the United States found that a microbicide was 39% effective in reducing a woman's risk of contracting HIV during sex. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 27, 2003. The HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act, P.L. 108-25) authorized $15 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 through FY2008. It created the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) at the Department of State to oversee bilateral HIV/AIDS activities and funding. Congress recommended specific distributions of funds for palliative care, prevention efforts, AIDS treatment, abstinence-until-marriage programs, and orphans. The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 authorized $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts from FY2008 through FY2013, including $2 billion for the Global Fund in FY2008. Congress removed recommendations on fund allocations for prevention and abstinence-until-marriage programs. The Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 authorized $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts from FY2008 through FY2013. It required specific allocations for prevention activities, including abstinence-until-marriage programs, treatment and care of individuals infected with HIV/AIDS, and support for orphans and vulnerable children. The legislation will be up for reauthorization in FY2013. The Clinton Administration proposed the LIFE initiative to address HIV/AIDS in African countries and India. President George W. Bush later launched the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative and PEPFAR to combat global HIV/AIDS with a $15 billion budget over five years. PEPFAR replaced the previous initiatives. PEPFAR, established by President George W. Bush, significantly increased attention and funding for global HIV/AIDS. The majority of the $15 billion funds were concentrated in 15 focus countries, with $9 billion in 12 sub-Saharan African countries. PEPFAR also allocated $5 billion to research and bilateral programs, and $1 billion to the Global Fund. It represented the largest commitment by any country towards an international health issue and demonstrated that ART could be effectively provided in low-resource settings. President Barack Obama has committed to continued support for PEPFAR and announced the Global Health Initiative (GHI) in 2009, aiming for a more integrated and comprehensive U.S. response to global health issues. The GHI seeks to transition PEPFAR from an emergency plan to a sustainable approach to global HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR, a key component of the Global Health Initiative (GHI), aims to prevent new HIV infections, treat millions living with HIV/AIDS, care for vulnerable populations, and train healthcare workers. PEPFAR programs are overseen by OGAC at the State Department and implemented by various U.S. agencies, including USAID. The CDC's Global AIDS Program operates in 38 countries and four regional programs, assisting in implementing HIV/AIDS prevention programs, analyzing program impact, and building public health capacity. The NIH supports HIV/AIDS research and training in approximately 100 countries, focusing on prevention tools, mother-to-child transmission, and treatment approaches. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Department of Defense (DOD) play key roles in providing education, training, and ensuring the availability of safe and effective AIDS treatment in various countries. FDA supports an accelerated review process for antiretroviral drugs, including fixed dose combination drugs, for PEPFAR programs. DOD operates HIV/AIDS programs in 73 countries under PEPFAR. The Department of Defense (DOD) operates HIV/AIDS programs in 73 countries, supporting military-to-military prevention, treatment, and care efforts. DOD also provides HIV prevention assistance to non-military PEPFAR programs. The DOD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) manages DOD's programs for foreign militaries and oversees PEPFAR funds. The Peace Corps, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, and Congress play key roles in countering HIV/AIDS globally. Peace Corps volunteers support community-based efforts in over 66 countries, some projects receive direct PEPFAR funding. The DOC creates sector-specific strategies for private sector involvement, while the Census Bureau assists with data management and analysis for PEPFAR. Congress provides funds for global HIV/AIDS assistance through various appropriations vehicles. In FY2012, Congress appropriated over 85% of all global HIV/AIDS funds to the Department of State, which transfers funds to implementing agencies like USAID and CDC for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs. Some funds are also used to support organizations combating global HIV/AIDS, including the Global Fund. Congress also appropriates funds to USAID for bilateral HIV/AIDS activities through State-Foreign Operations appropriations. Congress appropriates funds for global HIV/AIDS activities through various appropriations, including Labor-HHS and Department of Defense. Funding for bilateral global HIV/AIDS programs has been decreasing since FY2010. The United States has been the largest donor to global HIV/AIDS programs, contributing to the Global Fund which supports grants for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. In 2010, U.S. funds accounted for over half of all donor government disbursements for global HIV/AIDS and 24% of global HIV/AIDS funds from all sources. Six European countries spend more than the United States on global HIV/AIDS when standardized to GDP per $1 million spent. The United States is the largest donor to global HIV/AIDS programs, contributing to the Global Fund which supports grants for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Six European countries spend more than the United States on global HIV/AIDS when standardized to GDP per $1 million spent. The funding gap for combating global HIV/AIDS is estimated to be $6 billion annually. The United States collaborates with various partners, including national governments, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and the private sector, to combat HIV/AIDS through authorizing legislation and annual appropriations. The Global Fund, established in 2002, is a public-private partnership that the United States contributes the most to, supporting global responses to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. The Global Fund has committed over $22.6 billion in grants in 150 countries since it was established, responsible for 21% of all international HIV funding in 2009. UNAIDS coordinates HIV/AIDS activities implemented by nine U.N. agencies, with the United States being one of the largest contributors. The United States is a major contributor to UNAIDS, overseeing various HIV/AIDS activities such as reducing transmission, ensuring access to ART, preventing death from HIV/TB co-infection, empowering marginalized groups, and addressing issues like sexual violence. The 112th Congress will need to address how much assistance to provide for global HIV/AIDS efforts. Experts believe that the U.S. response to HIV/AIDS will impact the global fight against the disease. The Congress may consider treatment issues in its response to global HIV/AIDS. The U.S. response to global HIV/AIDS includes addressing treatment and prevention efforts. Treatment programs face challenges in meeting the demand for ART, while prevention strategies are debated for their effectiveness and funding incentives for developing countries. Recent scientific evidence on the preventive benefits of ART and antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis may encourage leaders of developing countries to increase financial investment in prevention. Global health experts emphasize the importance of health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries for a long-term approach to addressing HIV/AIDS. Country ownership is also promoted as a way to enhance support and sustainability in prevention efforts. Donor governments support country ownership for sustainable responses to the epidemic. PEPFAR programs use Partnership Frameworks with partner countries to clarify goals. Debates include aligning donor and country priorities and maintaining oversight while shifting control."
