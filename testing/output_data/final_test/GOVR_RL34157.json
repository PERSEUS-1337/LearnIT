    "content": "The Caribbean region consists of 16 independent nations and 13 overseas territories with a population of almost 42 million people. It is known for its diversity, including 13 island nations, Belize in Central America, and Guyana and Suriname in South America. The largest nations in terms of land area are Guyana and Suriname, while Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti have the largest populations. The majority of the population is of African heritage. The Caribbean region has a diverse population, including descendants of African slaves, East Indian indentured servants, ethnic Chinese, Javanese, Spanish descent, mixed African-Spanish heritage, indigenous Arawak and Carib Indians, Amerindian tribes, and Garifuna population. The Caribbean region has a diverse population with various ethnicities, including descendants of African slaves, East Indian indentured servants, ethnic Chinese, Javanese, Spanish descent, mixed African-Spanish heritage, indigenous Arawak and Carib Indians, Amerindian tribes, and a small Garifuna population. The region has a diverse colonial history with countries having British, Spanish, French, and Dutch colonial heritage. There are 12 predominantly English-speaking nations in the region, with some countries also speaking other languages or dialects. Haiti has two official languages, Creole and French. Most Caribbean nations have elected democratic governments, except for communist Cuba. Most Caribbean nations have elected democratic governments, except for communist Cuba. The region gained full political independence in the second half of the 20th century, with various countries achieving independence in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Former British colonies mostly have parliamentary forms of government, while Guyana, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Suriname are republics. The region also includes 13 overseas territories. Free and fair elections are common in the Caribbean, except in Cuba and Haiti. In 2006, successful elections were held in Haiti, Guyana, and St. Lucia, leading to changes in government. In 2007, the Bahamas and Jamaica had elections with upcoming elections in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite democratic traditions, Caribbean nations face threats to political stability, as seen in a coup plot in Dominica in 1981. In Grenada, a socialist government led by Maurice Bishop was overthrown in a violent coup in 1983, prompting US intervention. Trinidad and Tobago faced a coup attempt in 1990 by a radical Muslim sect. St. Kitts experienced instability in 1993 after disputed elections. In 2007, a plot to blow up a fuel pipeline in New York was foiled, leading to arrests in Trinidad and Tobago. A foiled plot to blow up a fuel pipeline and tanks at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport led to arrests in the United States, focusing attention on the security threat of Muslim extremists from the Caribbean region. The Caribbean region consists of countries with varying levels of social development, with some classified as high income by the World Bank. Haiti has the lowest adult literacy rate and highest infant mortality rate in the Caribbean. In the Caribbean region, Cuba has the lowest infant mortality rate. The United Nations Development Program ranks countries based on human development index (HDI), with some Caribbean nations categorized as \"high development\" and others as \"medium development.\" Economic growth was experienced by all Caribbean nations in 2006 after a slump in 2001-2002. In 2006, Caribbean nations saw economic growth, with Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, and the Dominican Republic being strong performers. Grenada rebounded from a decline in 2004 due to Hurricane Ivan. Guyana and Haiti were the weakest performers, with modest growth in recent years. In 2005 and 2006, Caribbean nations experienced economic growth. 14 of the region's nations are part of CARICOM, formed in 1973 to promote regional integration. CARICOM established the Caribbean Court of Justice in 2005, but only Barbados and Guyana have accepted it as their final court of appeal. In 2006, 12 CARICOM nations signed an accord for a CARICOM Single Market to enhance regional economic integration. The Eastern Caribbean nations were enticed to join regional economic integration efforts with the establishment of a Development Fund and Agency for poorer countries. The goal is to achieve a CARICOM Single Market and Economy by 2008, including a single currency and harmonized economic policies. However, some governments are lagging in facilitating free movement of labor and capital. Trinidad and Tobago's Central Bank governor highlighted challenges in implementing a common monetary policy due to economic differences in the region. The Cricket World Cup in 2007 in nine Caribbean nations spurred some progress. In March and April 2007, regional integration efforts were boosted in the Caribbean, with the establishment of the Single Domestic Space by CARICOM. This initiative allowed visitors to travel to 10 English-speaking Caribbean countries with one visa. Additionally, six Eastern Caribbean nations are members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), promoting economic integration and sharing a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) in Barbados supports economic development and regional integration. Jamaica is set to hold parliamentary elections on September 3, 2007. On September 3, 2007, Jamaica is set to hold parliamentary elections postponed from August 27 due to Hurricane Dean. The ruling People's National Party (PNP) led by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller is competing against the opposition Jamaican Labour Party (JLP) led by Bruce Golding. Hurricane Dean caused damage in several Caribbean nations from August 17-19, with Jamaica being hard hit, causing flooding, road closures, power outages, and agricultural sector damage. U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica declared a disaster due to the hurricane. The U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica declared a disaster due to Hurricane Dean, and USAID provided $125,000 for emergency relief supplies. Caribbean leaders met with President Bush in Washington D.C. to discuss cooperation in various areas, including trade agreements. President Bush pledged to work with Congress to extend the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion Act. On June 2, 2007, four individuals were charged in a plot to attack John F. Kennedy International airport by planting explosives in the airport's fuel supply tanks. The plot involved an international network of Muslim extremists from the United States, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago. Three foreign nationals were arrested in Trinidad and Tobago. On June 9, 2007, flexibility in passport requirements for U.S. citizens traveling to the Caribbean, Canada, and Mexico was announced due to a backlog of passport applications. On January 23, 2007, a new passport policy was implemented in Mexico. Due to a backlog of applications, travelers could use a government-issued photo and proof of application to travel until September 2007. In May 2007, the Bahamas had parliamentary elections, with the opposition FNM winning over the ruling PLP. In July 2007, the US House passed H.R. 176 for educational exchange programs in the Caribbean. On July 24, 2007, the House Subcommittee held a hearing on U.S. deportees in Latin America and the Caribbean. On June 18, 2007, the House recognized National Caribbean-American Heritage Month. On June 15, 2007, the House passed a bill to delay the implementation of a passport requirement plan. The House passed a bill on June 11, 2007, recognizing and welcoming Caribbean leaders to Washington DC. U.S. interests in the Caribbean include economic, political, and security concerns. During the Cold War, security concerns focused on the Soviet Union and Cuba, but shifted to economic relations post-Cold War. Security concerns resurfaced after the September 2001 terrorist attacks. Since the September 2001 terrorist attacks, security concerns have become a major U.S. interest in the Caribbean. The region is seen as America's \"third border,\" with events there directly impacting U.S. homeland security. The U.S. has close relations with most Caribbean nations, except Cuba under Fidel Castro. The relationship is characterized by economic linkages, counternarcotics cooperation, security efforts, and foreign assistance programs supporting democracy, economic growth, poverty alleviation, and AIDS combat in the region. The Caribbean region has had preferential treatment for exports to the U.S. since the 1980s. U.S. efforts now focus on preparing for hemispheric free trade. Tensions have arisen at times, such as when CARICOM nations called for an investigation into the departure of Haitian President Aristide in 2004. Relations with Cuba and Venezuela are generally good, with some resentment towards U.S. expressions of concern. Many Caribbean nations participate in the PetroCaribe program with Venezuela, offering discounted oil. The United States has provided significant foreign assistance to the region, with aid declining in the 1990s. Haiti was the largest recipient of assistance during this period. During the 1990s, the United States provided significant foreign assistance to the Caribbean region, with Haiti being the largest recipient. Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and Eastern Caribbean nations also received substantial aid. The majority of the assistance was economic, with some military aid given. From FY2000 to FY2007, U.S. aid to the region totaled about $1.9 billion, with increases in HIV/AIDS assistance, disaster relief, and support for Haiti after political changes. Following President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's departure from power, Haiti received significant economic assistance in the 2000s. In FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007, the Caribbean region received a total of $393 million, $336 million, and an estimated $346 million respectively. In FY2008, the Bush Administration requested almost $367 million in assistance for the Caribbean, with a majority allocated to Haiti. Other countries like Grenada, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic also received assistance. In FY2008, the Caribbean region received $9.3 million in economic assistance, with Eastern Caribbean nations receiving additional funds for various programs. The Third Border Initiative funding declined and was incorporated into a Western Hemisphere Program. The House passed H.R. 176, the Shirley A. Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act of 2007. The States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act of 2007 was passed to provide assistance to Caribbean countries for educational development and exchange programs. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean is affecting economic and social development, with high HIV infection rates primarily through heterosexual contact. Countries like Belize, the Bahamas, Guyana, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago have infection rates between 2% and 4%, while Barbados, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname have rates between 1% and 2%. The response to the AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean America involves support from governments, donors, organizations, and NGOs. Many countries in the region have national HIV/AIDS programs funded by these efforts. U.S. government funding for HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean has significantly increased in recent years, reaching $70 million in FY2004. U.S. assistance for HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean increased from $36 million in FY2004 to $104 million in FY2007. The 110th Congress proposed adding 14 Caribbean countries for increased HIV/AIDS assistance. The 110th Congress proposed adding 14 Caribbean countries for increased HIV/AIDS assistance. H.Con.Res. 166 (Lee) aims to support National Caribbean American HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. Several Caribbean nations have been potential recipients for Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) assistance, with Haiti and Guyana being candidate countries since FY2004. Guyana was designated as an MCA \"threshold\" country in FY2005 and was set to receive $7.2 million in assistance in June 2007 to improve its fiscal policy for MCA eligibility. In FY2006 and FY2007, the per capita income level for MCA-eligibility increased, potentially making the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname eligible for MCA funding. However, they were not approved for participation. Some U.S. assistance to the Caribbean has been hindered by countries like Barbados, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago not signing Article 98 agreements with the International Criminal Court. Congress modified the American Servicemembers' Protection Act in 2006 to address this issue. In 2006, Congress modified ASPA through a provision in the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 109-364), which ended the ban on IMET; restrictions on FMF, however, remain in effect. Legislation has prohibited ESF assistance to countries that are parties to the ICC and have not signed Article 98 agreements, with provisions for presidential waiver. The Administration terminated military assistance to six Caribbean nations in July 2003 for not signing bilateral immunity agreements, with some countries subsequently signing Article 98 agreements. In May 2004, Barbados, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago were the only Caribbean countries not receiving U.S. military assistance due to ASPA sanctions. Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados have resisted signing agreements. Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago were excluded from Third Border Initiative projects for not signing Article 98 agreements. Several Caribbean nations were affected by hurricanes in 2004, with Hurricane Charley hitting Cuba, Hurricane Frances hitting the Bahamas, and Hurricane Ivan causing severe damage across the Caribbean. Hurricane Ivan caused severe damage across the Caribbean, devastating Grenada, Jamaica, and western Cuba. Tropical Storm Jeanne caused devastating mudslides and floods in northern Haiti in September 2004, resulting in the death of 3,000 people. The United States provided immediate humanitarian assistance to several Caribbean nations, including Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, and Cuba. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance set up Disaster Assistance Response Teams to respond to the storms. By October 2004, USAID had provided $23 million in emergency humanitarian assistance for Hurricane Ivan and Tropical Storm Jeanne. The 108th Congress allocated $100 million for longer-term reconstruction in the Caribbean, with $42 million for Grenada, $38 million for Haiti, $18 million for Jamaica, and $2 million for other affected countries. USAID's assistance in Grenada included restoring communities, schools, health centers, and businesses in two phases. The reconstruction program in Haiti and Jamaica had two phases. In Haiti, it involved community and rural revitalization, including road repair, disaster mitigation, and hillside stabilization. In Jamaica, the program focused on repairing infrastructure, revitalizing agriculture, and rebuilding homes and schools. The Caribbean nations received hurricane assistance programs for recovery, rehabilitation of schools, and business support. Some countries in the region are transit points for drug trafficking from South America to the U.S. and Europe. President Bush designated four Caribbean nations as major drug-producing or transit countries in 2006. The new government in Haiti is urged to strengthen law enforcement and the judiciary to combat drug trafficking and crime. Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic, are major transit points for illicit drugs to the U.S. market. Cooperation with the United States on counternarcotics measures is emphasized, with efforts to target drug trafficking organizations. Corruption and weak governmental institutions are noted as obstacles to controlling the flow of illegal narcotics in the Dominican Republic. The State Department report highlights the challenges faced by Caribbean nations in combating drug trafficking and associated crimes due to weak institutions, political instability, and corruption. Despite robust cooperation with the U.S. on counternarcotics efforts, governments struggle to address official corruption at various levels. The Preval government in Haiti faces difficulties in curbing violence by criminal elements involved in drug trafficking. Other Caribbean countries, while not major transit points, remain vulnerable to drug trafficking due to their geographic location. The State Department's March 2007 report highlights the threat of drug trafficking in the Eastern Caribbean, particularly in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Efforts to combat money laundering are crucial in the region, with six Caribbean countries listed as major concerns. The report also emphasizes the need to diversify economies away from banana production to address the issue effectively. The Caribbean countries of primary concern for money laundering include Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and St. Kitts and Nevis, along with the Cayman Islands. Antigua and Barbuda's financial sector is vulnerable due to loose regulation and its Internet gaming industry. The Bahamas has strong anti-money laundering laws, forcing drug traffickers to find alternative ways to store cash. In Belize, money laundering is a significant issue. Money laundering in Belize is believed to occur primarily in the country's offshore financial center. In the Dominican Republic, financial institutions engage in transactions with money from illegal drug sales in the United States. St. Kitts and Nevis are at major risk for corruption and money laundering due to the high volume of narcotics trafficked through the country. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering has identified non-cooperative countries and territories in the fight against money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has been evaluating countries' anti-money laundering efforts since 2000. Initially, four Caribbean nations and one dependent territory were on the non-cooperative list, but they were all removed by June 2003 after taking actions to improve their regimes. The FATF continues to monitor these countries for compliance even after removal from the list. Some Caribbean officials and others believe that pressure to strengthen anti-money laundering regimes in the region has negatively impacted offshore financial sectors. Concerns arose after the passage of new anti-money laundering provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act, fearing stricter scrutiny on transactions with Caribbean financial institutions could harm the offshore financial industry in the region. The strengthening of anti-money laundering regimes in the Caribbean includes a prohibition on U.S. correspondent accounts with shell banks and tighter bank record-keeping requirements. Efforts such as the FATF evaluative process and the PATRIOT Act aim to change the region's reputation as a haven for money launderers and tax evaders. Legislation in the 110th Congress, like S. 396 (Dorgan), would restrict the use of offshore tax havens and tax shelters to avoid U.S. Federal taxation. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, S. 681 (Levin) and H.R. 2136 (Doggett), aims to restrict the use of offshore tax havens and tax shelters to avoid Federal taxation. Caribbean nations, including Anguilla, Bahamas, and Cayman Islands, are listed as \"offshore secrecy jurisdictions\" and have objected to the legislation, claiming compliance with international transparency requirements. According to the OECD, 17 Caribbean tax havens are committed to improving transparency and are not on the OECD's list of uncooperative tax havens. Barbados was removed from the list in 2000 due to its information exchange arrangements. Antigua and Barbuda filed a WTO complaint against the US over restrictions on Internet gambling. In April 2005, the WTO ruled that US restrictions on Internet gambling were inconsistent with market access commitments under GATS. The US could justify them under the public morals exception but was not in full compliance due to possible discriminatory treatment of foreign service suppliers in horseracing. Antigua filed a complaint, leading to a compliance panel ruling in their favor in March 2007. In response, the US announced modifications to its GATS commitments in May 2007. The United States modified its commitments under the GATS to exclude market access commitments on gambling services, leading to demands for compensation from Antigua and Barbuda, the European Union, Japan, India, Costa Rica, Macao, Canada, and Australia. Antigua and Barbuda sought WTO authorization to impose $3.4 billion in annual trade sanctions on the US for not complying with a 2005 WTO ruling on cross-border Internet gambling. An arbitration panel was set up to address the issue, with Antigua seeking a negotiated solution. CARICOM officials have expressed concerns about the situation. CARICOM officials want a negotiated solution in the gambling case, urging the United States to collaborate with Antigua and Barbuda. The United States has offered duty-free trade arrangements for Caribbean Basin nations since the 1980s under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). In the late 1980s, apparel imports from CBERA countries assembled from U.S. components became eligible for reduced duties, boosting the apparel sectors of Caribbean Basin countries. Congress enacted CBI II legislation in 1990, enhancing the benefits of CBERA. The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) was approved in 2000, expanding preferential tariff treatment for Caribbean Basin nations, similar to NAFTA, including preferential treatment for petroleum products and qualifying textile exports to the U.S. The CBTPA program provides preferential treatment for petroleum products and qualifying textile and apparel products to eligible countries. Criteria include WTO obligations, intellectual property rights, worker rights, child labor, counternarcotics, anti-corruption, and transparency efforts. Seven Caribbean countries currently participate in the program: Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago. Benefits are set to expire in September 2008 or earlier if a country enters into a free trade agreement with the United States. The Dominican Republic traded its benefits under both the CBERA and CBTPA for a reciprocal free trade agreement with the US in 2007. The Caribbean countries benefit from various trade programs like CBERA, CBTPA, and HOPE Act. The Dominican Republic has seen significant growth in its apparel sector due to preferential trade agreements with the United States. The Caribbean countries, particularly the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago, have significantly increased their exports to the United States through trade programs like CBERA, CBTPA, and HOPE Act. While some nations like Haiti and the Bahamas have seen a decline in exports, others have benefited greatly from production-sharing arrangements. The region's economy is largely service-based, with tourism and financial services being key sectors. The U.S. trade preferences have not had a significant economic impact on the Caribbean countries, with leading sectors being tourism and financial services. U.S. exports to the region increased from $8.9 billion in 2001 to $14.2 billion in 2006, with the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, and the Bahamas being major destinations. The United States had a trade deficit of almost $700 million with the Caribbean in 2006, mainly due to natural gas imports from Trinidad and Tobago. Most Caribbean nations, except Cuba, are participating in FTAA negotiations. Cuba is involved in FTAA negotiations, which have been stalled since 2004. Caribbean nations in CARICOM have reservations about the FTAA's impact, advocating for special treatment for small economies. CARICOM proposes a Regional Integration Fund to support smaller economies. U.S. and CARICOM officials discussed a possible free trade agreement in 2006. Negotiations for a free trade agreement with Caribbean nations include discussions on transition periods and revitalizing a Trade and Investment Council. The impending expiration of the CBTPA program in 2008 is a key issue. President Bush pledged to extend and update the CBPTA during a meeting with Caribbean leaders. The \"Third Border Initiative\" aims to deepen cooperation in various areas. The \"Third Border Initiative\" (TBI) aimed to enhance cooperation in fighting HIV/AIDS, responding to natural disasters, and ensuring benefits of globalization reach small economies in the Caribbean. It addressed issues like illegal drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, and financial crime that threaten U.S. and regional security interests. The initiative included programs for diplomatic, economic, health, education, and law enforcement cooperation, with increased funding to combat HIV/AIDS. Post-9/11, it expanded to focus on U.S. homeland security issues like administration of justice and security, using Economic Support Funds (ESF) to help modernize Caribbean airports for safety. The Third Border Initiative (TBI) has used Economic Support Funds (ESF) to help Caribbean airports modernize safety and security regulations. Funding has also supported border security, economic competitiveness, environmental management, and security preparations for events like the Cricket World Cup. Recent funding amounts include $8.9 million in FY2005, almost $3 million in FY2006, and a request of $3 million for FY2007. The TBI has now been incorporated into a larger Western Hemisphere Regional Program with $1.75 million in ESF for various cooperation activities. Caribbean nations receive $1.1 million in humanitarian assistance for disaster preparedness through the Third Border Initiative program. In 2004, Caribbean nations signed a joint declaration with the United States supporting the TBI program for cooperation in various areas. In 2007, individuals were charged with conspiring to blow up fuel tanks at JFK International Airport. Russell Defreitas, a former airport cargo worker at JFK, along with Abdul Kadir, Abdel Nur, and Kareen Ibrahim, were arrested for conspiring to blow up fuel tanks and a fuel pipeline at JFK International Airport. The plot involved an international network of Muslim extremists from the United States, Guyana, and Trinidad, with connections to radical groups in South America and the Caribbean. Cooperation from various countries was praised by U.S. officials in thwarting the terrorist plot. The failed plot to blow up fuel tanks at JFK involved an international network of Muslim extremists from the US, Guyana, and Trinidad. Cooperation from these countries was crucial in thwarting the plot. The presence of radical individuals in the Caribbean raises security concerns, but experts argue there is little evidence of widespread radicalization in the region. The United States has provided support to improve port security in the Caribbean region to comply with the ISPS Code, aimed at preventing terrorist incidents. Concern exists among Caribbean nations about the high cost of implementing these security regulations, with larger countries better equipped to afford them than smaller, poorer nations. The U.S. Coast Guard conducts foreign port security assessments to ensure compliance. The U.S. Coast Guard conducts foreign port security assessments to ensure compliance with ISPS standards. Trade sanctions are an option for non-compliant ports. Most Caribbean nations have reported compliance with ISPS Code, but some ports need improvements. U.S. agencies, including MARAD, support Caribbean nations in meeting ISPS Code requirements. The U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) in the Department of Transportation implements the Inter-American Port Security Training Program (IAPSTP) for the Organization of American States. Funding from the State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs supports port security improvements in Western Hemisphere countries. USAID has funded projects for Eastern Caribbean nations to assess port security requirements and compliance with ISPS Code. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) by U.S. Customs and Border Protection helps identify and inspect high-risk containers at foreign ports before shipment to the U.S. In September 2006, three Caribbean ports - Caucedo, Dominican Republic; Kingston, Jamaica; and Freeport, Bahamas - became operational CSI ports. These ports are also part of the Megaports Initiative to detect nuclear or radioactive materials. Jamaica and the Bahamas have concerns about new U.S. passport requirements affecting tourism. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 implemented the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, requiring U.S. citizens traveling by air to the Caribbean, Canada, and Mexico to have passports starting January 23, 2007. Due to passport application backlogs, a temporary flexibility policy was announced in June 2007 allowing travelers with proof of application to use government-issued photo ID. The Caribbean tourism industry expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of the passport requirement on their economies. The passport requirement for U.S. citizens traveling to the Caribbean could have a negative impact on tourism. Reports show declines in tourists visiting Jamaica and other islands. An exemption for cruise ship travel may help mitigate the effects. Proposed rules were published in June 2007, stating that passports may not be required for U.S. citizens on round trip cruises starting and ending in the same U.S. port. In the 110th Congress, provisions were made to delay the implementation of passport requirements for U.S. citizens traveling on round trip cruises starting and ending in the same U.S. port until June 1, 2009. The Bush Administration opposed these provisions. The Bush Administration opposed delaying the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative to June 2009. High rates of violent crime, including murder and kidnapping, are a major concern in the Caribbean, with Jamaica having the highest murder rate in 2006. The region has the highest murder rate per capita compared to other regions in the world. The UN/World Bank study identified transit of illicit drugs through the Caribbean as a major factor contributing to high crime rates in the region. It suggested a shift towards prevention, community policing, and youth services, along with limited firearm availability. U.S. deportations to Latin American and Caribbean countries constitute the majority of worldwide deportations. In FY2006, almost 95% of the 197,000 aliens deported worldwide went to Latin American and Caribbean countries. Legislation in 1996 increased deportations to the region, with over 188,000 deported in FY2006. 45% of those deported had criminal convictions. In FY2006, the number of U.S. deportations to Caribbean countries increased significantly, with over 188,000 deported. The Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Haiti were the major recipients, with a large percentage deported on criminal grounds. Other small English-speaking Caribbean nations also received deportees on a per capita basis. The deportation of Caribbean citizens from the United States on criminal grounds has been a contentious issue for years. In FY2006, over 5,300 criminal deportations to the Caribbean occurred, with concerns about social stigma and re-offender rates. Despite a decrease to about 4,500 deportations in FY2006, the issue remains significant. Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago have low re-offender rates among criminal deportees, but stigma remains a major issue for deportees in Caribbean countries. Officials often blame deportees for the rise in crime, while foreign diplomats and U.N. police force officials dispute this, attributing crime to powerful street gangs instead. Haiti's powerful street gangs are responsible for crime, while in Jamaica, government officials link criminal deportees to rising homicide rates. Jamaican politicians argue that deportees learned criminal behavior in the US, but criminologist Bernard Headley believes most are not hardened criminals. Caribbean officials urge the US to provide better information on deportees with criminal records and establish a Deportee Databank for the region. Caribbean officials have called on the United States to reconsider deporting long-term permanent residents, emphasizing the need for reintegration assistance for returning nationals. Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller has urged for international support in rehabilitation and effective monitoring. A U.N.-World Bank study suggests that assisting reintegration efforts for deported offenders in the Caribbean could help promote development and weaken criminal networks. Improved coordination and information sharing are recommended. The study recommended improved coordination and information sharing on criminal deportees by sending countries; robust research on the contribution of deportees to crime; and the financing of deportee reintegration programs. CARICOM issued a report in 2002 recommending member states establish offices for the resettlement of deportees, providing temporary employment, housing, and other services. Several countries in the region have established such offices, like Trinidad and Tobago's Social Displacement Unit. In 2006, the United States indirectly funded a $1 million pilot project in Haiti for deportee reintegration. The United Nations Development Program and International Organization for Migration established a Haitian government program for deportees in 2007, offering counseling, HIV/AIDS testing, drug rehabilitation, skills training, and micro-enterprise support. The program aims to serve as a model for reintegration programs in other CARICOM countries. Concerns in the Caribbean region include the impact of rising oil prices on economic growth and social stability, with only Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, and Suriname having significant oil and gas reserves. Trinidad and Tobago is a major oil and gas producer with significant gas reserves. It is the largest supplier of LNG to the United States. Cuba produces oil but still imports most of its consumption needs. Suriname and Barbados also produce oil, with Barbados importing 90% of its needs. Venezuela is offering oil to Caribbean nations on preferential terms. Venezuela is offering oil to Caribbean nations on preferential terms through the PetroCaribe program, raising U.S. concerns about increased influence in the region. The program aims to establish a regional supply network and a development fund, providing 190,000 barrels per day at favorable rates. Cuba is a major beneficiary, receiving 90,000 barrels per day. Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica are major beneficiaries of PetroCaribe, receiving 90,000, 40-45,000, and 23,500 barrels per day respectively. Fourteen Caribbean nations are part of the program, which aims to establish a regional supply network and development fund. Trinidad and Barbados have declined to sign the agreement due to concerns about dependency on Venezuelan oil. Trinidad's state-owned oil company is seeking new markets outside the Caribbean. Trinidad's state-owned oil company is seeking new oil markets outside the Caribbean to replace those lost to Venezuela due to PetroCaribe. Trinidad has increased energy cooperation with Venezuela, signing agreements for joint development of offshore gas blocks. Prime Minister Patrick Manning proposes processing gas in Trinidad and building a second oil refinery with Brazil and Venezuela. Developing biofuels like ethanol could reduce Caribbean countries' oil dependence. In March 2007, the US and Brazil signed an agreement. In March 2007, the United States and Brazil signed an agreement to promote cooperation on ethanol to reduce Caribbean countries' oil dependence. Brazil also signed agreements with Jamaica to modernize their sugar and ethanol sectors. Additionally, there were resolutions passed in the House recognizing National Caribbean-American Heritage Month and welcoming Caribbean leaders to Washington DC. The United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act of 2007, introduced in January 2007, aims to provide assistance to Caribbean countries for educational development and exchange programs. S. 1007 (Lugar) focuses on energy security through biofuels development with Brazil and other Western Hemisphere countries. S. 1106 (Thune) extends ethanol duty and investigates imports from Caribbean Basin countries. H.R. 848 (Fortu\u00f1o) is also mentioned. H.R. 848 (Fortu\u00f1o) introduced in February 2007, would authorize assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in certain Caribbean countries. Additionally, there are resolutions supporting Caribbean American HIV/AIDS Awareness Day and the First Summit of Caribbean Ministers of Health. H.Con.Res. 16 (Lee) congratulates Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller of Jamaica. The FY2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act includes provisions to delay passport requirements until June 1, 2009. The House passed a provision prohibiting funds for implementing a passport requirement plan. The Bush Administration opposes delaying the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative to June 2009. H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for FY2008, passed by the House, includes provisions for citizens. Section 1124(a) of the House-passed bill exempts US and Canadian citizens under 16 from presenting a passport when entering the US from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or the Caribbean. H.R. 1061 directs a pilot program to enhance state driver's licenses for land and sea travel passport requirements.
