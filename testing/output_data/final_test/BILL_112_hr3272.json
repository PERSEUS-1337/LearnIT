    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2011\" and it amends definitions related to the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 is amended to establish the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, aimed at reducing losses from windstorms through a coordinated federal effort with other levels of government, academia, and the private sector. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for planning and coordinating the program. The Director of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program is responsible for ensuring necessary components for windstorm risk reduction, supporting development of engineering tools, and requesting assistance from Federal agencies. The Director of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program can request assistance from Federal agencies, coordinate post-windstorm investigations, issue recommendations for model codes, and provide information to Congress. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is responsible for research and development to improve building codes and standards. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program sets standards for building design and construction. The National Science Foundation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Federal Emergency Management Agency support research and development to understand windstorms' impact and develop mitigation techniques. The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program establishes standards for building design and construction. It includes risk assessment tools, windstorm-related data analysis, public outreach, and the implementation of mitigation measures. An Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction is established, chaired by the Director and composed of heads of relevant agencies. The Interagency Coordinating Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, chaired by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, includes key federal agencies such as FEMA, NOAA, NSF, OSTP, and OMB. The Committee meets at least twice a year to oversee the planning and coordination of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. The Committee will develop and submit a Strategic Plan to Congress within one year of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2011. The plan will include prioritized goals, research objectives, agency roles, progress assessment methods, and research result transfer methods. The Committee will submit a progress report to Congress 18 months after the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2011. The report will detail funded activities, outcomes achieved, and any recommendations made for the Program. The Committee will develop a coordinated budget for the Program and submit it to Congress annually. Subsections (e) and (f) will be removed. SEC. 4. NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON WINDSTORM IMPACT REDUCTION. Section 205 of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 is amended to establish the National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish an Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction, composed of at least 7 members from various sectors. The Committee will provide assessments on trends in windstorm impact mitigation practices. The Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction will focus on engineering sciences, the Program's Strategic Plan priorities, coordination, and necessary revisions. Members will serve without compensation and report to the Director every 2 years with recommendations for Program improvement. The Committee is not required to file a charter after the initial one and will terminate at a specified date. The Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction will terminate on September 30, 2014. Section 207 of the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 is amended to authorize appropriations. Authorized appropriations for various agencies under the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act of 2004 include $4,000,000 for FEMA, $9,400,000 for NSF, and $5,300,000 for NIST for fiscal years 2012-2014. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized $2,700,000 for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014."
