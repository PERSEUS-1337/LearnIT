    "content": "The illicit production of methamphetamine has led to hazardous manufacturing wastes spreading nationwide, prompting the need for cleaning and remediating contaminated sites. \"Clean-up\" involves removing large contaminants for criminal investigations and hazard reduction, while \"remediation\" focuses on removing small-scale contaminants to rehabilitate facilities. The most common way to make meth involves using over-the-counter medications with pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, and cooking with various chemicals like acetone, hydrochloric acid, and ammonia. This process can be dangerous, causing eye and respiratory irritations, burns, explosions, and toxic waste. Emergency responders and law enforcement personnel can also suffer injuries from exposure to meth labs. Illicit meth production generates hazardous waste that is often dumped into the environment, contaminating water sources, land, and surfaces with toxic chemicals. Residues of meth can persist for months after production, posing health risks to individuals exposed to these substances. Research on health effects of exposures to substances associated with illicit meth production is limited. There are no federal guidelines or standards for clean-up of former meth sites due to lack of research. Guidelines are discretionary recommendations, while standards are mandatory regulations. The EPA has four main approaches to cleaning meth sites. The EPA can respond to dangerous pollutants at STL sites, but most do not reach that level. State and local governments can pay for clean-up and apply for reimbursement from EPA or notify the DEA for clean-up. Funds from HUD are available for redeveloping former meth sites. Remediation of meth sites involves various decisions and is an additional cost after clean-up. Remediation of contaminated private property or public areas involves decisions on whether to clean up or restrict access. Costs vary depending on the severity of contamination, with estimates ranging from $1,500 to $200,000 for meth lab clean-ups. The average cost to remediate an average-size site is around $50,000 according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The illicit production and use of methamphetamine (meth) is a significant issue in the United States, primarily concentrated in the western, southwestern, and midwestern regions. Meth is classified as a Schedule II narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act, with limited medical uses for certain conditions. The drug is mainly supplied by clandestine laboratories in Mexico and California, with some \"super-labs\" contributing to the problem. Meth production in the United States is fueled by clandestine laboratories in Mexico and California, including \"super-labs\" capable of producing large quantities. These labs distribute not only meth but also other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and MDMA. The closure of some super-labs has led to an increase in small-scale labs producing meth for personal use or limited distribution. The nationwide numbers of meth incidents have declined since 2003, attributed to restrictions on access to nonprescription pseudoephedrine-containing decongestants by some states and retailers. Restrictions on access to meth ingredients by states and retailers increased, making it harder to travel to nearby states or stores without restrictions. Some pharmaceutical companies reformulated decongestants to exclude pseudoephedrine. Stiffer sentences for illegal meth production further deterred involvement with STLs. Iowa, Oklahoma, and Oregon reported significant declines in meth incidents after passing laws restricting pseudoephedrine access. Nationwide decline in meth incidents is expected once complete 2005 data is available. Despite only 20% of illicit meth coming from STLs, their widespread presence and residual impacts are concerning. The widespread presence of small-scale meth labs (STLs) in the United States has raised concerns due to their environmental impact and geographic diffusion. Compared to super-labs in Mexico, STLs are less efficient and produce more contaminants. There are approximately 9,000 domestic small-scale labs in 2000 and 17,000 in 2004, far outnumbering super-labs. Small-scale meth labs (STLs) in the United States can be geographically scattered in various locations like apartments, motel rooms, and abandoned buildings. The waste produced by these labs is more varied and unpredictable compared to super-labs, as independent \"cooks\" may use different recipes available online. They may also use common items like decongestants, mason jars, and pressure cookers as substitutes for ingredients and equipment. The residual impacts of small-scale labs can affect children of the cooks. The residual impacts of small-scale meth labs include high levels of meth in the air during cooking, leading to potential health issues for children. Some children taken from these labs may suffer permanent damage to their respiratory tracts and nervous systems. Additionally, there are concerns about the health and social welfare of these children, whether they remain with their parents or are removed. Some meth cooks and individuals in the illicit drug business may also pose a threat due to being armed and mentally imbalanced. The EPA, DEA, and HUD are involved in investigating meth lab sites. Under CERCLA, EPA can respond to sites posing a danger to public health. Local or state governments can clean up sites and apply for reimbursement from EPA. Reimbursement is limited to $25,000 per incident. The United States EPA Local Governments Reimbursement Program offers up to $25,000 per incident for cleaning up clandestine meth lab sites. The number of reimbursements has been declining, possibly due to the process of applying for reimbursement and the cap on reimbursement amount. Another option for cleaning up meth sites is to notify the DEA. The DEA has been increasingly responsible for cleaning up meth lab sites without upfront payment by state or local governments. The number of DEA clean-ups has been rising while applications for EPA reimbursement have been declining. The average cost per site has been decreasing due to increased clean-up efficiency. Federal funds for redevelopment of former meth production sites are available through HUD's Brownfields Economic Development Initiative. HUD proposes to consolidate its Brownfields program into its Community Development Block Grant program in its FY2007 budget request. Funding for the Brownfields program was $24 million in FY2005 and $10 million in FY2006. HUD did not specify the budget for redeveloping former meth sites under the CDBG program. In FY2005 and FY2006, the budget for CDBG was $4.7 billion and $4.2 billion respectively, with a request for $3.0 billion in FY2007. Clean-up of meth sites may require special training and equipment, including removal of contaminated items, ventilation, chemical neutralization, washing, encapsulation, providing alternate water supplies, and controlling access to the site. Demolition may be necessary for highly contaminated structures. The decision to remediate a meth site can be challenging as EPA and DEA funds are only available for clean-ups, not for remediation. Owners of contaminated properties must decide if remediation is worth the cost, which can exceed the property value. Local or state governments may need to decide whether to remediate or restrict access to contaminated public areas. The severity of contamination and the desired level of cleanliness determine the cost of remediation, with no federal guidelines currently in place. Currently, there are no federal guidelines for remediation processes, with EPA and DEA funds only available for clean-ups. Nine states have feasibility-based standards for meth remediation, ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 micrograms of meth per 100 square centimeters of surface. Some states have standards for meth-related chemicals in addition to residual meth, requiring remediation by certified professionals. Requirements vary for notifying parties about contamination and maintaining public records. Lack of health-based standards raises questions about minimizing contaminants for preventing adverse health effects. The lack of uniform federal guidelines for remediating former meth labs complicates the task. States and localities are using limited research information to develop standards for clean-up certification, considering costs and differing in stringency levels. The National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws (NAMSDL) is developing model guidelines for the clean-up of meth lab sites, including certification of workers and reporting requirements. They are advocating for federally funded health studies, cleanup standards, and field test kits. NAMSDL's outline includes state agency oversight of clean-up programs and requirements for owners. The National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws (NAMSDL) is developing model guidelines for the clean-up of meth lab sites, including certification of workers and reporting requirements. This includes responsibilities for local health departments, property owners, contractors, and notification procedures. Decontamination procedures and confirmation standards are also outlined. In the 109th Congress, multiple bills authorize funds for cleaning former meth production sites and research on remediation standards. H.R. 4763, the Methamphetamine Eradication Act, allocates funds for various programs for remediation actions, equipment, and training. H.R. 3324 and S. 430, the Arrest Methamphetamine Act of 2005, authorizes funds for the COPS Program. The Arrest Methamphetamine Act of 2005 authorizes funds for the COPS Program and grants to States for meth lab clean-ups. Other bills like the Metheamphetamine Epidemic Elimination Act and the Methamphetamine Abuse Prevention Act of 2005 provide funds for DEA remediation activities and hiring personnel for cleaning STLs. The Combat Meth Act of 2005 amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act to authorize grants for meth-related activities. The CLEAN-UP of Methamphetamines Act authorizes funds for grants to assist in cleaning methamphetamine-affected areas. It includes provisions for training, equipment acquisition, and clean-up expenses. The Federal Emergency Meth Lab Cleanup Funding Act of 2005 would make funding available for clean-up expenses from the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005 authorizes funding for experts and consultants needed to clean former meth labs. It also sets guidelines for the remediation of these areas based on scientific knowledge. The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005 authorizes funding for experts and consultants to clean former meth labs. It includes guidelines for site assessment, remediation of contaminants, research support, and development of new meth detection technologies. The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2005 authorizes funding for experts and consultants to clean former meth labs, including guidelines for site assessment, remediation of contaminants, research support, and development of new meth detection technologies such as field test kits and appropriate standard reference materials."
