    "content": "Congress continues to show strong interest in supporting the U.S. research and development (R&D) enterprise, with a focus on federal R&D activities. The federal government plays a crucial role in funding R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. Major agencies funding basic research include the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), and Department of Energy (DOE). The Bush Administration requested $142.7 billion in federal R&D funding for FY2008, with a 1.2% increase over the enacted FY2007 total. Funding for FY2008 is provided in the Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. The increase in funding was primarily for NASA's space vehicles development program, the Department of Defense, and the American Competitiveness Initiative. The Department of Defense and NASA received increased funding for their programs in FY2008, with NASA receiving $2.2 billion for the International Space Station and $3.0 billion for the Constellation program. The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) did not receive the requested increases, including $50 billion for research and science education. Congress did not address the Global War on Terror funding request for DOD. The funding for research infrastructure from FY2007 through FY2016 aimed to double physical sciences and engineering research in NSF, DOE's Office of Science, and NIST over ten years. However, FY2008 funding fell below doubling targets, with NSF's research activities increasing by only 1.1%, DOE Office of Science by 5.8%, and NIST's core laboratory R&D by 1.4%. NIST's construction and research facilities account saw a significant increase to $160.5 million in FY2008. The ACI proposed $86 billion for a revised R&E tax credit over 10 years. The R&E tax credit expired in 2007 as it was not made permanent or extended. Funding levels for federal research initiatives varied in the President's FY2008 request, with increases for NNI and NITRD, and a decrease for the Climate Change Science Program. In FY2008, the Climate Change Science Program received $1.544 billion, a 7.4% decrease primarily due to reduced NASA funding. The Department of Energy requested $9.781 billion for R&D, with the final appropriation being $9.947 billion. The DOE Office of Science saw a 16% increase to $4.398 billion, reflecting the American Competitiveness Initiative. The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) aimed to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies over 10 years. The House provided $4.514 billion, the Senate committee recommended $4.497 billion, and the final appropriation was $4.018 billion, a 6% increase from FY2007. Within the Office of Science, basic energy sciences received only $20 million more than in FY2007, despite the request for a $248 million increase. The request for fusion energy sciences saw a $109 million increase, mainly for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). However, the final appropriation was $141 million less than requested, with no funding for the U.S. contribution to ITER. High energy physics also faced a shortfall of $94 million, leading to layoffs at Fermilab and SLAC. The requested funding for DOE national security R&D decreased by 3%, mainly due to the completion of construction projects like the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The House and Senate committees provided differing funding amounts for various programs, including the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The final appropriation was $3.199 billion, with increases for nonproliferation and verification R&D and inertial confinement fusion, but no funding for the reliable replacement warhead program. The Senate committee recommended a bipartisan congressional commission to evaluate the role of nuclear weapons in future strategic posture. The DOE requested $2.252 billion for energy R&D, with increases in nuclear, hydrogen, biomass, and solar energy programs. The House and Senate provided additional funds for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and fossil energy, with a final appropriation of $2.731 billion, 24% more than FY2007. The focus shifted away from the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative in nuclear energy R&D. Congress supports research and development in the Department of Defense through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriation, primarily for future military hardware and software. RDT&E funds are also allocated for the Defense Health Program and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, supporting health care delivery and Congressionally directed research. Funds support Congressionally directed research in areas like cancer and other medical conditions, as well as activities to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions. These programs are typically funded in the defense appropriations bill, with recent allocations for the Global War on Terror. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund also includes RDT&E funds. The Explosive Device Defeat Office administers the Fund and tracks funding allocated to RDT&E. The FY2008 request for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E was $75.1 billion, with additional funding for Defense Health Program and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction programs. The Global War on Terror request included $2.9 billion for FY2008 and $1.4 billion for FY2007 for RDT&E. Funding for RDT&E in Title IV has increased from $42 billion in FY2001 to $76 billion in FY2007, a 58% increase in constant FY2008 dollars. RDT&E funding has reached its highest levels in constant dollars since 1948. Congress has consistently appropriated more for RDT&E than requested since FY1996. Military services and DOD agencies receive their own RDT&E funding. Budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 make up DOD's Science and Technology Program, focusing on research. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 concentrate on developing specific weapon systems. The Defense Department's Science and Technology Program, funded through RDT&E, supports the development of new technologies and system improvements for existing operational systems. Congress aims to maintain U.S. military superiority by stabilizing S&T funding at 3% of DOD's overall budget. The FY2008 S&T funding request is $10.8 billion. The FY2008 S&T funding request in Title IV is $10.8 billion, which is $2.5 billion less than FY2007. The request falls short of the 3% goal set by Congress, with basic research receiving special attention. The FY2008 request for basic research by DOD is $1.4 billion, with over half of the budget spent at universities. Congress approved emergency supplemental funds for RDT&E in support of the Global War on Terror in FY2007. The FY2008 DOD budget request for basic research is $1.4 billion, with a significant portion allocated to universities. Congress approved $1.1 billion in emergency supplemental funds for RDT&E in support of the Global War on Terror in FY2007. The House passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008, providing additional funding for RDT&E and S&T programs. The House made changes to the President's systems development requests, providing less funds for the Army's Future Combat System and more funds for the Joint Strike Fighter. They also allocated additional funds for the Defense Health Program, including specific amounts for breast cancer and prostate cancer research. A provision in the bill limits the use of appropriations for indirect cost rates on basic research grants to 20%. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the bill on September 14, 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing Title IV RDT&E by $102 million and increasing it by $265 million in the bill. They also recommended $11.6 billion for the S&T program, which is roughly 2.6% of the total Department budget. Additionally, they recommended more funding for the Joint Strike Fighter programs of the Navy and Air Force, including $480 million for a competitive engine development. The Committee recommended $477 million for the RDT&E portion of the Defense Health Program, including funding for breast and prostate cancer research. They also increased funding for the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The conference committee filed its report on November 6, 2007, recommending $76.9 billion for Title IV RDT&E and $12.8 billion for S&T, representing approximately 2.8% of the total department budget. The conferees recommended $536 million for RDT&E within the Defense Health Program, including funding for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and other medical research. They also recommended $313 million for RDT&E within the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. Additionally, the conferees addressed indirect costs on government contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements for basic research, accepting the House proposal with a raised ceiling of 35%. They provided $11.6 billion to accelerate the development and deployment of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. $11.6 billion was allocated to accelerate the development and deployment of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to protect against improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan. This funding was in addition to $5.2 billion provided earlier for the same purpose. Congress instructed the Secretary of Defense to transfer these funds to appropriate accounts, including the RDT&E account. The President signed the bill (P.L. 110-116) on November 13, 2007. The House passed H.R. 4156 on November 14, 2007, considering only $50 million of the total request for activities in immediate need of additional funds. The House and Senate debated funding for R&D in FY2008, with NASA requesting $12.7 billion, a 7.3% increase over FY2007. The House provided $13.1 billion, the Senate $12.9 billion, and the final appropriation was $12.8 billion. Budget priorities at NASA are influenced by these funding decisions. Budget priorities at NASA are driven by the Vision for Space Exploration, endorsed by Congress in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005. This includes retiring the space shuttle by 2010, completing the International Space Station by 2017, returning humans to the Moon by 2020, and eventually sending humans to Mars. NASA is developing the Orion spacecraft and Ares I launch vehicle for these missions, with the first crewed flight expected in early 2015. The FY2008 budget request included increases for Vision-related programs and either modest increases or decreases for other programs. The FY2008 budget request for NASA included increases for Vision-related programs like Constellation Systems and the International Space Station, with smaller increases provided by Congress. Science saw a modest increase, while Aeronautics Research experienced a decrease. Congressional interest focused on the impact of the Vision on science funding, with concerns raised about sacrificing future missions for present efforts. The FY2008 budget request for NASA included increases for Vision-related programs like Constellation Systems and the International Space Station, with smaller increases provided by Congress. Science saw a modest increase, while Aeronautics Research experienced a decrease. Congressional concern was raised about sacrificing future missions for present efforts, particularly in Earth Science funding. The House and Senate provided additional funding for Science, with a focus on Earth Science missions and the Space Interferometer mission. The final Science appropriation included increases for Earth Science. The Science appropriation for FY2008 saw an increase of $31 million, with boosts for Earth Science and SIM programs. The President requested a budget of $28.558 billion for NIH, slightly lower than the final FY2007 level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 provided $29.170 billion for NIH, a $131 million increase over FY2007. House and Senate actions had recommended even higher funding levels, with conferees settling on approximately $29.937 billion. The FY2007 NIH appropriation was $570 million (2.0%) more than the FY2006 program level of $28.468 billion. The bulk of NIH's budget comes through the annual Labor-HHS-Education appropriations legislation, with an additional small amount of funding for environmental work related to Superfund. The FY2008 Labor/HHS appropriations bill, H.R. 3043 and S. 1710 were reported by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The vetoed conference version of H.R. 3043 led to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161) providing funding for most government programs outside of Defense. The NIH's discretionary budget authority comes from funding in the Labor/HHS and Interior/Environment appropriations bills. Additional funding for diabetes research and transfers within the Public Health Service also contribute to NIH's budget. A portion of the annual NIH appropriation is transferred to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. In FY2008, the transfer amount was $295 million, close to the proposed $300 million. The total funding available for NIH activities, including add-ons and transfers, is referred to as the program level. In FY2003, Congress completed a five-year project to double the NIH budget to $27.1 billion. Annual increases were around 14%-15% from FY1999 to FY2003. Advocates recommended 10% growth post-doubling, but Congress only gave 2%-3% increases for FY2004 and FY2005. Advocates then suggested 6% for FY2006 and 5% for FY2007 to maintain scientific momentum. However, the NIH budget decreased by 0.3% in FY2006, the first drop since 1970. FY2007 saw a 2.0% increase over FY2006. The FY2008 final funding level for the agency represents a 0.45% increase over FY2007, which is below the advocated 6.7% increase to reverse the decline in NIH's purchasing power since FY2003. The agency consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers, each focusing on specific areas of research and health. In FY2008, Congress provided separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, OD, and a buildings and facilities account. The FY2008 President's request was developed before the FY2007 appropriation was completed, resulting in most ICs being level-funded. Some ICs that received increases in FY2007 were dropped back to FY2006 funding levels in the FY2008 request. For example, the NCRR budget was decreased by $19 million after receiving a $34 million increase in FY2007. In FY2008, Congress provided separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, OD, and a buildings and facilities account. The FY2008 request decreased the NCRR budget by $19 million. The National Cancer Institute would have been cut by over $10 million in the request. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases would have been increased by $229 million, with $28 million for NIAID programs and $201 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The House and Senate bills proposed funding increases for most institutes and centers. In FY2008, Congress provided separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, OD, and a buildings and facilities account. The budget requested $136 million for Buildings and Facilities (B&F), an increase of $52 million (63%). The final appropriation included $119 million for B&F, an increase of $35 million (42%). For the Office of the Director, the President requested a $530 million (51%) drop in the account, while the appropriation gave a $62 million (5.9%) increase. The FY2008 appropriation included a $62 million increase for the Office of the Director, reflecting changes in funding for the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. The Roadmap total was boosted to $483 million, with the entire sum placed in the OD account, allowing ICs to use all their funding for their own programs without the Roadmap tap. In FY2008, the NIH appropriation included $486 million for the Roadmap/Common Fund, divided between IC budgets ($364 million) and OD ($122 million). The final amount in P.L. 110-161 was $496 million, with additional funding for the National Children's Study. This long-term study aims to examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of over 100,000 children in the U.S. from before birth until age 21, with a projected cost of $2.7 billion. The NIH's FY2008 budget included funding for the National Children's Study, a long-term project examining environmental influences on over 100,000 children from birth to age 21, with a projected cost of $2.7 billion. Despite initial lack of funding in the FY2008 request, $110.9 million was eventually allocated to support the study. The NIH focused on maintaining support for investigator-initiated research grants and nurturing new investigators, with plans to fund a high number of competing research project grants. The funding for NIH in FY2008 supported new types of awards to encourage young scientists and new investigators. Efforts were made to increase grants and average costs, including awards like Pathway to Independence and Director's Pioneer Awards. Clinical research training and Clinical and Translational Science Awards were also prioritized. In FY2008, NIH funding supported new awards for young scientists and new investigators, including Pathway to Independence and Director's Pioneer Awards. The Pioneer, New Innovator, and Bridge awards were funded at FY2007 levels, while the Pathways to Independence program received funding at the President's request level. The Senate bill included language on human embryonic stem cell research, but controversial provisions were dropped before the bill went to the floor. The biodefense research portfolio was set to increase slightly by reallocating extramural construction costs. In FY2008, the NIH funding remained at 2.4%, with NIH being the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 made organizational changes to enhance the authority of the NIH Director for strategic planning and cross-institute research initiatives. It also established overall funding levels for NIH and a \"common fund.\" The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 provides funding for the National Science Foundation in FY2008, with an increase from the previous year but below the budget request. The act also includes a transfer of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to the Research and Related Activities account. The Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) has been directed by conferees to review policies on transformative research. Reports recommend allocating funds for cutting-edge research. NSF is directed to issue a report on including transformative research in its portfolio and increase support for infrastructure improvements. Funding for NSF in FY2008 was $6.429 billion, an 8.6% increase from the previous year. The FY2008 request for NSF was $6.429 billion, an 8.6% increase from the previous year. President Bush's ACI aims to double the NSF budget over the next 10 years, with the FY2008 request supporting priority areas like discovery research, workforce preparation, and infrastructure development. These investments are intended to drive innovation and promote research at the forefront of discovery. The NSF emphasizes the importance of international research partnerships and increasing diversity in the scientific and engineering fields. The FY2008 budget request includes funding for the Office of International Science and Engineering, as well as investments in polar research, nanotechnology, and climate change science. The FY2008 budget request includes funding for various programs such as Climate Change Science, homeland security, and Networking and Information Technology Research and Development. The request also includes $5.131 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), with increased funding for the physical sciences to address concerns about support imbalance between life sciences and physical sciences. R&RA funds research projects, facilities, and education activities, including Integrative Activities (IA) for research instrumentation at U.S. colleges. The FY2008 budget request includes $263 million for Integrative Activities (IA), with $107 million allocated for EPSCoR. EPSCoR funding supports four investment strategies, with majority going towards new and continuing awards. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA, with responsibility for icebreakers supporting scientific research in polar regions transferred in FY2006. The NSF took over the costs of icebreakers supporting polar research from the U.S. Coast Guard in FY2006. The NSF funds the Office of Polar Programs at $464.9 million in FY2008 for research in arctic and antarctic sciences. Additionally, the NSF supports international research partnerships in polar regions and various research centers and programs with specific funding allocations. In FY2008, the NSF allocated funding for various research centers including Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, Science of Learning Centers, and Centers for Analysis and Synthesis. The request also emphasized the importance of strengthening core disciplinary research and investing in cyberinfrastructure to support research and education in the 21st century. An investment of $200.0 million in cyberinfrastructure would enhance modeling, simulation, visualization, data storage, and communication breakthroughs, making it more powerful and accessible to researchers and educators. The NSF's FY2008 request for the EHR Directorate was $750.6 million, with priorities including increasing technological literacy, preparing STEM professionals, and closing achievement gaps in scientific fields. Funding at different educational levels included $222.5 million for research on learning, $210.2 million for undergraduate education, and $169.5 million for graduate education. The NSF's FY2008 request for the EHR Directorate was $750.6 million, with priorities including research and evaluation on education in science and engineering, informal science education, Discovery Research K-12, and programs at the undergraduate level to create leverage for institutional change. Priorities at the undergraduate level included the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, Course, Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement, STEM Talent Expansion Program, Advanced Technological Education, and Scholarship for Service. The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP) was proposed at $46 million in the FY2008 request. The MSP in NSF, with a proposed budget of $46 million in FY2008, coordinates activities with the Department of Education and state-funded MSP sites. Approximately 80 awards have been made with an overall funding rate of about 9%. Priorities at the graduate level include programs like Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education. Additional support was provided for programs targeting underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, and engineering, such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology. In FY2008, the MREFC account was funded at $244.7 million, a 28.1% increase over the previous year. The NSF prioritized funding for ongoing projects and new projects approved by the National Science Board. Projects had to have the potential to advance scientific understanding or infrastructure technology. Six ongoing projects were scheduled for support in the FY2008 request. In FY2008, the National Science Foundation prioritized funding for ongoing and new projects with potential to advance scientific understanding or infrastructure technology. The FY2008 request included funding for seven projects: Atacama Large Millimeter Array Construction, Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory, National Ecological Observatory Network, South Pole Station Modernization project, Alaskan Region Research Vessel, Ocean Observatories Initiative, and Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. The House Committee on Science and Technology passed H.R. 1867, authorizing $21.0 billion for NSF for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161) includes appropriations for agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), providing $2.603 billion for research and education in FY2008. This is $301.6 million above the budget request and $74.7 million above the FY2007 enacted level. The act addresses priorities such as supporting K-12 science education, promoting university-industry partnerships, and improving funding rates for new investigators. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDA's research agency with 100 labs nationwide, focusing on food production, new products, pest management, and regulatory programs. In FY2008, ARS received $1.176 billion, $138.5 million above the request and $47.1 million above FY2007. The Administration proposed redirecting $141.0 million from specific research locations to livestock production, food safety, and crop protection initiatives. The FY2008 appropriation for ARS includes funding for buildings and facilities, with a specific allocation for the Biocontainment Laboratory and Consolidated Poultry Research Facility in Athens, Georgia. CSREES distributes funds to various institutions for agricultural research, education, and outreach, including partnerships with 1862, 1890, and 1994 land-grant colleges. Funding is distributed through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants, with a total of $1.130 billion provided in P.L. 110-161. CSREES receives $1.130 billion in FY2008, with funding for formula distribution to state Agricultural Experiment Stations slightly below FY2007 levels. Support for the 1890 formula programs remains steady. The budget proposes changes to the Hatch formula program, expanding multistate research programs and distributing funds through competitive grants. The National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program is funded at $192.2 million, a slight increase from FY2007. The FY2008 appropriation for the National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program is $192.2 million, a slight increase from the previous year. Funding supports science in agriculture and encourages participation of underrepresented groups. Projects focus on biomass conversion methods and the impact of renewable fuels on rural communities. The FY2008 appropriation for USDA includes $77.9 million for the Economic Research Service and $163.4 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The increase in funding will support market analysis, outlook programs, and the 2007 Census of Agriculture. Funding will also be used for data collection and processing activities in 2008. In FY2008, the Department of Homeland Security requested $1.379 billion for Research and Development (R&D), with allocations for the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), and U.S. Coast Guard. The House provided $1.351 billion, while the Senate provided $1.414 billion for R&D activities. In FY2008, the Department of Homeland Security allocated $1.328 billion for Research and Development (R&D), with $830 million for S&T, $473 million for DNDO, and $25 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The S&T Directorate reorganized its programs and management structure in late 2006, with university centers of excellence aligning to the new organization. Reductions in funding were requested for the Explosives and Infrastructure programs due to completed efforts and program realignment. The requested $51 million reduction in the Infrastructure and Geophysical program eliminated funding for community and regional initiatives. Operational programs transferred out of S&T include BioWatch, BWIC, RDCDS, and SAFECOM. The House provided $12 million less for Management and Administration, rejected the $14 million request for BioWatch units, and gave $10 million more for University Programs. The S&T Directorate is tasked with selecting university centers of excellence, determining research topics, and evaluating their work. The House reduced funding by $10 million for Research, Development, Acquisition, and Operations (RDA&O), including no funding for the ADVISE program. The Senate, on the other hand, increased RDA&O funding by $41 million, with reductions in the Chemical and Biological program and Innovation program, and no funding for ADVISE. Increases were allocated for the Explosives program and earmarks in Infrastructure and Geophysical and Laboratory. The final appropriation for the S&T Directorate included an increase of $35 million in RDA&O and a reduction of $4 million in Management and Administration. The Chemical and Biological program received $21 million less than requested, while Innovation received $27 million less. University Programs received $11 million more than the request, and Explosives received $14 million more for countering car bombs and IEDs. The final appropriation also included Senate earmarks for $55 million, with no funding provided for ADVISE or its follow-ons. The proposed funding increase in DNDO focused on Research, Development, and Operations, particularly the Transformational R&D program. There was also a proposed increase in Systems Acquisition for the Securing the Cities initiative in New York City. Congressional attention has been on criticism of DNDO's cost-benefit analysis for Advanced Spectroscopic Portal technology. The House recommended a reduction in funding, but this was reversed by a floor amendment. The House recommended a reduction in funding for the Securing the Cities initiative, but this was reversed by a floor amendment. The Senate shifted $29 million from Systems Acquisition to Research, Development, and Operations, with $20 million allocated for screening general aviation aircraft for illicit nuclear materials. The Senate also recommended a $10 million reduction in the Securing the Cities initiative, but a floor amendment reserved the requested amounts for this initiative. The FY2007 appropriations conference report (H.Rept. 109-699) called for a certification of ASP monitors before full-scale procurement. The final appropriation provided $90 million less than requested for Systems Acquisition. Funds were allocated for the National Academy of Sciences to assist in certification decisions. The final appropriation included funding for Securing the Cities and screening of general aviation aircraft. For FY2008, the Bush Administration requested flat funding for NOAA's R&D programs with proposed cuts for other research activities. The Administration proposed cuts for some NOAA research activities, including a 46% cut for the National Ocean Service R&D budget. However, there was an increase of $19 million for the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), about 6.7% more than the FY2007 estimated funding level. The Department of Commerce, NOAA FY2008 Budget Summary indicated that NOAA R&D funding would be 16% of the agency's total budget request of $3.82 billion, with 86% for research and 14% for development. OAR accounts for 60% of all NOAA R&D in the President's FY2008 request, resulting in an overall increase of $41 million, or 7.6%, for the agency. In FY2008, NOAA received an overall increase of $41 million, with the largest decrease in funding for the National Ocean Service. However, there were increases in funding for OAR, NOAA satellite programs, and certain coastal science and ocean observation activities. Funding for NOAA Fisheries and the National Weather Service remained at FY2007 levels. The National Weather Service R&D funding was maintained at FY2007 levels in FY2008. The Senate criticized NOAA for requesting cuts in key ocean programs and only modest increases in ocean programs for FY2008. The Senate also cited the Joint Ocean Commission's findings on the Administration's progress. The Joint Ocean Commission's January 2007 findings influenced the Administration to request modest increases for ocean research and NOAA R&D programs. The Senate committee recommended $32 million for competitively-awarded research grants in OAR, almost 32% more than FY2007. For climate change R&D, the Senate recommended $217 million, $24 million more than the request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $585 million for NOAA R&D in FY2008, $43 million less than the Senate recommendation. The House recommended $280 million for OAR climate change research, $44 million more than the request. The House bill would have provided $346 million for OAR overall, 23% more than the request. The House report did not address funding JOCI policy/research recommendations. NIST aims to increase U.S. companies' competitiveness through technological support. NIST research supports technological advances across the American economy, enhancing product reliability, manufacturing processes, and public safety. The President's FY2008 budget requested $640.7 million for NIST, with increases in internal research and development. The House passed a bill providing $831.2 million for NIST, 22.8% above FY2007 funding levels. The House passed bill H.R. 3093 providing $831.2 million for NIST, with increases for STRS, ATP, and MEP programs. The Senate version of the bill would have appropriated $863.0 million for NIST, with $30.8 million directed to non-NIST programs. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided NIST with $755.8 million, an increase of 11.7% over FY2007. The bill allocated funds for various programs including the Advanced Technology Program, Manufacturing Extension Program, and construction budget. Support for the STRS account increased to $440.5 million, but was below the President's budget proposal. The Technology Innovation Program receives $65.2 million, 17.6% less than the previous year. MEP funding totals $89.6 million, 14.4% less than FY2007. Construction funding triples to $160.5 million. NIST was funded at FY2006 levels until P.L. 110-5 provided $676.9 million in FY2007 support. Funding for the STRS account increased by 10% to $434.4 million, while the construction budget decreased by 66% to $58.7 million. In FY2007, funding for NIST's core programs increased by 18.3% for intramural R&D, with appropriations rising by 9.6%. The omnibus appropriations legislation for FY2008 provided a small increase in the STRS account, contrasting the Administration's proposed 15.2% increase. The original appropriations bill included a 15.2% increase, while the Senate-passed version had a 15.6% increase. The House passed H.R. 3093 with a funding increase, while the Senate version had a 15.6% increase. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) faced opposition as some viewed it as \"corporate welfare,\" but others defended it for assisting businesses in developing crucial technologies. Congress maintained funding for ATP, with the House passing initial appropriation bills. The House passed initial appropriation bills for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), but funding for ATP was not included in bills passed since FY2002. Support for ATP in FY2006 was 41% lower than in FY2005, and FY2007 funding remained the same. The Technology Innovation Program replaced ATP with reduced support in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership budget was a concern during FY2004 appropriations deliberations. The FY2004 budget request and subsequent acts reduced federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), but funding was restored in FY2005. Support decreased in FY2006 but remained above FY2004 levels. Funding for FY2007 stayed similar, while FY2008 saw further reductions. For more information, refer to CRS reports on NIST, ATP, and MEP. The Bush Administration requested $813 million for the Department of Transportation's R&D budget in FY2008, with the final appropriation totaling $852 million. The President also requested $410 million for Federal Highway Administration R&D, with the final appropriation remaining at $410 million. Highway research includes the Federal Highway Administration's transportation. The final appropriation for Federal Highway Administration's transportation research and technology contract programs is $410 million. Research programs focus on improving safety, reducing congestion, enhancing mobility, and minimizing negative impacts on the environment. The budget includes $84 million for FHWA Intelligent Transportation Systems R&D, an increase of $20 million from FY2007. Additionally, $172 million is allocated for state highway R&D efforts, a $9 million increase from the previous year. Both the House and Senate acts provided this funding. In FY2008, the final appropriation for FAA R&D was $274 million, a decrease of $30 million from FY2007. The President's R&D request for FAA was $258 million, with $140 million for Research, Engineering and Development. The final appropriation for RITA R&D in FY2008 was $8 million, an increase of $6 million from FY2007. In FY2008, the final appropriation for RITA R&D was $8 million, up $6 million from FY2007. The Administration requested $621 million for R&D in the Department of the Interior (DOI) in FY2008, with the House providing $678 million and the Senate providing $657 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 allocated a total of $661 million for DOI R&D, with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) receiving nearly 90% of the funding. Total funding for USGS in FY2007 was $564 million, with a proposed decrease in R&D funding of 3.0% in the President's budget. The final appropriation for USGS in FY2008 is $583 million, an increase of $37 million (3.4%) over the FY2007 budget. Funding increased in three of the four research areas, with an additional $7 million provided for climate change research. Funding for Geological Resources R&D in FY2008 increased by 2.5% to $219 million, focusing on assessing the nation's energy and mineral resources. The USGS conducts research on geological hazards, earthquakes, and volcanoes. Funding for Geographic Research R&D increased by 3.3% to $46 million in FY2007. Water Resources R&D funding remained constant at $126 million in FY2008. The Cooperative Water Program received $63 million in FY2008 for hydrologic research. Funding for USGS Biological Research increased in FY2008. In FY2008, funding for USGS Biological Research increased by 2.2% to $180 million. The program supports research on fish, wildlife, and habitats, with activities conducted by USGS scientists in Interior labs to address science needs of DOI and other agencies. In FY2008, the Environmental Protection Agency's Science and Technology account received $785.8 million, slightly above the President's request. Funding for research activities increased compared to FY2007, but many program areas within the account saw constant or decreased funding. EPA funds a variety of R&D activities to support its regulatory responsibilities. The Environmental Protection Agency's Science and Technology (S&T) account funds R&D activities for preventing, regulating, and abating environmental pollution. It is funded through annual appropriations from eight line-item accounts established by Congress in FY1996. The S&T account includes elements from the former EPA Research and Development account and receives funds from the Superfund account for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. EPA manages R&D at headquarters, laboratories, and externally through the Office of Research. The EPA's Science and Technology (S&T) account, managed primarily by the Office of Research and Development (ORD), funds R&D activities for environmental pollution prevention. The account supports research laboratories, grants, and applied science activities. The increase in funding for FY2008 was mainly due to a shift in funds from the Environmental Programs and Management account to cover operational and administrative expenses. The FY2008 consolidated appropriations provided a $6.4 million increase for research activities, but $17.5 million less than FY2007. Funding for EPA's research areas either decreased or remained flat compared to FY2007, with some areas receiving more funding such as Climate Protection and Global Change research. For example, Global Change Research received $19.7 million in FY2008, a 20% increase from FY2007. The FY2008 consolidated appropriations provided a $6.4 million increase for research activities, significantly less than the $33.3 million proposed by the House. The Senate committee recommended $18.6 million for research activity, including $14 million for extramural research grants for air and water quality research. The FY2008 appropriations included increases for EPA's global climate change activities, but did not establish a Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation as proposed by the House. The proposed commission would have received $50.0 million for FY2008, with $5 million allocated for its establishment and operations. The FY2008 appropriations included increases for EPA's global climate change activities, but did not establish a Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation as proposed by the House. The proposed commission would have received $50.0 million for FY2008, with $5 million allocated for its establishment and operations. An additional $45.0 million was proposed to support federal agency climate change research based on the commission's recommendations, which neither the Senate Appropriations Committee nor the President had proposed funding for. Members of Congress and stakeholders have raised concerns about funding for scientific research at EPA, including decreased funding for ecosystems research and other programs. The EPA funding debate for FY2008 centered around federal funding for scientific research activities, with concerns raised by Members of Congress, scientists, and environmental organizations about the downward trend in resources over time. The debate also focused on the use of \"sound science\" in regulatory actions and the application of scientific research in federal policy development."
