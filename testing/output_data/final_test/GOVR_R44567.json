    "content": "The report discusses the FY2017 budget request, congressional actions, and appropriations for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of the Census within the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It focuses on the Census Bureau, which has a larger budget. The table shows the FY2016-enacted and FY2017-requested amounts for ESA, BEA, and the Census Bureau, along with recommended amounts by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and FY2017-enacted amounts. The Economics and Statistics Administration provides policy support and management oversight for the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau. ESA conducts economic research and analyses in support of the Secretary of Commerce and monitors economic developments and policies. BEA's economic accounts provide valuable information on U.S. economic growth and regional conditions. The Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau provide valuable information on key economic issues such as U.S. economic growth, regional development, and industry relationships. They produce statistical measures like GDP, personal income, and corporate profits. The Census Bureau collects demographic, economic, and housing data, including the decennial census and Current Economic Statistics. The Administration's FY2017 budget request for the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) was $114.6 million, with $4.0 million allocated for policy support and management oversight. The budget also included $110.7 million for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which would fund essential data building blocks for measures like GDP and corporate profits. The Administration's FY2017 budget request for the Census Bureau was $1,633.6 million, a $263.6 million increase from FY2016. The proposal aimed to improve economic indicators' timeliness and accuracy, expand coverage to include various sectors, and develop a regional economic dashboard. The funding increase was primarily for preparations for the 2020 Decennial Census. The FY2017 budget request for the Census Bureau was $1,633.6 million, with $285.3 million allocated for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,348.3 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs. This allocation represented a 5.7% increase for Current Surveys and Programs and a 22.6% increase for Periodic Censuses and Programs compared to FY2016. The majority of the budget request, 77.1%, was for Periodic Censuses and Programs, while 16.3% was for Current Surveys and Programs. BEA and ESA's policy support and management oversight made up 6.3% and 0.2% of the total request, respectively. The FY2017 budget request for Current Surveys and Programs within the Census Bureau was $285.3 million, representing a 5.7% increase from FY2016. The budget for Current Economic Statistics was $194.7 million, a 5.7% increase from the previous year. Business statistics received a budget of $44.0 million, a 3.4% increase from FY2016. These statistics provide detailed data on the U.S. economy and are crucial for policy formulation and economic analysis. The FY2017 budget request for Business statistics was $44.0 million, a 3.4% increase from FY2016. Construction statistics provide national performance indicators for the construction sector, with a request of $16.8 million in FY2017. Manufacturing statistics, measuring the overall performance of the U.S. manufacturing sector, had a request of $21.3 million in FY2017. The FY2017 request for manufacturing statistics was $2.1 million more than FY2016. General economic statistics are crucial for understanding the U.S. economic structure. The FY2017 request for general economic statistics was $64.0 million, slightly higher than FY2016. Foreign trade statistics provide official monthly data on imports, exports, and trade balance. The FY2017 budget request for foreign trade statistics was $34.9 million, slightly higher than FY2016. Government statistics cover revenues, expenditures, debt, and financial assets of state and local governments. The FY2017 request for government statistics was $13.8 million, while for Current Demographic Statistics, it was $90.6 million. This includes collections and analyses of demographic data, such as the monthly Current Population Survey. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics for over 50 years. It provides labor force characteristics, unemployment rate, housing vacancy data, and includes regular supplements on various topics like child support, tobacco use, volunteers, and food security. The FY2017 request for household surveys was $57.8 million, $1.2 million more than FY2016. Funding for population and housing analyses in FY2017 was $10.4 million, $991,000 more than FY2016. The bureau's intercensal demographic estimates provide population data between decennial censuses. The FY2017 budget request proposed combining population projections and estimates under intercensal estimates, with a budget of $11.9 million. The bureau's demographic surveys sample redesign received a budget of $10.5 million for improved sampling methods and data processing systems. The budget request for demographic surveys sample redesign was $10.5 million, exceeding the enacted amount for FY2016. Critical programs identified included the 2020 Decennial Census, American Community Survey, 2017 Economic Census, and 2017 Census of Governments. The Census Bureau also introduced the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing System (CEDCaP) as a new IT initiative. The Administration requested $778.3 million for the 2020 Decennial Census in FY2017, a $179.4 million increase from the previous year. This funding is crucial for redistricting, distributing federal funds, and creating demographic estimates. The request reflects the bureau's focus on preparing for the upcoming census as a major initiative for FY2017. The Bureau of the Census is seeking an adjustment to discretionary spending limits for the decennial census operations to avoid potential operational failures due to lack of testing. This adjustment, starting no later than 2018, aims to prevent the need for emergency appropriations or cuts to other programs in 2020. The Census Bureau aims to conduct the 2020 census at a lower cost per housing unit than in 2010, which was the most expensive in U.S. history. The bureau is focusing on cost-control innovations in four major areas, including conducting address canvassing to ensure correct addresses and map locations. The Census Bureau plans to conduct the 2020 census more cost-effectively by utilizing new methods such as using geographic information systems and aerial imagery to update addresses. They aim to reduce the need for physical visits by offering an online response option and utilizing administrative records and commercial sources to follow up with nonrespondents. Sophisticated operational control systems will be used to track field employees' progress for any necessary follow-up visits. The Census Bureau plans to save over $5 billion by implementing new control systems to track daily progress in the field for the 2020 census. The estimated cost for the 2020 census redesign is $17.8 billion, compared to $12.5 billion for a reengineered census. In FY2017, activities were planned to prepare for the census, with a warning that insufficient funding could hinder the 2018 end-to-end test. The Census Bureau planned a nationwide 2016 address canvassing test in FY2017 to ensure address quality and housing unit coverage for the 2020 census. The test aimed to collect address and spatial data on various devices and mirror key dates for the 2020 census. One operation, \"update enumerate,\" was to update addresses and enumerate housing units simultaneously, using a nonresponse follow-up strategy. The 2017 test by the Census Bureau focused on improving data collection operations, including addressing limited English proficiency groups and developing efficient field operation systems. It also aimed to integrate operations with the new IT system, CEDCaP, but faced funding uncertainties leading to scaling back. In October 2016, the Census Bureau scaled back the 2017 test due to funding uncertainties, retaining the test of census compliance with a national sample but ceasing plans to test field operations in certain areas. The bureau planned to include these areas in the 2018 census test and continue researching administrative records for the 2020 census. Additionally, the bureau was to lease space for regional centers to support 2020 census operations. The Census Bureau faced challenges in leasing space for regional centers to support 2020 census operations and began planning the 2020 Census Communications and Partnership Programs in FY2017. The bureau also delivered the 2020 census topics to Congress, including gender, age, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and housing ownership. The American Community Survey replaced the decennial census long form from 1940 to 2000. The American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the decennial census long form from 1940 to 2000. It covers about 3.5 million households annually, providing data on various topics for different population sizes. The ACS is the primary data source for rural areas and small population groups. The bureau releases over 11 billion ACS estimates yearly on more than 40 topics, with an annual budget request of $251.1 million for FY2017. The Administration's FY2017 request for the ACS was $251.1 million, $20.2 million above the FY2016-enacted amount. The Census Bureau planned to use part of the funding to enhance data quality and secure cooperation from survey respondents through field representative refresher training. The absence of this training since FY2012 had increased the risk of reduced data quality, schedule delays, and respondent complaints. The bureau also proposed similar training for its ACS contact center staff. The budget justification highlighted the importance of performance reviews for field workers to reinforce correct interviewing techniques and field procedures. The bureau proposed new research to reduce respondent burden and increase program efficiency. Additionally, a comprehensive review of all ACS questions was ongoing, potentially leading to changes in data sources or question wording. The economic census dates back to the 19th century in response to a rapid population increase. The economic census, originating in the early 19th century, is a vital source of information about the U.S. economy. It is conducted every five years and provides data that serves as the foundation for key economic measures like GDP. The Administration requested $127.3 million for economic census activities in FY2017, a $2.0 million increase from the previous year. In FY2017, $125.2 million was allocated for the Economic Census, part of a six-year funding cycle. Activities focused on testing the CEDCaP system for data collection and processing, with plans for a 100% Internet reporting census. The census of governments, conducted since 1957, complements the economic census and together cover nearly all of GDP. The census of governments provides key information on state and local government structure, employees, finances, and intergovernmental relationships. It is the primary source for understanding the fiscal welfare of these governments, which account for 12% of GDP and 15% of the civilian labor force. The FY2017 budget request for the census of governments was $12.3 million, an increase of $3.4 million from the previous year. The FY2017 budget request for the census of governments was $12.3 million, reflecting the collection and processing of 2017 census data. The Census Bureau proposed using administrative records and electronic data collection to control expenses and reduce reporting burden. The Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing initiative, funded under the Periodic Censuses and Programs account, aims to create an integrated system for data collection and processing across all censuses and surveys. The Census Bureau's Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing initiative aims to consolidate costs by retiring unique systems, halt the creation of program-specific systems, and deliver mature solutions for the 2020 Census. The Administration requested $104.0 million for this initiative in FY2017. The Census Bureau's Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing (CEDCaP) initiative aims to support the 2017 Economic Census, Company Organizational Survey, and the 2020 Decennial Census. The Government Accountability Office highlighted CEDCaP as an IT investment needing attention, projected to cost $548 million through 2020. Senate Appropriations Committee reported on S. 2837 related to the Departments of Commerce and Justice. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported on S. 2837, recommending funding of $109.0 million for the Economics and Statistics Administration in FY2017. The Census Bureau would receive $1,518.3 million, with $270.0 million for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,248.3 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs. The Senate committee recommended funding of $1,518.3 million for the Census Bureau in FY2017, with $2.6 million allocated for oversight and audits of periodic censuses. They directed the bureau to reduce the cost of the 2020 Decennial Census and work with partners to obtain necessary administrative records for a more efficient nonresponse follow-up. The House Committee on Appropriations approved the House version of the FY2017 CJS appropriations bill, H.R. 5393 on June 7, 2016. The bill recommended $107.0 million in funding for ESA, with a focus on making CEDCaP fully secured against cyber attacks before implementation. The committee expressed support for the ACS but directed the bureau to reduce the number of questions and ensure efficient survey conduct. The House Appropriations Committee approved funding for the Census Bureau at $1,470.0 million in FY2017, which was $100.0 million above the FY2016 level. Funding for Current Surveys and Programs was $270.0 million, $15.3 million below the FY2017 request. Periodic Censuses and Programs were allocated $1,200.0 million, $100.0 million above the FY2016 level. The House bill approved $1,470.0 million for the Census Bureau in FY2017, $100.0 million above FY2016. It included provisions for oversight and withholding funds for IT work until an expenditure plan was provided. The House committee directed the bureau to improve cost estimates for the 2020 census and focus on core activities. The FY2017 CJS appropriations legislation was not enacted by the end of FY2016. The Census Bureau, BEA, and rest of ESA were funded through December 9, 2016, with a reduction under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2017. Division A of the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, provided funding through April 28, 2017. The Census Bureau could draw on money from Periodic Censuses and Programs for mandated decennial Census activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 funded ESA at $107.3 million, slightly less than FY2016, below the FY2017 request, and slightly above the House Appropriations Committee approval. $1,470.0 million was provided for the Census Bureau, with $270.0 million for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,200.0 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated $1,470.0 million for the Census Bureau, with $270.0 million for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,200.0 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs. $2.6 million of the latter amount would be transferred to the Commerce Department's OIG for Census Bureau oversight."
