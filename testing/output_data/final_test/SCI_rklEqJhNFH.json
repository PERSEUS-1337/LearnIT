    "content": "Large matrix inversions have often been cited as a major impediment to scaling Gaussian process (GP) models. A variational approximation for a wide range of GP models is presented, eliminating the need for matrix inversion at each optimization step. The bound directly parameterizes a free matrix, proving to give the same guarantees as earlier variational approximations. Experimental results show beneficial properties of the bound, but further improvements in optimization and implementation are needed for significant speed enhancements. One major obstacle to wider adoption of Gaussian Process (GP) models is their computational cost, mainly due to matrix inverses and determinants. Variational approximate inference methods have reduced matrix sizes, leading to improved time costs. Training with small minibatches is hindered by high iteration costs dominated by inverses and determinants. Cholesky decomposition is commonly used for computations, which is both asymptotically expensive and unsuitable for modern deep learning. In this work, a variational lower bound is introduced to speed up training in deep learning models by avoiding expensive matrix operations. The new bound can replace existing variational methods and is applicable in various models like deep GPs. The focus is on the theoretical properties of the bound with initial experimental results presented. The goal is to achieve scalability in future work by learning relations with a GP prior through factorised likelihood. The model uses approximate inference to handle non-conjugate likelihood and matrix operations from the Gaussian prior. It is based on variational inference with inducing variable posterior constructed using random variables. The goal is to minimize KL divergence between q(f (\u00b7)) and p(f (\u00b7) | y) by maximizing the bound from Hensman. The model aims to minimize KL divergence between q(f (\u00b7)) and p(f (\u00b7) | y) by maximizing the bound from Hensman et al. (2015) through reparameterization to eliminate expensive operations. The model aims to minimize KL divergence between q(f (\u00b7)) and p(f (\u00b7) | y) by maximizing the bound from Hensman et al. (2015) through reparameterization to eliminate expensive operations. We can construct a lower bound to L sv without inverses in the expectation terms using an upper bound for \u03c3 2 n|u, parameterized as \u03c3, for log-concave (\"lc\") likelihoods. This bound, L lc, is valid for the log marginal likelihood and can be optimized with respect to the parameters of L sv. The fully relaxed bound L fr is a reparameterization of L sv, allowing for inverse-free predictions. By adding T as a variational parameter, any model using L sv can easily adapt to the fully relaxed bound. Proposition 5 shows that the variance of \u2207 T L lc is zero at T = K \u22121 uu optimum. Matrix operations in the KL term are removed through unbiased estimation, with focus on obtaining an unbiased estimate of the gradient of log|K uu|. The Unbiased Linear Systems Solver (ULISSE) uses a randomly truncated CG run to compute an unbiased estimate of s = K \u22121 uu r. ULISSE expresses the solution as a sum of separate terms, re-weighted by inclusion probability to maintain unbiasedness. The cost of ULISSE is O(H\u012aM 2 ), with the preconditioner L T allowing for convergence in a single step when uu, enabling a practical method with low gradient variance. The text discusses new variational bounds for GP models that can replace previous methods without the need for expensive matrix operations. These bounds are shown to work well in simple experiments with single layer and deep GPs, removing a common obstacle to scaling GP models. The text introduces new variational bounds for GP models, addressing a common obstacle to scaling by removing the need for expensive matrix operations. Further improvements are necessary to fully realize the practical benefits. The text presents tight variance upper bounds for GP models, focusing on cases where N > M and nondegenerate kernels to avoid underdetermined systems. It shows that L lc = L sv when T = K \u22121 uu, with a non-zero gradient at this point. The gradient w.r.t. T is set to zero, leading to a unique optimum at T = K \u22121 uu where L lc = L sv. Additionally, for L fr, the KL term is considered as a convex function of S. The KL term is a convex function of S. The reparameterisation trick is used to evaluate unbiased estimates of gradients. The gradient w.r.t. T is zero at its optimum, leading to a unique optimum at T = K \u22121 uu. Our methods can recover solutions similar to L sv. The setup optimises all hyperparameters and variational parameters. The current setup optimizes all hyperparameters and variational parameters jointly using Adam. Inverse-free methods require more iterations to achieve a similar ELBO, with visual differences in fit quality exaggerated. Future improvements will focus on optimizing behavior and software enhancements to handle larger datasets and potentially use a different optimization routine. Software improvements will be needed to take advantage of using only matrix-vector products. To fully benefit from the method's speed-up, utilizing only matrix-vector products is essential (Gardner et al., 2018)."
