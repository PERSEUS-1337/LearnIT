The collection began in 1864 and reached 100 statues in 2005. Some statues were relocated due to aesthetic and structural concerns. The National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol features statues from each state, with 34 statues displayed in National Statuary Hall. States can replace statues and there have been discussions about altering the size of the collection. The report discusses the history and proposals for the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol, including the creation of the hall and recent legislative proposals to expand it. On April 19, 1864, Representative John Hovey Rice introduced a joint resolution to create a statuary hall in the Old Hall of the House, inviting states to provide statues of illustrious citizens. The resolution passed the House but was not approved by the Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. In June 1864, Representative Thaddeus Stevens proposed an amendment to create a marble floor in the Old Hall of the House of Representatives, similar to the Congressional Library or Senate vestibule. The amendment was initially removed from a bill in the Senate but later restored in a conference committee. The President is authorized to invite states to provide statues of deceased citizens for national commemoration in the old hall of the House of Representatives. Up to $15,000 from the capitol extension funds can be used for this purpose. In 1864, states were allowed to donate up to two statues of deceased citizens for the National Statuary Hall Collection. Congress later required that individuals depicted on statues must be deceased for at least 10 years, with exceptions for certain statues, including one of Rosa Parks placed in 2013. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has guidelines for statues donated to the National Statuary Hall Collection, which must be accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library. The AOC can relocate statues with approval, and there is a nine-step process for accepting new statues. States have been allowed to replace statues since 2000. Since 2000, states can replace statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection by following guidelines set by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001. To do so, a state must request approval from the Joint Committee, ensure the statue to be replaced has been displayed for at least 10 years, and cover all related costs for the new statue's design, construction, transportation, and placement. Since 2000, states can replace statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection by following guidelines set by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001. Legislation may increase the number of statues states can donate from two to three, and allow the District of Columbia and U.S. territories to contribute statues. Each state currently places two statues in the collection, but supporters argue for a third statue to increase diversity. Legislation has been proposed to increase the number of statues each state can donate to the National Statuary Hall Collection from two to three, in order to enhance diversity. Representative Douglas (Pete) Peterson introduced a bill in the 103rd Congress for this purpose, but it did not progress. More recently, Representative Stephen Cohen introduced a similar bill in the 112th Congress, but it was also referred to the Committee on House Administration without further action. The National Statuary Hall Collection may expand to allow each state to donate up to three statues. This proposal has been introduced in Congress but has not progressed. If implemented, states would have the option to add statues, leading to potential space issues in the Capitol complex. The National Statuary Hall Collection may expand to allow each state to donate up to three statues, potentially leading to space issues in Capitol locations like Emancipation Hall. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to authorize the District of Columbia and territories to provide statues for the collection since the 93rd Congress. In the 111th Congress, legislation was introduced to allow statues from the District of Columbia and U.S. territories to be included in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Bills were passed in the House for statues from DC and territories, with negotiations leading to a merger of the bills before being debated in the House. In the 112th Congress, a bill was introduced to allow the District of Columbia and U.S. territories to place statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Representative Dan Lungren reintroduced a bill similar to the previous one, but no further action was taken. Additionally, a statue of Frederick Douglass was donated by the District of Columbia government and accepted by Congress. The statue of Frederick Douglass was donated by the District of Columbia government and accepted by Congress for placement in Emancipation Hall of the Capital Visitor Center on June 19, 2013. Congress has considered proposals to increase the number of statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, including adding statues for each state and allowing the District of Columbia and U.S. territories to provide statues. Proponents argue that this would better represent various aspects of states' history, but it could lead to space issues for statue display in the Capitol. The Joint Committee on the Library has relocated some statues from National Statuary Hall to Emancipation Hall and other locations within the Capitol Visitor Center. Adding more statues to the collection may require moving existing ones, with considerations for costs to states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Concerns include the display of a larger collection in the Capitol and potential constraints like structural and safety issues. Since 2005, the National Statuary Hall Collection has had 100 statues, with states allowed to replace statues since 2000. Regulations for replacements were set by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001."
