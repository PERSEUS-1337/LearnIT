    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Secrets Protection Act\" and includes an amendment to the Rules of Evidence. The Federal Rules of Evidence are amended to include Rule 503, which establishes the State Secrets Privilege. This privilege allows the Government to withhold information in civil actions if disclosure could harm national defense or diplomatic relations. The court is required to protect sensitive information through various measures. The State Secrets Privilege allows the Government to withhold information in civil actions to protect national defense or diplomatic relations. Measures include issuing protective orders, conducting in camera proceedings, limiting counsel participation, and appointing a guardian ad litem when necessary. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the absent litigant's interests, drawing from a list of attorneys with security clearances. The guardian ad litem is prohibited from discussing privileged information with any nongovernmental party. If disclosure presents a risk of harm, the court may require a substitute pending resolution of the privilege claim. The court may require the Government to produce an adequate substitute, like a redacted version or summary of information, if less restrictive means are not feasible to address a risk of harm. The substitute must be approved by the court and provide counsel with an opportunity to challenge the Government's privilege claim. The Government can assert the privilege in any civil action it is involved in. The Government can assert the privilege in a civil action it is not a party to, and must provide supporting affidavits signed by the head of the agency. The court will undertake a preliminary review of the information before making any determinations. The court can conduct a preliminary review of privileged information provided by the Government and may consider appointing a special master or expert witness to assist in the case. The court may also request a manageable index of the privileged information from the Government. The court may request a specific index correlating statements in the affidavit with privileged information. Prehearing conferences will be held to address steps to protect sensitive information and define issues related to the Government's privilege claim. The court shall conduct a hearing to assess the validity of a claim of privilege, order disclosure of necessary information, resolve disputes regarding participation in proceedings, set a discovery schedule, and take other necessary steps such as ordering security clearances. The court conducts a hearing to determine the validity of a privilege claim. The court reviews all information asserted as privileged by the Government, along with affidavits, evidence, and other filings. In certain cases, sampling of privileged information may be allowed. The court may substitute a sufficient sampling of privileged information if a timely review of all information is not feasible, as long as it does not change the court's determination on the privilege claim. The court must independently assess the validity of the privilege claim and determine if the harm identified by the Government is reasonably likely to occur. The court must assess the validity of the privilege claim and determine the likelihood of harm. The Government bears the burden of proof for the harm and its likelihood. If the privilege is not upheld, the court will issue orders for disclosure and trial admission, with the right to appeal. If the privilege is upheld, no disclosure is required. The court determines the validity of the privilege claim and if upheld, the information will not be disclosed. If a nonprivileged substitute can be provided, the court will order the Government to produce it. The court will find against the Government if it fails to provide a nonprivileged substitute for information. The court will not make any decisions based on the state secrets privilege until all parties have completed nonprivileged discovery. After completing nonprivileged discovery, the court may weigh the equities and make appropriate orders in the interest of justice if privileged information is necessary to decide a factual or legal issue. This could include striking witness testimony, ruling in favor or against a party, or dismissing a claim. The court will not base any decisions on privileged information until all parties have completed nonprivileged discovery. The courts of appeal have jurisdiction to hear appeals related to the state secrets privilege, including decisions on its validity, refusal to provide nonprivileged substitutes, or denial of protective steps sought by the Government. Appeals can be expedited by the court of appeals, even during trial. During trial, if an appeal is made, the district court must adjourn the trial until the appeal is resolved. The court of appeals will hear arguments promptly, may skip written briefs, and make a quick decision, possibly without a written opinion. Reporting requirements are also outlined. The Attorney General must report in writing to specific committees within 30 days of invoking a state secrets privilege during a case. Each report must include all government-filed affidavits. The Attorney General is required to provide a report to Congress on the operation and effectiveness of the Rule within one year of its enactment, with suggested amendments included. This report must be submitted annually until three years after the enactment date, with further reports as needed. The Rule is the sole privilege provided. The Rule of Construction establishes the only privilege for civil cases involving state secrets. It applies to claims pending after the enactment date and allows relief from judgments based on the privilege under specific conditions. The Rule of Construction establishes the only privilege for civil cases involving state secrets, applying to claims pending after the enactment date and allowing relief from judgments based on the privilege under specific conditions related to conduct against the Government by its officers, employees, or agents."
