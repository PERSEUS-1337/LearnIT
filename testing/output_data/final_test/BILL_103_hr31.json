    "content": "The Act titled \"Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health Act of 1993\" is cited as the short title. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in section 2. The Congress finds that the Nation's beaches are valuable for recreation, attract millions of visitors, generate billions of dollars in tourism, face environmental quality decline due to increased population, and pollution crosses political boundaries. Coastal States have varying methods of testing water quality, leading to inconsistent public protection. The Act aims to establish uniform procedures for testing and monitoring coastal recreation waters to protect public safety and improve environmental quality. Monitoring water quality and posting signs at beaches during exceedance of standards would enhance public health and safety. SEC. 3. WATER QUALITY CRITERIA AND STANDARDS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters to protect public health during water activities. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include specific numeric criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters, such as Great Lakes and marine coastal waters used for swimming or bathing, to reflect public health risks from short-term increases in pathogens due to various causes. States must adopt water quality standards consistent with the Administrator's criteria. States must adopt water quality standards within 3 years of publication of criteria under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Failure to comply results in consequences. The Administrator shall establish water quality standards for coastal recreation waters for the State under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The State must use these standards in all programs related to coastal recreation waters. SEC. 4. COASTAL BEACH WATER QUALITY MONITORING. This section amends Title IV of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by adding a new section for coastal beach water quality monitoring. The Administrator shall publish regulations for monitoring coastal recreation waters to ensure compliance with water quality standards and public safety, specifying frequency based on use, extent of use, and proximity to pollution sources. The regulations for monitoring coastal recreation waters include methods for detecting pathogens, exemptions for specific areas if they meet certain criteria, and notification requirements for violations of water quality standards. The regulations require prompt reporting of violations to local officials and posting signs to notify the public of water quality standard violations in coastal recreation waters. The Administrator must also provide guidance on monitoring floatable materials and specify when their presence poses a threat to public health and safety. The regulations allow states to delegate monitoring of coastal recreation waters to local authorities. The Administrator will periodically review and revise regulations related to water quality standards. Coastal recreation waters are defined as Great Lakes and marine coastal waters used for swimming, bathing, or similar activities. Floatable materials include plastic, aluminum cans, wood, bottles, and paper products. SEC. 5. STUDY TO IDENTIFY INDICATORS OF HUMAN-SPECIFIC PATHOGENS IN COASTAL RECREATION WATERS. The Administrator, in cooperation with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, conducts an ongoing study to develop better indicators for detecting harmful bacteria and viruses in coastal recreation waters. A report describing the study findings, recommendations for improving water quality, and information on floatable materials in coastal waters is submitted to Congress every 4 years. The ongoing study by the Administrator and the Under Secretary of Commerce focuses on detecting harmful bacteria and viruses in coastal recreation waters. A report is submitted to Congress every 4 years, including information on floatable materials in coastal waters and beaches, recent trends, and State efforts to implement the Act. SEC. 6. Participation of State Coastal Zone Management Programs. Coastal zone management agencies must provide technical assistance to local governments to keep coastal recreation waters and beaches free from floatable materials. Amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act aim to reduce floatable materials in coastal waters through managing land uses and promoting public participation. The Coastal Zone Management Act amendments focus on reducing floatable materials in coastal recreation waters by providing technical assistance, managing land uses, promoting public participation, and acquiring clean-up equipment. The term 'coastal recreation waters' refers to Great Lakes and marine coastal waters used for swimming and bathing. The term 'floatable materials' refers to any matter that can float or remain suspended in water, including plastic, aluminum cans, wood, bottles, and paper products. SEC. 7. GRANTS TO STATES. The Administrator may provide grants to States for fulfilling requirements under sections 3 and 4, with a maximum of 50% cost sharing. Authorization of appropriations for grants to States under section 7 is limited to $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1994 and 1995, with an additional $1,000,000 for carrying out other provisions of the Act during the same period."
