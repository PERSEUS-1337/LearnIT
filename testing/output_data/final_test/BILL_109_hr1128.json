The tax credit for captured carbon dioxide used in enhanced oil and gas recovery is $0.75 per 1,000 standard cubic feet, with an inflation adjustment factor applied after 2004. The tax credit for qualified carbon dioxide is $0.75 per 1,000 standard cubic feet, with an inflation adjustment factor applied after 2004. Qualified carbon dioxide is captured from anthropogenic sources, measurable at the source, compressed, treated, transported via pipeline, sold for enhanced oil and gas recovery, and permanently sequestered in geological formations. The tax credit for qualified carbon dioxide is $0.75 per 1,000 standard cubic feet, with an inflation adjustment factor applied after 2004. Carbon dioxide from anthropogenic sources is captured from industrial plants like coal and natural gas power stations, natural gas processing plants, ethanol plants, fertilizer plants, and chemical plants. This captured carbon dioxide is used for enhanced oil and gas recovery and then permanently sequestered in geological formations. The tax credit for qualified carbon dioxide is $0.75 per 1,000 standard cubic feet, with an inflation adjustment factor applied after 2004. Sales of qualified carbon dioxide must be within the United States or a U.S. possession. The term 'qualified carbon dioxide' includes captured carbon dioxide used for enhanced oil and gas recovery. The term 'qualified carbon dioxide' includes captured carbon dioxide used for enhanced oil and gas recovery. Any credit under this section shall be attributable to the person that captures, treats, compresses, transports, and sells the carbon dioxide for use as a tertiary injectant in enhanced oil and natural gas recovery.
