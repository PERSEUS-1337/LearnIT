    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Amendments Act of 1999\" and includes provisions for the allocation of GST exemption to lifetime transfers to trusts. The \"Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Amendments Act of 1999\" includes provisions for the allocation of GST exemption to lifetime transfers to trusts. Section 2632 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow for the allocation of unused GST exemption to property transferred during an individual's lifetime to ensure a zero inclusion ratio. The unused portion of an individual's GST exemption is the part that has not been allocated, treated as allocated for direct skips, or treated as allocated for prior indirect skips. Definitions include an indirect skip as a transfer to a GST trust. The trust must distribute more than 25 percent of the trust corpus to non-skip persons before age 46 to avoid generation-skipping transfer tax. The trust instrument must distribute more than 25 percent of the trust corpus to non-skip persons who are living and more than 10 years older before age 46 to avoid generation-skipping transfer tax. The trust instrument must distribute over 25 percent of the trust corpus to non-skip persons who are living and more than 10 years older before age 46 to avoid generation-skipping transfer tax. If non-skip individuals die before a specified date, a portion of the trust corpus must be distributed to their estate or subject to a general power of appointment. The trust may also be included in the gross estate of a non-skip person if they were to die immediately after the transfer. The trust must distribute a portion of the trust corpus to non-skip persons over 25% who are living and more than 10 years older before age 46 to avoid generation-skipping transfer tax. If non-skip individuals die before a specified date, a portion of the trust corpus must be distributed to their estate or subject to a general power of appointment. The trust may also be included in the gross estate of a non-skip person if they were to die immediately after the transfer. Automatic allocations to certain GST trusts are deemed to have been made only at the close of the estate tax inclusion period. The fair market value of transferred property is not considered includible in the gross estate of a non-skip person or subject to a right of withdrawal. Powers of appointment held by non-skip persons are assumed not to be exercised. The fair market value of trust property at the close of the estate tax inclusion period determines the value of the transfer. An individual can elect to exclude indirect skips or transfers to a specific trust from this provision. Additionally, they can choose to designate a trust as a GST trust for all transfers to that trust. Individuals can make elections regarding indirect skips on timely filed gift tax returns for the calendar year of the transfer. Retroactive allocations can also be made on timely filed gift tax returns for the effective calendar year. Retroactive allocations of unused GST exemption can be made by a transferor to previous transfers to a trust on a chronological basis if a non-skip person with a specific lineage predeceases the transferor. Transfers to the trust can be retroactively allocated on a chronological basis if a non-skip person predeceases the transferor. Special rules apply if the allocation is made on a gift tax return filed before the non-skip person's death. The text discusses future interests in trusts and a conforming amendment to the Internal Revenue Code. It also specifies effective dates for transfers subject to chapter 11 or 12 of the Code made after December 31, 1999. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by this Act, applies to deaths of non-skip persons after the enactment date. SEC. 3. SEVERING OF TRUSTS. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include provisions for the severing of trusts, where a single trust can be divided into two or more separate trusts through a qualified severance. This division allows the resulting trusts to be treated as separate entities for tax purposes. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the division of a single trust into multiple trusts through a qualified severance. For trusts with an inclusion ratio greater than zero but less than 1, the division must result in two trusts, with one receiving a fractional share of the total trust assets. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the division of a single trust into multiple trusts through a qualified severance. The amendment specifies that the trust receiving a fractional share will have an inclusion ratio of zero, while the other trust will have an inclusion ratio of 1. The timing and manner of severances are flexible, and regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. This amendment applies to severances after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN VALUATION RULES. The amendment to section 2642(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code modifies the valuation rules for gifts where the GST exemption is allocated on a gift tax return filed before the prescribed date. The value of the property for GST purposes will be based on its final determination for estate tax purposes. The amendment to section 2642(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code addresses transfers at death, stating that the value of property transferred upon the transferor's death will be based on its final determination for estate tax purposes. The value of property transferred at death will be determined based on estate tax purposes, as specified by the Secretary. The amendments made by this section will be effective retroactively to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. SEC. 5. RELIEF PROVISIONS. Section 2642 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include relief provisions for late elections related to GST exemption allocations and certain elections under subsections (b)(3) and (c)(5) of section 2632. The Secretary will prescribe circumstances and procedures for granting extensions of time, including relief for transfers made before the enactment of this provision. The Secretary will consider all relevant factors, including evidence of intent in the trust instrument, when deciding on relief for late GST exemption allocations. Substantial compliance with the allocation demonstrating intent for a zero inclusion ratio will be taken into account. The IRS will consider all relevant factors, including evidence of intent in the trust instrument, for late GST exemption allocations. Substantial compliance with the allocation demonstrating intent for a zero inclusion ratio will be taken into account. Effective dates for the new provisions are specified. The new code will apply to allocations made before the enactment date for tax consequences of generation-skipping transfers. No negative implications are intended for relief for late elections or substantial compliance rules before the amendment."
