    "content": "Following the 2000 census, Texas gained two additional congressional seats. The state legislature failed to agree on a redistricting map, leading to a court-ordered plan for the 2002 election, resulting in a Democratic majority. In 2003, the Republican party took control and enacted a new redistricting map to increase their representation. Legal challenges were brought against the new plan, with the district court ruling in favor of the Republicans. The U.S. Supreme Court vacated a district court decision in League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) v. Perry and remanded the case in light of Vieth v. Jubelirer. The district court ruled against LULAC, focusing on political gerrymandering. Appellants argued the new redistricting plan was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The case addressed the constitutionality of partisan gerrymandering and whether the Texas redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act. The Court in LULAC v. Perry considered whether the 2003 Texas redistricting plan was an unconstitutional political gerrymander motivated by partisan objectives. Appellants argued that the plan violated equal protection and First Amendment guarantees. They urged the Court to adopt a presumption of invalidity for mid-decade redistricting plans enacted solely for partisan purposes. The Court expressed skepticism about claims seeking to invalidate a statute based on a legislature's unlawful motive without reference to its content. To prevail in a claim of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, it must show a burden on complainants' representational rights, \"as measured by a reliable standard.\" The Court rejected the appellants' argument that mid-decade redistricting for partisan purposes violates the Constitution's one-person, one-vote requirement. The Court emphasized that the fact of mid-decade redistricting alone is not necessarily indicative of unlawful political gerrymandering. The Court upheld the 2003 redistricting in Texas, stating that mid-decade redistricting for partisan reasons does not violate the one-person, one-vote requirement. Appellants argued that population shifts created unlawful variances among districts, but the Court found their theory to be a restatement of their primary argument. The Court rejected the appellants' argument that the Texas legislature's mid-decade redistricting for partisan reasons was impermissible. Justice Kennedy stated that there was no reliable standard for identifying unconstitutional political gerrymandering, and therefore the appellants had not established any legally impermissible use of political classifications. As a result, their statewide challenge was dismissed. The Supreme Court determined that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering were not justiciable in the case of LULAC, similar to the decision in Vieth v. Jubelirer. Justice Kennedy left open the possibility that standards for evaluating such claims might exist. In LULAC, the Supreme Court was divided on whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable, with no reliable measure found for what constitutes unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Justice Kennedy suggested that standards for evaluating such claims might exist in the future. The Court in LULAC found that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering were not justiciable, but did not rule out the possibility of such claims prevailing in the future. The critical standard for evaluating such claims and granting relief remains unresolved, as seen in the case of Texas's congressional District 23 where Latino voting strength was weakened. The Court determined that Latino voting strength in Texas's congressional District 23 was weakened, leading to a question of vote dilution. Despite the creation of a new District 25 as an \"offsetting opportunity\" district, the Court rejected the argument that it met Section 2 obligations. The Court found that changes to District 23 in Texas weakened Latino voting strength, leading to vote dilution. It was determined that the state broke apart a Latino opportunity district to protect the incumbent congressman from the growing dissatisfaction of the politically active Latino community. The Supreme Court ruled that District 23 in Texas violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting power of Latinos, despite attempts to redraw the district to compensate for past discrimination. This decision was made in response to the state breaking apart a Latino opportunity district to protect the incumbent congressman from the politically active Latino community. The Supreme Court ruled District 23 in Texas as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and a violation of the Voting Rights Act. A federal district court ordered remedial proposals and adopted a new plan for redrawing congressional districts. Special elections for the redrawn districts were set for the 110th Congress. Commentators noted that other states may now redistrict following a change in political control, rather than waiting for the decennial census. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to promote fairness and independence in redistricting by prohibiting states from carrying out multiple congressional redistricting after a census, requiring the use of independent commissions, and imposing standards of compactness and contiguity."
