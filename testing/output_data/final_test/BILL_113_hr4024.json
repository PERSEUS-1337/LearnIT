The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include protection of navigable waters from contamination by chemical storage facilities in Title VII. The term 'aboveground storage tank' in the Ensuring Access to Clean Water Act of 2014 refers to containers designed to hold fluids at chemical storage facilities, made of materials like concrete, steel, plastic, or fiberglass reinforced plastic, and located on or above the ground surface. Tanks with a capacity of 1,100 gallons or less are excluded, unless they are over 500 gallons and within 500 feet of a navigable waterway. The term 'covered chemical storage facility' refers to any aboveground storage tank subject to oversight and inspection requirements under Federal or State law within 500 feet of a navigable water designated for domestic water supply. The term 'chemical' includes any substance or mixture of substances. The term 'covered chemical storage facility' includes facilities storing chemicals posing a risk to designated domestic water supplies, excluding those already regulated for hazardous substances. The Administrator or State determines the risk based on the potential harm from a chemical release. The term 'State program' refers to a chemical storage facility source water protection program established under section 702, where the Administrator or State may consider applicable Federal or State laws. \"Establishment of State programs under SEC. 702 for chemical storage facility source water protection, considering applicable Federal or State laws.\" The Administrator or each State must implement a chemical storage facility source water protection program within 1 year. The program includes oversight and inspection of covered facilities to prevent chemical releases into designated domestic water sources. The State program for chemical storage facilities must include requirements such as good design, leak detection, spill control, inventory management, emergency response plan, employee safety training, integrity inspections, and corrosion protection. The State program for chemical storage facilities must include requirements for corrosion protection, notice to relevant parties about potential toxicity of stored chemicals, safeguards for detecting and mitigating releases, and financial responsibility. The State program for chemical storage facilities must include financial responsibility requirements, inspections of aboveground storage tanks, and a comprehensive inventory of covered chemicals. Inspections must occur every 3 years for facilities in source water assessment areas and every 5 years for other facilities. The State program for covered chemical storage facilities includes a comprehensive inventory of facilities in each State. States can enforce more stringent standards for oversight and inspection if desired. The Administrator may provide technical assistance to States with primary enforcement responsibility. A report on State oversight and inspection programs must be prepared and submitted to relevant committees within six months. The report will also be made public on the Administrator's website. The Administrator will provide technical assistance to States with primary enforcement responsibility and submit a report on State oversight and inspection programs to relevant committees within six months. The report will also be made public on the Administrator's website and a copy will be provided to each State with primary enforcement responsibility. \"Emergency powers are outlined in Section 703.\" The Administrator or State may issue corrective action orders to owners or operators of chemical storage facilities under Section 702. Public water system owners can seek relief through civil action or petition the Administrator or State for imminent endangerment situations. Public water system owners can petition the Administrator for action within 30 days, or within 72 hours in emergencies. SEC. 704 states that the owner or operator of a covered chemical storage facility is liable for costs incurred by the Administrator or State for response actions related to chemical releases. SEC. 705 addresses the transfer of covered chemical storage facilities. SEC. 705 outlines the requirements for transferring a covered chemical storage facility, including submitting pre-transfer inspection results and addressing any issues within 30 days of transfer. Operators of domestic water systems on navigable waters must be provided with information on emergency response plans for covered chemical storage facilities in the same watershed and an inventory of chemicals held at those facilities. Emergency response plans must be submitted to the Administrator or the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Administrator or a State may keep confidential sensitive information at a covered chemical storage facility, except for public health information. Information can be shared with the Administrator, the Secretary of Homeland Security, public water systems, or public agencies involved in emergency response. \"Any person owning or operating a covered chemical storage facility who violates requirements or fails to comply with an order may face a civil penalty of up to $15,000 per day in court.\""
