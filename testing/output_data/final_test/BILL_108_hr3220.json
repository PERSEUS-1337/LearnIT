The \"Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2003\" amends Section 101 of the Act to remove limitations on sales solicitations of tangible personal property and extends prohibitions to other business activity taxes. The \"Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2003\" amends Section 101 to extend prohibitions on business activity taxes to all other taxes, effective for taxable periods starting after the first day of the first calendar year following the enactment. The Business Activity Tax Simplification Act of 2003 extends prohibitions on business activity taxes to all other taxes starting after the first day of the first calendar year following the enactment. SEC. 3. Jurisdictional standard for state and local net income taxes and other business activity taxes. No state taxing authority can impose a net income tax on a person engaged in interstate commerce without a physical presence in the state. Physical presence is defined as being in the state for more than 21 days during the taxable year. The 21-day limit for determining physical presence in a state includes activities such as purchasing goods, gathering news, meeting government officials, attending conferences, and participating in charitable activities. Using the services of another person in the state for more than 21 days to establish or maintain market presence is also restricted. During the taxable year, owning or leasing tangible or real property in a state for more than 21 days is subject to limitations. However, certain activities such as property assembly, marketing materials distribution, and ancillary property use are excluded from the 21-day calculation. During the taxable year, owning or leasing property in a state for over 21 days is restricted, with exceptions for specific activities. Taxable periods not consisting of a year adjust physical presence requirements accordingly. Exceptions include domestic entities and individuals domiciled in the state, and taxation of partners and similar persons. During the taxable year, owning or leasing property in a state for over 21 days is restricted, with exceptions for specific activities. Taxable periods not consisting of a year adjust physical presence requirements accordingly. Taxing authority can tax entities like partnerships, Subchapter S corporations, and trusts, as well as their owners or beneficiaries, if state law imposes the tax on the owners or beneficiaries based on their ownership interest in the entity. Certain activities, such as selling tangible personal property within the state with delivery originating and completing in the state, are subject to different time restrictions. During the taxable year, owning or leasing property in a state for over 21 days is restricted, with exceptions for specific activities like live performances and sporting events with more than 100 individuals or spectators present. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The definitions in this Act include \"net income tax\" and \"other business activity tax,\" which encompasses various types of taxes imposed on businesses. The term \"other business activity tax\" includes taxes imposed by a State on businesses for the right to do business or based on business activities conducted in that State, excluding transaction taxes. The term \"State\" refers to any State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States, including political subdivisions. SEC. 5. GENERAL MATTERS. The limitation on a State's power under section 3 does not affect other limitations imposed by law. This Act applies to taxable periods starting after the first year following enactment."
