    "content": "Modern U.S. foreign aid history includes the creation of the State Department's \"F Bureau\" in 2006 and the role of the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) who oversees USAID. Congress is also involved in reforming foreign aid programs post-World War II to prevent the spread of communism in Europe. The United States provided economic assistance to stabilize governments in Greece and Turkey in 1947, followed by the Marshall Plan from 1948 to 1951, which offered $13.3 billion to 16 Western European countries for economic recovery and to prevent the spread of communism. U.S. foreign aid has adapted over the years in response to global events, focusing on Southeast Asia to counter Soviet and Chinese influence, and under President Kennedy, supporting Latin America and newly independent African states. Foreign aid in Latin America and Africa increased significantly, reaching its highest level since the Marshall Plan. Aid spending fluctuated in the following decades, rising in the 1980s to address famine in Africa and respond to conflicts in Central America. In the 1990s, U.S. aid decreased due to the end of the Cold War, but after 9/11, the Bush Administration emphasized foreign assistance as a key foreign policy tool, elevating global development as a pillar of national security. The importance of foreign aid in U.S. foreign policy and national security has been emphasized, with the Department of State and USAID playing a critical role. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness and coherence of the U.S. foreign aid infrastructure, leading to closer scrutiny by Congress and critics. Foreign aid experts and lawmakers argue for a major update to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which has not been comprehensively amended since 1985. In 2006, Secretary of State Rice introduced the \"transformational development\" initiative to improve aid program coordination. This led to the creation of the State Department Bureau of Foreign Assistance and the development of a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance. The State Department Bureau of Foreign Assistance developed a Strategic Framework for Foreign Assistance (FAF) to align U.S. aid programs with American strategic objectives. The FAF aims to help policy makers make strategic choices on fund distribution and ensure that U.S. foreign assistance advances the Administration's foreign policy goals. It identifies the ultimate goal as building and sustaining democratic, well-governed states that respond to the needs of their people, reduce poverty, and act responsibly in the international system. Five development objectives organize funding and programs towards this goal: Peace and Security, Governing Justly and Democratically, Investing in People, Economic Growth, and Humanitarian Assistance. This Framework heavily influenced the writing of the FY2008 and FY2009 budgets and the FY2010 budget request. Several criticisms have surfaced regarding the FY2010 budget request and the F process for U.S. foreign assistance coordination. Critics argue that the F Bureau only covers aid programs controlled by the Department of State and USAID, neglecting other agencies involved in foreign aid. They also claim that Congress was not involved in shaping the F process and that it lacks coordination with multilateral organizations. Additionally, the process is criticized for prioritizing Washington decision-making over field expertise. Overall, experts highlight ongoing problems in the organization, effectiveness, and management of U.S. foreign aid that require reform, including the lack of a national foreign assistance strategy. The problems with U.S. foreign aid include the lack of a national strategy, insufficient funding compared to diplomacy and defense, outdated organization and goals, lack of coordination among agencies, fragmented funding, and limited monitoring of aid effectiveness. Congress is responsible for authorizing and overseeing foreign aid programs. Most foreign aid appropriations are found in annual foreign operations appropriations acts, often combined with funding for related expenditures like diplomatic programs and export financing. Congress has not passed annual foreign aid authorization legislation since 1985, instead providing guidance through earmarks and directives in yearly appropriations acts. New authorizations for foreign assistance programs have been passed since 1985. Since 1985, Congress has passed various acts authorizing foreign assistance programs, including the FREEDOM Support Act, SEED Act, Millennium Challenge Act, and Security Assistance Acts. Reform of foreign assistance has been ongoing since the Marshall Plan in 1948, with the Mutual Security Act of 1951 coordinating military and economic assistance. The concepts of security and development were further emphasized in the Mutual Security Act of 1954 and its 1957 revisions. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 was a significant reform effort that organized U.S. foreign aid into a coherent whole, providing a long-term structure for foreign assistance. This legislation, supported by President Kennedy and Congress, remains in effect today. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 organized U.S. foreign aid efforts and authorized the President to choose an agency to implement its provisions. President Kennedy created the Agency for International Development (later known as USAID) in 1961. In 1973, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973, restructuring development aid programs to focus on basic human needs in developing countries. This Act reorganized foreign assistance into sectors like agriculture, education, and population, shifting away from large infrastructure projects. Various administrations have attempted foreign aid reforms over the years. In 1969, President Nixon formed the Task Force on International Development, chaired by Rudolph A. Peterson. The Peterson Commission examined U.S. foreign assistance and made recommendations in 1970, but Congress did not support the proposed legislation. In 1977, Senator Hubert Humphrey pushed for legislation to elevate development in U.S. foreign policy, but it did not pass. President Carter then created the International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) in 1979 for foreign assistance coordination. The International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) was under-resourced and abandoned by the Reagan Administration, leading to ineffective coordination of aid. President Reagan formed the Commission on Security and Economic Assistance in his first term, but the recommendations in 1983 did not result in legislation. The IDCA remained dormant until it was abolished in 1999. The Commission on Security and Economic Assistance issued recommendations in 1983, but it did not lead to legislation. In 1987, Representatives Lee Hamilton and Ben Gilman led an effort to rewrite foreign assistance law to reflect new international political realities and simplify legislation. However, disagreements among members prevented substantive reforms. President Clinton appointed Deputy Secretary of State Clifford Wharton to head a review. President Clinton appointed Deputy Secretary of State Clifford Wharton to lead a review of foreign aid and restructure USAID after the Cold War. The Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act (H.R. 3765, 103rd Congress; S. 1856, 103rd Congress) was introduced in late 1993 but did not progress in the Senate. The Clinton Administration later proposed a reorganization plan that included keeping USAID as an independent agency under the direct authority of the Secretary of State. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (division G of P.L. 105-277) extended the Secretary of State's authority over USAID. The 111th Congress introduced legislation reforming foreign aid, directing the President to develop a national strategy, conduct quadrennial reviews, and improve aid coordination and evaluation. There is a renewed debate on foreign aid policy post-9/11, focusing on its role in meeting U.S. foreign policy goals. Several studies published since 2001 have called for reform to improve foreign aid structure and effectiveness in meeting U.S. foreign policy and national security goals. These studies have heightened congressional interest in re-examining foreign assistance policies, programs, funding, and organizational structure. The 14 studies assessed in this report provide comprehensive approaches for foreign aid reform, including books, Senate committee reports, think-tank studies, NGO reports, and journal articles. These studies are often referenced in aid reform discussions and represent a range of viewpoints. The 14 studies reviewed for this report present a matrix of foreign aid reform recommendations, with 16 key recommendations identified by CRS. These recommendations range from replacing the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to restructuring the foreign assistance apparatus and exploring new funding and evaluation methods. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and other related legislation have been criticized for their outdated goals and lack of coherence. Various studies suggest the need to rewrite the FAA to streamline foreign aid efforts and improve overall effectiveness. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) has been recommended for rewriting to remove outdated earmarks, aid restrictions, and procurement rules. Studies call for refocusing aid on poverty reduction and setting development goals based on current realities. Effective congressional-executive cooperation is needed to accomplish this reform. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is recommended for rewriting to provide more flexibility in aid delivery and development activities, with enhanced accountability to Congress. The 2006 U.S. National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of international economic development in foreign policy and national security. This support has led to the \"3D\" approach to national security, focusing on diplomacy, defense, and development. Several studies recommend elevating development to equal partner status with defense and diplomacy in the U.S. national security framework. They suggest reorganizing government functions to prioritize development as a principal instrument of national security. A unified national strategy document for foreign aid activities is needed to provide coherence and align foreign assistance with U.S. foreign policy goals. Several studies recommend integrating foreign aid goals to strengthen U.S. national security by addressing poverty and desperation that lead to instability and conflict. A national development strategy is suggested to balance short-term political and security goals with long-term development goals. The importance of national strategies focusing on foreign aid coherence to elevate development within overall U.S. foreign policy and national security is emphasized. The need for a coherent foreign assistance strategy linked to a national security strategy integrating development with diplomacy, economic policy, defense, and intelligence is highlighted. Calls for better integration of government actors involved in providing foreign assistance are made to address perceived shortfalls in managing foreign aid. Lael Brainard suggests consolidating foreign aid management into one capable agency, with studies advocating for a new cabinet-level department of global development to improve aid effectiveness and policy coherence. This reform could balance short-term security goals with long-term development objectives. The Oxfam study suggests creating a new department of global development to improve aid effectiveness and policy coherence. Concerns have been raised about the State Department's diminishing role in foreign aid compared to the Department of Defense. Reports from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department's Advisory Committee support a strong leadership role for the State Department in U.S. foreign assistance. The Committee reports recommend that the State Department should have primary authority over security assistance, with the Department of Defense responsible for implementation in limited areas. They caution against shifting authority from the State Department to DOD and emphasize the need for adequate budget requests to meet policy goals. The State Department should have primary authority over security assistance, with integration of State Department and USAID functions recommended for better foreign aid decision-making. The Office of the Director of Foreign Assistance within the State Department aims to provide coherence, budget transparency, and effectiveness evaluation for foreign aid programs. The article \"Don't Reinvent the Foreign Assistance Wheel\" by Gordon Adams criticizes the Foreign Assistance (F) process for concentrating too much power within the State Department and creating a non-transparent aid structure. It argues that alternatives like restoring independent status to USAID or creating a new cabinet-level foreign assistance department would have negative consequences. The article calls for improving the F process instead of pursuing these alternatives. The Adams article suggests enhancing the Foreign Assistance (F) process by elevating the importance of the DFA, establishing capabilities within USAID and State Department bureaus, and linking resource needs to strategic goals. The studies recommend expanding the F process's authority to cover all U.S. foreign assistance actors, programs, and policies for better coherence. Transparency in aid eligibility criteria and resource allocation is also advised to promote long-term development. One commentator argues that resources should be allocated to encourage long-term development over short-term political gains, which are more common under the current Foreign Assistance Framework (FAF). There is a consensus among U.S. government and foreign aid experts that underfunded and understaffed civilian aid agencies compromise the overall capacity for foreign assistance programs. Studies recommend increasing resources for civilian agencies involved in foreign assistance to improve institutional capability and meet challenges effectively. Certain recommendations call for the use of \"smart power\" in foreign assistance, making civilian agencies central to national security strategy and requiring increased funding. There are concerns about the growing role of the Department of Defense in foreign assistance, with calls for responsibility to be shifted back to civilian agencies with enhanced capabilities. Recommendations focus on boosting capacity and capability in civilian foreign assistance agencies through funding for personnel, training, and expertise retention, as well as investing in core competencies like management, resource planning, monitoring and evaluation, human resources, procurement, and emergency response. Several studies emphasize the importance of integration and coordination among foreign assistance actors within the U.S. government to improve aid effectiveness. Recommendations include policy and agency integration beyond the limited coordination of the current process. Some studies focus on integration between the State Department and USAID, suggesting alignment of policy and programs with foreign trade, investment, and other policies to create a seamless engagement with foreign countries. Several studies recommend integrating individual foreign assistance programs to improve aid effectiveness. They suggest establishing funding structures that require interagency cooperation and maintaining civilian leadership for foreign assistance, while also increasing State Department capacity for stabilization and reconstruction assistance. Additionally, coordination among foreign assistance, trade, foreign investment, debt relief, financial stabilization, and economic sanctions policies is advised to prevent conflicting strategies. Lael Brainard of the Brookings Institution emphasized the need for coordinated sanctions policies to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. international development efforts. Concerns exist regarding the lack of interaction between policymakers in Washington and those implementing foreign aid programs in the field, with recommendations for increased input from the field in forming foreign aid policy. One study suggests creating a structured engagement between Washington and foreign assistance actors in the field to improve policy formulation. It recommends increasing expertise in foreign aid programming and budgeting within the State Department's regional bureaus and country desks. The current budgeting for foreign assistance is fragmented across different government agencies, and three studies propose unifying all foreign assistance spending in the President's budget presented to Congress. Foreign assistance spending across various government agencies and types, including economic, development, humanitarian, security, and military assistance, is a key focus. Recommendations include consolidating funds from current foreign assistance accounts under the State Department and creating a national security budget integrating diplomacy, economic policy, defense, development, and intelligence spending for a more strategic approach. Critics highlight the limitations of the current aid funding system, which prioritizes short-term political objectives and disproportionately benefits middle-income countries. Many studies recommend that aid allocation should be driven by the recipient country's needs, tailored to fit individual circumstances, and dependent on the country's commitment to development. Direct aid to governments should increase based on their ability to implement transparent strategies. Close coordination with recipient countries is crucial for providing effective assistance. Several studies recommend multiyear budgeting for foreign assistance to align resources with strategy, provide aid predictability, and balance long-term development aid with immediate humanitarian needs. This approach aims to ensure effective aid allocation based on recipient country needs and promote local ownership of aid for recipient country development. One study suggests long-range budgeting for foreign assistance should be mandated by the President and executed by the Director of Foreign Assistance at the State Department through the F process, in cooperation with the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget. Another calls for multiyear budgeting to be part of a formal quadrennial foreign assistance review to improve aid strategy. These studies argue that long-range aid budgeting would enhance the effective allocation of U.S. foreign assistance and help achieve overall strategic goals. Observers note an overemphasis on short-term aid goals that hinders long-term effectiveness. The studies highlight the need to balance short-term and long-term aid in U.S. foreign assistance reform. They suggest that the focus on short-term national security and foreign policy goals hinders long-term development objectives. One study proposes using the Economic Support Fund for immediate economic needs and keeping it separate from the Development Assistance account, which should fund longer-horizon development programs. The 2005 OECD report suggests increasing long-term development aid to stable countries to counterbalance short-term assistance to crisis countries. Atwood, McPherson, and Natsios call for a balance of short-term and development assistance within individual country aid plans. The U.S. official development assistance (ODA) to multilateral organizations has decreased significantly. Studies recommend increasing funding and participation in multilateral institutions for foreign assistance. The United States is urged to prioritize multilateral forms of aid in its foreign assistance strategy to leverage its influence and encourage greater aid contributions from other countries. One study suggests that increased U.S. participation in multilateral aid organizations would reduce the burden on recipient countries by pooling funds with other donor nations. Foreign aid experts criticize the U.S. government's evaluation of aid programs, calling for better monitoring and evaluation based on measurable impact and strategic goals. They recommend a comprehensive and unified assessment system across agencies for a results-based evaluation. Several studies recommend involving Congress in the evaluation process of foreign aid, linking benchmarks to budget requests for security assistance, and requiring strategic planning and annual reports. They also call for increased assessment training for USAID and State Department personnel. Congress's role in foreign aid is primarily through the power of the purse, with half of the studies suggesting an increased role for Congress in decision-making. Overall, the studies advocate for a more robust relationship between Congress and the executive branch on foreign assistance issues. Recommendations for Congress include increased oversight powers in exchange for greater flexibility for the executive branch on foreign assistance issues. This involves resuming the passage of annual foreign assistance authorization legislation, abolishing restrictive agency operating accounts, restoring a presidential foreign aid contingency fund, and improving efficiency and accountability of reprogramming for foreign aid funds. Other suggestions include requiring comprehensive cross-agency foreign assistance budgets to be submitted to Congress and creating congressional select committees on national security for a more inclusive assessment of foreign aid. Some recommendations for Congress on foreign assistance include increased oversight powers in exchange for executive branch flexibility, establishing new permanent funds for humanitarian aid, and improving efficiency and accountability of reprogramming foreign aid funds. Experts view U.S. foreign assistance as valuable for addressing poverty, hunger, and national security goals, but agree that reforms are needed for effectiveness. Enhancing civilian agency resources is a key recommendation supported by all studies surveyed. The report highlights recommendations for Congress on foreign assistance, including raising development to equal status with diplomacy and defense, increasing needs-based foreign aid, and expanding Congress's role in oversight. Some experts view the growing role of the Department of Defense in foreign aid as concerning. Congress is advised to hold more aid hearings earlier in the legislative process and negotiate funding levels with the executive branch before the budget process. The report provides recommendations for Congress on foreign assistance, including establishing a national foreign aid strategy and increasing resources to civilian agencies. Some recommendations, like creating a cabinet-level department for foreign aid, would require legislation, while others, such as improving agency coordination, could result in savings. Some recommendations for reforming U.S. foreign aid include creating a unified budget, improving agency coordination, monitoring aid impact, balancing long-term versus short-term aid, increasing needs-driven aid, and local ownership of aid programs. The 111th Congress is considering various reform possibilities amidst economic constraints and other major concerns. The existing foreign aid structure should be continued with minor modifications and increased resources. Concerns include regional desk officers fearing aid funding redirection, embassies feeling excluded and demanding transparency, USAID worrying about fund reallocation, and Congress feeling left out of the F bureau creation process. Committees in Congress feel they were not consulted early on in the creation of the F bureau and had to figure out how the new structure fit the budget accounts established by legislation. Critiques include concerns about reviving USAID leading to conflicts with the State Department, and the potential negative impact of a cabinet-level Department of Development on policy direction and resource control in foreign aid programs. The author argues against creating a separate Department of Development, stating that it could lead to a decrease in development assistance. Instead, he recommends building on existing structures at the State Department and USAID to improve strategic planning for foreign assistance. The author suggests improving strategic planning for foreign assistance by assigning personnel with strategic thinking skills to the Office of Civil and Foreign Service, enhancing engagement between Washington and the field, and involving Congress in budget submissions. Additionally, the author proposes making the Director of Foreign Assistance a second Deputy Secretary of State and transferring operational budgeting responsibilities to a Deputy Secretary of State for Operations to increase oversight and accountability. The author recommends enhancing strategic planning for foreign assistance by creating a pilot project for long-range planning and budgeting, establishing a foreign assistance strategic planning process within the State Department, and strengthening resource planning capabilities in regional bureaus. These steps aim to improve State's effectiveness in foreign relations and increase oversight and accountability. The journal article by three former USAID Administrators argues for restructuring U.S. foreign aid policy to address organizational chaos and neglect. They propose creating a cabinet-level agency or restoring USAID's autonomy to elevate the stature of U.S. foreign assistance. The article suggests restructuring U.S. foreign aid policy by possibly using the Millennium Challenge Act for aid eligibility, rewriting the outdated Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, elevating development to the level of defense and diplomacy, creating a cabinet-level agency for development, giving USAID more authority and resources, allowing USAID to devise overall strategy, and increasing field office input for more effective aid programs. The testimony by Lael Brainard from the Brookings Institution emphasizes the need to decentralize aid programs, customize aid to recipient countries, prevent short-term aid programs, and increase Congress's role in establishing a new USAID. U.S. foreign aid is crucial for helping the poor and promoting national security and interests. The witness, Ms. Brainard, highlights the inefficiencies in the outdated U.S. foreign aid infrastructure, recommending reforms such as elevating the development mission, investing in civilian capabilities, supporting country ownership, achieving policy coherence, and reducing the number of agencies involved. She suggests creating a cabinet-level voice for development to streamline aid efforts. Ms. Brainard recommends reforms in U.S. foreign aid infrastructure, including elevating the development mission and creating a cabinet-level voice for development. The book \"Security by Other Means\" provides a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign assistance, covering various topics such as strengthening development assistance and analyzing security and strategic aspects. The book \"Security by Other Means\" analyzes U.S. foreign assistance, highlighting the need for a more effective structure due to fragmentation and incoherence. Recommendations are made to create a unified framework for foreign aid to address security challenges. Task Force recommends a unified framework for U.S. foreign assistance, integrating soft power and development tools to address diplomatic, strategic, and humanitarian needs. Assistance types would be coordinated to provide a comprehensive package tailored to recipient countries, including support for repressive regimes within broader assistance packages. The Task Force recommends a unified framework for U.S. foreign assistance, integrating soft power and development tools to address diplomatic, strategic, and humanitarian needs. This includes a comprehensive country assistance package that addresses economic and political issues through coordinated interagency action. Congress would integrate its committees dealing with armed forces and foreign aid for coherent policy and funding, while also extending oversight over foreign assistance programs for greater flexibility in adapting aid to changing conditions. Recommendations are provided for improving the effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance through better governmental organization and executive branch relationship with Congress. The final chapter outlines six central challenges in organizing foreign assistance within the executive branch, including the need for rationalization of agencies, improved coordination, and mission clarification. It emphasizes the importance of restructuring program design based on objectives and needs, promoting a unified voice on foreign aid, incentivizing interagency cooperation, and investing in core foreign assistance competencies. The chapter recommends creating a new department for global development to improve coordination and elevate development alongside defense and diplomacy. It suggests passing annual foreign assistance authorization legislation and increasing flexibility for the use of funds. The Center for Global Development suggests modernizing foreign assistance by increasing flexibility in fund usage, abolishing restrictive accounts, and establishing a small presidential contingency fund. They argue that current foreign assistance programs are insufficient in addressing global poverty and inequality despite efforts made by the George W. Bush Administration. The author recommends developing a national foreign assistance strategy that elevates global development as critical to our national interest, merging foreign assistance programs into a new cabinet-level department, reforming the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and establishing a stronger partnership between the executive branch and Congress for greater accountability and flexibility in aid agencies. The article suggests improving the allocation of U.S. foreign assistance by prioritizing multilateral channels, increasing quantity, and ensuring greater accountability. Currently, 44% of aid goes to six countries, while 56% is distributed among nearly 100 others, with 40% going to middle-income countries and only 34% to low-income countries. The CGE policy framework emphasizes the importance of a \"smart power\" approach for presidential candidates, highlighting the need for increased diplomacy and foreign assistance to build a better, safer world. This integrated approach includes diplomacy, development, economic policy, defense, and intelligence capabilities. The smart power framework proposes that the United States use an improved diplomatic capacity to develop more integrated relationships with other countries and institutions to address development and security challenges. It recommends expanding cultural and exchange programs, the Peace Corps, and strengthening cooperation with NGOs, universities, and the private sector. The Administration should reorganize national foreign policy, authorize the President to develop a national security strategy integrating diplomacy, development, economic policy, defense, and intelligence. The smart power framework proposes integrating diplomacy, development, economic policy, defense, and intelligence capabilities in the national security budget. It suggests elevating development to the level of defense and diplomacy, creating a new cabinet-level department for foreign assistance, and restructuring the Foreign Service for better alignment with regional military commands. Additionally, it recommends increasing funding for foreign assistance to address stability in conflict states and streamlining the bureaucracy for flexibility in meeting challenges. The CSIS report recommends streamlining foreign assistance bureaucracy for flexibility, amending the Foreign Assistance Act, aligning trade and agricultural policies with assistance strategies, and conducting quadrennial strategy reviews. It also discusses the Department of Defense's involvement in nontraditional security assistance like counter-terrorism and humanitarian aid. The Task Force recommends a new approach to military's role in foreign assistance, with DOD providing short-term contingency assistance while State Department leads a cross-agency strategy for security assistance. Increased funding for State and USAID capabilities is also advised. The Task Force recommends increased funding for State and USAID capabilities to restore balance among DOD, State Department, and USAID. Transparent plans and budgeting are essential for effective oversight and development of efficient budgeting models for comprehensive assistance funding. The HELP Commission Report on Foreign Assistance Reform highlights the broken U.S. foreign assistance system and emphasizes the importance of long-term development. The HELP Commission recommends rewriting the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to reflect new development goals, provide more assistance to private sectors in developing countries, engage new non-governmental partners, align trade and development policies, and strengthen management capacity of U.S. assistance agencies. The United States should enhance monitoring and evaluation, human resources, and procurement capabilities of agencies involved in foreign aid to improve effectiveness. Reorganization of U.S. international affairs functions is recommended to elevate foreign aid to equal status with defense and diplomacy. Funding should be based on the needs of developing countries and U.S. national interests. The Commission also suggests forging a new executive/legislative branch relationship, bolstering humanitarian efforts, and establishing accountability. The policy paper discusses the need for a Cabinet-level Department for Global and Human Development to improve U.S. foreign assistance, which is described as badly broken and in need of repair. Key recommendations include creating a $500 million humanitarian fund, simplifying funding structures, clarifying DOD's role in development assistance, and emphasizing local infrastructure and agriculture. The report recommends elevating development to the level of defense and diplomacy, emphasizing collaboration and cooperation, achieving long-term objectives, rewriting the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, promoting local self-sufficiency, and increasing recruiting and training of human resources. The report highlights new initiatives in U.S. foreign policy, including Transformational Diplomacy and the role of the Defense Department in foreign aid. It praises U.S. as the largest donor of humanitarian assistance but notes that aid concentration in Iraq and Afghanistan lacks predictability. The OECD DAC identifies deficiencies in U.S. foreign assistance, such as organizational fragmentation and underutilization of multilateral avenues for aid delivery. The report criticizes the diminishing role of USAID in providing ODA, lack of funding for economic development, and issues with results-based monitoring. It also highlights concerns about Congress's legislative directives that reduce aid flexibility. The DAC recommends elevating development to the same level as diplomacy and defense in U.S. foreign policy, expanding the Foreign Assistance Framework, and increasing public awareness of development programs. The report calls for major reform in U.S. foreign aid to improve aid volume and distribution, balance assistance for crisis and long-term development, enhance multilateral assistance, and adopt a unified, results-based management approach for better aid effectiveness. The integration of development under military control in U.S. national security strategy prioritizes short-term goals over long-term development of recipient countries. Revamping foreign aid to empower citizens and strengthen states can lead to a safer world. The securitization of aid is highlighted, with a focus on fostering effective governance in counterinsurgency operations. Military organizations like AFRICOM are increasingly involved in aid efforts. The study recommends reform actions to prioritize development in national security, enact a new Foreign Assistance Act, create a Department of Foreign Assistance, establish a national development strategy, rebuild USAID or create a new agency, increase nonproject aid to governments with credible development strategies, allow multiyear aid commitments, and untie U.S. foreign aid. SFRC1 \u2014Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Embassies as Command Posts in the Anti-terror Campaign, December 15, 2006. The committee report from December 15, 2006 recommends that Ambassadors should have the authority to approve all humanitarian, development, and military-related programs, including security assistance under Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary of State should ensure that all security assistance, including Section 1206 funding, falls under their authority. The Secretary of State should have authority over all security assistance, including Section 1206 funding, in the new process for prioritizing foreign assistance. Country team meetings should include military representatives for countries receiving military funding to maintain a civilian/military balance. Congress should fund civilian foreign affairs agencies at the requested level to prevent military encroachment. The Administration should develop a comprehensive budget for foreign assistance covering economic, development, humanitarian, security, and military aid. The report recommends that programs should be funded through foreign assistance accounts administered by the Department of State, with the Secretary of State retaining primary authority over planning and implementation. There is a lack of overall agreement on foreign assistance strategy between Washington and overseas posts, with complaints centering on transparency, paperwork, priorities, and inconsistent demands. Despite concerns, embassy officials believe they are managing well and welcome new programs with additional funding. The report suggests that the President should design a national foreign assistance plan. The report recommends the President design a national foreign assistance strategy emphasizing national security and humanitarian needs. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with USAID, should implement the strategy ensuring aid aligns with U.S. foreign policy interests. Additionally, the Secretary of State should secure necessary funds, provide direction, transparency, and accountability for foreign assistance. The report criticizes the flawed implementation of these efforts through the \"F\" process. The USAID should be strengthened and given resources to attract top development experts. Ambassadors must ensure balanced and effective implementation of foreign aid strategy. Congress should provide funding for security assistance in the foreign affairs budget. Migration of foreign assistance functions to DOD should be avoided due to inadequate budget requests. Congress should oversee the effective spending of foreign aid. The State 2025 Working Group's final report emphasizes the need for a more robust and strategically focused Department of State to address anticipated global challenges. Recommendations include integrating planning offices and technology infrastructures with USAID, merging overlapping bureaus, and co-locating related offices in Washington, D.C. to enhance strategies and operations. The State 2025 Working Group's final report recommends integrating planning offices and technology infrastructures with USAID, merging overlapping bureaus, and co-locating related offices in Washington, D.C. to align strategies and operations. It also suggests establishing senior-level responsibility for reconstruction and stabilization activities, expanding U.S. global presence, and increasing staff resources for both State and USAID. Atwood, J. Brian, M. Peter McPherson, and Andrew Natsios discuss the effectiveness of foreign aid in their article \"Arrested Development.\" Lael Brainard provides a witness statement on foreign aid reform to the U.S. Congress. The Center for Global Development presents a report on modernizing foreign assistance for the 21st century. Foreign Assistance for the 21st Century: An Agenda for the Next U.S. President is a report by various organizations such as the Center for U.S. Global Engagement and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, focusing on development and security assistance reform. The HELP Commission Report on Foreign Assistance Reform by the United States Commission on Helping to Enhance the Livelihood of People Around the Globe is also highlighted. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and papers from organizations like InterAction, OECD, Oxfam America, and the U.S. Congress on the need for a Cabinet-level Department for Global and Human Development, reforming U.S. foreign aid, and utilizing embassies in the anti-terror campaign. The curr_chunk provides information on reports and papers from organizations like InterAction, OECD, Oxfam America, and the U.S. Congress regarding the need for a Cabinet-level Department for Global and Human Development, reforming U.S. foreign aid, and utilizing embassies in the anti-terror campaign."
