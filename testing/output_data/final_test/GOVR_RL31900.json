    "content": "More than 30 years ago, states agreed to control trade related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to complement the agreements comprising the nonproliferation regime. Supplier controls can slow, deter, and make WMD acquisition more difficult for proliferators. Some key states do not participate in the regimes, allowing proliferating states like North Korea, Pakistan, and India to reproduce and sell WMD technologies abroad. When export controls fail, U.S. laws impose penalties on countries, entities, or persons. Penalties for proliferation activities are imposed by U.S. laws through various provisions, including penalties for enrichment or reprocessing trade. The Symington and Glenn amendments strengthened penalties in 1976 and 1977, with additional penalties added for nuclear detonations. Missile proliferation-related sanctions were established in 1990, and the U.S. government also imposes sanctions through executive orders. In October 2002, the Bush Administration revealed North Korea's uranium enrichment program and implicated Pakistan in a missiles-for-nuclear technology trade. Sanctions were imposed on North Korean and Pakistani entities for cooperation in missiles in March 2003. Despite concerns, the State Department stated that cooperation between the two countries was in the past. In late 2003, events involving nuclear safeguards inspections in Iran and Libya's decision to renounce its nuclear program unfolded. In late 2003, nuclear safeguards inspections in Iran and Libya's renouncement of its WMD programs provided evidence of Pakistani scientists supplying nuclear technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. A.Q. Khan confessed to his proliferation misdeeds in February 2004 and was pardoned by President Musharraf. President Bush mentioned Khan in a speech on proliferation in February 2004, while Musharraf admitted to selling nuclear technology to North Korea in his memoirs in September 2006. President Bush, in a speech at the National Defense University in February 2004, accused A.Q. Khan and his associates of selling nuclear technologies to outlaw regimes from North Africa to the Korean Peninsula. Khan provided Iran, Libya, and North Korea with designs for Pakistan's centrifuges. Both North Korea and Pakistan have faced sanctions for their involvement in WMD trade. North Korea has been under sanctions for nearly fifty years, while Pakistan has been sanctioned intermittently for importing WMD technology and testing nuclear devices. The sanctions on North Korea's Changgwang Sinyong Corporation were imposed for its role in transferring Category I weapons. The sanctions on Khan Research Laboratories, a Pakistani entity, were imposed for involvement in the transfer of Category I missiles. Sanctions on North Korea and Pakistan for WMD trade have been imposed in the past. Despite initial appearances, North Korea and Pakistan have a history of trading conventional armaments, especially during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran's sale of Scuds and production capabilities were crucial. North Korea, despite signing the NPT, never fulfilled its obligations and withdrew from the treaty in 2003. It is believed to possess nuclear weapons and may increase its arsenal. North Korea tested a nuclear device in 2006, but experts doubt its success. They are believed to have biological weapons and export ballistic missiles for hard currency. In contrast, Pakistan relies on outside technology for its weapons programs. Pakistan relies on outside technology for its weapons programs but is not considered a major exporter of WMD-related items. The involvement of the Pakistani military and government in Khan's nuclear deals is uncertain. Despite rejecting the NPT and testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan is party to the BWC and the CWC. The U.S. Department of Defense believes Pakistan has the resources for limited BW research and likely possesses chemical weapons. Pakistan has sought missile program assistance from North Korea and China. Proliferation by newly WMD-acquiring states is seen as inevitable due to technology diffusion, lack of political will for controls, and demand driven by perceived threats or WMD prestige. North Korea and Pakistan had advanced technology in ballistic missiles and uranium enrichment by the mid-1990s. Pakistan could potentially help North Korea obtain nuclear weapons using highly enriched uranium, bypassing agreements with the United States. Concerns about North Korea's interest in uranium enrichment date back to the mid-1980s, with reports of procurement of related equipment. This route would be difficult to detect using satellite imagery. In the mid-1980s, North Korea obtained equipment for uranium enrichment, including an annealing furnace from a German company. German intelligence investigations revealed that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea received uranium melting information from Pakistan. Technicians from the German company were suspected of transferring equipment and information to North Korea. Subsidiaries of the company also exported centrifuge-related welding equipment to Iraq in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s, North Korea obtained centrifuge-related welding equipment from German companies. The Agreed Framework did not address uranium enrichment directly, but North Korea was prohibited from possessing plutonium reprocessing or uranium enrichment facilities by a 1992 agreement with South Korea. In 1998, the US sent a team to Kumchang-ni to investigate potential nuclear activities, but the site was deemed non-nuclear. In 1999, signs of North Korean interest in uranium enrichment emerged. Despite denials, CIA Director George Tenet stated in 2004 that North Korea was likely pursuing a uranium enrichment program with technology from AQ Khan. North Korea has not admitted to having such a program during six-party talks. The CIA distributed a one-page white paper to Congress in November 2002, revealing new information on North Korean uranium enrichment capabilities. The paper stated that North Korea began a centrifuge-based uranium enrichment program in 2000 and was constructing a plant capable of producing weapons-grade uranium for multiple nuclear weapons annually by mid-decade. The Deputy Director of National Intelligence's report does not mention North Korean uranium enrichment activity or capability. Media reports suggest the CIA has evidence of construction, but it is ambiguous whether this information comes from a defector. Former U.S. ambassador Donald Gregg also commented on the situation. According to former U.S. ambassador Donald Gregg, North Korea is a challenging target for intelligence agencies. The CIA is unsure of North Korea's uranium enrichment location, but possible sites have been narrowed down to three. One defector claimed North Korea had a secret uranium processing site under Mt. Chun-Ma. Commercial satellite images show tunnel entrances at Hagap. Detecting clandestine uranium enrichment is more challenging than detecting plutonium production due to the lack of distinct features in uranium enrichment plants. While plutonium facilities have telltale signatures, such as specific shapes and connections to power sources, uranium enrichment plants often do not exhibit these characteristics. For example, gaseous diffusion plants are large and require significant electricity, making them easier to detect, while centrifuge plants can be small and emit minimal environmental signals. Pakistan may have provided assistance to North Korea in developing centrifuge plants for uranium enrichment. The aid reportedly included a design package and actual rotor exports. North Korean efforts to procure materials from various countries, including Pakistan, were detected by the United States. A Pakistani official mentioned that North Korea ordered centrifuge components from 1997 to 2000. Pakistan may have provided assistance to North Korea in developing centrifuge plants for uranium enrichment, including P-1 centrifuge components ordered from 1997 to 2000. The scope of Pakistan's cooperation with Libya and Iran raises questions about further assistance from Khan to North Korea. North Korea's acquisition of uranium enrichment capability is significant given its plutonium-based nuclear weapons. North Korea has completed reprocessing spent fuel, potentially increasing its plutonium stockpile for 5 to 6 weapons. It lacks a completed enrichment plant but could produce HEU with thousands of centrifuges. The larger reactor at Yongbyon is in disrepair, and North Korea could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons. North Korea could potentially produce enough weapons-grade uranium for two or more nuclear weapons per year when its enrichment plant is fully operational. Concerns arise about whether North Korea received a nuclear weapons design similar to what Libya obtained, which included Chinese text and instructions for assembling a vintage-1960s HEU implosion device. This could provide North Korea with a significant advantage for its nuclear weapons program. North Korea's centrifuge enrichment program may make its arsenal less vulnerable to military strikes due to the difficulty in detecting such facilities. The production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium could allow for the development of more sophisticated nuclear weapons. Pakistan has two distinct missile development programs, one run by PNDC in collaboration with SUPARCO. Pakistan's missile development program, led by PNDC in collaboration with SUPARCO and PAEC, has focused on solid-fueled ballistic missiles since the 1980s. The Hatf series includes short to medium-range missiles, with some believed to have benefitted from Chinese and European assistance. Pakistan's missile development program, led by PNDC in collaboration with SUPARCO and PAEC, has focused on solid-fueled ballistic missiles since the 1980s. The Hatf series includes short to medium-range missiles, with some believed to have benefitted from Chinese and European assistance. The Hatf 4 (Shaheen 1) may be based on Chinese M-11s, while the Hatf 6 (Shaheen 2) with a 2000-km range was tested in early March 2004. Khan Research Laboratories headed the second development program, with reports suggesting alignment between ballistic missile and nuclear warhead efforts. KRL cooperated with North Korea in developing the Ghauri (Hatf 5) around 1993, a liquid-propellant, nuclear-capable, 1500km-range ballistic missile successfully flight-tested in April 1998. Pakistan now fields approximately 5 to 10 Ghauri missiles. Pakistan developed the Ghauri 1 missile with North Korean assistance in the 1980s. The missile, similar to Iran's Shahab, was likely coordinated between Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea in 1993. There were visits between Pakistani officials and North Korea for missile development, with reports of missile assembly sets being sent to Pakistan. North Korea denies these claims. Between 1994 and 1997, 5 to 12 No Dong missile assembly sets were allegedly sent to Pakistan from North Korea, which North Korea denies. Flights from North Korea to Pakistan increased in early 1998, with about 9 flights per month, following visits of high-level North Korean officials to Pakistan. A.Q. Khan made 13 visits to North Korea in the 1990s, and it is believed that Pakistan received between 12 and 25 complete No Dong missiles in the late 1990s. There are speculations that Pakistan may have assisted North Korea in developing solid propellant technology. The Taepo Dong 1 missile, flight-tested in August 1998, reportedly had a solid-propellant stage, with both Iranian and Pakistani personnel present during the test. Iran and Pakistan have shown interest in space launch vehicles. Iran and Pakistan have shown interest in space launch vehicles. Pakistan's Ghauri 1 missiles increase its ability to target India and deploy nuclear warheads. The Ghauri exceeds the MTCR standard for a nuclear-capable missile. A.Q. Khan has stated that the Ghauri is Pakistan's only nuclear-capable missile, with the Ghauri 2 still in development. The Ghauri 2 missile, still in development, will have a range of 1800-3000km, capable of reaching major Indian cities with large payloads. The Ghauri missiles, using liquid propellant, are less easily deployed than the Shaheen 1 and 2 missiles. The Shaheens, based on Chinese M-11s, are easier to prepare, require fewer support vehicles and personnel, and are more accurate than the Ghauris. There are reports that the Ghauri missiles may be replaced by the Shaheens. North Korea adhered to a missile testing moratorium from 1999 to 2006, but resumed testing in 2006 with a failed Taepo-Dong-2 launch. North Korea's renewed missile testing could impact North Korean-Pakistani missile cooperation, but the extent is uncertain due to unknown objectives. Pakistan may seek to enhance its missiles' payload, accuracy, and mobility, potentially turning to Chinese rather than North Korean assistance. The origins of Pakistan's nuclear collaboration with North Korea are unclear, with reports of equipment passing through Pakistan in the past. In 1986, Swiss officials seized equipment en route to Pakistan that could be used for uranium enrichment. The uranium enrichment information may have been diverted from the German partner in URENCO to Pakistan via Switzerland and then reexported to North Korea. Nuclear cooperation between Pakistan and North Korea accelerated in the 1990s, with exchanges of scientists and engineers. Khan's nuclear deals may have piggybacked onto missile cooperation, providing more opportunities in the mid- and late-1990s. North Korea reportedly ordered P-1 centrifuge components from Pakistan from 1997 to 2000. Pakistan reorganized some of its nuclear programs following the May 1998 tests. Pakistan restructured its nuclear programs after the May 1998 tests, becoming a \"declared\" nuclear weapons state. Regulations were issued for controlling nuclear exports, requiring a \"no objection certificate\" from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission for commercial exports of nuclear material. The advertisement listed items such as uranium, thorium, plutonium, and other radioactive materials for export. The advertisement listed items useful for a nuclear weapons program, including nuclear-grade graphite, reactor equipment, neutron flux measuring equipment, gas centrifuges, UF6 mass spectrometers, and frequency changers. The advertisement listed items for a nuclear weapons program, including nuclear-grade graphite, reactor equipment, neutron flux measuring equipment, gas centrifuges, UF6 mass spectrometers, and frequency changers. Pakistan's Ministry of Commerce retracted regulations allowing fissile material exports after U.S. State Department intervention. Ministry of Defense agencies in Pakistan are exempt from export controls, potentially enabling weapons programs to bypass regulations. U.S. officials raised concerns about nuclear technology transfers between Pakistan and North Korea in 2000. In 2000, suspicions arose about nuclear technology transfers between Pakistan and North Korea, leading to an investigation that uncovered large deposits of money in KRL scientists' personal bank accounts. A.Q. Khan was removed from his position as head of KRL in March 2001, but retained as a presidential adviser until early 2004. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage suggested retired nuclear agency employees could be spreading technology to other states, causing confusion about the extent of cooperation, which was later clarified to be limited to missile cooperation. Pakistani officials initially denied the allegations of October 2002. After initial denials, Pakistani officials eventually acknowledged limited missile cooperation with North Korea in response to suspicions of nuclear technology transfers in 2000. Secretary of State Powell emphasized President Musharraf's assurance that Pakistan was not engaging in improper activities with North Korea, highlighting a new relationship with the country. In 2004, Khan admitted to inappropriate contact between Pakistan and North Korea, raising questions about Pakistani government involvement in nuclear assistance. Khan alleged military officials knew of transfers, with some accounts implicating top generals. Pakistani officials claim transfers were personal, not government-sanctioned, possibly explaining why the Bush Administration did not impose sanctions. Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kelly stated in a letter that the Administration reviewed the facts carefully. President Musharraf suspected Khan's cooperation with North Koreans as early as 1999, dampening rumors of nuclear secrets trading with North Korea by stating purchases were made with money. This could implicate the Pakistani military and government, potentially affecting U.S. aid decisions and triggering sanctions. In 1996, Pakistan's foreign currency reserve crisis led to a barter arrangement to avoid defaulting on external debt. The following year, visits of North Korean and Pakistani officials raised concerns about missile cooperation and WMD trade, posing policy questions for Congress on nonproliferation oversight and counterterrorism strategy. The need for leverage outside traditional nonproliferation frameworks is highlighted in dealing with North Korea and Pakistan, with China and potential US-Pakistan counterterrorism cooperation as sources. The roles of sanctions, interdiction, and intelligence are crucial in addressing secondary proliferation, with mixed effectiveness seen in past cases like Libya renouncing WMDs. Khan's technology trade was alerted through intelligence, while interdiction played a secondary role. Intelligence played a secondary role in Khan's forced retirement in 2001, with unclear effects on trade. Congress should consider improving intelligence capabilities to locate uranium enrichment facilities in North Korea. The WMD trade between North Korea and Pakistan raises concerns about proliferation threats and the security of the US and its allies. The nexus of proliferation of WMD and terrorism poses a significant threat to U.S. security. Concerns exist about North Korea potentially proliferating its nuclear technology, while Pakistan's nuclear weapons are a worry due to terrorist activities on its soil. The security of Pakistani nuclear arsenal from terrorists and the assistance provided by Pakistani nuclear scientists are key nonproliferation concerns. The inadvertent leakage of nuclear know-how poses a serious threat, with concerns about nuclear scientists assisting terrorists or other states. Questions arise about the safety of Pakistan's nuclear program and the alleged nuclear transfers to North Korea. Some argue for evidence of cash transactions instead of nuclear technology exchange, while others call for direct access to Khan to uncover the extent of his activities. The Bush Administration's focus on counterterrorism cooperation since September 2001 is also questioned. Since September 2001, the US has prioritized cooperation on counterterrorism over nonproliferation. Yemen received Scud missiles from North Korea in 2002 but was not sanctioned due to its active cooperation in counterterrorism. The White House indicated that countries assisting North Korea's enrichment program could risk losing US assistance post-9/11. The aftermath of September 11th has shifted the focus towards counterterrorism over nonproliferation. The US faces the challenge of balancing both objectives, with Pakistan being a key ally in the war on terror but raising concerns about its involvement in weapons proliferation."
