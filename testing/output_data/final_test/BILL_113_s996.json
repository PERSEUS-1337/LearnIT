    "content": "The Administrator in this Act refers to the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Section 2 amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to maintain risk premium rates for properties purchased after the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. Section 3 delays flood insurance rate changes. Any changes in risk premium rates for flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program as per the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 will not take effect until the Administrator submits a report on affordability, with a 180-day grace period. The effective date for changes in flood insurance risk premium rates under the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 will be 180 days after the Administrator submits the required information. SEC. 4. STUDIES OF VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY-BASED FLOOD INSURANCE OPTIONS. The Administrator is required to conduct a study on options for voluntary community-based flood insurance policies through the National Flood Insurance Program. The study will analyze how these policies would impact communities with varying economic bases, geographic locations, flood hazard characteristics, and flood management approaches. The Disaster Protection Act of 1973 requires the Administrator to evaluate the feasibility of offering voluntary community-based flood insurance policies to areas of residual risk. The Administrator must consult with the Comptroller General of the United States as needed. A report containing the study results must be submitted to the Senate and House committees within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The report submitted under the Disaster Protection Act of 1973 must include recommendations for incorporating voluntary community-based flood insurance policies into the National Flood Insurance Program and implementing strategies to encourage flood mitigation activities. The Comptroller General must submit a report within 6 months of the Administrator's report submission. The Comptroller General reviews and analyzes the Administrator's report on community-based flood insurance policies, providing comments, recommendations, and additional suggestions to the Senate and House committees. Amendments to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 are proposed. Amendments to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 include provisions regarding the construction, reconstruction, and improvement of flood protection systems, with a focus on excluding the level of Federal funding or participation in the evaluation process. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 includes provisions for the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of flood protection systems. SEC. 6. AFFORDABILITY STUDY. Section 100236 of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 is amended to allow the Administrator to use additional funding sources for carrying out the section, if needed. If the Administrator cannot submit the required report by the specified date, an alternative option is available. If the Administrator cannot submit the required report by the specified date, alternative methods of gathering information will be notified to the relevant committees within 60 days of enactment. The gathered information using the alternative method must be submitted within 180 days of the notification. Upon submission of required information, the subsection (c) requirement will be considered fulfilled. SEC. 7. FACILITIES IN COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS. In this section, definitions include terms like \"coastal high hazard area,\" \"eligible entity,\" \"essential to a community's recovery,\" and \"major disaster.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the provisions outlined in the text. The President declared a disaster under the Stafford Act. Regulations state that actions in coastal high hazard areas are considered substantial improvements if they involve replacing structures damaged in the disaster. The regulations require that replacement structures in coastal high hazard areas must be essential for community recovery, have no alternative location, meet flood-resistant design standards, and have evacuation procedures in place to reduce risks. The regulations mandate that if a practicable alternative outside the coastal high hazard area offers better protection against flood hazards, replacement structures or facilities must be relocated to that site. The original site for the destroyed structure or facility must be deed restricted according to federal regulations. If a replacement structure is rebuilt at the same location, an alternative parcel of land in the coastal high hazard area must be set aside for better flood protection or restoration of coastal floodplains. The section applies to any major disaster declared after the enactment of this Act, providing protection to endangered species, critical habitat, wetlands, or coastal uses."
