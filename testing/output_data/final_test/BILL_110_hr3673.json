    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Trauma Institute Act\". Congress finds that trauma is a significant issue, causing a high number of injuries and deaths in both military and civilian populations. Trauma is a leading cause of death in the United States across all age groups, resulting in a large number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions. The economic impact of trauma is substantial, costing the United States billions of dollars annually. Injuries are a significant global issue, with a projected increase in disability-adjusted life years lost by 2020. Both military and civilian trauma casualties are treated similarly, and focused trauma research can benefit both groups. Despite the high impact of trauma, funding for trauma research is significantly lower compared to other health issues like HIV and cancer. The Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program and National Trauma Institute are addressing the lack of funding for trauma research in military and civilian populations. NTI aims to become the largest military trauma research center in the world by 2011. Defense centers, like NTI, aim to translate battlefield innovations to civilians at home, reducing injuries and deaths for soldiers and civilians. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT. The Secretary of Defense will establish a National Trauma Institute in San Antonio, Texas with the purposes of developing medical technologies for injury prevention and diagnosis, and coordinating trauma research at various medical centers in the area. The National Trauma Institute in San Antonio, Texas will conduct trauma research on injury prevention, triage, resuscitation, bleeding treatment, burn care, head injury, tissue engineering, orthopedics, intensive care unit treatment, rehabilitation, and outcomes. Authorization of $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 for the National Trauma Institute activities, excluding general administrative expenses."
