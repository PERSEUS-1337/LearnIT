The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows disclosure of protected health information to individuals involved in care. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows disclosure of protected health information to family, friends, or others involved in an individual's care if the individual does not object or if it is determined to be in the individual's best interests. HHS released guidance on HIPAA Privacy Rule for disclosing mentally ill individual's PHI to family, law enforcement, or others to prevent harm. Part 2 regulations protect privacy of patient records at alcohol and drug treatment programs. On February 9, 2016, HHS proposed a rule to update Part 2 regulations for electronic exchange of substance abuse treatment records. Congress highlighted the impact of serious mental illness on physical health and the need for clarity on patient information disclosure under HIPAA Privacy Rule.

Funding of $4 million for FY2018 and decreasing amounts for FY2019-FY2022 is authorized for the training programs. Medicaid finances medical services for low-income individuals. Medicaid provides medical services and long-term care for low-income individuals, including children, pregnant women, adults, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly. States have flexibility in covering mandatory and optional populations and services, leading to variation in Medicaid programs. Some states restrict Medicaid payment for multiple encounters in a day at health centers. Title XII addresses Medicaid's same-day services prohibition under the Social Security Act. Title XII of the Social Security Act allows separate payment under Medicaid state plans for mental health and primary care services provided to an individual on the same day. It also mandates a study on Medicaid coverage of mental health treatment for adults aged 22-64 in Institutions for Mental Diseases. The study mandated by Title XII of the Social Security Act requires information on capitated payments for IMD services, number of individuals receiving services, length of stay, determination of services through IMDs, and the impact on capitated payments. HHS Secretary must submit a report to Congress within three years. SSA Section 1115 allows waivers for states to conduct research projects to further Medicaid and CHIP goals. States utilize Section 1115 waiver authority to achieve Medicaid and CHIP goals by covering non-Medicaid and CHIP services, implementing benefit restrictions, capping program enrollment, and testing delivery system reforms. CMS encourages states to leverage this waiver authority, along with other state innovation opportunities, to drive delivery system transformation initiatives focused on integrating physical and behavioral health services and improving access, patient care, and population health while reducing healthcare costs. Title XII (Section 12003) requires the CMS Administrator to issue a State Medicaid Director letter on designing innovative service delivery systems for adults with serious mental illness or children with serious emotional disturbance who receive Medicaid. This includes opportunities for demonstration projects under the SSA Section 1115 waiver authority to improve care for these individuals. The Medicaid IMD exclusion limits federal matching funds for inpatient mental health care, with exceptions for individuals over 65 in IMDs and inpatient psychiatric hospital services for children under 21. The Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration project allows certain IMDs to receive Medicaid payments for services provided to Medicaid enrollees aged 21-64 in psychiatric emergencies. 11 states and the District of Columbia were selected to participate in the demonstration starting July 1, 2012. The Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration project began on July 1, 2012, involving 11 states and the District of Columbia. It was discontinued in August 2016 due to budget neutrality issues. Title XII (Section 12004) requires the collection of specific information from participating states, including data on IMDs receiving Medicaid payments and expenditures under the program. The Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration project started in July 2012 and involved 11 states and the District of Columbia. It was terminated in August 2016 due to budget concerns. Title XII (Section 12004) mandates the collection of data on forensic psychiatric hospitals, disproportionate share hospital payments to IMDs, facilities treating individuals with mental health issues, and emergency department utilization during the project. The HHS Secretary must submit a report to Congress within two years of enactment summarizing and analyzing this information. EPSDT is a required Medicaid benefit providing health screenings and services for children under 21, with states obligated to offer all medically necessary services. Medicaid services, including preventive, dental, mental health, and specialty services, are provided without benefit limits to address health conditions identified through screenings. Title XII (Section 12005) expands EPSDT services to individuals under 21 in inpatient psychiatric hospitals, effective January 1, 2019. States have flexibility in covering optional populations and services, with Medicaid benefits potentially including long-term services and supports (LTSS) for those with disabilities. EPSDT remains a required Medicaid benefit for children under 21, offering all medically necessary services. LTSS such as PCS and HHCS are Medicaid benefits that assist beneficiaries with cognitive disabilities to live independently. H.R. 34 expanded states' ability to provide these services, leading to a rapid increase in Medicaid PCS expenditures. Concerns have been raised about oversight and fraud in HHCS expenditures, prompting the use of EVV systems for verification. Electronic visit verification (EVV) systems are used to verify and document remote activities for Medicaid PCS and HHCS providers. Title XII requires the use of EVV systems by specific deadlines to avoid reductions in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rate. In implementing the Section 12006 requirement for Medicaid PCS and HHCS EVVs, states must consult with relevant agencies and entities to ensure compliance with HIPAA privacy and security requirements. Failure to implement EVV systems may result in reduced FMAP payments for states. States implementing the Section 12006 EVV requirement must have a stakeholder process for input and provide training for PCS and HHCS EVV. States exempt from EVV requirement if already using EVV systems. States making good faith efforts may have a one-year exemption from FMAP reductions. Title XII (Section 12006) provides a one-year exemption from FMAP reductions for states using EVV systems for PCS and HHCS. EVVs capture service details and authorize HHS to cover EVV costs for states requiring providers to use EVV systems. Title XII (Section 12006) requires HHS to collect and share best practices for PCS and HHCS EVV systems by January 1, 2018. It includes training for providers on EVV operation and fraud prevention, as well as educating caregivers and beneficiaries on EVV use and fraud prevention methods. The section also clarifies that there is no employer-employee relationship established between agencies/entities and contracted individuals under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Title XII (Section 12006) does not mandate a specific EVV system for PCS or HHCS agencies, allowing flexibility in provider and beneficiary selection. It also permits states to establish quality measures for EVV implementation. Title XIII addresses mental health parity and eating disorders, including applying mental health parity to eating disorder benefits. The Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) requires group health plans and insurance issuers to ensure mental health benefits are not more restrictive than medical/surgical benefits. Medicaid and CHIP must also comply with certain MHPAEA requirements. The MHPAEA requires compliance with mental health benefit parity in group health plans and insurance issuers, including Medicaid and CHIP. Enforcement involves HHS, Labor, and Treasury, with additional requirements outlined in PHSA Section 2726(a) and Title XIII. Compliance program guidance is mandated to improve adherence to MHPAEA. The compliance program guidance document for MHPAEA must be issued within one year of enactment and updated every two years. It includes illustrative examples of compliance and noncompliance, as well as recommendations. Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury are required to issue guidance to help group health plans and insurance issuers meet MHPAEA requirements, with a public comment period before final guidance is issued. The guidance clarifies information and provides examples of methods for disclosure to ensure compliance. Title XIII (Section 13001) requires Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury to solicit public feedback on improving the disclosure request process, make feedback publicly available, and share it with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. It also mandates auditing of health plan documents for violations of MHPAEA and does not limit the Secretaries' authority to audit documents. Title XIII (Section 13002) mandates the HHS Secretary to convene a public meeting to create an action plan for better federal and state coordination on enforcing MHPAEA and state parity laws. The plan must be finalized within six months of the meeting and include recommendations to Congress. Additionally, Title XIII (Section 13003) requires the Assistant Secretary of Labor to submit reports annually for five years on this matter. Title XIII (Section 13004) mandates reporting of closed federal investigations with MHPAEA violations annually for five years. The Comptroller General must report on MHPAEA compliance among various health plans within three years. Title XIII (Section 13007) extends MHPAEA requirements to eating disorder benefits in group plans. Title XIII (Section 13007) extends MHPAEA requirements to eating disorder benefits in group health plans and insurance coverage, ensuring compliance with MHPAEA regulations. Additionally, Title XIII (Section 13005) empowers the HHS Secretary to raise public awareness on eating disorders and update information on the National Women's Health Information Center website. Furthermore, Title XIII (Section 13006) allows the HHS Secretary to identify model programs for educating health professionals on effective prevention strategies. Subtitle A of the PHSA Section 399Z authorizes activities to educate health professionals on preventing and treating eating disorders, including identifying, intervening, referring, and treating patients. It falls into four categories: changes to grant programs, initiatives, new grant programs, and changes to new initiatives. Subtitle A of the PHSA Section 399Z expands DOJ and DHS programs to assist individuals with mental illness and substance use issues. The Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives.

The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program provides grants for community policing and law enforcement operations, such as hiring community policing officers and establishing school-based partnerships. Subtitle A expands the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program to include mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections initiatives. It allows COPS grants to be used for specialized training for law enforcement officers on interacting with individuals with mental health issues, establishing collaborative programs to address mental health and substance abuse problems, and enhancing corrections officers' ability to address mental health in incarcerated individuals. Grants under the Mental Health Courts program can be awarded for providing judicial supervision over individuals with mental illnesses. Subtitle A expands the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program to include mental health programs and related law enforcement and corrections initiatives. It allows grants under the Mental Health Courts program to be used for providing continuing judicial supervision over offenders with mental illness, a mental handicap, or a co-occurring mental illness and substance use problem, charged with misdemeanors or nonviolent offenses. The program also includes coordinated delivery of services, voluntary mental health treatment with the possibility of dismissal of charges or reduced sentencing upon successful completion, centralized case management, and continuing supervision of treatment plan compliance. Subtitle A of the Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program expands to include mental health programs for offenders with mental illness or substance use issues. Grants can be used for court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment and pretrial service programs to improve outcomes for individuals with mental illness. DOJ can award grants to states, local governments, tribes, and nonprofits for addressing behavioral health needs and risk screening of defendants. The DOJ can award grants for expanding behavioral health screening and assessment in criminal justice systems, promoting the use of risk assessment tools, matching individuals with appropriate programs, identifying those in need of supervision and treatment, and coordinating services among justice agencies and providers. Subtitle A of the intensive supervision services program establishes requirements for grant distribution, accountability, and penalties for noncompliance.
