    "content": "The \"Secure Our Nation's Interior Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for expedited removal. Section 235(b)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to specify conditions for determining inadmissibility of arriving aliens in the United States. The determination of inadmissibility under this paragraph results in removal from the United States without further hearing or review, unless the alien is involved in criminal proceedings or indicates an intention to apply for asylum or fear of persecution. If an alien arriving in the United States indicates an intention to apply for asylum or fear of persecution, they will be referred for an interview by an asylum officer if they have been in the country for less than 1 year. State and local law enforcement personnel have the authority to enforce immigration laws and detain or transfer aliens to federal custody. This authority is not overridden by Congress. The Department of Homeland Security can respond to requests for assistance from state and local law enforcement regarding the custody of illegal aliens. If the Governor of a State requests the Secretary of Homeland Security to take an illegal alien into Federal custody, the Secretary must do so within 48 hours. Alternatively, the Secretary can ask the relevant State or local law enforcement agency to temporarily hold the alien for transfer to Federal custody. The Secretary of Homeland Security must transfer illegal aliens to Federal custody within 48 hours if requested by a State Governor. Reimbursement will be provided to States and localities for expenses incurred in the incarceration and transportation of illegal aliens.
