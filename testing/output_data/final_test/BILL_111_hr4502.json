    "content": "The \"Nanotechnology Education Act\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. It focuses on implementing nanotechnology in schools. The Congress finds that nanotechnology will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing, impacting security, economy, and health positively. The US must maintain leadership in nanoscience and microtechnology to maximize these benefits. In 2007, students on temporary visas earned 33% of all science and engineering doctorates in the US, with foreign students earning 63% of engineering doctorates. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating US students from secondary schools to higher education for research and development. Access to scientific tools and training for teachers and professors is essential for preparing students for careers in nanotechnology. The purpose of this section is to strengthen the capacity of US secondary schools and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary tools and training. Eligible institutions include public, private, parochial, or charter secondary schools offering advanced science courses. The Director of the National Science Foundation is defined as the \"Director\" in this section. The section aims to enhance US schools and colleges' ability to train students for nanotechnology careers through grants for equipment. Eligible institutions include secondary schools offering advanced science courses, community colleges, 4-year higher education institutions, and informal science centers. Qualified nanotechnology equipment must be used for teaching and be mostly manufactured in the US. The Director will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to provide grants for eligible institutions to acquire equipment and software for teaching nanotechnology. Grants will not exceed $400,000 per institution. The nanotechnology in schools program aims to educate students and faculty on nanotechnology, provide educational services, and offer teacher education and certification for technology skills. The program has limitations on the use of funds. The nanotechnology in schools program limits the use of funds for software, educational services, and teacher education. Equipment purchased with grant funds must primarily benefit undergraduate programs. Eligible institutions must submit applications to receive grants. The Director requires institutions to submit grant applications with specified information. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, a procedure for application acceptance will be established. Selection of grant recipients will prioritize geographic diversity. The Director requires institutions to submit grant applications with specified information, prioritizing geographic diversity, historically Black colleges and universities, minority institutions, and institutions in EPSCoR states. Matching requirement and limitation apply. The Director may only award a grant to an eligible institution if the institution agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to 1/4 of the grant amount. Waiver of the matching requirement is possible for institutions with no or low-value endowments. The waiver of the matching requirement is available for institutions with endowments below $5,000,000. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 cannot apply for another grant for 2 years, while other eligible institutions face the same restriction. After receiving a grant under this section, institutions must submit an annual report on grant fund usage within 1 year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year. The Director evaluates activities of institutions receiving grants under this section and assesses their impact on students, faculty, and staff. A report to Congress with recommendations is submitted within 6 months of the evaluation. Authorization of Appropriations.--$40,000,000 is authorized for the Director to support the program under this section in fiscal year 2011, with additional funding as needed for fiscal years 2012 through 2014."
