    "content": "In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy impacted the East Coast of the United States. President Obama declared major disasters for 12 states and the District of Columbia. A request for $60.4 billion in supplemental funding was submitted to Congress on December 7, 2012, to address losses and damages from Hurricane Sandy and future disasters. The proposal included $47.44 billion for disaster assistance and $12.97 billion for mitigation. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 was introduced as an amendment to H.R. 1 of the 112th Congress, requesting $60.41 billion in supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance. The legislation included reforms to disaster assistance authorities and did not explicitly separate mitigation provisions from other relief appropriations. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 included $55 billion in emergency funding and $5.379 billion for disaster relief. A budget point of order removed the emergency designation from $3.461 billion of construction funding. The Senate made changes to the amendment and passed the legislation on December 28, 2012. The House did not act on the legislation before the end of the 112th Congress. One provision increasing the bond limit for the Small Business Administration's Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving Fund became law during the 112th Congress. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 provided $55 billion in emergency funding and $5.379 billion for disaster relief. A provision in P.L. 112-239 increased the bond limit for the Small Business Administration's Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving Fund to $6.5 million, with a potential increase to $10 million if certified necessary by a federal contracting officer. Additionally, H.R. 41 allocated $9.7 billion in borrowing authority for the National Flood Insurance Program, signed into law as P.L. 113-1 on January 6, 2013. H.R. 152 included $17 billion for immediate needs, with an amendment adding $33 billion in funding. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 provided $55 billion in emergency funding and $5.379 billion for disaster relief. An amendment added $33 billion for longer-term recovery efforts and infrastructure improvements. The House passed the amended bill with long-term recovery funding by a vote of 241-180. The Senate passed the bill unchanged on January 28, 2013 by a vote of 62-36, and it was signed into law. The Senate passed H.R. 152 unchanged on January 28, 2013 by a vote of 62-36, and it was signed into law as P.L. 113-2 the next day. Table 1 outlines the Obama Administration's request for supplemental funding and mitigation funding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, with figures in millions of dollars of budget authority. No distinction is made in the table between requested mitigation funding and recovery funding. A breakdown of the Administration's request for mitigation funding is included in CRS Report R42869, FY2013 Supplemental Funding for Disaster Relief. The table outlines the Obama Administration's request for supplemental funding and mitigation funding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. It shows appropriations by bureau or program, along with the requested budget authority in millions of dollars. The enacted column reflects the funding provided in H.R. 152, which was ultimately signed into law as P.L. 113-2. Funding levels were reduced by sequestration under the BCA. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented across-the-board spending cuts in response to sequestration requirements, affecting both defense and nondefense funding. This changed how Congress accounted for federal funding for disaster response and recovery by eliminating additional appropriations for emergency needs. The Budget Control Act (BCA) imposed limits on discretionary spending in budget resolutions, including provisions for disaster relief funding. The law allowed for adjustments to the spending caps based on a 10-year average of federal spending on disaster relief. The continuing resolution signed into law in September 2012 allocated $6.4 billion for disaster relief, the first time such funding was provided under the BCA in response to a major disaster. The Administration sought $6.4 billion in supplemental funding for disaster relief, the first time exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Budget Control Act. The funding was designated as emergency requirements, with a portion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and the rest for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities. Senate-passed H.R. 1 allocated $5,379 million for disaster relief under the BCA, with the remaining funding designated as emergency funding. The bill contained emergency funding for disaster relief and Army Corps of Engineers construction activities. One method to cover additional disaster costs could be through rescissions or other means to reduce the budget impact. Supplemental funding for the Disaster Relief Fund has traditionally been treated as emergency spending without requiring offsets. The Disaster Relief Fund has been used as an offset for disaster assistance provided through other federal entities. The Obama Administration's supplemental request after Hurricane Sandy would have been complicated to offset due to a lack of baseline appropriation and the scale of the offset required. The Obama Administration's request for disaster assistance in FY2012 exceeded the size of the three smallest appropriations bills combined. Despite the Administration's position that funding could be provided without offsets, attempts were made in the House and Senate to offset the costs through cuts to discretionary spending, which ultimately did not pass. The Senate did not agree to offset the cost of H.R. 152 by reducing discretionary spending caps through FY2021. The emergency designation for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities in Senate-passed H.R. 1 allowed $3,461 million to count against FY2013 discretionary budget caps. P.L. 113-2 also treated the $3,461 million for Army Corps of Engineers construction the same way. This expenditure affected the final resolution of FY2013 appropriations to avoid violating budget caps. It is uncommon for a supplemental appropriations bill to focus solely on one event. Appropriations for FEMA's DRF are regularly used for relief efforts from multiple disasters across fiscal years, regardless of the legislative vehicle. Most appropriations in P.L. 113-2 were specified for Hurricane Sandy-related expenses, with the remaining funds designated for disaster relief programs or activities. Funding not covered by this language is detailed in Table 2. During the debate on supplemental funding for Hurricane Sandy, comparisons were made to past disasters like Hurricane Irene, Katrina, and Andrew in terms of impact on life, daily activities, and economies. These comparisons provided perspective on the scale of devastation. Hurricane Sandy, like other major disasters, requires unique federal assistance due to varying capabilities of state, tribal, and local governments. Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate discussed this issue in relation to Hurricane Sandy. Former FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate explained that federal assistance decisions are based on the state's overall need and its ability to address disasters without federal help. The level of assistance depends on the impact on different community sectors, such as business districts or public facilities. The type of assistance provided, like loan assistance from the Small Business Administration, varies based on the specific disaster's effects. The Small Business Administration provides loan assistance for disasters, while FEMA's Public Assistance program offers significant aid. Factors affecting disaster comparability include population density, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, and federal coordination across multiple jurisdictions."
