    "content": "Modelling statistical relationships beyond the conditional mean is crucial in many settings. Conditional density estimation (CDE) aims to learn the full conditional probability density from data. Neural network based CDE models can suffer from overfitting, but a model-agnostic noise regularization method has been developed to address this issue. This method adds random perturbations to the data during training, acting as a smoothness regularization that improves performance across various datasets and CDE models. The effectiveness of noise regularization in neural network based Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) makes it preferable over previous approaches, even with limited training data. CDE focuses on modeling the conditional probability density p(y|x) to understand deviations from the mean and their likelihood. Recent machine learning literature shows interest in high-capacity density models using neural networks. In contrast to previous work on high-capacity density models, which focus on modeling images with large datasets, our interest lies in Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) in settings with limited and noisy data. While traditional regression assumes Gaussian noise, CDE uses expressive distribution families to model deviations from the mean, leading to more severe overfitting. Classical regularization techniques like weight decay have been effective for regression and classification but may not be as useful in the context of CDE where the neural network output controls parameters of a density model. Noise regularization is proposed as a method to address the limitations of standard regularization methods in the parameter space of neural networks for conditional density estimation. By adding small random perturbations to the data during training, the conditional density estimate is smoothed and generalizes better. This approach penalizes very curved or spiky density estimators in favor of smoother variants, proving to be a beneficial inductive bias in various applications. The proposed noise regularization scheme for neural networks in conditional density estimation is shown to be asymptotically consistent and outperforms other regularization methods significantly across various datasets. It is easy to implement, agnostic to model parameterization, and improves upon state-of-the-art non-parametric estimators when properly regularized. Neural network based CDE improves non-parametric estimators with limited training data. Density Estimation involves finding a good estimate of the true density function from observations. Parametric estimation assumes the density function belongs to a parametric family, with maximum likelihood estimation used to estimate parameters. Non-parametric density estimators like kernel density estimation (KDE) use a kernel function to estimate density. The bandwidth parameter h controls the smoothness of the estimated PDF. Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) involves estimating the conditional density function p(y|x) for random variables X and Y. Conditional density estimation (CDE) aims to find an estimate f(y|x) of the true conditional density p(y|x) using a dataset of observations. The KL-divergence objective is minimized w.r.t. \u03b8 in conditional M-projection. Previous work in CDE focuses on high-capacity models with few prior assumptions. Conditional density estimation (CDE) involves estimating conditional probabilities without making prior assumptions. Previous work in CDE focuses on high-capacity models and compares the approach to previous regularization and data augmentation methods. Non-parametric kernel density estimators (KDE) have been studied extensively in statistics and econometrics, with issues such as bandwidth selection and poor generalization in sparse data regions. Various methods have been proposed to estimate conditional probabilities, including combining non-parametric and parametric elements. Non-parametric density estimators struggle with poor generalization in sparse data regions, leading to performance decline with increasing data dimensionality. Recent approaches in machine learning involve using neural networks for conditional density estimation, such as controlling mixture density model parameters. Latent density models like cGANs and cVAEs have shown success in image distribution estimation, but their probability density function is intractable. Normalizing flows offer a more promising solution by providing a tractable PDF. Our regularization approach for neural network based conditional density estimation models aims to prevent overfitting by penalizing strong variations of the log-density. Traditional regularization methods like weight decay and Bayesian priors have been effective in regression and classification tasks, but their impact on density estimation in the context of CDE is less clear. Our approach is agnostic to parameterization and has shown empirical efficacy in controlling the parameters of a normalizing flow model. Adding noise during training is a common scheme that has been proposed in various forms, including noise on neural network weights or activations and additive noise on gradients for scalable MCMC posterior inference. Other research suggests augmenting training data through random and/or adversarial transformations. Our approach transforms training observations. This paper focuses on regularization of Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) by adding small random perturbations to training observations. It builds on previous studies on noise regularization for regression and classification problems, showing that training with noise penalizes strong variations of log-density. This is the first paper to evaluate the efficacy of noise regularization for density estimation, especially in expressive families of conditional densities. Regularization of Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) involves adding noise perturbations to data points during optimization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Unlike in regression or classification, the inductive bias imposed by popular regularization techniques is less clear in the CDE setting. The proposed method replaces original data points with random variables and uses zero-centered noise for optimization. The noise regularization approach in Conditional Density Estimation involves adding zero-centered noise to data points for optimization, generating augmented data sets by perturbing original data. This method is agnostic to whether unconditional or conditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used. When dealing with highly flexible parametric families like Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), the maximum likelihood solution becomes impractical. Instead, numerical optimization techniques such as mini-batch gradient descent are commonly used. Algorithm 1 can be modified into an extension of mini-batch gradient descent on the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) objective, where each mini-batch is perturbed with independent noise before computing the objective function and gradients. This noise can be seen as \"smearing\" the data points during optimization. The presented variable noise in maximum likelihood estimation helps alleviate jaggedness in density estimates from un-regularized objectives. Mathematically analyzing noise perturbations formalizes this intuition. The expected loss from adding random perturbations can be approximated using a second order Taylor expansion. The expected loss in maximum likelihood estimation with variable noise can be approximated using a second order Taylor expansion. Noise perturbations help smooth density estimates from un-regularized objectives, with the noise assumed to be small in magnitude. Maximum likelihood estimation with data noise involves minimizing a loss function that includes a form of smoothness regularization. The regularization term in maximum likelihood estimation with noise perturbations penalizes large negative second derivatives of the conditional log density estimate, smoothing the fitted distribution and preventing over-fitting. The noise regularization controls the sensitivity of the density estimate to changes in the conditional variable, with the intensity determined by the variance of the random perturbations. Training with noise regularization results in smoother density estimates compared to plain maximum likelihood estimation, which leads to strong over-fitting. Training with noise regularization results in smoother density estimates closer to the true conditional density. Asymptotic consistency results are established for the noise regularization, showing convergence to the asymptotic MLE solution under certain regularity conditions. The loss function is defined as a function of \u03b8, with the empirical estimate used as the training objective due to a finite number of samples from p(z). The maximum likelihood estimation with noise regularization involves forming a kernel density estimate of the training data and then projecting it onto the parametric family to find the optimal parameter \u03b8*. This approach results in smoother density estimates and convergence to the asymptotic MLE solution under certain conditions.

The consistency of the procedure is crucial, and the problem is decomposed into sub-problems to show convergence as the sample size increases. Random noise vectors are added to the training data to obtain the kernel density estimate, allowing for flexibility in choosing the number of samples. Summarized chunk: \nThe proof methodology for consistency results in regression with a quadratic loss function is outlined, extending to generic log-likelihood objectives. Bandwidth parameters are crucial for convergence, with integrability assumptions ensuring well-behaved expectations. The full proofs are available in the Appendix. Summarized chunk: \nProposition 1 establishes conditions for the asymptotic behavior of the smoothing sequence in regression. It guides the selection of noise intensity in Algorithm 1. The result shows that using a kernel density estimate instead of empirical data distribution remains consistent for maximum likelihood. The intractable l n (\u03b8) is replaced by its sample estimate l n,r, allowing for precise approximation with arbitrary samples. Theorem 1 establishes consistency for a density model with noise regularization, showing that the parameter vector obtained through optimization is close to the ideal parameter. Asymptotic consistency results are derived in the parameter space, formalizing the concept of closeness and optimality. The concept of closeness and optimality in the parameter space is formalized by defining \u0398 * as the set of global minimizers of the objective function. Algorithm 1 is shown to be asymptotically consistent, converging to the set of optimal parameters \u0398 * under certain conditions. Theorem 2 extends this result to global minimizers of the empirical objective, with implications for compact neighborhoods of local minima. The noise regularization properties involve choosing the optimal noise intensity h for different training data sets. Minimizing the l 1 distance between the kernel density estimate q (h) n and the data distribution p(z) is a key aspect, but finding a general solution is challenging without knowing p(z). When assuming Gaussian distributions for p(z) and the kernel function K, the optimal bandwidth can be calculated as h = 1.06\u03c3n, where \u03c3 is the estimated standard deviation of the data, n is the number of data points, and d is the dimensionality of Z. This formula, known as the rule of thumb, is commonly used. The rule of thumb for choosing the optimal noise intensity h in machine learning involves decay towards zero as data becomes larger. The bandwidth decay rate should be slower than n \u2212 1 d. For non-Gaussian data distributions, a faster decay rate like n \u2212 1 1+d may be more suitable. Experimental analysis is provided to validate the theoretical arguments and assess practical efficacy. In experiments, Gaussian perturbations are used with a noise regularization approach that is model-agnostic. Performance is evaluated on various neural network models using simulated and real-world data sets, including Euro Stoxx stock-market returns. The curr_chunk discusses data sources including Euro Stoxx stock-market returns and UCI datasets, with test log-likelihood scores compared under different schedules of noise regularization. The experiment data and code are available for further reference. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of bandwidth rates on test log-likelihoods for Gaussian Mixture and Skew Normal densities. Bandwidth rates that follow decay conditions converge to non-regularized estimators with large training sets. Fixed bandwidths lead to bias and saturation in performance. Slow decay rates work better for Gaussian-like data, while non-Gaussian data requires faster decay rates. Noise regularization improves estimator performance with limited training data. Regularization techniques, including l1 and l2 penalties, weight decay, and Bayesian neural networks, are compared for improving estimator performance with limited training data. The importance of regularization decreases as training data size increases. The noise regularization scheme outperforms other regularization methods for neural network based CDE models across different datasets and sample sizes. It is agnostic to the model's parameterization and ensures moderate test error, especially with limited training data. Noise regularization outperforms other methods for neural network based CDE models across various datasets and sample sizes. It ensures moderate test error, especially with limited training data. In comparing CDE methods, we evaluate how estimators compete against non-parametric methods in small data regimes. Three methods are compared: Conditional Kernel Density Estimation (CKDE), Neighborhood Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE), and a semi-parametric estimator. Bandwidth selection is performed using the rule of thumb for kernel density estimation based methods. The paper compares CKDE, NKDE, and other methods for conditional density estimation. Bandwidth selection is done using R.O.T and CV-ML. Neural network methods outperform non-parametric ones, even with limited training data like the Boston Housing dataset. The focus is on high-capacity models for conditional density estimation. In conditional density estimation, adding small random perturbations during training acts as noise regularization, leading to smoothness regularization and improved consistency. Experimental results show this method outperforms other regularization techniques across various models and datasets, making neural network based CDE the preferred choice, especially with limited training data. Future research could explore how noise regularization enhances uncertainty estimates for tasks like safe control and decision making. The function operates on a set of data points, partitioned into losses for each point, perturbed by random noise. The loss is approximated using a second order Taylor expansion. The objective function corresponds to a conditional M-projection. The expected loss under noise follows from the assumption of small noise magnitude. Lemma 1 states regularity conditions ensuring that expectations in l (h) n (\u03b8) and l(\u03b8) are well-behaved in the limit, implying uniform and absolute integrability of the log-likelihoods. Inequality (30) shows that reducing the l1-distance between the true density p and the kernel density estimate q (h) n can make |l (h) n (\u03b8) \u2212 l(\u03b8)| small. The text discusses choosing the kernel and bandwidth for a kernel density estimate. Proposition 1 is derived using results from Devroye (1983), showing that certain events lead to the conclusion of the proposition. Theorem 1 of Devroye (1983) is applied to obtain an upper bound on the probability of certain events not occurring. The text discusses the intersection of events A and Bn, using a union bound argument to show their convergence. By applying the Borel-Cantelli lemma, it is concluded that event A holds with probability 1 for random training data. Proposition 1 states that event B also holds with probability 1, leading to the conclusion that the intersection of events A and B has a probability of 1. The proof of Theorem 2 follows a similar argument as Theorem 1 in White (1989), assuming a specific condition (13) holds with probability 1. By extending the result to larger values, it is shown that the convergence holds almost surely. The proof of Theorem 2 extends the argument from Theorem 1 in White (1989) by showing convergence almost surely under a specific condition. The theorem discusses global optimizers over a set of parameters \u0398, emphasizing that multiple minimizers of l(h) n,r can be chosen arbitrarily without affecting the proof. The application of the theorem to local optimization is straightforward when \u0398 is chosen as a compact neighborhood of a local minimum \u03b8*. The neural network outputs parameters for the unconditional mixture distribution p(y) based on the conditional variable x. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with diagonal covariance matrices is used as the density model, with the conditional density estimate p(y|x) being a weighted sum of K Gaussian components. The GMM parameters are controlled by the neural network with mixing weights resembling a categorical distribution. The softmax linearity is used for output neurons to resemble a categorical distribution. Standard deviations are ensured to be positive with a softplus non-linearity. Component means use a linear output layer without non-linearity. Experiments use a neural network with two hidden layers of size 32. MDNs are parametric conditional density models, while KMN combines non-parametric and parametric elements. Both models combine a mixture density model of p(y) with a neural network controlling the conditional variable x. The KMN model uses a neural network to control the weights of mixture components, with fixed component centers and scales. The model employs Gaussians as mixture components, with scale parameters learned jointly with neural network parameters. The KMN model is more restrictive than MDN as the locations and scales of mixture components are fixed during inference. The KMN model has fixed mixture components during inference, reducing overfitting compared to MDNs. In experiments, K = 50, M = 2, with a neural network having two hidden layers of size 32. The Normalizing Flow Network (NFN) transforms a base distribution using invertible mappings to generate a complex distribution. The Normalizing Flows from Rezende & Mohamed (2015) were introduced for fast sampling in variational inference. To adapt them for CDE, the direction of flows is inverted, with one affine flow and multiple radial flows found to perform well. The experiments used a standard Gaussian base distribution transformed by the flows. The respective neural network has two hidden layers of size 32. The data generating process involves a bivariate joint-distribution where x follows a normal distribution and y a conditional skew-normal distribution. The parameters of the skew normal distribution are functionally dependent on x, controlling the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. The conditional probability density function corresponds to the skew normal density function, with a negative skewness that decreases as x increases. The joint distribution p(x, y) follows a Gaussian Mixture Model with 5 Gaussian components. The conditional density p(y|x) can be derived in closed form, with mixture weights sampled from a uniform distribution and component means from a spherical Gaussian. The conditional probability density of 1-day log-returns is predicted based on 14 explanatory variables, including return factors from finance and option implied moments. The target variable is one-dimensional, while the conditional variable is a 14-dimensional vector. The covariance matrices are sampled from a Gaussian distribution and projected onto positive definite matrices for visualization in a 2-dimensional equivalent."
