    "content": "There is ongoing debate about creating an independent entity to determine Medicare policy, separate from Congress and CMS. Advocates argue that this is necessary for real health care reform, as Congress can be influenced by special interests. Advocates argue for an independent body to make Medicare policy decisions, citing concerns about Congress being influenced by special interests. Critics worry about reducing Congress's role in policymaking and oversight. The proposed Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009 would establish a new policymaking body with the authority to make changes in the program without congressional approval, potentially reducing Congress's oversight responsibilities. Senator Jay Rockefeller introduced the bill to elevate MedPAC to an executive branch agency with the power to determine Medicare payment and coverage policies. The Obama administration and the Senate Finance Committee proposed creating an independent Medicare advisory council to make recommendations on payment policy. This would change Congress's traditional role in Medicare policymaking. The concept of an independent policymaking entity in Medicare is introduced in the report. The current health care reform debate includes proposals for new independent entities to handle administrative and policymaking functions in Medicare and the broader health care system. These entities could conduct research on comparative effectiveness, manage the private health insurance market, and make payment and coverage decisions. One rationale for creating these entities is the belief that they can make more objective decisions than traditional policymaking bodies. Independent entities with policymaking authority are created to make better policy decisions by being insulated from congressional and executive decision-making processes. They are governed by boards or commissions appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with members serving long, staggered terms to reduce influence from the White House or Congress. Membership must represent diverse professional expertise and political orientations. One prominent model discussed in the current reform debate is the Federal Health Board, endorsed by former Senator Tom Daschle. Modeled after the Federal Reserve Board, it would have broad authority over health care programs, making benefit recommendations, regulating the insurance market, and improving care quality. Other discussed models are more modest in scope. H.R. 3590 proposes establishing a private, non-profit corporation for comparative clinical effectiveness research overseen by a Board of Governors. Another proposal suggests creating health insurance exchanges to regulate private health plans. Proposals for Medicare governance include creating an independent entity like the Medicare Guardians with broad authority to enact policies for restructuring healthcare delivery and payment within the program. Congress has debated the merits of establishing new administrative entities in Medicare multiple times. In the history of Medicare, there have been discussions about creating a new administrative entity to manage the program. Congress considered this during the Medicare reform talks in 2000 and 2001, especially when looking to add a prescription drug benefit and promote competition among private Medicare plans. Concerns arose about the ability of the overwhelmed CMS (formerly HCFA) to handle increased responsibilities. Various reform proposals suggested solutions like expanding authority, increasing the budget, creating separate agencies, and establishing a Medicare Board for managing competition. Currently, Medicare policy is largely determined by Congress and three congressional committees: the House Committee on Ways and Means, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Senate Committee on Finance. These committees propose legislation to modify all aspects of Medicare, including payment policy, benefits, coverage, and program administration. Congressional involvement in Medicare policy varies, with detailed legislative language in some areas like payment systems and benefit coverage criteria. Congress has outlined broad benefit categories for Medicare coverage in Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, giving CMS discretion to make coverage determinations through NCDs and LCDs. CMS has issued 308 NCDs, but the majority of coverage decisions are made at the local level through LCDs. Congress relies on agencies like the CBO, CRS, and GAO for analytic and research support in policymaking efforts. The Congressional Research Service (CRS), Government Accountability Office (GAO), and Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) were established by Congress to review and make recommendations on Medicare payment policies. MedPAC issues policy recommendations through two annual reports to Congress, focusing on various issues affecting the Medicare program. MedPAC issues policy recommendations through two annual reports to Congress, covering a range of recommendations from broad policies to detailed payment updates for Medicare providers. The commission considers current provider payments and efficiency when formulating recommendations, such as eliminating or reducing payment updates for certain facilities. MedPAC also testifies regularly for congressional committees. In merging ProPAC and PPRC, Congress created MedPAC as an independent advisory body to provide objective expertise on Medicare payment policy. MedPAC issues policy recommendations to Congress but lacks the authority to implement them without congressional approval or CMS regulatory action. MedPAC, created as an independent advisory body merging ProPAC and PPRC, lacks authority to implement recommendations without congressional approval or CMS action. Despite difficulty in measuring the number of implemented recommendations, MedPAC is perceived as influential in shaping Medicare policy. Senator Rockefeller introduced S. 1380 to reform MedPAC as an executive branch agency with broad policymaking authority in Medicare payment and coverage. The President also submitted a draft proposal to Congress for the Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act of 2009. The IMAC proposal, also known as the Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act of 2009, would establish a five-member council to advise the President on Medicare payment rates for certain providers. The Senate Finance Committee included a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to establish an independent Medicare advisory board to develop proposals to reduce Medicare spending. The three proposals aim to create an independent entity with appointed members for Medicare oversight. S. 1380 suggests replacing the current MedPAC advisory commission with an 11-member executive commission. H.R. 3590 proposes a new 15-member Medicare advisory board. Terms for members vary between six to five years, with the President appointing a Chair from among the members. H.R. 3590 proposes a new 15-member Medicare advisory board with specific appointment recommendations from key Senate and House leaders. The Secretary, CMS Administrator, and HRSA Administrator would serve as non-voting members. Membership qualifications would be similar to those for MedPAC, requiring expertise in medicine or health care policy. S. 1380 proposes a new independent entity with authority over Medicare coverage decisions and payment policies. The Commission would have broad authority in payment and coverage areas, including developing reimbursement rates for providers and suppliers. It would also be responsible for Medicare coverage policy, currently handled by CMS. The Commission would establish three advisory councils to assist in its policymaking functions. The Administration's proposal for an Independent Medicare Advisory Board (IMAC) would establish a separate entity with a narrower scope of authority compared to S. 1380. IMAC's primary responsibility would be recommending annual payment updates for certain Medicare providers, with exceptions to broader Medicare reforms. The proposal does not explicitly exclude Medicare coverage policy from IMAC's jurisdiction. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board established by H.R. 3590 would have the authority to develop and submit recommendations to Congress and the President to reduce Medicare spending. The Board must prioritize recommendations that extend Medicare solvency, improve health outcomes, protect beneficiary access to care, and consider the effects of changes in provider payments. Certain areas are exempt from the Board's authority. The Independent Medicare Advisory Board established by H.R. 3590 would have the authority to develop and submit recommendations to Congress and the President to reduce Medicare spending. The Board is prohibited from making recommendations that would ration care, raise revenues, increase beneficiary premiums, or modify eligibility. Additionally, the Board cannot reduce payments to providers and suppliers scheduled to receive a reduction in their payment updates in excess of a reduction due to productivity. The Administration's proposal requires explicit presidential approval or disapproval of the Council's recommendations. The President has 30 days to approve or disapprove the Independent Medicare Advisory Board's report in full, without the ability to reject individual recommendations. If the Board fails to submit a proposal by January 15, the Secretary must submit a contingent proposal. Regardless, the Board's recommendations would automatically take effect unless Congress passes legislation to override them. The process for Congress to override recommendations made by the Independent Medicare Advisory Board involves different procedures outlined in various proposals. For example, under S. 1380, a three-fifths majority in Congress is required to consider measures that would overrule payment or coverage determinations. The Administration's proposal mandates that Congress must pass a joint resolution of disapproval within 30 days of the President approving the Board's recommendations, which must also be approved and signed by the President. H.R. 3590 includes fast track procedures for congressional consideration of the Board's recommendations, requiring two-thirds majorities in both Houses of Congress to override the President's veto. The Board must submit annual recommendations by January 15, with committees required to report out the proposal by April 1 or be discharged from further consideration. The Board's proposal must be enacted by Congress by August 15, or the Secretary will implement it automatically. To stop this, Congress must pass a resolution of disapproval by August 15, 2017. Different proposals aim to control Medicare spending, with S. 1380 requiring a 1.5% annual reduction. The Commission must make payment recommendations by specific dates, with variations in timelines between proposals. The Board must develop recommendations to reduce Medicare spending by specific annual percentages, with automatic payment reductions to providers if savings targets are not met. The recommendations cannot increase Medicare expenditures over a 10-year period. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act would reduce Medicare spending by $28.2 billion between 2015-2019. The Administration's proposal included a 10-year budget neutrality provision, with proposals needing to meet this requirement to be implemented. The CBO analysis of the President's IMAC proposal predicted $2 billion in savings over 2010-2019, with larger savings achievable by including explicit spending reduction targets. In the current health care reform debate, the idea of creating an independent, policymaking entity in Medicare has gained prominence. This report outlines key characteristics of legislative options proposed for an independent commission or governing entity in Medicare, including funding sources and annual budget adjustments. Creating an independent commission or governing entity in Medicare is seen as a way to control healthcare spending. However, determining the size, authority, cost control mechanisms, and independence of this new body poses challenges for lawmakers and experts. Examining different approaches for creating such entities is crucial as policymakers debate health reform options."
