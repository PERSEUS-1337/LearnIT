It discusses the need for expanding receiving terminals and the challenges in constructing new ones. Changes in LNG market structure, contract design, risk sharing, financing, transportation, and the emergence of a competitive spot market are crucial for LNG to play its projected role in the U.S. energy supply. The report analyzes factors in the LNG market, focusing on legislative measures to streamline the approval process for LNG terminals. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan advocated for increased terminal capacity to address high energy prices. Some analysts see the LNG market structure as a barrier to supply security and price stability in the U.S. natural gas market. The report discusses the impact of the LNG market on supply security and price stability in the U.S. natural gas market. It contrasts standard LNG market transactions with competitive market models and evaluates the ongoing transition between the two. The price of LNG will determine whether it acts as a cap or floor on U.S. natural gas prices, with implications for consumers. The evolution of LNG supply and market structure will influence LNG prices and impact decisions on energy infrastructure and technology investments. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects increasing dependence on imported natural gas in the United States. In 2005, imports accounted for 19.4% of total consumption, and this is projected to rise to 26.6% by 2015. Changes in sourcing and form of imported gas are expected. The United States' reliance on imported natural gas is expected to increase, with a shift in sourcing and form. In 2005, over 85% of natural gas imports came from Canada via pipeline, but by 2020, this is projected to decline to less than 50%. Most future imports are expected to be in the form of LNG. In 2005, LNG imports accounted for less than 3% of U.S. consumption, but the 2030 projection shows a significant increase to 4.5 Tcf. The average wellhead price of natural gas has also increased from $1.91 per Mcf in the 1990s to $4.74 per Mcf in the 2000s. Increased natural gas prices have impacted residential consumers and industries, leading to a renewed interest in LNG supply to the U.S. market. The potential for LNG to cap U.S. natural gas prices depends on market dynamics and supply-demand balance. Some foresee a significant increase in LNG imports to keep prices competitive, while others view LNG as a high-cost, inflexible option. The LNG market operates on a four-link supply chain involving field development, liquefaction plants, specialized tankers, and receiving plants. Each link requires significant capital investment and does not generate revenue until the entire chain is operational. This high cost structure impacts the pricing of LNG and its role in the U.S. natural gas market. The LNG market relies on long-term Sale and Purchase Agreements (SPA) to manage risk and ensure economic viability. These contracts are necessary due to the high capital expenses involved in large volume gas fields supplying natural gas for liquefaction. The length of the SPA is determined by the size of the gas field, capital investment, and consumer needs, with risk being a critical factor in the market. The SPA in the LNG market manages risk by including a \"take-or-pay\" provision, ensuring the buyer guarantees purchase of gas volumes or pays for non-delivery. This provision transfers quantity risk to the buyer, ensuring full production levels for the producer. Price risk is controlled through a price escalation clause tied to oil prices in existing SPAs. LNG prices are determined through contract negotiation based on an external index price. Investment costs for LNG projects have been high, with capital investment costs of over $400 per ton of annual capacity in the mid-1990s. Recent facilities have seen significant cost reductions, with trains in Trinidad constructed for less than $200 per ton. Political instability and country risk also contribute to the risk in LNG markets. Significant cost reductions in LNG projects have been achieved, with trains in Trinidad built for less than $200 per ton of annual capacity. Economy of scale plays a major role in reducing capital costs per ton of LNG produced. Larger scale operations lead to lower unit costs, reduced risk, and improved project financing and completion probabilities. However, marketing risk increases with the size of production capacity if an SPA is not in place. The marketing risk associated with increasing LNG quantities is a concern for producers, leading to a preference for long-term contracts. Capital costs for new LNG facilities rose in 2005 and 2006 due to various construction factors and the involvement of national oil companies in projects. Transportation costs, including specialized tankers, also contribute to project expenses. The Olokola project faces significant transportation costs for LNG due to the need for specialized tankers. Ownership of LNG tankers is unclear, with few owned by independent shipping companies. The destination clause in SPAs hinders the development of a spot market by preventing buyers from reselling LNG. Inefficient use of tankers is common as they follow set routes and often return empty, increasing costs. Competitive incentives are minimal in this market due to the destination clause. In the traditional LNG market, incentives are minimal due to the destination clause in SPAs and ownership linkages. Short term purchases are rare, with prices negotiated and likely linked to oil prices. Spot markets aid in price discovery, but quantities are set in SPAs, dictating contract terms. Large LNG buyers, mainly electric utilities, operate under regulated monopolies, limiting competitive impetus. The traditional LNG market operates under regulated monopolies, limiting competitive incentives. Transitioning to a competitive market model would require breaking down and re-assembling the supply chain based on market principles. This would involve countries developing stranded gas resources and producing LNG for the open market independently or with international energy companies. Owners in LNG projects would market their production shares independently, increasing competition. In a competitive LNG market, projects would market production shares independently, leading to increased competition. Buyers would shop globally for the best prices, driving prices down. Tankers operated by shipping companies would minimize costs, and offloading facilities would be open to all, reducing delivery costs. In a competitive LNG market, the availability of financial capital would support the supply chain for new projects and infrastructure without the need for specific agreements. Risk could be managed through financial derivatives like swaps and futures contracts, ensuring stability and flexibility for investors. The international LNG market underwent a structural transformation in the late 1990s due to expiring contracts, less regulation, and improved technology. This led to changing buyer requirements and lower costs, driving a market transformation that continues today. The United States has been involved in the modern LNG market since the late 1960s. In the late 1960s, LNG exports from Alaska to Japan began, leading Japan to become the world's top LNG importer. Japan relies on LNG for its electric power industry due to no domestic gas sources or access to pipeline imports. LNG prices are determined by oil prices, influencing investment decisions based on market prices and potential yields. The LNG market has historically seen facilities close during periods of weak domestic natural gas prices, only to reopen when prices recover. Recent years have seen higher natural gas prices and lower LNG costs leading to the reopening and expansion of facilities. The market is transitioning as old contracts expire, with signs of change in the industry. The LNG market is undergoing a transition as old contracts expire, leading to more open regulatory environments for utilities. Consumers are now receiving more liberalized contract terms for new LNG supply agreements, with take-or-pay provisions applying to only a portion of the contract volume. The destination clause is also being liberalized in some cases, giving buyers more choice in the market. While these changes benefit consumers, the impact on progress towards a competitive market structure remains uncertain. Newly negotiated long-term contracts in the LNG industry may impact market structure for the next 10 to 20 years. For example, exemptions from take-or-pay provisions could affect spot market trading or account for demand volatility. The attractiveness of long-term agreements persists, as seen in examples like Austria's OMV reconsidering an LNG terminal in Croatia due to supply source uncertainties. In the U.S., Cheniere's involvement in terminal projects reflects ongoing interest in long-term agreements. Cheniere, involved in U.S. terminal projects, seeks mixed usage contracts. 70% capacity underwritten by Total, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, and Dow Chemical. Plans to enter arbitrage market with remaining 30%. Market competitiveness depends on LNG price signal. Additional market participants may not change market fundamentals if tied to specific consumers. The existence of a viable spot market in LNG is crucial for market flexibility, price discovery, and driving down costs. While short term transactions are increasing, a fully functioning spot market is still in the future. Spot cargoes mainly enter the United States during the summer months. The United States is considered a residual market for LNG, with deliveries at U.S. receiving terminals affected by world events and competitive price pressures. Weak U.S. natural gas prices in 2001-02 led to lower capacity utilization at U.S. facilities, as supplies were diverted to Europe and Japan due to higher prices and shortages of tanker capacity. This behavior has raised concerns about the reliability of LNG supply. In 2006, Qatar reallocated supplies from North America to Asia, particularly Japan and South Korea. In 2006, U.S. LNG supplies were redirected from North America to Asia, specifically Japan and South Korea, due to stronger prices in those markets. U.S. receiving terminals were operating at around 50% capacity, reflecting weak demand and declining prices. The LNG market still relies heavily on fixed contractual relationships rather than a transparent spot market, despite some short-term transactions indicating a move towards efficiency. The Asian LNG market is more responsive to market fundamentals, but a global spot market has not yet emerged due to infrastructure and logistical constraints. The role of LNG as a stable, large volume supplier to the U.S. market is enhanced by expanding supplies, which can set a price cap. Producers would need excess capacity to counter upward price pressure. The price of LNG should competitively lead the market to the delivered cost, rather than following it. LNG project development costs are high and variable, impacting pricing. Increased U.S. LNG use may create a price floor for natural gas prices, as high costs of LNG project development require a sufficiently high price. Dubai plans to establish an LNG storage center and trading hub by 2010, allowing for trading based on seasonal price differentials and geographical arbitrages. This facility, located near Qatar and other Persian Gulf producers, is expected to enhance the market competitiveness of LNG. The construction of a new LNG facility is timed to coincide with the opening of Gulf LNG projects. Critics argue that LNG will be supply constrained through 2013, affecting financial liquidity. The LNG tanker fleet is increasing, with newer, larger ships being built. Practical limits on tanker size may impact their ability to berth at existing terminals. Some new ships are dedicated to specific projects, while others are not. The construction of new LNG tankers is not dedicated to specific projects, potentially indicating the emergence of a merchant fleet. These tankers may serve as insurance against quantity uncertainty in up and downstream projects. However, there is little evidence of an independent LNG tanker fleet in new construction data, suggesting existing shipping practices will likely continue. The purpose of these new tankers is to service the evolving market on a larger scale, rather than significantly changing market competition. An available, uncommitted tanker fleet is seen as necessary for a competitive LNG spot market. The cost of LNG tanker construction has decreased due to increased competition among shipyards. Charter rates for tankers range from $27,000 to $150,000 per day. Larger ships are being built, reducing transportation costs. Access to specialized receiving facilities is necessary for LNG tankers reaching consuming nations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) determined that LNG receiving facilities in the United States do not have to provide open access to all who wish to dock LNG cargoes, allowing owners with contracted LNG resources to have dedicated unloading facilities. This decision aims to enhance investment feasibility and ensure that owners/investors can import their own LNG supplies. The decision to allow owners with contracted LNG resources to have dedicated unloading facilities enhances investment feasibility and ensures their ability to import LNG supplies. However, this may hinder the development of a competitive LNG market due to limited risk management options for market participants. The New York Mercantile Exchange offers futures and options contracts on natural gas, but their standardized contract quantities may not align with typical LNG tanker deliveries. The limited risk management options for market participants in the LNG market may hinder the development of a competitive market. An active over-the-counter derivatives market could be a solution, but challenges such as tight supplies, lack of active spot market trading hubs, and restricted transportation options exist. Additional physical and security investments are needed for LNG import expansion, with policy concerns surrounding terminal siting, pipeline infrastructure, safety, and supply bottlenecks. The higher energy content of imported LNG and its technical challenges may hinder rapid expansion. Imbalance in the natural gas market could lead to shortages and high prices, with LNG suggested as a possible solution. Large quantities of stranded natural gas reserves globally could help address quantity issues and potentially establish a price cap based on LNG costs. The debate on U.S. LNG imports continues. The debate on U.S. LNG imports has focused on investment in receiving terminals, jurisdictional issues, security, and environmental safety. Institutional and market structure factors could impede an LNG scenario, especially in price formation. Changes are needed for a more competitive market structure due to the traditional long-term contract-based LNG market. Risk is a primary factor in LNG production investment, with challenges in risk management without proper institutions and financial instruments. Without proper instruments to supplement or replace the SPA in risk management, a competitive spot market for LNG may struggle to develop. Existing markets only partially allow for risk management, potentially altering trading dynamics. If a competitive market fails to materialize, LNG expansion may rely on long-term contracts, limiting market-based pricing. Traditionally, LNG prices have been tied to oil or local gas prices, but without market pressure, gas prices may not reach cost-based levels. This could impact the ability of LNG to cap domestic natural gas prices. Optimists believe that LNG could potentially close the gap between U.S. natural gas demand and supply by utilizing stranded natural gas and developing receiving terminals. However, relying solely on LNG may not provide a stable supply for domestic consumers, impacting the need for other sources like an Alaska natural gas pipeline or drilling. The need for an Alaska natural gas pipeline may weaken, along with the need for drilling in environmentally sensitive areas and expanding technology to develop gas reserves from new sources. These alternatives become more important if a more pessimistic view of LNG is taken."
