    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Targeted Job Creation and Business Investment Act\" and includes a provision for reducing the employer portion of payroll tax for certain employers increasing payroll. The \"Targeted Job Creation and Business Investment Act\" includes a provision to reduce employer payroll tax deposits for employers who increase payroll in 2010 or 2011 by 15 percent. Employer payroll tax deposits are defined as required deposits under the Internal Revenue Code for taxes imposed on the employer with respect to individuals in their employ. The \"Targeted Job Creation and Business Investment Act\" offers a reduction in employer payroll tax deposits for those who increase payroll by 15 percent in 2010 and 10 percent in 2011. Payroll increase is defined as the excess of wages paid in a quarter compared to the previous year. The term \"wages\" refers to the meaning in section 3121(a) of the Code for section 3111(a). \"Inflation adjusted wages\" are wages multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment for the relevant calendar year. A \"qualified individual\" is any individual meeting certain criteria. An \"individual\" is someone who starts working for a qualified employer between February 3, 2010, and January 1, 2012, in a county with an unemployment rate of at least 8.5%. They cannot be hired to replace another employee unless that employee left voluntarily or for cause. The employer's payroll tax deposits cannot be reduced below zero for any quarter. Any excess reduction would be treated as a payment of tax for the last taxable year. The Secretary will refund or credit any overpayment promptly without interest. Employer deductions for taxes paid under section 3111 will be reduced by the amount of reduced employer payroll tax deposits. Employer deductions for taxes paid under section 3111 will be reduced by the amount of reduced employer payroll tax deposits. Wages must be for trade or business, and adjustments for certain acquisitions are made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. After December 31, 2009, employer deductions for taxes paid under section 3111 will be reduced by the amount of reduced employer payroll tax deposits. Wages paid by the employer before an acquisition will be increased by wages or compensation paid by the predecessor for the acquired trade or business. Dispositions of a major portion of a trade or business require the employer to provide necessary information to the acquiring person. For calendar quarters after a disposition, employer wages deemed paid before the disposition will be reduced by the amount attributable to the trade or business. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide rules for eligible employers not on a quarterly tax deposit system. SEC. 3. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT.
