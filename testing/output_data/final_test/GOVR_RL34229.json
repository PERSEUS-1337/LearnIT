    "content": "As Congress considers tax reform, the debate on the tax treatment of corporations is ongoing. Some proposals aim to cut the corporate rate by broadening the base, while others suggest raising or reducing revenues. Arguments surrounding the corporate tax focus on distortions introduced by the tax, organizational form choices, and international issues. Recently, Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin argued that the corporate tax is ultimately paid by workers, citing a study by Az\u00e9mar and Hubbard. The current debate on corporate tax reform includes references to various studies and opinions on the burden falling on wages. The discussion traces back to proposals from over 10 years ago, with recent news reports and Treasury press office statements adding to the ongoing dialogue. President George W. Bush's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform in 2005 also contributed to the conversation. In November 2005, President George W. Bush's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform proposed major tax system reforms, including for corporate income taxes. Hearings were held in 2006, but no further action was taken. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson addressed concerns about high U.S. corporate tax rates in a 2007 opinion article, announcing a conference to examine the business tax system's impact on the economy. R. Glenn Hubbard referenced the conference and a study on how the tax affects labor. During a conference, discussions revolved around the corporate tax rate, its impact on labor, revenue-maximizing tax rates, and the need for reform. Participants debated whether to trade tax preferences for lower rates, the complexity of the tax system, and methods of income shifting in a global economy. Some argued that the corporate tax is outdated, distorts decisions, and hinders firms' competitiveness. Kevin Hassett suggested that lowering the corporate tax rate may be more effective in raising revenues. During a conference, discussions revolved around the corporate tax rate and its impact on labor, revenue-maximizing tax rates, and the need for reform. Some argued that the corporate tax is outdated, distorts decisions, and hinders firms' competitiveness. Chairman Rangel introduced a bill, H.R. 3970, with a revenue-neutral subsection that included base broadeners from the 2007 Treasury study. The rate reduction was from 35% to 30.5%, smaller than the 27% discussed in the study. Base broadeners in H.R. 3970 were criticized by some business groups. The corporate tax debate and issues of burden and growth effects continued to be in the news. In May 2008, N. Gregory Mankiw suggested that the burden of the tax falls on labor, citing research on corporate tax. Senators Wyden and Gregg introduced S. 3018 for a lower corporate tax rate. Similar bills were introduced in the 112th Congress. The Fiscal Commission proposed corporate reform similar to the Wyden-Gregg bill. Republican leaders also proposed corporate tax reform with rate reductions. In 2014, Chairman Camp introduced H.R. 1 for comprehensive reform. In 2014, Chairman Camp introduced H.R. 1 for comprehensive tax reform, cutting the corporate tax rate to 25%. Senator Hatch showed interest in corporate tax integration in 2016. Speaker Paul Ryan and Chairman Kevin Brady proposed a major revision in business income tax treatment in their \"Better Way\" blueprint. The current proposal for corporate tax reform is being revised in collaboration with the House, Senate, and Administration. The report discusses corporate tax issues, including the impact on revenue and distribution. It highlights the importance of the corporate tax in preventing tax shelter abuse and its role in maintaining a progressive tax system. The corporate tax is discussed in terms of its role in a progressive tax system, efficiency, revenue yield, and potential reforms. Despite concerns about the tax rate, current corporate taxes are historically low, accounting for around 2% of GDP and 10% of federal revenues in recent years. The corporate tax has fluctuated around 2% of GDP and 10% of revenues in recent years. It is projected to raise revenues of 1.6% to 1.7% of GDP for the years 2016 to 2027. The tax is the third-largest federal revenue source, behind individual income tax and payroll tax. The corporate tax is estimated at 9.4% of revenues in FY2017, falling to 8.5% by FY2027. The corporate tax has seen a decline in new investment, dropping from 63% of profits in 1953 to around 20% currently. This decrease is attributed to various factors such as lower statutory rates, more lenient depreciation rules, and the rise of tax-favored intangible investments. Additionally, changes in rates and depreciation, along with more liberal rules allowing firms to benefit from corporate status while being taxed as unincorporated businesses, have contributed to the decline in corporate tax revenues. The share of total business net income received by unincorporated businesses increased significantly from 1980 to 2004, with Subchapter S firms experiencing a notable rise from 1% to 15%. The number of shareholders allowed for the election also increased over the years. Additionally, partnerships, including limited liability corporations, saw a growth from 3% to 21%, mainly after 1990, reflecting the establishment of limited liability corporations under state law. Unincorporated businesses, including S Corporations and partnerships, accounted for 59% of total business net income in 2012. Corporate tax revenue remains a significant source of federal income, and proposals suggest trading rate reductions for base broadening to maintain revenue neutrality. The corporate tax plays a crucial role in protecting the collection of individual income taxes by preventing high-income individuals from using corporations as tax shelters. Without a corporate tax, wealthy business owners could exploit tax rate differences to their advantage. Individual tax rates were significantly reduced in 1986, but the corporate tax remains necessary to prevent tax avoidance. The corporate tax rate fell from 70% to 28%, eventually increased to 39.6%. The 2007 Treasury study showed that 61% of unincorporated business income was from top income tax bracket taxpayers. Shifting income to corporations can be advantageous for high-income individuals due to lower graduated tax rates. Restrictions include limiting income shifting to one corporation, graduated rate amounts, and disallowing rates for personal service corporations. The tax law has historically included a tax on accumulated earnings to prevent using corporations as tax shelters. Lower corporate tax rates and higher dividend tax rates have made this constraint more significant. Graduated rates for personal service corporations are restricted to prevent income shifting. If dividends are taxed at 23.8% and the corporate rate is lowered to 27%, corporations could potentially offer a tax shelter opportunity by distributing less than 94% of their income. This could benefit labor income and individual capital income, even without the benefit of graduated rates. Rules restricting accumulated earnings in corporations aim to prevent using them as tax shelters. Some tax reform proposals suggest lowering individual rates and providing special lower rates for pass-through income from capital. For instance, the \"Better Way\" tax plan proposes a 20% rate for corporations and a top individual rate of 33%, with half of dividends and capital gains taxed. Other reforms could include raising tax rates on dividends and capital gains at the individual level while lowering the rate at the firm level, eliminating the graduated rate structure, and integrating individual and corporate income taxes more formally. The discussion on tax reform proposals includes lowering individual rates and providing special lower rates for pass-through income from capital. The \"Better Way\" tax plan suggests a 20% rate for corporations and a top individual rate of 33%, with half of dividends and capital gains taxed. The issue of a revenue-maximizing tax rate, associated with the \"Laffer\" curve, has rarely been considered in the conversation. The Laffer curve graphs revenue against the tax rate, showing that revenue is zero at a zero tax rate and zero at a 100% tax rate. The Laffer curve shows the relationship between tax rates and revenue, indicating a point where revenue is maximized. The debate on corporate tax cuts potentially paying for themselves has resurfaced in 2017, with references to articles by Glenn Hubbard and Kevin Hassett discussing the negative relationship between corporate revenues and tax rates. The Laffer curve debate on corporate tax cuts resurfaced in 2017 with references to articles by Hubbard and Hassett citing research by Clausing and Devereux. Mintz also conducted a cross-country study. Clausing's research suggests a revenue-maximizing tax rate of 33%, which increases with additional variables. The revenue-maximizing tax rate varies among different studies, with rates ranging from 28% to 57%. Devereux, Clausing, Brill, and Hassett all present different findings on this topic, with some indicating a weak relationship between tax rates and corporate tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. The theoretical expectations and empirical studies discussed in this section shed light on the varying results. Theoretical and empirical assessments question the results of analyses on the Laffer curve and corporate taxes. Traditionally, corporate tax behavior involved capital substitution between corporate and noncorporate sectors, affecting returns and prices. The Laffer curve and corporate taxes are analyzed in terms of capital substitution between corporate and noncorporate sectors, impacting returns and prices. The corporate profits tax base faces opposing forces due to changes in capital and profit rates, with the taxable base potentially increasing or decreasing. Most models suggest that the tax base is relatively unaffected by tax rates, leading to uncertain revenue-maximizing tax rates. Behavioral responses could alter the outcome, particularly in the open economy model. The open economy model suggests a revenue-maximizing tax rate of around 30% due to high elasticity estimates of foreign capital flows. However, even with infinite elasticities, this tax rate cannot be achieved in extreme cases. The revenue-maximizing tax rate in international trade depends on the labor share of income and factor substitution elasticity. Common values suggest a tax rate of 75%, which could increase with relaxed conditions. If the US has 30% of world resources, the rate rises to 81%. Imperfect substitutability between investments and products would further increase the rate. It may not be possible to find a rate that maximizes revenues as a percentage of GDP due to GDP and tax revenues falling together. In the context of international trade, the revenue-maximizing tax rate depends on factors like the labor share of income and factor substitution elasticity. Common values suggest a tax rate of 75%, which could increase with relaxed conditions. However, it may not be possible to find a rate that maximizes revenues as a percentage of GDP due to GDP and tax revenues falling together. The discussion on revenue-maximizing tax rates considers factors like labor income share and elasticity of factor substitution. Physical reallocations or changes in debt-equity ratios do not significantly impact these rates. Profit shifting, particularly through shifting operations to unincorporated businesses, could affect revenue, but high corporate tax rates in the US may not be the primary driver. The discussion on revenue-maximizing tax rates considers factors like labor income share and elasticity of factor substitution. Profit shifting, particularly to foreign countries, could impact revenue, but recent estimates suggest that cutting the corporate tax rate in the US may not generate enough revenue to offset profits shifted back into the country. The revenue-maximizing tax rate is the point where tax base contraction leads to no revenue gain from a tax increase, and cutting tax rates could potentially raise revenue. Revenue feedback from behavioral responses is crucial, with the revenue-maximizing tax rate providing 100% revenue feedback. Using a general equilibrium model based on empirical estimates, recent studies suggest that cutting the corporate tax rate in the US may not generate enough revenue to offset profits shifted back into the country. A recent CRS report analyzed the impact of cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, finding a revenue offset of 5% due to increased output in the US. The revenue-maximizing tax rate is not near 35%, with feedback effects from profit shifting estimated to be small. Even if profit shifting ended, it would only add a feedback of no more than 20%. The potential feedback effects of profit shifting due to a corporate tax rate cut are estimated to be small, with a maximum increase of 20%. However, this increase would be overshadowed by the rise in debt, leading to a 23% loss in revenues by the 10th year. Additionally, reduced output would further impact the budget deficit through increased interest costs. The analysis by Brill and Hassett examines the effect of the top corporate tax rate on corporate tax revenues as a percentage of GDP using panel data for 29 OECD countries from 1981 to 2003. They find an inverted U-shaped relationship, with the tax rate initially increasing revenues before decreasing them. However, their results may be biased and inconsistent due to not accounting for panel data issues. The Brill and Hassett study analyzed the impact of corporate tax rates on tax revenues using panel data for OECD countries from 1981 to 2003. Results show no significant relationship between tax rates and tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. The study by Clausing also examines the relationship between corporate tax rates and tax revenues as a percentage of GDP for OECD countries from 1979 to 2002. Despite including more explanatory variables, her findings align with Brill and Hassett's, showing a Laffer curve relationship. However, Clausing's estimation methods may lead to biased results. The coefficient estimates in her analysis differ from Brill and Hassett's, with smaller values and opposite signs. Overall, the study by Clausing suggests that the corporate tax rate has little impact on corporate tax revenues as a percentage of GDP, with no evidence supporting the existence of a corporate tax Laffer curve. Significant coefficient estimates on the tax squared term do not produce the expected Laffer curve shape. It is noted that empirical studies indicating a revenue-maximizing tax rate may not be reliable if they do not account for base changes. In a recent paper, Slemrod and Kawano provide estimates controlling for the direction of changes in the base and find these controls raise the estimated revenue-maximizing tax rate. Cross-country empirical studies have been used to address the Laffer curve issue and the incidence of the corporate tax on wages. Numerous empirical studies examine relationships like the effect of the user cost of capital on investment, with most finding modest effects on domestic investment. One recent study by Djankov et al. found no effect on investment for statutory tax rates, but large effects for constructed cash flow tax rates. The study is a single cross section, lacking fixed country effects, and faces difficulties with the hypothetical nature of the cash flow tax rate variable. The study by Djankov et al. found no impact on investment from statutory tax rates but significant effects from constructed cash flow tax rates. The analysis raised concerns about the methodology, including the treatment of outliers like Bolivia and Mongolia. The tax rate in Bolivia is inconsistent with the corporate rate and reflects an alternative transactions tax. A study found that a 10 percentage point drop in corporate tax in the United States increased investment by 2.2 percentage points, which is not considered plausible. According to another model, U.S. capital would only increase by a maximum of 0.7 percentage points with the elimination of corporate tax. The Djankov et al. study analyzes the impact of corporate tax rates on investment, foreign direct investment, and entrepreneurial activity in 85 countries using 2004 data. Their results suggest that the investment increase due to tax rate changes may be significantly overstated. The coefficient estimates for the effective corporate tax rate variable from the Djankov et al. study are statistically significant in most cases. The data was reanalyzed with corrected tax rate for Bolivia and additional independent variables. The coefficient estimates for the effective corporate tax rate variable from Djankov et al.'s study are smaller in the reanalysis, with the tax rate's effect on aggregate investment not statistically significant. The impact on foreign direct investment and entrepreneurial activity is smaller but statistically significant. The Hubbard article discusses the distributional effects of the corporate income tax, citing a study by Az\u00e9mar and Hubbard. It suggests that most of the corporate tax is paid by workers, contributing to a progressive tax system. Tax data shows that higher income individuals have more income from capital than labor. The burden of the corporate income tax generally falls on capital, not labor income. Government and private agencies focus on distributing the corporate tax to capital income. Studies by Harberger, Randolph, Hassett, Mathur, Felix, Desai, Foley, Hines, and Arulampalam, Devereux, Maffini were referenced. Mankiw mentions Randolph and Arulampalam, Devereux, and Maffini studies, but the latter may not be relevant to the US corporate tax. The Az\u00e9mar and Hubbard article discusses different approaches to studying corporate tax incidence, including general equilibrium models and direct estimates of wages based on tax rates. These studies consider international capital flows and the share of tax on excess profits borne by labor. The share of tax on excess profits borne by labor in wage bargaining is discussed in various studies, including general equilibrium and empirical estimates. Recent reports mention studies supporting the burden falling on wages, with some uncertainty on the behavioral response measured. The burden of source-based capital income tax falls on labor in a small open economy with perfect capital mobility and product substitution. The corporate tax combines aspects of source-based and residence-based taxes. Studies by Harberger and Randolph use a model adjusted for the United States as a large country and multiple sectors to explore tax incidence. Randolph's study focuses on incidence in different models rather than predicting the tax burden. Harberger and Randolph explore tax burden incidence in different models, with Harberger finding that less capital mobility shifts the burden from labor to capital. Harberger's model includes four sectors, with the corporate tradable sector bearing over 100% of the tax burden on capital. Contrary to the perception of manufacturing as capital-intensive, housing services and other industries like utilities and agriculture are more capital intensive. Randolph's model, with a less capital-intensive manufacturing sector, shows 70% of the corporate tax burden falling on labor. In a more complex model by Gravelle and Smetters, capital still bears about 80% of the corporate tax burden. Factors like consumer willingness to substitute between foreign and domestic products, labor and capital substitutability, and investor willingness to substitute investments in different countries, tend to shift the burden towards falling on capital. Based on various models, the majority of the corporate tax burden (about 60%) is borne by capital due to lower substitution elasticity between capital and labor. Factors like debt usage and elements of a residence-based tax further increase the burden on capital. General equilibrium models, while complex, still overlook important features of the corporate tax. The corporate tax burden falls mainly on capital in the United States due to low unionization rates. The current tax system subsidizes debt finance, making capital less likely to be exported. Raising the corporate tax rate could actually attract capital inflow, benefiting labor. Countries with similar tax rates create a closed economy model where the burden falls on capital. In 2007, the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate was 39%, higher than the G-7 and OECD averages. By 2013, rates had decreased to 29% in the OECD and 30% for the top 15 countries. Effective tax rates are similar globally, with over 90% falling on capital in the U.S. despite arguments that it impacts labor due to reduced savings. The burden of a capital income tax falls on labor according to a model that makes extreme assumptions about human behavior. Life-cycle models show varying results, but higher taxes on labor can offset revenue loss. Some economists argue that models assuming perfect information are inappropriate, as individuals may use rules of thumb for savings. Empirical evidence does not support an increase in savings in response to reduced tax rates. Corporate tax rates do not affect savings rates. Empirical study shows a 1% increase in corporate tax leads to a 0.8% to 1% decrease in manufacturing wages, which is not consistent with economic magnitudes. The impact of a dollar increase in corporate tax on wages is estimated to be $22 to $26, far exceeding the actual corporate tax contribution to GDP. The Hassett and Mathur study analyzed the impact of corporate tax rates on wages using data from 72 countries from 1981 to 2003. They found that a 1% increase in corporate tax led to a $22 to $26 decrease in manufacturing wages, which was not predicted by any model due to statistical issues. They used a five-year average wage to account for economic effects over time and included the price level of consumption as a variable to adjust for cost of living differences. The Hassett and Mathur study analyzed the impact of corporate tax rates on wages, finding that a 1% increase in tax led to a $22 to $26 decrease in manufacturing wages. The study used variables like the top corporate tax rate and exchange rates to explain cost of living differences across countries. The coefficient estimate suggests a 10% increase in tax leads to a 7.6% decrease in average manufacturing wage rate, which is statistically significant. Exchange rates are influenced by financial markets and government policies, but may not accurately reflect the purchasing power of wage rates in different countries. Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) are designed to equalize the internal purchasing power of currencies. Using PPPs to convert national currencies to a common currency like U.S. dollars is more appropriate. Consumption PPPs, which exclude government and investment expenditures, are better for converting wages. This approach provides coefficient estimates that are closer to nominal wages as the dependent variable. The coefficient estimates for different measures of the corporate tax rate are not statistically significant. The most suitable measure of wages is the inflation-adjusted consumption PPP-adjusted wage rate. Wages were converted to U.S. dollars using consumption PPP and then adjusted for inflation before calculating the five-year average. The coefficient estimates for this model are closer to zero compared to other cases. The coefficient estimates for different measures of the corporate tax rate are not statistically significant. The coefficient estimate in the first column is statistically significant at the 10% level but not at the 5% level. The effect of corporate tax rates on wage rates in manufacturing is smaller and less robust than reported in the Hassett and Mathur study. Hassett and Mathur justified using five-year averages to control for possible measurement error induced by the business cycle. However, 66 observations have the average wage based on less than five years of data. The estimation results show that excluding 66 observations did not affect the coefficient estimates for various measures of the corporate tax rate. Using five-year averages for wage data and beginning of period values for explanatory variables reduces variation but also discards important information for estimating economic effects. The analysis is repeated with annual data and lagged values of the corporate tax rate, showing insignificant results for all measures. The analysis using annual data and lagged corporate tax rate values shows insignificant results for the impact of tax rates on wages in manufacturing. Hassett and Mathur revised their initial paper to address issues with cross-country wage studies. Proper specification in analyzing the impact of tax rates on wages should consider rates of other countries. Hassett and Mathur partially addressed this by adding neighboring countries' tax characteristics, reducing the coefficient on taxes. However, their study still produced implausible estimates, even when including average tax rates of countries with similar income levels. The percentage change in wages for a 1% change in corporate taxes is 0.5%, implying a $13 decrease in wages for each dollar fall in corporate taxes. Various studies have examined the incidence of tax on labor income, categorized into cross-country data studies, cross-state data studies, and studies focusing on bargaining over excess profits. The Arulampalam, et al. study was the first of the latter type, while three other studies, including Felix's, have also analyzed cross-country data. The study by Desai, Foley, and Hines analyzes the allocation of tax burden between labor and capital using data on multinational subsidiaries of U.S. firms. The sample includes 19 countries with varying years, but lacks control for country fixed effects. The study by Desai, Foley, and Hines examines tax burden allocation between labor and capital in multinational subsidiaries of U.S. firms. They find labor income bears 45% to 75% of the total burden, but their model has theoretical flaws and econometric issues due to focusing solely on multinational corporate sector firms. The study by Desai, Foley, and Hines analyzes tax burden allocation between labor and capital in multinational subsidiaries of U.S. firms. They find that labor income bears a significant portion of the burden, but their model has theoretical flaws and econometric issues. The tax burdens on debt and equity differ at the individual level and depend on various factors. The results of their study may be influenced by cross equation restrictions. The study found that removing restrictions did not yield statistically significant results. Different specifications were considered, including only manufacturing subsidiaries to avoid tax sheltering operations. Results were not statistically significant, and a recent cross-country study by Clausing also found no significant results in examining OECD countries. Clausing's study on corporate tax burdens in different countries found no robust evidence of large depressing effects on wages. By comparing wages using purchasing power parity and excluding value-added variables, she suggests that the effect of corporate taxes on labor productivity cannot be detected with aggregate cross-country data. Felix's review of empirical studies examines tax incidence based on cross-state comparisons. She finds that a $1 increase in taxes reduces wages by between $1.40 and $3.60, with some limitations in the data set. Felix and Hines use a similar cross-state data set to study rent sharing and the effects of tax rates on wages, finding positive relationships instead of negative ones. The authors found that higher corporate tax rates reduce union wage differentials, contradicting previous studies. Carroll's analysis of individual workers across states shows that average state tax rates have a significant impact on wages, measured by taxes divided by personal income. The study examines the impact of corporate tax rates on wages, finding a negative relationship. It addresses the issue of tax allocation formulas affecting capital flows and labor burden. Serrato and Zidar's study found 30-35% of tax burden borne by labor. The study found that 30-35% of the tax burden is borne by labor. It also considered the mobility of capital and labor across states, suggesting that capital is more mobile, making the tax burden more likely to fall on labor. Recent studies have discussed the potential burden of corporate tax on wages, with findings varying from 49% to 60%. These studies do not estimate the tax rates of other states in their regression analysis. The studies on the burden of corporate taxes on wages focus on the share of the tax on excess profits that falls on workers due to bargaining and rent sharing. These studies do not estimate the general equilibrium effects of corporate taxes on economy-wide wages. The Liu and Altshuler paper referenced by the Treasury Press Office falls under rent-sharing studies and has limited relevance to the overall issue of corporate income tax in the United States. However, their results have been used as evidence on the general tax burden, leading to a proliferation of similar studies. The studies focus on the share of corporate tax on excess profits borne by labor through rent-sharing. These studies do not estimate the overall impact of corporate taxes on economy-wide wages. It is important to note that labor's share cannot be interpreted as the total tax falling on wages as it relates only to excess profits, which are a small part of total profits. The share of rents sets an upper boundary on the tax share falling on labor. The estimated share of excess profits borne by labor through rent-sharing is around 10% to 20%, with empirical studies showing levels exceeding 35%. This burden applies only to firms with excess profits engaging in bargaining, which is less common in the US where unions cover less than 7% of private wage and salary workers. Studies focusing on labor's share in excess profits have found similar results. Most studies show that labor captures a small share of excess profits, typically less than 10% and rarely more than 20% or 30%. The union wage premium is estimated to be around 15%, resulting in a 1% share of the total wage bill reflecting rents of union workers. In the standard bargaining model, a corporate tax rate on excess profits is not expected to impact wages. Taxes are typically applied to a firm's revenue minus cost, with the tax term not affecting the split of pretax profits between workers and the firm. The tax term does not affect the split of pretax profits between workers and the firm. Higher tax rates reduce the surplus to be divided but lower the \"price\" of giving a dollar to labor. The only tax effect left is from general equilibrium effects on the economy due to the tax on normal profits. The proportional effect on rents is similar to that on wages. Taxes on excess profits do not directly impact wages in the standard bargaining model. The ADM study analyzed firm-level data from European countries (primarily France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) from 1996-2003 to study rent-sharing effects on tax incidence. The study controlled for firm-specific effects and found significant impacts despite theoretical insights questioning the need for such research. The authors analyzed firm-level data from European countries from 1996-2003, focusing on rent-sharing effects on tax incidence. They found that labor bears 64% of the tax in the short run and 49% in the long run. The study derived a model where the tax on revenues minus wages disappears and introduced an extra tax term affecting wages directly. The authors did not control for country-specific effects in their analysis. The study on tax incidence analyzed firm-level data from European countries, focusing on rent-sharing effects. The authors found that labor bears a significant portion of the tax burden, with 64% in the short run and 49% in the long run. However, there are reservations about the empirical methods used, as important variables like competitive wage were not included in the analysis. The study also raised concerns about the statistically significant relationships obtained and the possibility that they may not accurately represent the tax burden share. The authors of the study on tax incidence analyzed firm-level data from European countries, focusing on rent-sharing effects. They found that labor bears a significant portion of the tax burden, with 64% in the short run and 49% in the long run. However, there are concerns about the econometric methods used, as the results are not robust and the relationship being measured is unclear. Additionally, the study raised questions about the impact of exogenous tax changes on wages, especially in countries where tax rates did not change or mostly declined during periods of economic growth. The study by aus dem Moore, Kasten, and Schmidt compared wage changes in German manufacturing to French manufacturing after German tax reforms. German wages increased by 6.4% due to tax rate cuts, which was a significant effect. The ratio of wages to taxes was 11.9, with wages being about 12 times the amount of taxes. The reduction in German taxes was around 20%, leading to a $4 increase in wages for each dollar reduction in tax. The authors suggest that the empirical estimates may be capturing other influences. The authors of the study on German tax reforms suggest that their empirical estimates may be influenced by other factors. Another study by Dwenger, Rattenhuber, and Steiner also examines the German tax cut using firm data, but does not address theoretical concerns. They assume that labor bears 156% of the tax burden through bargaining, and that changes in wages lead to shifts in employment. This assumption is inconsistent with theory. The wage does not change from direct bargaining effect but arises from increased taxes, affecting employment in the corporate sector. General equilibrium effects cannot be uncovered with firm-specific data within a country. A study in Germany found a significant effect of corporate tax on wages. Bauer, Kasten, and Siemers discovered a significant impact of corporate tax on wages, particularly affecting low-skilled workers with less bargaining power. Their findings suggest that a 1% increase in tax rate led to a decrease in wages by 0.28% to 0.46%. Comparing to other studies, the results indicate that a dollar of corporate tax reduced wages by 336% to 550%. Additionally, Fuest, Peichl, and Sioegloch reported a 47% incidence in a wage bargaining model using data from German municipalities and local business tax changes. The incidence of tax changes in local business tax is 47%, with an estimated excess burden of 36%. Studies comparing outcomes in France and the UK show the share falling on wages to be 39% in France and 40% in the UK in the short run, and 66% in France and 73% in the UK in the long run. Az\u00e9mar and Hubbard estimated that 60% of the burden falls on labor in OECD countries, with union density playing a significant role. Studies in the United States show mixed results, with some indicating that wages rise with state tax rate increases. The study found that wages rise with state tax rate increases, but the union differential decreases. Workers in unionized firms bear 54% of the tax burden, with the analysis focusing on indirect effects rather than direct taxes on rents. The model used has a mistake, leading to an estimate that is likely outside the range of reasonable theoretical predictions. The study found that wages rise with state tax rate increases, but the union differential decreases. Workers in unionized firms bear 54% of the tax burden, with the analysis focusing on indirect effects rather than direct taxes on rents. The estimate appears outside the range of reasonable theoretical prediction and probably in the wrong direction. The share of the tax that falls on rents is no more than 3%, and rents would more likely benefit. In an open economy, wage shares can be estimated through capital flow across countries. Using a single country's data measures labor burden through rent-sharing, but tax on rents should not be shared. Liu and Altshuler's model lacks a bargaining equilibrium, leading to offsetting price and income effects that eliminate rent-sharing from taxes. Their empirical approach examines industry wage rate changes based on asset mix and marginal tax rate changes. The study examines how tax changes affect industries over time, with labor bearing 60% to 80% of the tax burden. The decline in marginal tax rates for equipment-heavy industries like manufacturing led to slower wage growth due to factors like decreased union influence and international competition. Empirical studies on tax incidence are criticized for producing unreasonable estimates and being inconsistent with theory. Based on general equilibrium models, most of the burden of the corporate tax falls on capital, with labor bearing 20% to 40% of the burden. Consideration of debt could cause more than 100% of the burden to fall on capital, making the tax progressive and primarily impacting capital. The corporate tax is a progressive one that falls largely on higher incomes, with efficiency concerns related to misallocation of resources and financial distortions affecting debt-equity ratio and capital gains realization. The corporate tax affects capital gains realization and asset mix efficiency costs. Key provisions include depreciation rules, production activities deduction, and R&D credit. Tax rates in the table are forward-looking and marginal, estimating the tax share on prospective investments. The corporate tax affects capital gains realization and asset mix efficiency costs, with key provisions including depreciation rules, production activities deduction, and R&D credit. The variations in tax rates distort the mix of capital within a firm and the allocation of capital across industries. The tax rate on equipment is estimated at about 24%, significantly lower than the statutory rate, resulting in an overall effective rate of 20%. Intangible investments like research, advertising, and human capital have the lowest tax rates. Spending on advertising, research, and development, and investment in human capital are expensed with zero tax rates. Research and development expenses are eligible for a credit, leading to a negative rate. Estimates of tax distortions take into account all levels of taxes, including individual passive income held in tax-exempt forms. The corporate sector's tax burden varies between debt and equity financing, with debt being negatively taxed and equity taxed at 22.4% or 26.5%. Shareholder taxes have minimal impact, with equity taxed at 19.7% at the firm level. The tax burden on interest at the firm level is 19.7%, influenced by tax-exempt investors and lower rates on capital gains. Debt is subsidized at the firm level with a negative 53.5% tax rate, while the overall corporate tax rate is 5.7%, impacting international capital allocation. The tax burden on interest at the firm level is 19.7%, with a 5.7% corporate tax rate affecting international capital allocation. Distortions in capital allocation can be reduced by measures like indexing interest payments for inflation and lowering corporate tax rates. The misallocation of capital between corporate and noncorporate sectors is a key concern, with differences in tax rates for business plant and equipment contributing to the distortion. The estimated distortion from having a separate corporate tax varies depending on the model used, ranging from less than 10% to about a third of corporate tax revenue. The recent decline in the differential due to lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains suggests a smaller distortion of probably no more than 4% to 7% of revenue. This distortion affects corporate payouts as appreciation in stock values is not taxed until realized. The tax on corporate income leads to distortions in corporate payouts, with a small welfare cost and around 10% of corporate tax revenues affected. There are also distortions due to the lock-in effect for capital gains realizations. Ways to reduce these distortions may be worth considering, despite the revenue needs of the government. The 2007 Treasury study focused on effects on savings, which is not typically the main concern regarding the efficiency of the corporate income tax. The distortion caused by corporate income taxes extends to all capital income taxes and is influenced by savings behavior in response to tax changes. Different economic models show varying levels of distortion, with potential increases depending on the substitution of taxes on wages for taxes on capital. Tax rules can impact capital allocation efficiency globally, with the U.S. corporate tax rate at 39%, higher than other countries. For firms eligible for U.S. production activities deductions, the rate was 36.3%. Effective tax rates were similar, but marginal rates were higher than the OECD average. This data suggests the U.S. is not significantly high tax compared to other countries. The United States is not a notably high tax country for investment, with the main international distortion being increased investment in low-tax countries. The inefficiency is due to a tax benefit for investment abroad, rather than the corporate effective tax rate. Potential revisions to the corporate tax include broadening the tax base to lower the rate or provide investment incentives. The curr_chunk discusses proposals to reform the corporate tax system, including broadening the tax base, correcting interest deductions, and increasing individual level taxes. It also mentions projections for corporate tax revenues and potential reductions in the corporate tax rate. The curr_chunk discusses potential revisions to corporate tax expenditures, including eliminating certain preferences to lower the statutory corporate tax rate. The 2007 Treasury study estimated that removing these preferences could lower the tax rate to 27%. Major preferences include expensing and accelerated depreciation, as well as the production activities deduction. The curr_chunk discusses tax expenditures, including the exclusion of interest on state and local bonds, research tax credit, and deferral of income from foreign sources. It also mentions a bill introduced in 2007 to lower the tax rate to 30.5% and extend provisions for small businesses. The proposal in 2007 aimed to lower the tax rate for small businesses at a cost of $20.5 billion. It included provisions such as eliminating the production activities deduction and restricting lower withholding tax rates on income invested in the US under treaty rules. The proposal in 2007 aimed to lower the tax rate for small businesses by eliminating the production activities deduction and restricting lower withholding tax rates on income invested in the US under treaty rules. Senator Wyden's tax reform proposal for the 111th Congress would eliminate various corporate tax preferences and lower the rate to 24%, including provisions like accelerated depreciation and deferral. The bill S. 3018 aims to reduce tax rates by using provisions outside standard tax expenditures to raise revenue, such as a per country foreign tax credit limit. It also raises revenue by disallowing interest deductions reflecting inflation. The Fiscal Commission proposed a similar measure but without deferral and the per country foreign tax credit limit. The Senate Finance Committee released discussion drafts in 2013 on cost recovery and accounting related to corporate taxation, including proposals for a new depreciation system and changes to deductions for research and development expenses. The draft also includes provisions for depreciating real property over 43 years and repealing LIFO and lower of cost of market inventory methods. In international tax rules, all foreign source income would be addressed. In international tax rules, all foreign source income would be subject to tax, with some income taxed at a lower rate. President Obama's budgets included corporate tax reform provisions focused on international, insurance, inventory accounting, and fossil fuels. The FY2016 budget introduced new international tax reform approaches, including provisions for disallowing interest expense for unrepatriated income and foreign tax credit. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed significant changes to corporate tax rules, including the replacement of provisions for disallowing interest expense for unrepatriated income with a minimum 19% tax on foreign source income. The Act was projected to raise an average annual gain of $35 billion over FY2017-FY2026, with additional revenue from intangible provisions. This proposal aimed to repeal or revise 115 corporate-related provisions, with estimates available in a Joint Committee on Taxation document. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed significant changes to corporate tax rules, including the replacement of provisions for disallowing interest expense for unrepatriated income with a minimum 19% tax on foreign source income. The most important tax expenditures in terms of revenue effect were slowing accelerated depreciation, amortization of research and development, phase-out and repeal of the production activities deduction, and elimination of LIFO and lower of cost or market inventory accounting. Other provisions included amortization of advertising and limiting net operating losses to offset no more than 90% of income. The system also moved to a territorial tax for international tax treatment. The CBO's budget options study includes revenue-raising corporate tax proposals, such as restricting depreciation and implementing a different foreign tax return. Various proposals have suggested cutting corporate tax rates to 27%, 24%, or 25%. The potential rate reduction depends on factors like using revenues from unincorporated businesses. The options for corporate tax rate reduction include using revenues from unincorporated businesses and addressing provisions related to timing differences. Base broadeners like accelerated depreciation could generate more revenue in the short term than in the long term. Eliminating corporate tax expenditures alone could potentially reduce the rate to 28%, but this may result in revenue loss over time. Eliminating corporate tax expenditures could reduce the rate to 27% in the long run, or 22% if deferral is included. Most traditional tax expenditures have limited impact on rate reduction, and combining provisions results in slightly smaller tax reductions. The most significant provision in terms of revenue is the deferral of tax on foreign source income, followed by accelerated depreciation and the production activities deduction. The Research and Experimentation (R&E) credit is considered an exception as it leads to higher social returns, but some economists believe it is poorly targeted and possibly abused. The tax exempt bond benefit is seen as beneficial for state and local governments. The tax expenditure provision includes benefits for state and local governments, charitable contributions, and low-income housing credits. Repealing certain provisions may be difficult due to support, and trading accelerated depreciation for a rate reduction could impact the cost of capital. The 2007 Treasury study suggested using base broadening for investment incentives like partial expensing. Investment incentives like partial expensing have been discussed as part of tax proposals. Designing subsidies that are neutral across assets and generate even revenue loss is challenging. Historically, investment subsidies have been limited to equipment, with options like investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation. However, these options have limitations in terms of favoring short-lived assets or having uneven revenue loss patterns. Lowering the statutory tax rate reduces profit shifting incentives to tax havens. Ending deferral of foreign income taxation, as proposed in S. 3018, could also lessen this incentive. There are potential gains from taxing foreign income, but international reforms, such as a territorial tax, are controversial. The \"Better Way\" proposal and the Fiscal Commission have suggested adopting a territorial tax, which could either raise revenue, lose revenue, or break even depending on its design. A territorial tax could have varying financial outcomes depending on its design features. The 2014 Ways and Means proposal would be revenue neutral in the budget horizon but lose revenue in the long run. Different approaches, such as exempting dividends of active businesses or deferring interest deductions, could also impact revenue. Based on 2013 data, potential gains from adjusting interest deductions could result in a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the tax rate. One way to reduce the corporate tax rate is by raising individual taxes and using the revenue to lower the corporate tax rate. Rolling back the 2003 tax changes on dividends could allow the federal corporate tax rate to be reduced to 32.9%. Taxing capital gains at higher rates could also generate additional revenue. One proposal to increase revenue is to tax corporate capital gains on an accrual basis, which could yield more revenue and eliminate distortions. Lowering corporate rates could be achieved by taxing non-profits to offset their savings. Another option is to tax large pass-through entities as corporations. The impact on revenue would depend on changes in taxation of dividends and capital. The revenue impact of changing the tax treatment of pass-through income depends on adjustments to taxation of dividends, capital gains, individual, and corporate income rates. The calculation assumes restoring pass-through income to its previous level and taxing profits at an effective 15.7% rate. There is debate on the urgency of lowering the corporate tax rate. Many recent discussions and analyses suggest the need to lower the corporate tax rate. However, claims of increased revenues from cutting rates do not hold up under empirical examination. Studies showing a revenue-maximizing tax rate of 30% contain errors, and cross-country studies on the burden of corporate tax on labor have flaws. Claims of high U.S. tax rates causing problems in the global economy are misrepresented. In a global economy, there is a misrepresentation of the U.S. tax rate compared to other countries, especially when capital is not easily mobile. While some argue for the necessity of corporate tax as a backstop for individual tax collections, it does create economic distortions. However, these distortions have decreased over time as corporate rates have fallen. Implementing revenue-neutral changes could reduce these distortions and lead to a more efficient corporate tax system, although the potential for significant rate reduction is limited. In a global economy, the U.S. tax rate misrepresents compared to other countries, especially when capital is not easily mobile. Corporate tax is argued as necessary for individual tax collections but creates economic distortions, which have decreased over time as rates have fallen. Implementing revenue-neutral changes could reduce distortions and lead to a more efficient corporate tax system, with limited potential for significant rate reduction. The revenue-maximizing tax rate in an open economy is determined by factors such as corporate capital stock and after-tax rate of return. The Gravelle and Smetters paper discusses the revenue-maximizing tax rate in a global economy, considering factors like labor share of income, factor substitution elasticity, and output share. They show that in a small country with perfect substitutability, the revenue-maximizing rate can be as high as 75%, and even higher for larger countries like the United States. Factors like capital mobility and product substitutability can further increase the tax rate. The Gravelle and Smetters paper discusses the revenue-maximizing tax rate in a global economy, considering factors like labor share of income, factor substitution elasticity, and output share. They suggest that in extreme cases, such as a closed economy or the Ramsey growth model, a 75% tax rate could apply. This would result in a fixed after-tax return and a burden on wage income, leading to a decrease in labor income. Additionally, a corporate tax rate that maximizes revenue while considering its impact on wages could be calculated. The data from various studies on corporate tax rates were analyzed using panel data. The relationship between the corporate tax rate and dependent variables was examined through linear regression models. The random error term in the linear regression model captures omitted factors affecting the dependent variable. If certain conditions are met, OLS estimators provide unbiased estimates of the parameters. The parameter represents the true relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The parameter of interest in linear regression is the true relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The estimator is a random variable with desirable properties: unbiased, efficient, and consistent. Panel data can lead to biased and inconsistent estimators due to unmet conditions. The term captures unobserved heterogeneity specific to a country in panel data analysis. The unobserved heterogeneity specific to a country in panel data analysis includes differences in economic data, institutions, laws, regulations, and attitudes toward business. Ignoring this heterogeneity leads to biased and inconsistent estimates in linear regression. Autocorrelation and correlation between error terms from year to year are common issues in data analysis. The parameters of the model are estimated using fixed effect estimation with an AR(1) error structure. The fixed effects method has limitations when variables vary across countries but not across time within a country. OLS is used without justification in some studies, despite the lack of variation within countries to identify effects of certain variables. The study examines the variation of the corporate tax rate across countries and over time to justify the use of OLS. Results from three reanalyzed studies show the mean, standard deviation, and decomposition of the standard deviation into between and within country components. If there is no variation over time within countries, the effect on the dependent variable cannot be estimated using fixed effects. The study analyzes the variation of corporate tax rates across OECD countries from 1979 to 2002. There is significant variation within and between countries, with some changing their rates multiple times. On average, countries changed their rates once every five years. The study refutes the argument that the effect of corporate tax rates on revenues is not identifiable with fixed effects. Appendix C details modeling problems in the Desai, Foley, and Hines study. The Desai, Foley, and Hines study (DFH) fails to recognize price variability in their modeling problems, leading to unjustified cross-equation restrictions. Their model overlooks the existence of other sectors in the economy and starts with a basic equation related to general equilibrium models. The Desai, Foley, and Hines study (DFH) derive an equation to motivate their regression model, assuming a fixed price to show the relationship between tax changes, interest rates, and wages. The model overlooks price variability and other sectors in the economy. Countries have preferences for goods based on country of origin, leading to price responses known as Armington elasticities. Firms produce heterogeneous products with varying capital intensities, making fixed prices unrealistic in a world economy trading numerous products with differential taxation. The problem with the interpretation of the findings is that they did not adjust for other sectors in the economy, including non-traded sectors and sectors not subject to the corporate tax. Incidence results must be adjusted for the fact that the tax is only a partial one. The fraction of the tax falling on labor, denoted as rKc, can be determined by estimating the effects on r and w. The real change in wages is derived by dividing the change in nominal wage by the change in total price level. The percentage change in real wage can be expressed as a function of the share of the burden falling on labor income. The equation for incidence in the economy is obtained by substituting values and normalizing the initial price level. The burden on labor from the tax sector is determined by the ratio of total labor to labor in the tax sector. Factors such as capital intensity affect whether the burden on labor increases or decreases. The possibility of lower burden on labor is significant, especially in sectors like housing in the United States. Studies on bargaining models and rent-sharing of corporate taxes are important in understanding the impact on labor. Bargaining models in tax studies focus on maximizing welfare for recipients through a Nash equilibrium. The model includes variables like wages, utility, profit, and bargaining strength. The goal is to differentiate with respect to wages to maximize benefits. The bargaining solution formula derived in ADM focuses on wages, capital stock, and profits. It is expressed as wN= w*N+[(1- \u00b5)/\u00b5] (\u03a0-\u03a0*), where \u03a0 represents revenue and \u03a0* represents the return on capital. This formula is used to estimate wages and analyze the excess wage. The formula for estimating wages in the bargaining model includes a tax term, reflecting the deductibility of wages from taxes. This results in an increase in wages due to tax savings, making the cost of paying surplus in wages smaller. The tax term in the formula for estimating wages reduces excess profit and affects the cost of paying surplus in wages. Taxes only impact the cost of capital, not wages, and the burden of the tax on excess profits is borne by the owners. Taxes increase the normal cost of capital. ADM's model ignores the indirect burden of taxes on wages, focusing instead on the direct effect of taxes outside of general equilibrium effects. They introduce a term (\u03d5) in their formula for estimating wages that is not clearly defined and not related to profit or the cost of capital. This term represents a tax payment that is separate from profits or capital costs, but it is unclear what qualifies as part of \u03d5. Examples such as deductions for interest and pension fund contributions may fall under deductible costs or wage compensation. ADM lacks a way to measure the value of \u03d5 in their regression analysis. Estimating the relationship in D(7) involves running a regression on total taxes per worker using instrumental variables like tax rates. Felix and Hines estimate the union wage premium in their version of (D6), denoting labor as L and the competitive wage as w. They use \u03b1 as the bargaining share in their equation (D8) without a product price P. The text discusses the impact of tax rates on the demand for capital and labor, using an optimization model to simplify the expression. The proper form of the equation is given, along with conditions for maximizing profit. The Cobb Douglas function is used to represent quantity, with first-order conditions for capital and labor also provided. The text discusses the impact of tax rates on the demand for capital and labor using an optimization model. Equation (D14) shows that tax rates do not affect the wage premium, which increases as demand becomes less elastic. For a Cobb Douglas function, there is no need to estimate the wage premium based on tax rates. The text discusses the impact of tax rates on the demand for capital and labor using an optimization model. The ratio of returns to wages changes with factor substitution elasticity. The effect of taxes on rents is ambiguous. The semi-elasticity of the ratio of returns to wages is small, ranging from 0.09 to -0.09. The study calculates the elasticity of tax burden on wages and returns, assuming a factor substitution elasticity below 1. The interpretation that 54% of the tax falls on rents is questioned due to the calculation method used. The impact on wages was found to be positive in their estimates. The study calculates the elasticity of tax burden on wages and returns, assuming a factor substitution elasticity below 1. The impact on rents is calculated by multiplying 0.36 by the ratio of rents to corporate tax collects. The share of tax burden on rents ranges from 3% to 13% depending on different assumptions."
