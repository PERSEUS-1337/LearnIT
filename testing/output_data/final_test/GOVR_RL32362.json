    "content": "Mental health and substance abuse services aim to address the negative effects of mental illness and drug addiction. Mental illness encompasses diagnosable mental disorders characterized by changes in thinking, mood, or behavior. Treatment options include psychosocial therapies, prescription drugs, or a combination of both. The Surgeon General's report outlines the mental health system, which includes specialty mental health services provided by professionals like psychologists and psychiatrists, and general medical/primary care services offered by health professionals such as family practitioners and pediatricians. Various types of mental health treatment are defined by their specialties. The mental health system includes specialty services provided by psychologists and psychiatrists, as well as general medical services by family practitioners and pediatricians. Mental health treatment is categorized by duration and setting, with services for acute conditions and long-term care in institutional, community-based, and home-based settings. Substance abuse treatment consists of detoxification and medication management, as well as education and counseling. Substance abuse treatment includes services to reduce drug use and dependence, improve functioning, and minimize complications. Care is provided in various settings with different levels of intensity. Medicaid covers medical services for low-income individuals. In FY2000, Medicaid covered 44.3 million people at a cost of $116.9 billion to the federal government. Eligibility is based on income and resources, with varying standards among states. Medicaid is generally available to low-income individuals who are aged, blind, disabled, or members of families with dependent children. Certain individuals with higher income and high medical costs may also qualify. Medicaid eligibility includes over 50 distinct population groups, divided into \"categorically needy\" and \"medically needy\" classifications. Some groups require disability status for eligibility, such as recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Children with mental illness and substance abuse issues may qualify for coverage under certain Medicaid groups that do not require disability criteria, such as families meeting specific income levels or pregnant women and young children. These groups have more lenient financial criteria compared to the SSI pathway into Medicaid. States may establish higher income and resource standards for the medically needy, who can \"spend down\" to the medically needy income standard by incurring medical expenses. Net income after subtracting medical expenses is used to determine eligibility. States have the option of covering the medically needy, including children under 18 and pregnant women with income/resources too high for other groups. States may also offer medically needy coverage to otherwise ineligible individuals under 21. In 2002, 36 states had medically needy programs covering individuals under 21 who meet financial criteria. 24.2 million children were enrolled in Medicaid in FY2000, accounting for 55% of the total Medicaid population. Total Medicaid expenditures for children were $38.5 billion in that year. Some Medicaid benefits are mandatory, while others are covered at state discretion, including mental health and substance abuse services. Some Medicaid benefits, such as inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physician services, and home health services, are mandatory for children under 21. The EPSDT program provides screening and preventive care for this group, including mental health services. States are required to provide all federally-allowed treatment to correct identified health problems for children under the EPSDT program, including mental health and substance abuse services. Optional Medicaid benefits for children may include services provided by licensed practitioners, clinic services, and prescribed drugs. The Medicaid program covers a range of services for individuals, including mental health and substance abuse services, inpatient psychiatric services for those under 21, and case management. States may offer a more limited set of benefits to medically needy individuals. Additional benefits are required for states covering IMD services. States covering IMD services or services in ICF/MR for medically needy beneficiaries must provide mandatory services for categorically needy or any seven categories of care listed in Medicaid law. Waivers can be obtained for special programs, such as mental health and substance abuse services, with some states like Kansas, New York, and Vermont having specific waivers for children with severe mental health needs. Some states like Kansas, New York, and Vermont have waivers to provide special services for children with severe mental illness under SCHIP, including caregiver training, crisis intervention, and case management. SCHIP was established in 1997 to provide health insurance to uninsured children with modest income. Approximately 5.3 million children were enrolled in SCHIP during FY2002, with $12.5 billion in federal funds spent nationally through June 2003. Eligibility for SCHIP allows states to cover uninsured children under age 19 in families with incomes above Medicaid standards. States have flexibility in defining eligibility for SCHIP, considering factors like geography, age, income, and resources. Children eligible for Medicaid or with other insurance are not eligible for SCHIP. Income limits vary among states, with some reaching 350% FPL. SCHIP covers a wide range of benefits, including mental health and substance abuse services. SCHIP provides a wide range of coverable benefits, including mental health and substance abuse treatment services such as inpatient and outpatient care, prescription drugs, home-based care, nursing services, and case management. SCHIP offers various healthcare services, including mental health and substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs, home-based care, nursing services, and case management. States have three options for designing their SCHIP programs: expanding Medicaid, creating a separate state program, or a combination of both. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have SCHIP programs in operation. States expanding Medicaid under SCHIP authority must provide full mandatory Medicaid benefits for the categorically needy, along with optional services. Alternatively, states can opt for a separate program with three benefit options: benchmark package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or a plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The chosen option determines the covered benefits under separate SCHIP programs. Benchmark equivalent coverage under SCHIP requires states to provide a package of benefits with the same actuarial value as the benchmark plan, covering basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, and well-child care, along with additional services like prescription drugs and mental health services. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) includes prescription drugs, mental health, vision, and hearing services. States can apply for waivers to establish demonstration projects for unique needs. Currently, only a few states have such waivers. The Congressional Research Service collected data on benefit limits for children under Medicaid and SCHIP in 2000. Two survey instruments were developed for Medicaid and separate state SCHIP programs to collect benefits data in June 2000. Respondents indicated service amounts children could receive without prior authorization. Limits could be absolute, indicating a maximum amount even with prior authorization. Survey results were reported for all 50 states and the District of Columbia for Medicaid, and for 41 separate programs in 33 states for SCHIP. In June 2000, survey instruments were used to collect benefits data for separate state SCHIP programs in 33 states. Five general mental health and substance abuse service categories were included, such as inpatient and outpatient services, detoxification, substance abuse, and residential treatment. The survey did not directly correspond to specific benefits listed in Medicaid statute. Under Medicaid statute, various providers can deliver outpatient mental health and substance abuse services, covered under benefit categories like outpatient hospital services, rural health and federally qualified health center services, physician services, other practitioner services, and other clinic services. Inpatient mental health services and detoxification are likely covered as inpatient hospital services or inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under 21. Psychiatric services for individuals under 21 are typically provided in general acute care hospitals with psychiatric care wings, psychiatric hospitals, or residential treatment centers. The benefits listed in SCHIP statute align closely with service categories in surveys, but there is no specific category for residential treatment centers. Each service category in surveys likely corresponds to multiple benefits in both Medicaid and SCHIP statute, posing a challenge for survey design due to potential differences in coverage limits. The survey data on benefit limits for outpatient mental health services are imprecise due to different limits for physician services and other clinic services. The results represent general benefit limit policies for mental health and substance abuse services for children under each program. Both Medicaid and SCHIP programs rely on managed care organizations to deliver services, making it challenging to obtain detailed data on variations in benefit limits specific to individual managed care contracts. The survey data highlights the different methods states use in their Medicaid and SCHIP programs to define the breadth of services for children. The results serve as a baseline documenting coverage policies during a period of expansion. Tables 1 through 5 summarize whether mental health and substance abuse services are covered. As of June 2000, most Medicaid and SCHIP programs covered inpatient and outpatient mental health services for children, with Medicaid programs offering more unlimited benefits than SCHIP programs. Additionally, both programs covered inpatient detoxification and outpatient substance abuse services for children, with varying levels of unlimited benefits. Medicaid programs offer more unlimited benefits for inpatient mental health services compared to SCHIP programs. There are discrepancies in coverage for Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs), with only one-fourth of Medicaid programs not covering RTC services, while 44% of SCHIP programs do not provide this benefit. Some SCHIP programs do offer access to RTC services, despite it not being a typical benefit in commercial insurance products. As of Oct. 2000, 36 states had medically needy programs under Medicaid, with coverage varying for categorically needy and medically needy beneficiaries. States without medically needy programs included AK, AL, AZ, CO, DE, ID, IN, MO, MS, NM, NV, OH, SC, SD, and WY, always listed in the \"CN Only\" sub-column. In the SCHIP column, 28 states had a single program. As of June 2000, states had separate SCHIP programs with different benefit plans, some having multiple programs distinguished by extensions to the state abbreviation.

In the Medicaid column, coverage, limitations, and monitoring of inpatient mental health services apply to categorically needy and medically needy beneficiaries. As of Oct. 2000, 36 states had medically needy programs under Medicaid. These states may be shown in either the \"CN Only\" or the \"CN+MN\" sub-columns, depending on benefit coverage policies. In the SCHIP column, 28 states had a single separate SCHIP program represented by the state abbreviation. The remaining five states with separate SCHIP programs each had more than one such program with different benefit plans. Two states (California and New Jersey) each had two separate SCHIP programs, distinguished by A or B extensions. Three states (Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts) each had three separate SCHIP programs, distinguished by A, B, or C extensions. As of June 2000, multiple programs (e.g., CT-A, CT-B, CT-C) were analyzed for coverage and monitoring of outpatient substance abuse services for children under Medicaid and SCHIP. State abbreviations were used in the analysis, with different coverage and limitations based on beneficiary classification. Additionally, as of October 2000, 36 states had medically needy programs that covered certain groups under Medicaid. In June 2000, multiple programs were analyzed for outpatient substance abuse services for children under Medicaid and SCHIP. 36 states had medically needy programs under Medicaid, with some states having separate SCHIP programs with different benefit plans. Some states had multiple SCHIP programs distinguished by extensions to the state abbreviation.

Appendices provide details on limits for mental health services under Medicaid, with many states using prior authorization for inpatient services. Some SCHIP programs set quantity limits on inpatient mental health services, often combining them with substance abuse treatment or other related benefits. This approach allows for tailored benefits to meet individual needs. Some states set quantity limits for inpatient mental health care, varying by managed care organization or type of provider. Dollar-based limits are used for outpatient mental health services in a few states under Medicaid. In SCHIP programs, non-dollar quantity limits were commonly used for outpatient mental health services, with variations based on units or hours of service, visits, type of service, and provider. Some states required an initial evaluation and treatment plan for beneficiaries to determine Medicaid coverage. Overall, the limits on outpatient mental health services in SCHIP were similar to those in Medicaid, with over half of SCHIP programs applying non-dollar quantity limits. Few programs used dollar-based limits for mental health services, while some had provider-specific, type of service-specific, or condition-specific restrictions. Similar methods were used to limit outpatient substance abuse services. For inpatient detoxification, half of the states used prior authorization or other types of review. Day limits for inpatient detoxification were short in some cases, reflecting per admission/episode limits. Residential Treatment Center Services are increasingly used to treat children with psychiatric disorders, replacing hospitals. Some programs have limits on inpatient detoxification services, including day limits per year or benefit period, single quantity limits, and lifetime limits. Overall, there are quantity limits on general inpatient acute care hospitalizations. Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs) are replacing hospitals for treating children with psychiatric disorders. State Medicaid programs often require prior authorization for RTC admissions, with quantity limits specified as day limits per admission or episode. SCHIP programs may not cover RTC services, but those that do often have day limits per admission, episode, year, or benefit period. Some SCHIP programs set a single quantity limit for RTC services in combination with other treatments for mental illness and substance abuse. Comparing benefit limits under Medicaid and SCHIP requires caution due to differences in the meaning of \"limits\" between the two programs. The difference in the meaning of \"limits\" between Medicaid and SCHIP programs impacts the breadth of care available and data collection on benefit restrictions. States choose service delivery systems for Medicaid and SCHIP, including fee-for-service and managed care. Hybrid models combining features of both systems exist. Managed care involves MCOs monitoring and controlling service delivery, while FFS has state agencies in control. Under Medicaid, state agencies set limits on benefits and optional services, along with utilization controls like prior authorization. Providers receive payments based on state-established rates for specific services. Health care providers under FFS require special approval to continue delivering necessary services beyond set limits. Under Medicaid, providers may need approval from the state to deliver medically necessary services beyond set limits. For example, a state Medicaid plan may limit outpatient mental health services to 24 visits per year, but additional visits can be approved if medically necessary. Fee-for-service delivery is common for individuals not served by managed care or who opt out. Most Medicaid children without disabilities receive services in this way. Most Medicaid children without disabilities receive services in managed care settings where state agencies negotiate benefit plans with contracted organizations. These organizations establish provider networks and pay negotiated rates for covered services. Benefit plans can be comprehensive or limited in scope, with variations in coverage and limits across Medicaid managed care. In Medicaid managed care plans, there are variations in coverage and benefit limits across different plans within a state. Utilization controls are used to monitor service delivery and ensure medically necessary benefits. Additional funding may be provided for extended services if benefit limits are met, or the child may continue to receive services in a fee-for-service setting. Under fee-for-service and managed care in Medicaid, states must provide all federally-allowed treatment for children, even if not covered under the state's plan, through EPSDT. Providers may need prior authorization for \"EPSDT extended benefits.\" SCHIP programs follow private insurance models. Under SCHIP programs, managed care is the primary service delivery system, with most states contracting with managed care or indemnity plans. California has 23 comprehensive health plans under SCHIP. Benefits are limited by medical necessity, with variations in other limits and monitoring of service delivery. Providers receive payments for participating in these programs. Some children with mental health issues and substance abuse problems can access inpatient and outpatient services through Medicaid and SCHIP. However, the availability of benefits may vary between the two programs. The breadth of benefits under Medicaid and SCHIP varies across states. SCHIP children have access to benefit packages similar to the private sector. Concerns have been raised about potential cuts in benefits due to economic downturn. Medicaid costs have increased due to pharmaceuticals, long-term care services, and enrollment growth. States have implemented various Medicaid cost containment strategies, including reducing prescription drug costs, provider reimbursement rates, and optional services. Some actions taken include eliminating coverage for certain adults, non-custodial parents, and services like dental, chiropractic, optometry, and podiatry. States are also delaying or rescinding plans for service expansions and facing enrollment growth challenges in their SCHIP programs. Cost containment activities in Medicaid and SCHIP programs include eliminating dental care for adults without children, reducing payments for providers, capping enrollment, and increasing beneficiary cost-sharing. While mental health and substance abuse benefits for children seem largely intact, access to care may still be reduced in the near term. The status of mental health parity remains a significant policy issue for the mental health community. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) established federal standards for mental health coverage by group health plans in 1996. However, it does not require full-parity mental health coverage and allows for more restrictive treatment limitations and cost sharing. Substance abuse and chemical dependency treatment are excluded from the definition of mental health benefits under MHPA. Medicaid managed care plans and SCHIP programs must comply with MHPA, with specific requirements for prepaid Medicaid managed care contracts. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) applies to prepaid Medicaid managed care contracts and SCHIP programs offering group health insurance coverage. The MHPA does not apply to fee-for-service arrangements. Legislation in the 108th Congress aims to expand the MHPA by requiring group health plans to treat mental health coverage the same as medical and surgical coverage. The bills for full-parity legislation have bipartisan support but face opposition from employers and health insurance organizations due to cost concerns. Medicaid managed care plans and SCHIP programs would need to comply with the full-parity provisions. Source: Congressional Research Service analysis of benefits data collected in 2000 surveys.
