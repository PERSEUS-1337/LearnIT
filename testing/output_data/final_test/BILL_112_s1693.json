    "content": "The new section 849 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces special rules for reinsurance of non-life contracts with non-taxed affiliates. The taxable income of an insurance company is determined by excluding non-taxed reinsurance premiums, additional amounts paid for such reinsurance, and any returns or commissions related to the reinsurance. Non-taxed reinsurance premiums are defined as premiums paid to an affiliated corporation for reinsurance of risks not subject to tax. Affiliated corporations are those connected to an insurance company. Affiliated corporations are treated as such if they would be part of the same controlled group of corporations under specific conditions. A specified affiliated corporation can elect to treat reinsurance income as effectively connected with a trade or business in the US for tax purposes. The specified affiliated corporation can elect to treat reinsurance income as effectively connected with a trade or business in the US for tax purposes, exempting it from certain taxes and subjecting it to tax under this subchapter. The specified affiliated corporation can elect to treat reinsurance income as effectively connected with a trade or business in the US for tax purposes, exempting it from certain taxes and subjecting it to tax under this subchapter. Such specified reinsurance income shall be treated as derived from sources without the United States for purposes of foreign tax credit provisions. The Secretary may issue regulations or other guidance regarding related items of specified income. The specified affiliated corporation can elect to aggregate related items of reinsurance income for tax purposes. The term 'specified reinsurance income' refers to income attributable to reinsurance subject to certain conditions. The Secretary may prescribe requirements to ensure proper tax determination and payment by foreign affiliated corporations. The Secretary may provide rules for elections related to reinsurance income, applicable for the taxable year and subsequent years unless revoked. Regulations will be prescribed to prevent avoidance of tax purposes, including alternative reinsurance transactions. Subchapter L of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item at the end. The amendment applies to reinsurance of non-life contracts with non-taxed affiliates starting after December 31, 2011."
