    "content": "The \"Veterans' Hospice Care Services Act of 1995\" establishes programs for furnishing hospice care to veterans under Chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code. This includes a hospice care pilot program and hospice care services. The term 'terminally ill veteran' in the \"Veterans' Hospice Care Services Act of 1995\" refers to a veteran who is receiving hospital or nursing home care under specific conditions and has a life expectancy of six months or less as certified by a Department physician. The term 'hospice care services' includes care, items, and services as defined in the Social Security Act, along with personal care services. A 'hospice program' is any program meeting specific requirements, while a 'medical facility of the Department' refers to a facility specified in the law. A 'non-Department facility' is any facility, other than a Department medical facility, where care is provided to terminally ill veterans. During a pilot program from 1995 to 2000, the Secretary conducted an assessment on providing hospice care services to terminally ill veterans. The program aimed to determine the most effective means of delivering such services. Personal care services, necessary for maintaining health and safety, were defined as including dressing, personal hygiene, feeding, nutrition, and environmental support. The Secretary conducted a pilot program to provide hospice care services to terminally ill veterans. The program aimed to designate medical facilities, means of providing services, allocate resources, and enter into necessary arrangements. The Secretary conducted a pilot program to provide hospice care services to terminally ill veterans. The program aimed to designate medical facilities, means of providing services, allocate resources, and enter into necessary arrangements to ensure the provision of services. The Secretary considered the need to gather information for evaluating hospice care services by various means and in different circumstances, including facilities in urban and rural areas. The Secretary conducted a pilot program to provide hospice care services to terminally ill veterans in various medical facilities with different affiliations and bed capacities. The demonstration projects were located based on relevant criteria to evaluate the furnishing of hospice care services. Hospice care can be provided through designated means under the program. The Secretary shall designate means for providing hospice care services, including care at Department medical facilities, hospice programs with inpatient services at Department or non-Department facilities. Care must be provided at a minimum of five Department medical facilities.

Inpatient care for terminally ill veterans can be provided at a different facility if necessary. Payment to a hospice program for care must not exceed the amount under the Social Security Act. The Secretary may pay hospice programs for care to terminally ill veterans if deemed necessary and if the payment under the Social Security Act is insufficient to cover costs. This falls under the provision for care for terminally ill veterans. The Secretary shall designate at least 10 medical facilities to provide palliative care to terminally ill veterans through hospice services or monitoring at Department or non-Department facilities. The Secretary shall ensure terminally ill veterans receive information on hospice care eligibility and services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.

The Secretary must submit a report by August 1, 1999, to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs evaluating the hospice care pilot program and services for terminally ill veterans. The report will include descriptions of the pilot program, demonstration projects, and facilities providing care. The report to be submitted by the Secretary will include details on the facility conducting the demonstration project, how it was selected, means of providing hospice care services to terminally ill veterans, personnel involved, and a factual analysis of services provided. The report to be submitted by the Secretary will include details on inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, home-care visits, direct costs incurred by terminally ill veterans and their families, and the costs incurred by the Department in conducting the demonstration project. The report will include an analysis of costs related to furnishing services in Department and non-Department facilities, administering services, and unreimbursed costs incurred by other entities. It will also analyze the satisfaction levels of terminally ill veterans and their families receiving services under the project. The report will include a description of hospice care services provided at Department medical facilities, along with a comparative analysis by the Under Secretary for Health of services offered to terminally ill veterans. The report will analyze the health services provided to terminally ill veterans in demonstration projects and designated facilities, focusing on pain management, inpatient admissions, medical procedures, and overall effectiveness. The report will assess the effectiveness of projects and facilities in providing care to terminally ill veterans, including hospice services and recommendations for additional legislation. The text outlines a hospice care pilot program for terminally ill veterans, including definitions, program requirements, care provisions, information dissemination, and evaluation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs retains authority to provide hospice care services under additional programs.
