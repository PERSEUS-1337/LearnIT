    "title": "SB 856",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 905.2 of the Government Code is amended to apply to claims against the state filed with the Department of General Services. Claims for money or damages against the state must be presented in accordance with the specified chapters, including claims for reissuance of warrants. Claims can be made for express contracts or injuries for which the state is liable. Claims against the state for money or damages must be filed with the Department of General Services and are subject to a filing fee of $25, except for certain types of claims. The fee collected goes into the Service Revolving Fund for the support of the Department of General Services. The fee does not apply to individuals receiving benefits from specific programs or whose income is 125 percent or less of the current monthly poverty line. Persons sentenced to imprisonment or confined in a state institution with a balance of $100 or less in their trust account can request a fee waiver by submitting a signed affidavit and financial information. There is no entitlement to a hearing for fee waiver denials. The Department of General Services will begin processing the claim when the filing fee is submitted or the fee waiver is granted. Upon approval of the claim by the Department of General Services, the filing fee will be reimbursed to the claimant, except for claims for expired warrants. The state entity against which the claim was filed will pay the reimbursement. If a fee waiver was granted, the state entity will pay the fee to the department. Payment will be made when the claim is paid by the state entity or added to an equity claims bill. The Department of General Services may assess a surcharge of up to 15% of the approved claim to the state entity. The surcharge, excluding the refunded filing fee, will be deposited into the Service Revolving Fund for department support. The surcharge does not apply to reissued expired warrants. The Controller will transfer fees from the state entity's appropriation to support the department upon request, excluding amounts needing legislative approval. The filing fee and surcharge apply to claims filed after June 30, 2004. The section does not apply to claims under the California Whistleblower Protection Act. Comprehensive services include shelter, hotline, and temporary housing. The Human Trafficking Victims Assistance Fund provides temporary housing, food facilities, psychological support, peer counseling, referrals to community services, and emergency transportation. The Director of the Office of Emergency Services oversees the Fund, and a qualified nonprofit organization must meet specific criteria to receive assistance. The Human Trafficking Victims Assistance Fund offers services to victims, including housing, counseling, and social services. A victim of human trafficking is defined as someone trafficked in the state or who fled to the state. The participating county must contribute at least 10% of total project costs for adult local criminal justice facilities. The BSCC determines funding and scoring criteria for counties eligible for financing programs. $20 million is set aside for Napa County from the authorized amount. The funding criteria for counties eligible for financing programs include documenting pretrial inmate percentages and describing risk assessment-based pretrial release programs. Preference is given to counties prepared to proceed with financing in a timely manner. Counties must provide a resolution authorizing matching funds for financing and approving necessary project documents to the BSCC. Matching funds must be compatible with state lease-revenue bond financing. Counties must provide documentation of CEQA compliance, including a final Notice of Determination or Notice of Exemption, and a letter from county counsel certifying statute of limitations expiration and resolution of any challenges. Funding priority will be given to counties replacing outdated housing with treatment space or renovating/building facilities for treatment and rehabilitation services. (d) A participating county may replace existing housing capacity with minimal increase using this financing authority if there is a documented capacity deficiency. The county must certify that they will not lease the housing capacity for 10 years after completion. Any locked facility funded by the state must include space for in-person visitation meeting state regulations. The County of Napa is awarded $20 million for its adult local criminal justice facility without the need for further proposals. This funding can be used in conjunction with a partial award previously received. The sum of $3 million is appropriated from the Gambling Control Fund to the Department of Justice to address the backlog in investigations related to card room licensing. This act is a bill providing appropriations related to the Budget Bill and shall take effect immediately."
