    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2009\". Congress emphasizes the importance of science-based nutrition standards for school food service programs to receive Federal reimbursements under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and the National School Lunch Act. Foods sold outside of these programs are not required to meet the same nutritional standards. Congress has authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish nutrition standards in the school lunchroom during meal times to promote child nutrition and health. Since 1979, the Secretary has prohibited the sale of food of minimal nutritional value in areas where school meals are sold or eaten. The uneven authority of the Secretary to apply nutrition standards throughout the school campus and over the course of the school day undermines federally reimbursed school meals and child nutrition and health. The definition of \"food of minimal nutritional value\" is the national nutrition standard for foods sold outside of school meals. Since the 1970s, obesity rates among children ages 6 to 19 have tripled, and children's sodium intake is 214 percent above recommended levels. This undermines parents' efforts to ensure their children consume healthful diets, as some children purchase foods other than balanced meals provided through school lunch and breakfast programs. In 1996, children aged 2 to 18 consumed an excessive amount of saturated fat, with over 2/3 of foods consumed by schoolchildren being recommended for occasional intake. Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for children with type 2 diabetes, and a quarter of children aged 5 to 10 show early signs of heart disease. Children aged 2 to 18 consumed 118 more calories per day in 1996 compared to 1978, leading to potential weight gain. The national cost of obesity is $123 billion annually, with half covered by Medicare and Medicaid programs. SEC. 3. NATIONAL SCHOOL NUTRITION STANDARDS. Amends Section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to regulate nutrition standards. The Secretary shall establish science-based nutrition standards for foods served in schools other than foods provided under the Child Nutrition Act and the National School Lunch Act. The Secretary will establish nutrition standards for foods sold outside the school meal programs on the school campus during the extended school day, considering recommendations from scientific organizations. The Secretary will establish nutrition standards for foods sold outside of the reimbursable meal programs in schools, considering the positive and negative contributions of nutrients, ingredients, and foods to children's diets, evidence on the relationship between certain nutrients and chronic illnesses, and special exemptions for school-sponsored fundraisers. The Secretary will establish nutrition standards for foods sold outside of the reimbursable meal programs in schools, considering nutrients, ingredients, and special exemptions for school-sponsored fundraisers approved by the school and infrequent within the school. The standards will be updated after the publication of new Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Secretary will establish nutrition standards for foods sold outside of the reimbursable meal programs in schools, with special exemptions for school-sponsored fundraisers. The regulations will take effect at the beginning of the school year following finalization, unless finalized within 90 days before the school year. The Secretary will also submit reports on the implementation of the regulations. The Secretary will submit quarterly reports to the Senate and House committees on progress towards finalizing regulations for nutrition standards in schools."
