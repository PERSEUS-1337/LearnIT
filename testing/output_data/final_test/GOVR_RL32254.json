The federal income tax burden on small firms is a perennial issue for Congress, with differing views on its impact on formation and growth. Small firms are seen as vital for job creation, technological innovation, and advancing the economic status of minorities, immigrants, and women. Some view the federal income tax as an obstacle, while others see it as a policy tool for boosting small firms. Seven bills have been enacted by the 111th Congress to establish new tax preferences for small firms. The federal income tax burden on small firms is a perennial issue for Congress, with differing views on its impact on formation and growth. Seven bills have been enacted by the 111th Congress to establish new tax preferences for small firms, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Small business tax benefits raise potential policy issues for Congress, such as defining what constitutes a small business and determining the appropriate size measure for eligibility. The federal government provides tax benefits and other forms of assistance to small businesses. It is important to consider the economic justification and cost-effectiveness of these benefits. The report aims to address these issues. The report aims to shed light on nonagricultural small business tax preferences, their foregone revenue, and economic arguments for and against them. It explores challenges in defining small businesses for policy purposes, reviews existing tax preferences, and discusses the economic contributions of small firms. It also examines government policies to support small businesses and the importance of defining qualifying firms for tax benefits. The Small Business Act of 1953 grants the Small Business Administration the authority to establish size standards for federal programs supporting small businesses, specifying the maximum size a company can be to qualify for assistance. Congress has refrained from creating size standards for specific federal programs, except for agricultural enterprises. Other federal agencies may create their own size standards for programs they administer with approval. The Small Business Act of 1953 grants the SBA authority to establish size standards for federal programs supporting small businesses. The act outlines criteria for identifying small businesses eligible for SBA programs, emphasizing independence and non-dominance in their field. The SBA aims to set industry-specific size standards that help small firms improve their performance in the domestic economy. The SBA uses criteria like employee count, annual receipts, and assets to determine eligibility for small firms in various industries. The size standards set by the SBA are industry-specific and aim to help small businesses improve their performance in the domestic economy. The SBA sets industry-specific size standards based on factors like employee count, annual receipts, and assets. Other measures like financial assets for banking and barrels per calendar-day for petroleum refining are used for certain industries. Evaluation of industry characteristics determines if the size standard is set below, at, or above the anchor standard. Factors considered include average firm size, start-up costs, entry barriers, competition among firms, and distribution by size. The SBA also considers the impact on small firms' access to federal opportunities. The SBA sets industry-specific size standards based on factors like employee count, annual receipts, and assets. The size standards range from $0.75 million to $35.5 million based on receipt size, 100 to 1,500 employees based on employment, and $7 million or $175 million based on financial assets. The agency's Office of Size Standards assesses the impact of proposed changes on industry performance, considering competition, firm size, start-up costs, barriers to entry, and industry distribution. The SBA assesses industry performance by analyzing competition, firm size, start-up costs, barriers to entry, and distribution of industry sales and employment. Recommendations are made to the Size Policy Board, which advises the Administrator on approving changes. The SBA can establish alternative size standards based on net worth and profits for loan programs. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 allows for setting limits on net worth and profits until new standards are implemented. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 allows the SBA to establish alternative size standards for loan programs based on net worth and profits. The act also requires the SBA to review industry size standards regularly and make adjustments as needed. Federal agencies must use SBA size standards for small business set-aside programs. The SBA has the authority to establish alternative size standards for loan programs based on net worth and profits. Federal agencies must use SBA size standards for small business set-aside programs, but they are not required to do so for other programs and tax provisions supporting small businesses. Agencies can develop their own size standards, but they must undergo a rigorous review process overseen by the SBA. Concerns remain about the SBA's methodology for selecting size standards, including issues like whether there should be a fixed range for size standards, how often they should be adjusted for inflation, and whether they should be adjusted for productivity gains in an industry. The federal tax code uses SBA size standards to determine eligibility for small business tax benefits, with most tax preferences using asset, receipt, or employment size. The employment and receipt sizes in the tax code are smaller than those used by the SBA to identify small businesses by industry. Some tax provisions benefit small firms through their design, such as the expensing allowance under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax code uses SBA size standards to determine small business eligibility for tax benefits, with varying size standards leading to uneven distribution of benefits. Lawmakers have flexibility in designing tax benefits for small businesses, but not all business income is treated equally under federal taxation. The tax burden on business income varies based on factors such as the type of entity (C corporation or passthrough), with corporate profits taxed twice and passthrough entities taxed only at the owner level. The taxation also depends on whether the owner pays the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Passthrough business owners subject to AMT may or may not be taxed at lower rates than under regular income tax. Firm size also influences taxation. Federal tax benefits for smaller firms are scattered throughout the tax code, offering deductions, credits, and preferential rates to reduce capital costs and increase cash flow. These benefits are not industry-specific and aim to support small businesses outside of agriculture. The tax benefits for small businesses have changed due to the enactment of H.R. 1 in December 2017. The new lineup includes the Section 41 research tax credit and the Section 168(k) 100% expensing allowance. The previous small business tax benefits, such as the graduated corporate income tax and the rollover of gains from the sale of publicly traded securities, have been replaced or repealed. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the corporate AMT and the exemption for small businesses with average annual gross receipts under $5 million. The current tax law does not address passthrough businesses, leading to debates on whether their lower tax rates constitute a small business benefit. The act set a lower corporate tax rate compared to passthrough entities, reversing the previous tax law's discrepancy. Among C corporations and passthrough entities, there are small and large companies with varying economic roles. In 2014, small companies (with $500,000 or less in receipts) made up the majority of tax returns for C corporations, S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. In contrast, large companies (with over $50 million in receipts) accounted for a significant portion of total receipts for C corporations, S corporations, and partnerships, but not for sole proprietorships. This shows that not all passthrough businesses are the same in terms of size and contribution. The contribution to total sole proprietorship receipts varies among passthrough firms and C corporations, regardless of size standards. The tax benefits shown in Table 1 could cost over $17 billion in FY2018, exceeding the SBA budget. Expensing allows for accelerated depreciation, deducting the full cost of assets in the year they are placed into service under IRC Section 179. Under IRC Section 179, a company can deduct up to $1 million for qualified property placed in service in 2018. The allowance is subject to limitations, with a phaseout threshold set at $2.5 million in 2018. The maximum allowance is indexed for inflation starting in 2019. The expensing allowance under IRC Section 179 is set at $2.5 million, indexed for inflation from 2019. A firm can expense up to $1 million on qualified assets in 2018, with a phaseout threshold at $2.5 million. The purpose is to lower the cost of capital for small companies and stimulate business investment during weak economic growth. There is no size limit on companies eligible for Section 179, but the phaseout threshold benefits small firms. The expensing allowance under IRC Section 179 is designed to lower the cost of capital for small firms and stimulate business investment. It can stimulate investment by reducing the user cost of capital and increasing cash flow for firms using it. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin's 1995 article illustrated the impact of the allowance on the cost of capital. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin's 1995 article summarized the impact of the expensing allowance on the cost of capital. The results showed that expensing offered a significant investment subsidy that increased with a firm's marginal tax rate. For example, at a tax rate of 15%, expensing lowered the user cost of capital by 11.3%, while at a rate of 35%, the reduction rose to 27.9%. The expensing allowance reduces the user cost of capital as the tax rate increases. In FY2018, it may result in a revenue loss of $50.4 billion, but this outcome depends on the amount of U.S. investment in qualified assets. The allowance can lead to revenue losses during periods of rising business investment, but revenue gains may occur during declining investment periods. This shift reflects the timing of depreciation deductions under current law. Companies that opt for expensing under Section 179 trade lower tax liability in the present for larger tax liabilities in the future. This tradeoff benefits companies, especially for long-lived assets, as the present value of all depreciation deductions is greater with expensing. The concept is that business taxable income should exclude all costs incurred in earning it, allowing companies to deduct all ordinary and necessary costs as current expenses. Companies can deduct ordinary and necessary costs as current expenses in determining taxable income. However, costs incurred in starting or organizing a business should be capitalized as they are not directly related to income generation. IRC Section 195 allows individuals to deduct up to $5,000 of business start-up and organizational costs incurred after October 22, 2004. The Small Business Job Creation Act of 2010 raised the deduction for business start-up and organizational costs to $10,000, with a phaseout threshold of $60,000. To qualify for the deduction, costs must be incurred in creating or acquiring a trade or business, and the taxpayer must have an equity interest and actively participate in management. Business start-up and organizational costs must be paid or incurred as part of an investigation into creating or acquiring an active trade or business, or as part of starting a new trade or business with the aim of producing income. The costs must be similar to deductible costs for expanding an active trade or business in the same industry. Businesses could amortize these costs over five or more years if they entered a trade or business before October 22, 2004. The option to deduct up to $5,000 in the first year of operation allows new firm owners to deduct expenses. The option to deduct up to $5,000 in the first year of operation permits new firm owners to deduct expenses, accelerating the recovery of certain business expenses. This can aid the growth of small start-up firms by reducing their cost of capital and increasing cash flow. Additionally, for firms that lose money in their first year, the deduction adds to their net operating losses, which can be carried forward up to 20 years to offset future taxes. Permissible methods of accounting for business taxpayers include cash-receipts, accrual, installment, long-term-contract, crop, special methods for research and development, and soil and water conservation expenditures. Cash-basis accounting records income when received and expenses when paid, while accrual-basis accounting matches income and expenses to the period they are earned or incurred. Accrual-basis accounting records income and expenses when transactions are completed, providing a more accurate measure of a firm's economic income. This method matches income with expenses with greater precision and rigor, unlike cash-basis accounting which is simpler but less precise. Accrual accounting is required in certain circumstances for tax purposes. For tax purposes, the accrual method must be used when keeping an inventory is necessary for business operations. Certain entities like C corporations, partnerships with C corporations, and trusts earning unrelated business income are required to use the accrual method. However, starting in 2018, partnerships or C corporations with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less in the previous three tax years may use the cash method. Individuals, S corporations, and certain partnerships and personal service corporations also have the option to use the cash method. Personal service corporations, like individuals and S corporations, have the option to use the cash method for tax purposes. This method allows for greater control over the timing of receipts and payments, offering the benefit of deferring income tax payments. Small firms can take advantage of lower tax rates by shifting deductions and income recognition from one tax year to the next. Despite the potential benefits, some eligible small firms may not choose to use the cash method. Using the cash method for tax purposes can offer benefits to small firms, but it may not always be in their best interest. Accrual-basis accounting may be more suitable for businesses needing accurate financial reports, as cash-basis accounting can distort financial position by excluding certain transactions and allowing manipulation of net income. Deductions for interest and borrowing expenses were allowed before the enactment of P.L. 115-97. The 2017 act amended Section 163(j) to limit the deduction for business interest expenses, which is now capped at the sum of a firm's interest income, 30% of its adjusted taxable income, and any floor-plan financing interest paid. Interest that cannot be deducted can be carried forward indefinitely, subject to restrictions for partnerships and S corporations. Adjusted taxable income excludes certain non-business items. The 2017 act amended Section 163(j) to limit the deduction for business interest expenses, now capped at the sum of interest income, 30% of adjusted taxable income, and floor-plan financing interest. Companies with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less are exempt from this limitation. Several tax provisions benefit smaller enterprises by encouraging equity investment in qualified small firms. The tax provisions aim to help smaller enterprises raise funds by increasing after-tax returns or reducing after-tax losses on investments. Individuals investing in smaller firms receive tax benefits not available to those investing in larger firms. Key considerations for income tax liability include recognizing income as ordinary or capital gain, and differentiating between long-term and short-term capital gains or losses. Capital gains or losses occur when selling or exchanging capital assets like stocks or bonds. Holding capital assets for over 12 months results in long-term capital gains or losses. In 2018, long-term capital gains are taxed at 20% for higher income filers, 15% for middle-income filers, and 0% for lower income filers. IRC Section 1202 allows noncorporate taxpayers to exclude gains from qualified small business stock held for at least five years. The exclusion for qualified small business stock (QSBS) allows taxpayers to exclude a percentage of gains based on the acquisition date. The exclusion is 100% for QSBS acquired after September 27, 2010, 50% for QSBS acquired between August 11, 1993, and February 17, 2009, and 75% for QSBS acquired between February 18, 2009, and September 27, 2010. There is a total limit on the gain that can be excluded, capped at $10 million. Any remaining gain is taxed at a fixed rate of 28%. The partial exclusion for qualified small business stock (QSBS) requires the stock to be issued by a domestic C corporation with gross assets not exceeding $50 million. At least 80% of the corporation's assets must be actively used in qualified trades or businesses during the holding period. Specialized small business investment companies also qualify under the Small Business Investment Act. Stock issued by C corporations with less than $50 million in gross assets is eligible for the gain exclusion if primarily engaged in an eligible trade or business, excluding certain industries like health care, law, engineering, and finance. Small C corporations such as DISCs, RICs, REITs, REMICs, FASITs, cooperatives, or those claiming the possessions tax credit are ineligible for the exclusion. The full exclusion for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) is intended to benefit small start-up firms by increasing potential after-tax returns for investors. This exclusion allows for a 0% effective capital gains tax rate on QSBS acquired after September 27, 2010. Supporters argue that the 100% exclusion is necessary due to the uncertainty surrounding the growth prospects of new start-up firms. The exclusion for Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) reduces the cost of capital for eligible C corporations issuing QSBS. A study found that prices of QSBS issued by eligible firms after the tax change were significantly higher, passing on future benefits to issuing corporations through higher stock prices. This leads to lower cost of capital for firms. Rising stock prices lower a firm's cost of capital, but not everyone agrees with the gains exclusion. Alan Viard argues that the exclusion distorts investment capital allocation by favoring certain investors and industries. Losses on stock investments are treated as capital losses for tax purposes, offsetting capital gains or up to $3,000 in ordinary income. Investors can deduct losses from small business investment companies (SBICs) from their ordinary income under IRC Section 1242. SBICs are licensed private investment corporations that provide capital and guidance to small firms. This exception aims to encourage equity investment in SBICs by reducing after-tax losses compared to other investments. SBICs use SBA loan guarantees to invest in qualified firms. IRC Section 1244 allows ordinary loss treatment for qualified small business stock sales. Stock must meet specific requirements to qualify. The IRC Section 1244 allows for ordinary loss treatment for qualified small business stock sales, with specific requirements for eligibility. Small business corporations must derive more than 50% of gross receipts from non-passive sources to qualify for this tax benefit. Additionally, the deduction for an ordinary loss is capped at $50,000 for single filers and $100,000 for married couples filing jointly. The IRC Section 263A requires businesses to capitalize direct and indirect costs related to inventory items purchased or produced. Direct costs include material and labor costs, while indirect costs encompass expenses like equipment maintenance, utilities, and administrative costs. This rule, known as the uniform capitalization rule, was added to the tax code in 1986. The uniform capitalization rule under IRC Section 263A requires businesses to capitalize direct and indirect costs related to inventory items purchased or produced. Taxpayers have discretion in assigning indirect costs, but methods used should yield reasonable results. Small firms with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less in the last three tax years are exempt from this rule, allowing for lower administrative costs and more control over business expense deductions. The uniform capitalization rule requires businesses to capitalize costs related to inventory items. One method used is \"last-in-first-out\" (LIFO), which assumes the most recently acquired goods are sold first. LIFO can lower taxable income during rising inventory costs. The dollar-value method is a common application of LIFO, where inventory values are based on a pool of dollars. The dollar-value method for inventory valuation uses a pool of dollars instead of specific items, with the base year determining the value. Small firms can use a simplified dollar-value LIFO method under IRC Section 474, with certain eligibility criteria. This method differs in how inventory items are pooled and base-year values estimated. Small firms with average annual gross receipts of $5 million or less in the previous three tax years can use this simplified method. The nonrefundable tax credit for start-up costs of new retirement plans for employees, enacted in 2001, was extended indefinitely in 2006. The credit equals 50% of the first $1,000 in eligible costs for the first three years of plan operation, covering expenses related to plan administration and employee communication. The nonrefundable tax credit for start-up costs of new retirement plans for employees, enacted in 2001, was extended indefinitely in 2006. The credit equals 50% of the first $1,000 in eligible costs for the first three years of plan operation, covering expenses related to plan administration and employee communication. Small firms with fewer than 100 employees can claim a maximum credit of $1,500 if at least one highly compensated employee participates in the plan, incentivizing them to establish pension plans for employees. According to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the percentage of small firms with fewer than 100 employees offering pension plans decreased from 2002 to 2013. The disabled-access credit under IRC Section 44 allows eligible small firms to claim a nonrefundable tax credit for making their facilities more accessible for disabled employees, with a maximum cap of $5,000 per firm in a tax year. The disabled-access credit is part of the general business credit under IRC Section 38, subject to dollar limitations and rules for carry-forward and carry-back. Eligible small firms can claim the credit if their gross receipts were under $1 million or their FTE workforce did not exceed 30 persons in the previous tax year. Expenses to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 qualify for the credit, including removing barriers and providing accommodations for disabled individuals. The disabled-access credit, part of the general business credit under IRC Section 38, aims to lower costs for small firms complying with ADA mandates and encourage hiring of disabled individuals. However, its effectiveness in promoting workplace accommodations remains unclear, with limited awareness among businesses. The ACA added a provision to the federal tax code related to this credit. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) added a provision to the federal tax code granting small employers a tax credit for contributions to health plans covering at least 50% of employee costs. Eligible employers could claim the credit since 2010, with a maximum of 35% of contributions for qualified health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows small employers to claim a tax credit for contributions to health plans covering at least 50% of employee costs. Employers with up to 25 or fewer full-time employees earning an average annual compensation of $50,000 or less can benefit from the credit. The full credit is available to employers with 10 or fewer full-time employees earning an average annual compensation of $25,000 or less. The credit phases out for larger employers and higher compensation levels. Eligible employers can claim the credit for up to two consecutive tax years if they offer qualified health plans through a state-based health insurance exchange. Each state was required to establish such an exchange by 2014. The tax credit for small employers offering health plans through a state-based health insurance exchange is equal to 50% of employer contributions for qualified health plans. The credit has rules affecting its effective rate and is subject to limitations as part of the general business credit. Unused credits can be carried forward up to 20 years or deducted in the next tax year. The tax credit for small employers offering health plans through a state-based health insurance exchange can be deducted in its entirety for the next tax year. Employers can take the credit against both regular income and alternative minimum taxes, but must reduce their deduction for employer-paid health insurance premiums by the amount of the credit. The credit aims to increase the share of employers with 25 or fewer low-wage employees offering health insurance by lowering the after-tax cost of coverage by up to 50% in any two consecutive years starting in 2014 for firms with sufficient tax liability. Congress added the credit to the ACA to address gaps in employer-provided health insurance. According to a survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, while 96% of large employers offer health benefits, only 50% of small employers with 3 to 49 employees do so. Among all employers surveyed, 64% with low-wage workers offered health benefits, compared to 44% with a high ratio of low-wage workers. Small firms, according to the SBA, play a significant role in the economy. Small firms play a significant role in the economy, accounting for a large percentage of domestic firms and private-sector employment. Despite their economic importance, small firms receive substantial federal tax benefits and other subsidies, raising questions about the need for government assistance. This support carries an opportunity cost in terms of potential economic effects, prompting the need for a sound economic justification for existing federal government support for small businesses. The U.S. economy could benefit from reallocating funds currently supporting small businesses to areas like infrastructure, research, and deficit reduction. Proponents argue for government support based on the economic role, financial barriers, tax rates, and opportunities for individual advancement provided by small firms. Small businesses are important for the economy, with lawmakers advocating for government support due to their significant contribution to job creation and economic output. Proponents argue that small firms deserve federal assistance not only because of their economic importance but also for the unique benefits they bring to the economy. Proponents argue that small firms provide valuable economic benefits through job creation, technological innovation, and contributions to economic growth. Data from the SBA shows that firms with fewer than 500 employees created the majority of net jobs from 1992 to 2013. Surviving small firms, especially gazelles with rapid growth, offset job losses from failed businesses. Proponents of government support for small firms argue that they play a crucial role in technological innovation. Studies have shown that small start-up firms are more adept at identifying and exploiting new technologies in industries where no firm has established substantial market power. Small firms gained temporary competitive advantages over larger rivals in biotechnology, microelectronics, computer software, and electronic commerce during the 1980s and 1990s. Small firms have made significant contributions to technological innovation in industries such as biotechnology, microelectronics, computer software, and electronic commerce. Studies show that firms with fewer than 500 employees held 41% of all patents filed by U.S. corporations from 1996 to 2000, receiving 13 to 14 times as many patents per employee compared to larger firms. Small firms also filed a significant percentage of patents in various sectors including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electronics, and chemicals. Additionally, small firms were found to be 16 times more prolific in innovation in \"green\" technologies compared to other firms. Between 2005 and 2009, small firms were 16 times more productive in acquiring patents than larger firms, with an average of 27 patents per employee compared to 1.6 patents per employee for larger firms. Proponents of government support for small businesses argue that they play a crucial role in industrial supply chains, providing goods and services more efficiently in industries driven by economies of scale like computers. In industries like computers, automobiles, and steel, small and large firms specialized in specific products or services, often acting more as partners or suppliers than competitors. Foreign outsourcing among large U.S. manufacturing firms in the 1990s reinforced this pattern. Small firms have an advantage in supply chains due to their flexibility and speed in responding to market opportunities. Small business ownership also provides financial and social benefits for women, minority groups, and immigrants. Small business ownership offers financial and social benefits for women, minority groups, and immigrants, providing opportunities for increased income, independence, and integration into the economic mainstream of the United States. Immigrants comprised 18% of small business owners in 2010, employing 14% of all small business workers. Women, minority, and immigrant-owned small firms contribute to their communities by promoting workplace diversity and communication openness. Small business ownership benefits women, minority groups, and immigrants by providing financial independence, job opportunities, and integration into the economy. Government support is crucial for small firms, especially in raising capital for growth and innovation. Proponents of government support for small businesses argue that many new small firms struggle to secure funding from traditional sources due to a lack of information for lenders and investors. This leads aspiring small business owners to finance projects using personal resources or abandon their entrepreneurial ambitions. Proponents argue that government support, such as loan guarantees and tax incentives, is necessary for small firms to access funds and grow. They also highlight the high tax compliance costs faced by small businesses as a reason for preferential treatment in the tax code. The estimated federal tax compliance costs vary based on the size of the business, with smaller firms facing a higher burden per employee compared to larger firms. Critics question the economic justification for government support for small businesses, citing recent studies that challenge the arguments made by proponents. Critics of government support for small businesses argue that there is no evidence of market failure affecting trends in small business formation, growth, investment, and failure. They specifically question the impact of imperfections in financial markets on the number of small firms. Critics argue against government support for small businesses, stating that there is no evidence of market failure affecting small business trends. They question the impact of financial market imperfections on small firm formation and growth. Critics also highlight the equity effects of small business tax preferences, which they believe undermine the progressivity of the federal income tax system. Small business tax preferences lower tax burden on earnings of passthrough entities, benefiting individuals in higher tax brackets. Passthrough business income accounted for a significant portion of total adjusted gross income for taxpayers in the top tax brackets in 2017. Critics argue that individuals, not firms, bear the burden of business income taxes or benefit from tax subsidies. Critics argue that small business tax preferences may lower tax burdens for small business owners compared to individuals earning primarily from wages and salaries, potentially impacting horizontal equity in household income taxation. Some oppose these subsidies on efficiency grounds, as income taxes can create economic welfare distortions by affecting consumption and production choices. The best tax system is one that raises revenue without distorting economic resource allocation. A lump-sum tax is ideal as it imposes the same tax on all individuals. This implies that all investments should be taxed equally, non-uniform taxes across businesses diminish social welfare, and taxes should not influence a firm's input or investment decisions. Critics argue that small business tax preferences contradict these principles and may impact horizontal equity in household income taxation. Supporters argue that small firms deserve government assistance due to their job creation and innovation, while critics question the empirical evidence for this claim. Critics question the long-term edge of small firms over larger firms in creating jobs, developing new goods, improving supply chains, and promoting economic change. They argue against claims of systematic failures in financing for start-up firms. Both critics and proponents agree that small firms drive most job growth in the U.S. economy. According to the SBA, firms with 500 or fewer workers created 63.3% of all net new U.S. jobs from 1992 to 2013. Proponents argue for government support for small firms based on this data, while critics cite studies showing small firms are not consistently better at creating jobs than large firms. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, small businesses generated varying numbers of new jobs, with most jobs coming from start-up firms. A report by Ian Hathaway and Albert Palacios showed that firms less than a year old created about 3 million jobs annually from 1990 to 2009. However, non-start-up firms lost an average of 1.5 million jobs per year during that period. Start-up firms created an average of 2.906 million jobs annually from 1990 to 2009, while small firms aged 1 to 5 years lost 703,000 jobs per year, those aged 6 to 10 years lost 401,000 jobs annually, and firms aged 11 or more years lost 849,000 jobs yearly. A study by Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda supported these findings, showing that net job growth is negatively related to firm size when not accounting for firm age. The relationship between firm size and net job growth disappeared when considering firm age. Start-ups accounted for a large share of job creation and destruction from 1992 to 2005. Firms over 10 years old with more than 500 employees contributed significantly to job creation and destruction. Young firms exhibit an \"up or out dynamic,\" growing fast or going out of business. Birch and Medoff identified fast-growing small businesses as \"gazelles.\" Economic analysis shows that an economy generates jobs through a natural process of growth, decline, and structural change. The size distribution of firms is a byproduct of this process, with national employment being influenced by fiscal and monetary policy, consumer spending, business investment, and exports/imports. Research and development (R&D) is crucial for technological innovation and long-term economic growth. Innovation is a powerful engine of economic growth, but businesses often underinvest in R&D without government support. This is due to firms not being able to capture all returns from R&D and some lacking access to funds for projects. Economists see this as a market failure due to the positive externalities from R&D investments. Many economists advocate for government measures to boost business R&D investment, as private companies often overlook external economic benefits. Critics argue that government support should not be limited to small firms, as both small and large companies drive technological innovation and economic growth. In 2008 and 2009, larger firms conducted the majority of business R&D in the United States, with companies over 1,000 employees accounting for nearly 76% of investments. Small firms have historically been more successful in generating new industries and dominating early growth stages, while large firms have advantages in raising funds for research projects. Critics argue that firm size does not consistently determine innovation success. Small firms may be more innovative in some industries, while large firms have an edge in others. Most small business owners do not aim to develop new ideas. The 2011 study by economists Erik Hurst and Benjamin Pugsley from the University of Chicago found that only 10% of new businesses planned to develop proprietary technology, processes, or procedures in the future. Critics challenge the idea that small firms play critical roles in improving business supply chains, citing findings that half of new small businesses intended to provide existing products or services to an existing customer base, with little desire to grow or innovate. Small businesses showed little desire to grow or innovate, with over half citing nonpecuniary benefits like being their own boss and having a flexible schedule as primary reasons for starting. Most small firms were concentrated in industries like restaurants, skilled professionals, skilled craftsmen, professional service providers, and small retailers. Critics question the argument that small firms deserve government support for productivity growth, as many small business owners focus on selling existing goods rather than innovating. While start-up companies like Google and Amazon can drive market transformation, critics argue that small firms in general are not critical for economic renewal and change. Government support for small businesses is criticized for potentially hindering growth by creating a disincentive to qualify for subsidies. The \"notch problem\" arises when firms lose tax preferences, like the Section 179 expensing allowance, once they reach a certain size. The Section 179 expensing allowance sets a maximum of $1 million in 2018, phasing out when qualified asset spending exceeds $2.5 million. Firms spending over $3.5 million cannot claim the allowance, leading to tax penalties for investing more than $2.5 million. Critics argue this discourages investment. Small firms play a significant role in the U.S. economy, with the extent of their contributions depending on how they are defined. Small businesses, whether defined by fewer than 500 or 100 employees, contribute significantly to private-sector jobs and output, drive innovation, and facilitate industry renewal. Congressional support for small firms is evident through government programs and tax preferences, with potential revenue loss exceeding $17 billion in FY2018. Current federal small business tax benefits aim to improve access to equity capital, simplify tax compliance, promote capital investments, and achieve policy objectives. Supporters argue that these benefits are crucial to eliminate barriers for small businesses, which play a vital role in job creation and technological innovation. The main challenge for small start-up companies is raising the financial capital needed for operations and R&D. Recent studies question the effectiveness of current federal support for small businesses in promoting job growth and investment. A 2010 study by economists found that smaller firms had faster job growth rates than larger firms from 1976 to 2005, but this relationship changed when considering the age of firms. Instead, a strong correlation between gross and net job creation emerged. Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between gross and net job creation and the age of firms. Start-ups exhibit high rates of job creation and destruction in their first 10 years. Research by economists Hurst and Pugsley challenges the notion that small business owners are prolific job creators and innovators, revealing that few bring new ideas to the market and many are content selling existing products in established markets. Hurst and Pugsley found that few small business owners aim to grow large or innovate, aligning with the industries they operate in. Their research also showed that many new business owners in 2004 were motivated by nonpecuniary reasons like being their own boss. This challenges current federal policies towards small businesses, suggesting that job growth and innovation may come from a small number of new companies. Congress may need to explore new ways to target federal support at small start-up companies to help them raise financial capital. Identifying these companies is a challenge, and working with venture capitalists could help find new entrepreneurial firms that could benefit from early-stage federal assistance. Understanding the costs and benefits of current federal support for small businesses can help lawmakers determine which programs are effective. Most economists believe that deviations from neutral taxation of capital returns are justified to correct market failures. This raises questions about the effectiveness of existing federal government support for small firms. Existing federal government support for small firms aims to address market failures, such as barriers in debt and equity markets hindering small business startup financing. Imperfections in capital markets, like asymmetric information and excessive caution from lenders and investors, can prevent individuals from obtaining funds to start and grow a new business. A study by Robb and Robinson in 2010 showed that most firms rely more on external debt than on family and friends for financing in their first year of business. The study by Robb and Robinson in 2010 found that over 80% of firms relied on bank debt and owner equity for start-up capital. Access to capital is crucial for new small firms, and the government is taking steps to improve it, such as SBA loan guarantees and crowdfunding. Additional measures may be needed to further support new entrepreneurial ventures.
