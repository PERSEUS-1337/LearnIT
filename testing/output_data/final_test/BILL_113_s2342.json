    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Subsidizing Childhood Obesity Act\". Congress finds that childhood obesity rates have significantly increased over the past 30 years, with more than one-third of children and adolescents now overweight or obese. If current trends continue, adult obesity rates could exceed 60 percent in some states by 2030. Poor health-related behaviors, such as unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity, start early in life and persist into adulthood, putting children's health at risk. American children and youth are not meeting basic nutritional goals, consuming excess calories and added sugars. Budgets for food marketing to children have spiked into the billions of dollars, with companies using various platforms like television, radio, Internet, and product placement to target children. Studies show that television food advertising influences children's food choices, purchase requests, diets, and health. A 2005 report from the Institute of Medicine highlighted the impact of aggressive marketing of high-calorie foods to children on childhood obesity. Three-quarters of foods advertised on children's TV shows are sweets or fast foods. A study funded by the National Institutes of Health suggested that eliminating tax deductions for advertising unhealthy food to children could reduce childhood obesity rates by 5 to 7 percent. SEC. 280I denies deductions for advertising aimed at children to promote unhealthy food consumption. No deduction allowed for advertising targeting children to promote unhealthy food consumption, including travel expenses and entertainment goods or services. The Secretary shall contract the Institute of Medicine to develop procedures for evaluating and identifying food of poor nutritional quality and associated brands. The Institute of Medicine must submit a report with proposed procedures within 12 months. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to marketing to children, including 'brand,' 'child,' 'food,' and 'marketing.' The curr_chunk discusses various advertising and promotional techniques used to target children, including television, radio, print media, social media, internet, packaging, movie theaters, video games, digital devices, retail sites, and specialty items. The curr_chunk discusses regulations to be implemented regarding advertising and promotional techniques targeting children, including specialty items, character licensing, celebrity endorsements, and advertising within schools. The Secretary will define terms like 'directed at children' and 'food of poor nutritional quality' within 18 months of enactment. The curr_chunk amends the table of sections for part IX. The curr_chunk adds a section denying deductions for advertising targeting children to promote unhealthy food. Effective in 24 months after enactment. Additionally, there is extra funding for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer additional funding to the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program annually, based on the increase in revenue from the amendments made by the Act."
