    "content": "The broadband loan and grant programs at RUS aim to speed up broadband deployment in rural America, providing high-speed internet access for various purposes like ecommerce, telecommuting, and telemedicine. Broadband technologies include cable modem, fiber-optic cable, mobile wireless, DSL, fixed wireless, and satellite. Broadband access in rural areas is crucial for economic development, allowing businesses and individuals to participate in the online economy. A 2016 study found that rural broadband providers added $24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015 and supported 69,595 jobs. Broadband access in rural areas is essential for economic development, supporting 69,595 jobs in 2015. Concerns have been raised about a \"digital divide\" between rural and urban areas in broadband deployment, with rural areas lagging behind. Despite overall progress in broadband coverage, a notable gap remains in rural and Tribal America. Broadband access in rural and Tribal areas in America remains a concern, with 24% of rural Americans and 32% of Tribal Americans lacking fixed terrestrial broadband coverage. The urban-rural gap has narrowed over the last five years, but rural areas still lag behind in mobile broadband deployment. According to Pew Research Center data, 58% of adults in rural areas have high-speed broadband at home, compared to 67% in urban areas and 70% in suburban areas. The urban-rural gap in broadband access persists, with 72.9% of rural residents and 78.5% of urban residents using the internet. The lower population density in rural areas contributes to less broadband deployment, as the cost to serve customers increases with geographical distances. This results in less incentive for companies to invest in rural broadband compared to urban areas. The cost of deploying broadband technologies in rural areas is higher due to terrain challenges and backhaul expenses. Limited competition and consumer choice in rural areas make it unlikely for private providers to invest in expanding broadband networks to unserved areas. In 2000, Congress and the Administration initiated pilot broadband loan and grant programs within the Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to finance rural broadband deployment. $100 million in loans was made available for broadband transmission and local dial-up Internet service in rural areas. In December 2000, the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) announced a $100 million loan funding pilot program to finance broadband telecommunications services in rural America. The program was extended into FY2002 with $80 million in loans available, along with a $20 million grant program allocated in the FY2002 agriculture appropriations bill. The appropriations bill (P.L. 107-76) allocated $20 million for a pilot broadband grant program under the Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program. RUS announced the availability of $20 million for broadband service in rural America, targeting economically challenged communities without existing broadband. Grants were available for entities providing \"community-oriented connectivity\" to critical community facilities. The program was extended into FY2003 with $10 million allocated for broadband grants under the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003 (P.L. 108-7). RUS currently has four ongoing programs. RUS has allocated $10 million for broadband grants through four ongoing programs to incentivize and subsidize broadband infrastructure investment in unserved and underserved rural areas. These programs include Rural Broadband Access Loans, Community Connect Grants, Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans and Loan Guarantees, and Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants. The ReConnect Program, funded at $600 million, aims to link teachers and medical service providers in one area to students and patients in another through telecommunications. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) has approved 704 broadband projects totaling almost $8.6 billion in loans and $144.8 million in grants since FY2004 to deploy telecommunications or broadband infrastructure networks in rural areas. The loan program at RUS, authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, provides funds for broadband service in eligible rural communities. It was initially funded with $100 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation and has been reauthorized multiple times. Starting in FY2004, the program has been funded through annual appropriations in the Distance Learning and Telemedicine account. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program receives annual appropriations from Congress for loan subsidies and lending authority. The program is codified as 7 U.S.C. 950bb and was implemented through an interim rule in 2015, finalized in 2016. Eligible entities for loans include corporations, LLCs, cooperatives, mutual organizations, and Indian tribes. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program is accepting applications from eligible entities such as corporations, LLCs, cooperatives, mutual organizations, Indian tribes, and state or local governments. Funding must be for rural areas with at least 15% unserved households, no more than two incumbent service providers, and no overlap with current RUS borrowers or grantees. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis until September 30, 2019, with evaluations every 90 days. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program accepts applications every 90 days, with a minimum loan amount of $100,000 and a maximum of $25 million. The program maintains broadband service standards at 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. The 2018 farm bill increases the annual authorization level to $350 million, adds a grant component, and changes the service area threshold to 50%. RUS will issue a revised regulation to implement these changes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 allocated $9 million for a grant program to finance broadband transmission in rural areas eligible for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program benefits. The program provides grant money to applicants proposing to provide broadband to unserved rural areas for economic growth and enhanced services. Funding is provided through annual appropriations in the Department of Agriculture's Distance Learning and Telemedicine account. The Community Connect Broadband Grants program, funded through the Department of Agriculture, supports projects in rural areas lacking broadband service. Eligible applicants include various entities, and funded projects must provide free broadband to community facilities for two years. A new final rule issued by RUS in 2013 made changes to matching funds, eligible communities, and application criteria. The final rule issued by RUS in 2013 made changes to broadband service speed definitions and grant criteria. A new threshold for broadband service speed and grant speed will be provided in an annual Notice of Funding Availability. The minimum broadband speed required for both fixed and mobile service is 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. The Community Connect Grant Program offers grants ranging from $100,000 to $3 million for rural areas with a population of 5,000 or less. The program is authorized at $50 million annually from 2018 to 2023. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program provides funding for telephone and broadband services in rural areas, with a requirement for broadband service since 1995. More information is available at http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/community-connect-grants. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program offers various types of financing, including direct Treasury rate loans, guaranteed loans, and hardship direct loans. These loans are available for rural areas with a population of 5,000 or less, where telecommunications facilities are lacking or the applicant is the recognized provider. The interest rates for these loans vary based on the Treasury rate, providing flexibility for borrowers in meeting their financing needs. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program offers various types of financing for rural areas with low population density. The program includes direct Treasury rate loans, guaranteed loans, and hardship direct loans with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Currently, the 5% hardship loans are not offered due to lower interest rates available from the Treasury and FFB loans. The Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Program, established by the 1996 farm bill, provides grants for equipment and software that support telemedicine and distance learning in rural areas. Grant funds can be used for various telecommunications equipment, computer hardware, software, infrastructure, instructional programming, broadband facilities, and technical assistance. Eligible applicants include entities in rural areas that provide education or health care through telecommunications. The 2018 farm bill reauthorizes the DLT program through FY2023 at $82 million per year, with 20% of funding for substance use disorder treatment services. An Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity aims to promote agriculture, economic development, job growth, and e-connectivity in rural and tribal areas. The Administration requested $500 million for a grant/loan program to expand e-connectivity. The FY2018 appropriation includes $600 million for a broadband grant/loan program at USDA/RUS to deploy broadband in rural and tribal areas. The program aims to serve households in rural areas without sufficient broadband access. The FY2018 appropriation includes $600 million for a broadband grant/loan program at USDA/RUS to deploy broadband in rural and tribal areas. Not more than 4% of the funds can be used for administrative costs, and up to 3% for technical assistance and predevelopment planning activities. The agreement prioritizes funding for areas lacking broadband access and emphasizes coordination among federal agencies for broadband deployment and adoption. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provides $550 million for the Rural Connectivity Pilot Program, with $125 million in direct appropriation and $425 million reprogrammed from a credit subaccount. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to ensure that ineligible ReConnect Program applicants have a means of appealing. The ReConnect Program, funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, aims to expand broadband access in rural areas with insufficient coverage. Projects must serve at least 90% of households in rural areas lacking 10 Mbps/1 Mbps broadband. Loans or grants will not be considered for entities with previous defaults or unmet loan conditions. The ReConnect Program aims to expand broadband access in rural areas with insufficient coverage. Approximately $600 million is available for funding opportunities, with a reserve for additional loans or grants. Award recipients must complete projects within five years. Eligible entities include states, local governments, Indian tribes, nonprofits, for-profit corporations, and telecommunications companies. The ReConnect Program offers funding opportunities for companies, cooperatives, ISPs, and municipalities to bring broadband to rural areas. Up to $200 million is available with a maximum request of $50 million. Eligible areas must have insufficient broadband access, and projects must provide minimum speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. Applications accepted until July 12, 2019, with a maximum request of $25 million for loan and $25 million for grant. The ReConnect Program offers funding up to $200 million for companies, cooperatives, ISPs, and municipalities to bring broadband to rural areas. The maximum request is $25 million for both loan and grant, with a matching contribution of 25% required. Eligible areas must lack sufficient broadband access, with projects needing to provide minimum speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis through June 21, 2019. The ReConnect Program offers funding up to $200 million for broadband projects in rural areas, with a maximum request of $25 million. Eligible projects must provide minimum speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps and require a 25% matching contribution. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis through May 31, 2019. More information is available at https://reconnect.usda.gov. RUS offers broadband loans for infrastructure projects, while the FCC's Universal Service Fund provides ongoing subsidies for telecommunications networks in high-cost areas. The RUS Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program relies heavily on high cost USF subsidies, with 99% of borrowers receiving support. Broadband loans from the BIP and Farm Bill programs also benefit from USF support. The FCC has ordered changes to the USF program in October 2011. The FCC ordered changes to the USF program in October 2011, transitioning from supporting voice telephone service to supporting broadband deployment. The high cost program is being phased out in favor of the Connect America Fund (CAF), causing uncertainty among rural providers and leading to a drop in demand for RUS loans. The reduction in USF support and ICC payments has caused rural providers to hesitate in increasing debt for planned construction. Various rural broadband programs are funded through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, with loan subsidies supporting higher loan levels. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposed $4.5 million for Rural Broadband Access Loans. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposed funding for Rural Broadband Access Loans and Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans, totaling $4.5 million and $0.863 million respectively. Additionally, Community Connect and DLT grants are being transferred into a new $162 million \"Rural Economic Infrastructure Program.\" Up to $80 million will be directed towards the Appalachian region. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposed funding for Rural Broadband Access Loans and Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans, totaling $4.5 million and $0.863 million respectively. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, providing $4.521 million for the broadband loan program. Funding aims to promote availability in underserved areas without a business case for private investment in broadband networks. The committee directed RUS to focus on projects bringing broadband service to underserved households and areas, with $122.692 million allocated for the new Rural Economic Infrastructure Program. The House bill allocated $122.692 million for the new Rural Economic Infrastructure Account, including Community Connect and DLT grants, Community Facilities grants, and Home Repair grants. At least 15% of the resources must be allocated to each program area. The bill also addressed challenges faced by tribal communities in accessing broadband service and encouraged the Secretary to provide a plan for addressing these challenges. Additionally, the House matched the Administration proposal for telecommunications loans, providing a loan level of $690 million. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $690 million for telecommunications loans, with $345 million in direct Treasury loans and $345 million in FFB loans. They also directed USDA to collaborate with other federal agencies to address rural broadband issues, including identifying barriers to infrastructure investment and data speeds for broadband users in rural and tribal areas. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for broadband programs in rural areas and tribal lands, including loans and grants for increasing internet speeds. The bill provided $4.53 million for broadband loans, $30 million for Community Connect grants, and $26.6 million for DLT grants. Unlike the House, the Senate did not include funding for Rural Economic Infrastructure grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for broadband programs in rural areas and tribal lands, including loans and grants to improve internet speeds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $5 million for broadband loans, $30 million for Community Connect grants, and $49 million for DLT grants. The committee recommended focusing on projects that bring broadband service to unserved households and exploring a pilot grant program to use fiber-optic cable for broadband services in rural schools and medical centers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided funding for broadband programs in rural areas and tribal lands, including loans and grants to improve internet speeds. It included $5 million for broadband loans, $30 million for Community Connect grants, and $49 million for DLT grants. Additionally, the Administration's FY2019 budget proposal requested funding for RUS broadband programs, including Rural Broadband Access Loans and Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans and Loan Guarantees. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations bill (H.R. 5961) approved by the House Appropriations Committee includes funding for various broadband programs. This includes $5.83 million for Rural Broadband Access Loans, $1.125 million for Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans, $30 million for Community Connect Grants, $32 million for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants, and $550 million for the ReConnect Program. The FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations bill includes funding for broadband programs, with $600 million allocated for a pilot broadband loan and grant program. The committee directs coordination with FCC and NTIA to target unserved areas for broadband loans and grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2019 Agriculture Appropriations bill, allocating funds for rural broadband access loans and telecommunications infrastructure loans. The committee highlighted the challenges tribal communities face in accessing broadband services and urged the Secretary to provide a report on how the Community Connect program can assist Indian Tribal Organizations. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $690 million in total loan levels for direct Treasury loans and FFB guaranteed loans. Specific allocations include $30 million for Community Connect Grants, $50 million for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants (including $20 million for the opioid epidemic in rural America), and $425 million for the ReConnect Program. The committee emphasized the importance of focusing on projects that bring broadband service to unserved households and recommended exploring the use of multistrand fiber-optic cable for rural schools and medical centers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) was signed into law on February 15, 2019, providing funding for various broadband programs. The Act allocated $690 million for direct Treasury loans and FFB guaranteed loans, including $30 million for Community Connect Grants, $50 million for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants, and $425 million for the ReConnect Program. The legislation emphasized the importance of bringing broadband service to unserved households and recommended the use of multistrand fiber-optic cable for rural schools and medical centers. The FY2019 appropriations under P.L. 116-6 include $5.83 million for Rural Broadband Access Loans, $1.725 million for Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans, $30 million for Community Connect Grants, $47 million for Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants (including $16 million for the opioid epidemic), and $550 million for the ReConnect Program. USDA rural development programs are directed to allocate at least 10% of funds to projects in persistent poverty counties. The conference report (H.Rept. 116-9) directs USDA to allocate funds to projects in persistent poverty counties and coordinate with FCC and NTIA for broadband deployment. USDA is instructed to use NTIA's assessment for broadband access and explore various technologies for deployment. The Administration's FY2020 budget proposal requested zero funding for RUS broadband programs. In the FY2020 budget proposal, funding for RUS broadband programs includes: ReConnect Program with $200 million for loans and grants, Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans with $1.933 million for loans, Community Connect Grants with $30 million, and Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants with $43.6 million. The RUS broadband programs have been awarding funds to rural communities since FY2001. Criticisms include not enough approved loans, complex application process, and insufficient credit support leading to rejections. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed the RUS to reduce the burdensome application process and make the program requirements more reasonable, particularly in regard to cash-on-hand requirements. USDA was also directed to hire more full-time employees to remedy delays in application processing times. The RUS is working to make the program more user-friendly while protecting taxpayer investment. The RUS is working to make the loan program more user-friendly and ensure loans are likely to be repaid. The loan application process focuses on validating market analysis and ensuring sufficient resources for operating expenses. Application review times have decreased over time, and a Proposed Rule was released in 2007 to revise regulations. The RUS released a Proposed Rule in 2007 to revise broadband loan program regulations. Criticisms of applicant eligibility criteria have been raised, with concerns that funding has shifted away from rural communities in need of broadband access. $103.4 million in loans and grants (nearly 12% of total funding awarded) were given to 64 communities near large cities. The eligibility requirements for the program have been criticized for being too narrow, excluding small rural towns exceeding 20,000 in population and higher income communities with limited broadband access. The IG report found that RUS often awarded loans to communities with existing broadband service. The IG report found that RUS has not prioritized loans for communities without broadband service, leading to loans being awarded to communities with existing service. In 2004, 66% of communities receiving loans had preexisting service. According to the IG report, RUS awarded loans to companies in competitive business environments. 40% of approved communities were unserved, and 15% had only one broadband provider. Critics argue that RUS loans unfairly subsidize multiple broadband providers in communities already served by private capital. RUS defended its policies in providing loans for broadband service in areas with existing competition, stating that it aligns with the need for competition to improve service quality and reduce costs for consumers. They argued that the presence of a competitor does not necessarily mean an area is adequately served, and that serving more densely populated rural areas with some level of competition may be necessary for borrowers to maintain a viable business. The IG reexamined the RUS broadband loan program and found that key issues identified in a previous report had not been resolved. Loans were still being issued to communities near cities with existing providers, and loans were granted in markets with competition. Since 2005, 34 out of 37 approved RUS broadband loans went to areas with existing private providers, totaling $873 million for 1,448 communities. The IG report criticized the program for funding projects in areas already served by broadband providers, but RUS defended its actions as consistent with statutory requirements and congressional intent. RUS argued that its Proposed Rule and changes to the broadband loan statute addressed concerns over loans to nonrural areas and preexisting broadband providers. The Final Rule had not been implemented during 2005-2008, leading RUS to continue awarding loans under existing rules. The program was on hiatus in 2009-2010 for the Broadband Initiatives Program, with new regulations released in 2011. In March 2011, the OIG closed its audits of the RUS broadband loan program after addressing concerns. In May 2014, GAO reported that 43% of awarded rural broadband loans were no longer active, highlighting issues with loan performance goals and FCC reforms causing investment uncertainty. The GAO made recommendations to address uncertainty hindering investment in broadband, focusing on evaluating loans made by RUS through the broadband loan program and aligning performance goals with the program's purpose. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program, authorized by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, has been reauthorized and modified by farm bills. The 2018 farm bill seeks to reauthorize and modify the program, along with addressing other RUS broadband programs and issues. During the 2008 farm bill reauthorization, key issues with the RUS broadband loan program were debated, including criticism for stringent financial requirements and burdensome application processes. Congress considered modifying loan eligibility criteria to balance accessibility for rural areas with taxpayer protection. The definition of \"rural\" communities was also discussed. The definition of \"rural\" communities for broadband loan eligibility was changed twice, with criteria including population size and location outside metropolitan statistical areas. Suburban communities were effectively excluded from receiving loans under the program. The definition of \"rural\" communities for broadband loan eligibility was changed in 2004, broadening the criteria to include communities near large cities. This change allowed loans to be issued to communities with preexisting service, addressing the challenge of targeting rural communities for broadband assistance. The definition of \"rural\" communities for broadband loan eligibility was broadened in 2004, allowing loans to be issued to communities near large cities. This led to controversy over loans to areas with competitive preexisting service, as loan recipients may compete with existing broadband providers. Congress was urged to define eligibility criteria more sharply during reauthorization. During reauthorization, Congress debated whether loans should be given to companies serving rural areas with preexisting competitive broadband service. Some argued against subsidizing competitors in sparsely populated rural markets, while others advocated for promoting competition to drive down prices and improve service. The issue raised concerns about diverting assistance from unserved areas in need of support. The 2002 farm bill directed RUS to use \"technologically neutral\" criteria for approving loans for broadband projects. Approved projects used various technologies such as fiber-to-the-home, DSL, fixed wireless, cable, and broadband over powerlines. Satellite broadband projects did not receive funding. The 2002 farm bill directed RUS to use \"technologically neutral\" criteria for approving loans for broadband projects, allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to determine minimum data transmission rates. There were debates on raising the minimum speed thresholds to ensure rural areas receive \"next-generation\" broadband technologies, but this could exclude certain technologies. Proponents argued for keeping the minimum threshold low to serve underserved areas. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246) reauthorized the RUS broadband loan program, defining rural areas and addressing criticisms. It allows any broadband technology economically feasible for deployment in underserved rural areas. The RUS broadband loan program reauthorized by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 defines rural areas based on housing density. Priority is given to applicants offering broadband service to households without it. Eligible entities must submit a proposal to provide service to rural areas and complete build-out within three years. Entities serving at least 20% of US households cannot receive more than 15% of funds for the broadband loan program in a fiscal year. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to review and recommend modifications in rate-of-data-transmission criteria for the broadband loan program. Loans cannot be made in areas with three or more incumbent service providers unless specific requirements are met. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to review and recommend modifications in rate-of-data-transmission criteria for the broadband loan program. Loans cannot be made in areas with three or more incumbent service providers unless specific requirements are met. The applicant must not be eligible for funding under another provision of the Rural Electrification Act. The Secretary must consider existing recurring revenues at the time of application and ensure that the security used for a loan is appropriate to the risk involved. The Secretary of Agriculture reviews and recommends modifications for the broadband loan program. Loans are issued to financially stable entities, with security considerations based on broadband service availability. A cost-share of up to 10% may be required. Direct loans have an interest rate equivalent to Treasury borrowing costs or 4%. Loan terms can be up to 35 years with sufficient security. In underserved trust areas, loans with 2% interest rates may be provided, and nonduplication requirements can be waived. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to provide loans with interest rates as low as 2% and may waive certain restrictions. Entities with more than 20% market projection in rural areas must submit a market survey. Public notice of applications is required, and steps are taken to reduce costs for first-time applicants. The Secretary of Agriculture can provide loans with low interest rates and waive restrictions. Entities with over 20% market projection in rural areas must submit a market survey. A preapplication process can be established for smaller internet providers to determine area eligibility. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee program is authorized at $25 million annually from 2008 to 2012. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the program's loans, communities served, broadband speed, and types of services. The USDA provides loans with low interest rates for rural broadband access, with requirements for market surveys and area eligibility. The program is authorized at $25 million annually from 2008 to 2012, with reports to Congress on loans, communities served, broadband speed, and services offered. Section 6111 establishes a National Center for Rural Telecommunications Assessment, while Section 6112 directs the FCC Chairman to submit a report on a comprehensive rural broadband strategy to Congress. The report describes a rural broadband strategy, to be updated in the third year after enactment. The Farm Bill Broadband Loan Program was on hiatus in 2009 and 2010 as RUS implemented the Broadband Initiatives Program. Final regulations for the broadband loan program were being refined to reflect RUS experience in implementing BIP. An Interim Rule and Notice was published in March 2011, setting rules for the broadband loan program. The FCC released a report on rural broadband in May 2009. The FCC released a report on rural broadband strategy, recommending improved coordination, assessment of broadband needs, and overcoming deployment challenges. The Agricultural Act of 2014 amended the Rural Electrification Act to reauthorize the Rural Broadband Access Loan Program through FY2018. The Agricultural Act of 2014 reauthorized the Rural Broadband Access Loan Program through FY2018, with provisions to redefine project area eligibility, increase transparency, establish a minimum level of broadband service, and create a Rural Gigabit Network Pilot Program. The program did not include a Senate proposal for a new grant component or broadening of eligible rural areas. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) prioritizes applicants offering broadband service to unserved households or those with inadequate service levels. Equal consideration is given to all qualified applicants, including those without previous funding. Preference is given to applicants serving residential customers and not primarily focused on business services. The RUS prioritizes applicants offering broadband service to unserved households or those with inadequate service levels. Evaluation periods are established to compare loan applications and prioritize loans to rural communities lacking acceptable broadband service. Market survey and notice requirements are also outlined for applicants. The RUS database tracks applications for assistance, status, and details of each application, including recipient name, type of assistance, purpose, and semiannual reports. Reporting requires loan recipients to submit detailed reports for three years post-project completion. Default and deobligation procedures are established for recovering funds from defaults, awarding to new applicants, and minimizing overlap. Service area assessment directs RUS to list proposed service areas promptly on its website. The RUS requires broadband service providers to submit information about the services they offer in specified census block groups. The minimum acceptable level of broadband service is defined as 4 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream, with the Secretary reviewing and potentially adjusting this speed definition every two years. The Secretary may establish different minimum speeds for fixed and mobile broadband. Assistance terms may consider if the area is unserved or below minimum service levels. The annual report to Congress must include new broadband services, network improvements, broadband speeds and prices, changes in adoption rates, and activities to increase high-speed access for educational institutions and healthcare providers. The reauthorization of the broadband loan program through FY2018 at $25 million per year includes a study on effective data sharing for the National Broadband Map. Additionally, a new Rural Gigabit Network Pilot Program was authorized to extend ultra-high-speed broadband service to rural areas. The Rural Gigabit Network Pilot Program, authorized at $10 million per year for FY2014-FY2018, was not implemented due to lack of funding. The Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program was implemented in July 2015, with the interim rule published in the Federal Register. The program allowed for two application periods per year and was made final in June 2016. The 2014 farm bill expired on September 30, 2018, prompting consideration for reauthorization of the RUS broadband loan program. The 115th Congress considered reauthorization of the RUS broadband loan program in the 2018 farm bill. H.R. 2, introduced by Representative Conaway, would reauthorize the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. The House Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 2 with amendments, and the House passed it on June 21, 2018. The Senate farm bill, S. 3042, was introduced by Senator Roberts and approved by the Committee on Agriculture. The Senate passed its version on June 28, 2018. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2 on June 28, 2018, with key differences in the rural broadband loan program. The House bill maintains current eligibility thresholds, while the Senate bill requires serving areas with 90% unserved households. The Senate bill aims to address the issue of inadequate broadband service in rural areas by limiting the number of broadband service providers in eligible areas and introducing a grant component to the current loan program. Grants are available in combination with loans for projects serving hard-to-reach communities with low service density. The federal share of project costs varies based on the density of the service area. The Senate bill introduces grants to the current loan program to improve broadband service in rural areas. Grants are available for projects serving low-density areas, with a federal share of 25% to 75%. The minimum broadband service speed is set at 25 Mbps (download)/3 Mbps (upload), with future standards to be established by USDA. The House bill authorizes RUS to provide rural broadband loans or loan guarantees for middle mile infrastructure projects, with an authorization level of $150 million for each fiscal year 2019-2023. Additionally, $350 million is allocated for grants to be used in conjunction with loans and loan guarantees. The Senate bill does not include a provision for middle mile infrastructure. The Senate bill authorizes $150 million annually for broadband loans, loan guarantees, and grants from 2019 to 2023. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was signed into law on December 20, 2018, adding a grant component to the RUS broadband program. Priority is given to projects serving rural communities without adequate broadband service. Priority for broadband projects is given to those providing at least 10 Mbps/1 Mbps service, with additional focus on serving rural households, low-income communities, populations under 10,000, areas experiencing outmigration, isolated areas, and precision agriculture applications. Projects developed or funded by multiple stakeholders also receive priority. Grants must be used in areas where at least 90% of households are unserved, with funding not exceeding 75% of total project costs for areas with fewer than 7 people per square mile. The Secretary has the authority to adjust the federal share of a grant up to 75% for rural areas without broadband service, low-income communities, populations under 10,000, areas experiencing outmigration, isolated areas, and precision agriculture applications. Loan eligibility requires at least 50% of households in proposed service areas to be unserved. The eligibility threshold for proposed service areas under P.L. 115-334 has been raised to 50%, up from 15%. Broadband buildout requirements now allow five years for completion, with a minimum standard of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. The Secretary will establish projections for minimum standards of broadband service for various timeframes and review them every two years. The Secretary may adjust minimum levels of broadband service every two years. Projects eligible for rural broadband loans must meet minimum service levels and future speed standards. Substitute standards may be used for unserved areas if cost prohibitive. Technical assistance and training may be provided to applicants. Applicants must serve communities without residential broadband of at least 10 Mbps/1 Mbps to be eligible for technical assistance and training. 3-5% of the annual broadband grant, loan, and loan guarantee program appropriation is allocated for this purpose.
