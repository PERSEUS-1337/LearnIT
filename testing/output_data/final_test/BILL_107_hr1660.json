The Congress acknowledges the importance of mathematics and science education in preparing students for the information age and the 21st-century workforce. The United States economy relies heavily on skilled, high-tech workers, and investing in research and development in science and technology is crucial for economic growth. The intellectual capital of the United States will play a significant role in maintaining economic growth, highlighting the importance of education in developing this resource. American students show average and below average performance in math and science compared to international peers. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in 1999 revealed declining trends in the 1970s, followed by improvements in the 1980s and early 1990s, but performance has plateaued since then. Noteworthy findings include lower science scores for 17-year-olds in 1999 compared to 1969, and stagnant scores for 13-year-olds in the same year. In 1999, there were disparities in academic performance among students based on race and gender. White students had higher math scores than black and Hispanic peers, with a widening gap since 1990. Males outperformed females in science at ages 13 and 17. Additionally, a higher percentage of 13-year-olds in 1999 reported general science content in class compared to 1986. The National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st century also highlighted these findings. Recent reports from TIMSS and NAEP show lackluster performance in math and science education in the US, which is unacceptable in today's technologically driven age. Proficiency in these subjects is crucial for American students to succeed in the 21st century and maintain a competitive economy. The United States economy is vibrant and competitive, emphasizing the need for advancement in mathematics and science proficiency. It is crucial to support economically disadvantaged students who lack opportunities to improve their knowledge in these areas. Urban and rural schools often lack resources to prepare students for the global community, creating a need for partnerships between schools and businesses. Partnerships between schools and businesses are crucial to improve mathematics and science proficiency for urban and rural students. Failing to prepare all citizens for the technology-driven economy risks the nation's economic and intellectual preeminence. Better teaching is key to enhancing achievement in mathematics and science for all students. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director shall establish a grant program for local educational agencies to develop mathematics, science, and information technology curricula, purchase necessary equipment, and provide teacher training in those subjects. The grant program aims to train teachers in information technology, mathematics, and science, and provide students with a standards-based course of study in these subjects. Eligible local educational agencies must have agreements with the private sector for services and funds, and comply with the requirements of the Act. Private sector participation is outlined in conditional agreements. The grant program requires private sector participation, including technology tool donations, internship opportunities, mentoring, and scholarship funds for students studying mathematics, science, and information technology. Local educational agencies must submit applications according to guidelines established by the Director. The grant program requires private sector participation, including technology tool donations, internship opportunities, mentoring, and scholarship funds for students studying mathematics, science, and information technology. The application for the scholarship program must include a description of proposed activities, criteria for selection, duration of scholarship, number of scholarships to be awarded each year, funding levels, and evidence of private sector participation and financial support. The Director will issue guidelines for the program. The Director will issue guidelines for a grant program that awards local educational agencies up to $300,000 based on merit, private sector commitments, and economic need. The Director will conduct a study to evaluate the impact of activities under the Act on student performance in math, science, and IT at the precollege level. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within 4 years of the first scholarship award. The report will include data on students graduating with majors in these fields and those employed in them. The Act defines a \"conditional agreement\" as an arrangement between the private sector and educational agencies to provide services and funds for students in math, science, and IT programs. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation, and an \"eligible student\" is a 12th-grade student who has participated in these programs. The Act establishes a program for students in math, science, and IT fields who demonstrate commitment and high academic standing. The terms \"institution of higher education\" and \"local educational agency\" are defined in reference to existing legislation. The curr_chunk states the definition of a term in reference to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The National Science Foundation is authorized to receive $5,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2006 for the implementation of this Act."
