    "content": "Defined contribution (DC) plans have become the most prevalent form of employer-sponsored retirement plan in the United States over the past 25 years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 51% of private-sector workers participated in an employer-sponsored retirement plan in 2007, with only 20% covered by traditional pensions. In a defined benefit (DB) plan, the employer bears the investment risk, ensuring sufficient assets to pay benefits, while in a DC plan, the worker bears the investment risk, with retirement account balance depending on contributions. In a typical 401(k) plan, a worker must decide whether to participate, how much to contribute, how to invest the contributions, what to do with the account if he or she changes jobs, and how to take money out of the account after retiring. The decline in major stock market indices in 2008 greatly reduced the value of many families' retirement savings held in DC plans, with assets falling from $3.73 trillion to $2.66 trillion, a decline of 28.7%. Ongoing contributions by workers and employers helped mitigate the impact of the stock market volatility on retirement savings. The effect of stock market volatility on families' retirement savings is a key concern for Congress regarding DC plans. Other issues include increasing access to employer-sponsored plans, raising participation and contribution rates, improving investment choices, disclosing fees clearly, preserving savings during economic hardship, and promoting life annuities for retirement income. This CRS report outlines major policy issues related to DC plans: access to retirement plans, participation, contribution rates, investment choices, fee disclosure, leakage from savings, and converting savings into income. According to the National Compensation Survey (NCS), 61% of private-sector workers had access to retirement plans in 2007. 21% had a DB plan, 55% had a DC plan, and 15% had both. Nearly 4 out of 10 workers did not have access to a retirement plan. Small employers are less likely to offer retirement plans than larger ones. Increasing small employers offering plans could expand access to millions more workers. Retirement plans could be expanded to include millions more workers, especially those at small establishments. Data from the Bureau of the Census and the Department of Labor show a significant gap in retirement plan sponsorship between large and small employers. In 2007, 40% of private-sector workers did not have access to a retirement plan, with 64% of them working for firms with fewer than 100 employees. Workers at establishments with 100 or more employees were more likely to have access to retirement plans compared to those at smaller establishments. Workers at small establishments are less likely to be offered a retirement plan, but if offered, they are as likely as employees at larger businesses to participate. In 2007, 70% of workers at establishments with 100 or more employees were offered a DC plan, with a 76% take-up rate. In comparison, at establishments with fewer than 100 employees, 42% of workers were offered a DC plan, with a 79% take-up rate. If employees at small firms had been offered DC plans at the same rate as employees of larger firms, an additional 11.4 million workers would have had the opportunity to participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans in 2007. In 2007, an additional 9.0 million workers would have participated in DC plans if small firms offered them at the same rate as larger firms. Retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, must comply with ERISA and the IRC to receive tax benefits. Nondiscrimination tests ensure fair treatment for all employees in terms of contributions and benefits. Small firms face challenges in passing these tests due to modest changes in employee participation or contributions. To encourage more employers, especially small ones, to sponsor retirement plans, Congress has authorized defined contribution plans exempt from certain administrative requirements. Plans failing nondiscrimination tests may have contributions returned to highly compensated employees (HCEs) and risk losing tax-qualified status. A \"safe-harbor\" 401(k) plan, established in 1996, exempts sponsors from annual nondiscrimination tests in exchange for employer contributions. In a safe-harbor 401(k), employers must contribute at least 3% of pay. In a safe-harbor 401(k), employers must contribute 3% of pay for each eligible employee or match employee salary deferrals up to 3% and 50% of the next 2%. Any firm with employees can establish this plan. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 authorized the SIMPLE plan, where employers must contribute 2% of pay or match 100% of employee contributions up to 3%. Participants aged 50 and older can make additional contributions up to $11,500 per year in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 and 2011, participants aged 50 and older can make additional contributions of up to $2,500 to a SIMPLE plan. Employers with fewer than 100 employees can establish SIMPLE plans. The Revenue Act of 1978 authorized a defined contribution plan called the Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) for firms without retirement plans. Employer contributions to a SEP cannot exceed 25% of pay up to a maximum of $49,000 in each year 2010 and 2011. Participants are fully vested in employer contributions. Despite the availability of retirement plans like SEP, SIMPLE, and safe-harbor 401(k), there has been limited growth in plan sponsorship among small firms over the past 20 years. Small firms are less likely to offer retirement plans compared to large firms due to a higher likelihood of going out of business. Small firms have higher rates of going out of business annually compared to larger firms. This uncertainty leads to fewer small employers offering retirement plans to their employees. To address this issue, there is a proposal to promote the adoption of payroll deduction IRAs by employers who do not sponsor retirement plans. Small business owners who do not sponsor a retirement plan may consider setting up a payroll deduction IRA for their employees. While some may drop existing retirement plans in favor of IRAs, many will not due to the higher contribution limits and tax benefits of 401(k) plans. In 2011, the annual contribution limit for an IRA is $5,000 compared to $16,500 for a 401(k). Small business owners can save more for retirement on a tax-deferred basis with a 401(k) plan. IRA contribution limits are lower than 401(k) limits, leading some small business owners to consider dropping 401(k) plans for IRAs. Payroll deduction IRAs lack ERISA protections, which are important for 401(k) participants. Participation in 401(k) plans requires employees to elect to contribute. 401(k) plans typically require employees to elect to contribute, although some plans now automatically enroll eligible employees. Participation rates are influenced by access to retirement plans and the take-up rate among employees offered a plan. In 2007, only 32% of workers under 35 participated in DC plans, with a low take-up rate among younger workers. Workers aged 35-44 had a 82% take-up rate, while those aged 45-54 had a rate of 83%. In 2007, participation rates in DC plans varied among different age groups and firm sizes. Workers aged 35-44 had an 82% take-up rate, while those aged 45-54 had a rate of 83%. Participation rates were lower for younger workers compared to older workers. Employees of small firms had lower participation rates due to fewer firms offering retirement plans. Only 9% of workers at firms with fewer than 20 employees participated in a DC plan, compared to 57% at firms with 500 or more employees. In 2007, participation rates in DC plans varied among different age groups and firm sizes. Workers aged 35-44 had an 82% take-up rate, while those aged 45-54 had a rate of 83%. Participation rates were lower for younger workers compared to older workers. Access to employer-sponsored retirement plans and participation in plans also differ between better-educated and less-educated workers and between workers in higher-income and lower-income households. Only 39% of workers in households with a high school education or less had access to a DC plan, compared to 60% in households with higher education levels. Policies to increase retirement plan participation should consider the target population's situation. Efforts should focus on improving the low take-up rate among young employees, possibly through automatic enrollment or more education. Policies to boost retirement plan participation should target small firms and less-educated workers, possibly through automatic enrollment and investment education. Tax incentives are in place to encourage employer sponsorship and employee participation in retirement plans. Employer contributions to retirement plans are tax-deductible, benefiting higher-income workers more due to their higher tax brackets. The tax deduction makes contributing to a 401(k) plan cheaper on an after-tax basis. Higher earners tend to save more, with or without tax incentives. Some economists argue that tax incentives for retirement saving are skewed towards higher-income workers who would save regardless. To encourage low- and middle-income workers to save, a new retirement savings tax credit was introduced in 2001, known as the \"saver's credit.\" The saver's credit, introduced in 2001, provides tax incentives for retirement saving. Single taxpayers with AGI up to $17,000 can get a 50% credit on contributions up to $2,000, with varying percentages for different income levels. Married couples filing jointly with AGI up to $34,000 are also eligible. The credit is non-refundable and has a maximum of $1,000. The saver's credit is limited because it is non-refundable and phases out over a low income range. H.R. 1961 aimed to make the credit refundable, increase the rate of the tax credit, and raise the income limits for maximum credit. The bill aimed to increase the saver's credit, making it refundable and raising income limits. Employee contributions to 401(k) plans are influenced by matching contributions, with common formulas offering 50% of the first 6% of pay contributed. In 2007, the most common matching formula for 401(k) plans was 50% of the first 6% of pay contributed by the employee, with a total employer contribution of 3% of employee pay. Many workers contribute just enough to receive the full employer match, affecting their retirement savings. The retirement benefit in defined contribution plans depends on contributions, investment gains, and fees. In 2007, research showed that workers' retirement account balances are influenced by the number of years and amounts they contribute. Encouraging workers to save more and start saving earlier can increase their income in retirement. Table 3 displays households' monthly contributions to DC plans in 2007 by age, income, and all contributing households. The median monthly contribution to defined contribution plans in 2007 was shown. In 2007, households with workers aged 25 to 64 participating in DC plans had a median contribution of $290 monthly, equivalent to $3,480 annually. 25% of households contributed $660 or more per month, while 25% contributed $130 or less. 25% of participating households contributed 8.3% of earnings or more, and 25% contributed 2.9% or less. Younger households contributed less to DC plans compared to older households. In 2007, median monthly contributions to DC plans varied by age group. Households headed by individuals under 35 contributed $190, those aged 35-44 contributed $310, 45-54 contributed $368, and 55-64 contributed $330. Contributions as a percentage of earnings were 4.2% for under 35, 5.2% for 35-44, and 5.7% for both 45-54 and 55-64 age groups. In 2007, household contributions to DC plans varied by income quartile. Higher-income households had a median monthly contribution of $750, which was 6.6% of their earnings. In contrast, lower-income households had a median monthly contribution of $100, which was 5.7% of their earnings. Employer matching contributions in 401(k) plans vary based on income quartile. Higher-income households contribute 6.6% of earnings, while lower-income households contribute 4.3%. Matching contributions can increase participation rates, but often phase out at low employee contribution rates. Contributions over 6% of pay are rare. Automatic contribution escalation can help raise contribution rates over time. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 aimed to promote employer adoption of these strategies. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 incentivized employers to implement automatic enrollment in retirement plans by granting exemptions for plans with a \"qualified automatic contribution arrangement.\" This arrangement includes automatic escalation of employee contributions, starting at 3% of pay in the first year and increasing to 6% in subsequent years. The maximum automatic deferral is 10% of pay, with a total annual limit of $16,500. In 2011, the limit for qualified automatic contribution arrangements is $16,500, including employer contributions. Employer contributions can be non-elective or matching, with specific criteria for matching formulas. The median employee salary deferral into DC plans was 6% of pay in 2007, with some workers deferring less. Automatic contribution escalation in qualified arrangements could increase employee contribution rates significantly. Automatic contribution escalation in 401(k) plans can raise employee contribution rates for many participants. Most plans with automatic enrollment see continued participation. However, there is limited evidence on the long-term effects of automatic escalation. Participants can also choose how to invest their contributions in 401(k) plans, with the majority of plans allowing for investment direction. In 2007, the average 401(k) plan offered participants 18 investment options, including actively managed U.S. and international stock funds, indexed U.S. stock funds, and actively managed U.S. bond funds. Participants bear the risk of investment losses due to declines in the value of chosen assets. Diversification can help reduce this risk. Diversification reduces investment risk by spreading assets across different companies and industries. It helps protect against losses in poorly performing companies by offsetting gains from well-performing ones. Market risk, such as a broad decline in stocks, can still affect a diversified portfolio. Investment advisors recommend diversifying not only within asset classes but also across different types of assets. Investment advisors recommend diversifying not only within asset classes but also across different types of assets, such as stocks and bonds. Life-cycle funds and target date funds are examples of diversified investments that spread assets across various classes of assets. Despite recommendations for diversification and periodic re-balancing, many plan participants heavily invest in stocks and stock mutual funds, with 78% of DC plan assets allocated to these investments at year-end 2007. Many workers nearing retirement heavily invested in stocks and stock mutual funds, risking substantial losses in a market downturn. In 2007, nearly 30% of DC plan participants aged 35-54 had 100% of their account balance in stocks, while 28% of those aged 55-64 had their entire balance in stocks. Policy analysts suggest plans should help participants make better investment choices or automatically allocate contributions among different investments. Investment education and target date funds are ways to achieve asset diversification in DC plans. To achieve asset diversification in DC plans, participants need to understand finance principles like risk-and-return characteristics of stocks and bonds. Investment education, advice, and target date funds are ways to help employees make informed investment decisions. Over 90% of 401(k) plans offer some form of investment education. 401(k) plans offer investment education through enrollment kits, seminars, workshops, and internet sites to help participants understand saving for retirement. Education focuses on finance basics like compound interest and stock vs. bond differences. Understanding investment gains over time encourages contributions and higher savings. Participants learn to balance risk tolerance with desire for returns when choosing investments. Despite education, some employees may still choose not to participate. Investment education provides general information on finance principles for plan participants, while investment advice offers tailored recommendations on specific investments. Some employers are hesitant to offer investment advice due to costs and legal concerns. In 2007, 49% of 401(k) plans provided investment advice, up from 35% in 2000. Automatic enrollment may be more effective for workers who prioritize current income over retirement savings. In 2007, 49% of 401(k) plans offered investment advice to participants, up from 35% in 2000. Some participants make unwise investment choices, such as investing too much in their employer's stock or being too conservative with their contributions. Providing sound investment advice can help participants avoid common mistakes and potential losses. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows plan sponsors to provide investment advice without liability for participant losses if certain procedures are followed. The advice must be fee-based or based on an unbiased computer model, with disclosure of fee arrangements and affiliations. The Department of Labor published a final regulation on investment advice provisions of the PPA, delaying its implementation multiple times. The PPA allows investment advice with disclosure of financial interests, and a bill was introduced to prohibit conflicted investment advice. Robert Andrews introduced H.R. 1988, the Conflicted Investment Advice Prohibition Act of 2009, which would restrict investment advice to independent advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The bill aims to ensure that advisers act as fiduciaries and provide documentation of investment options' historical rates of return to plan participants. Life-cycle funds and target date funds are added to 401(k) plans to help participants manage their retirement accounts based on risk tolerance and expected retirement date. However, the 2008 stock market downturn revealed problems with these funds as many lost 25% to 30% of their value. Target date funds are considered a subset of life-cycle funds. Target date funds are a type of life-cycle fund that automatically adjusts asset allocation as the participant nears retirement. The goal is to achieve a specific asset mix at the expected retirement date, shifting from higher-risk to lower-risk investments. Life-cycle funds and target date funds aim for rapid growth early on and stability later in the participant's career. Life-cycle funds and target date funds aim for growth in the early years and stability in later years, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash. Less than 5% of DC plan assets are currently invested in life-cycle funds, but analysts expect this to increase due to the Pension Protection Act. Allocation of assets varies among target date funds with the same retirement date. A study by Morningstar found that target-date 2010 funds had varying stock allocations, with some funds performing better than others during the 2008 bear market. For example, the S&P Target Date 2010 Index Fund fell 17%, while the Deutsche Bank DWS Target 2010 Fund only fell 4% and Oppenheimer's Transition 2010 fund fell 41%. The Thrift Savings Plan's \"L2010 Fund\" held 70% of its assets in bonds and 30% in stocks, with shares falling 10.5% in 2008. Senator Herb Kohl raised concerns about fund performance in a letter to Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis in February 2009. In February 2009, Senator Herb Kohl urged Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis to review target date funds and address regulations to protect plan participants. Secretary Solis responded in March, stating that the Department of Labor, along with the SEC, would review target date funds for potential federal regulation. Congress is also concerned about the impact of fees on retirement account balances, as service providers charge fees that are ultimately paid by plan participants. The structure of 401(k) fees can be complex and opaque. The structure of 401(k) fees is complex and opaque, making it difficult for plan participants to judge if they are receiving services at a fair price. Employers arrange for third parties to provide various services for the plan, including recording transactions, arranging loans, and contracting with funds for contributions. Services can be purchased individually or in bundled arrangements. Fees for 401(k) plans can be priced individually or in bundled arrangements, where multiple services are offered for a single fee. The fees vary based on the services offered and the size of the plan. Larger plans with more participants and higher average balances tend to have lower fees as a percentage of plan assets. A survey by Deloitte Consulting found that fees vary across plans of different sizes. The study analyzed fees for 401(k) plans, ranging from less than $1 million in total assets to plans with over $500 million in assets and more than 10,000 participants. The median fee for all plans was 0.72% of plan assets, with 10% of plans having fees of 0.35% or less, and 10% having fees of 1.72% or more. Fees are charged for services like record-keeping and investment management, with some being transaction-based and others as a flat fee per account per year. Fees for 401(k) plans can vary, with some charged as a percentage of total plan assets. Small differences in fees can significantly impact retirement savings. Plan sponsors are responsible for defraying reasonable expenses, including fees, as stated in Section 404(a) of ERISA. The Department of Labor requires plan sponsors to ensure that fees for retirement plans are reasonable, allowing for variation in fees. Sponsors of Defined Contribution (DC) plans are obligated to ensure fees are reasonable but lack the same financial incentive as Defined Benefit (DB) plan sponsors. Increased transparency in fee arrangements could lead to participants paying lower fees. The Department of Labor requires plan sponsors to disclose fees for retirement plans to ensure they are reasonable. Legislation has been introduced to increase fee disclosure to participants, including bills like S. 401 and H.R. 1984 in the 111th Congress. The committee numbered H.R. 2989, which combined bills H.R. 1984 and H.R. 1988, introduced by Representative Robert Andrews. Another bill, H.R. 2779, introduced by Representative Richard Neal, focused on Defined Contribution Plan Fee Transparency. Congress has allowed exceptions to access retirement savings before retirement age, increasing the risk of reducing savings prematurely. Pre-retirement withdrawals from retirement accounts, known as \"leakages,\" are regulated by Congress to limit access but not completely prohibited due to the importance of access for plan participants. Research shows that restricting access may deter workers from contributing to retirement accounts. Current laws strike a balance between limiting leakages and allowing access in emergencies. Leakages can include hardship withdrawals, borrowing against assets, and cashing out upon separation from employment. The tax code allows 401(k) plans to offer hardship distributions to employees facing immediate financial needs. These distributions are limited to the employee's previous elective contributions and can be used for expenses like medical care, housing, education, and funeral costs. Hardship distributions must cover the immediate financial need and any resulting taxes. Hardship distributions from 401(k) plans are subject to income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if not used for specific purposes allowed by law. Participants can borrow from their accounts, with loans capped at $50,000 or 50% of their vested benefit. Repayment is typically required within five years, except for home purchases which can be repaid over 15 years. Loans from a 401(k) plan for home purchases can be repaid over 15 years. If repayment stops, the IRS will consider the loan amount as a distribution subject to taxes and penalties. Employees separating from their employer before repaying the loan must settle the balance immediately to avoid it being taxed. Borrowing from a 401(k) is usually better than a hardship withdrawal as the account balance is not permanently reduced, and contributions can continue while the loan is outstanding. Repayments on loans are not taxed or penalized unlike hardship distributions. Loans from DC plans are not taxed or penalized if repayments are on schedule. In 2007, 9.5% of households with a DC plan had outstanding loans, with a mean balance of $6,683. Leakages from retirement savings can occur when changing jobs, with options like keeping the account, rolling it over, or taking a distribution. Congress has amended the IRC to encourage workers to leave their retirement benefits in their former employer's plan or roll over the account into an IRA or another qualified retirement plan. A 10% tax is imposed on early distributions not rolled over, and employers must offer departing employees the option to transfer funds to an IRA or another plan. Withholding of 20% is required if the participant chooses to receive the distribution. Congress has amended the IRC to encourage workers to leave their retirement benefits in their former employer's plan or roll over the account into an IRA or another qualified retirement plan. IRC \u00a7411(a)(11) allows a plan sponsor to distribute a departing employee's accrued benefit without consent if the value is under $5,000. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 requires distributions over $1,000 to be deposited into an IRA unless instructed otherwise. Congress aims to prevent leakages from retirement savings while allowing for withdrawals in times of financial hardship. Current law allows cashing out accrued benefits under $5,000 automatically, with a written agreement needed for amounts over $5,000. Workers can take cash distributions when leaving a job, with 20% withheld for taxes and an additional 10% tax if not rolled over within 60 days. Stricter limits on pre-retirement distributions could impact participation and contributions. Allowing easier pre-retirement access to retirement accounts could lead to more leakages, depleted balances, and poorer retirements. Early distributions compromise objectives like encouraging plan participation, asset preservation, and access during economic hardship. Retirement savings must be used for financial security during retirement, considering risks like increased life expectancy, market volatility, inflation, and healthcare costs. Converting savings into income can be challenging, with options like purchasing annuities available. One option for converting retirement savings into income is purchasing a life annuity, which provides regular payments for life in exchange for a lump-sum premium. Life annuities help protect against financial risks in retirement, such as longevity and investment risks. Some annuities offer inflation protection through annual income increases, while others allow for investment gains but also involve sharing in losses. Few 401(k) plans offer annuity options for retiring workers, with only 21% providing this choice in 2007. Annuities have proven unpopular, with fewer than 10% of participants opting for them. Most DC plan participants either take periodic withdrawals or roll their balance into an IRA at retirement. Social Security and defined benefit pensions also provide income, leading to few people purchasing life annuities. Few retirees purchase income annuities due to concerns about high fees, impact on financial assets, and desire to leave assets as inheritance. Defined benefit pension plans offer joint and survivor annuities as default, contributing to low annuity uptake compared to periodic withdrawals from retirement accounts. Defined contribution plans do not have a requirement to offer joint and survivor annuities as the default form of benefit. Policy proposals aim to make annuities more appealing rather than mandatory, with options like excluding annuity income from gross income. Retirees often have to purchase individual annuities due to the lack of annuity options in 401(k) plans, which can be more expensive and less efficient than group annuities. Individual annuities are costlier than group annuities, shifting the burden of finding the best deal onto inexperienced individuals. Many retirees prefer periodic withdrawals over purchasing a life annuity due to high cancellation costs. Economists are puzzled by the low demand for annuities despite their protection against longevity risk. Research shows that the appeal of annuities depends on buyers understanding the value of income security they provide. Researchers have found that emphasizing the insurance aspects of annuities increases potential buyers' receptiveness to purchasing life annuities. The Retirement Security Project suggests a strategy called \"automatic trial income\" to familiarize people with annuities by allowing retirees to \"test drive\" them for 24 months. This approach could help increase the understanding and appreciation of the income security that annuities provide. The Retirement Security Project proposes \"automatic trial income\" to change the perception of retirement accounts by framing them as an income stream. This approach would automatically pay out part of a worker's 401(k) as income at retirement, with the option to take the remainder as a lump sum or convert it to an annuity after 24 months. Automatic trial income would apply to those 55 or older when leaving a job and accounts above a minimum value, preventing small balances from being converted to annuities. The Advanced Life Deferred Annuity (ALDA) is a product purchased at retirement that delays income payments until the purchaser reaches an advanced age, like 80 or 85. If the purchaser dies before payments begin, they forfeit the premium. Premiums are low compared to immediate income annuities, providing longevity insurance at a fraction of the cost. The ALDA could offer substantial insurance against living into old age for a low premium, but its effectiveness compared to annuities remains uncertain. Some financial firms are developing managed withdrawal programs as alternatives to annuities, offering investment accounts with periodic distributions to ensure the balance lasts for a specified period. The federal government may need to establish standards for restating account balances as future income streams to help participants view their 401(k) as a source of retirement income. Some financial firms are developing managed withdrawal programs as alternatives to annuities, offering investment accounts with periodic distributions to ensure the balance lasts for a specified period. Unlike annuities, these accounts do not provide longevity insurance, and the account owner bears the risk of investment losses or outliving their savings. Efforts to increase retirement plan sponsorship among small employers have had limited success, with sponsorship being substantially lower among small employers compared to large employers. Increasing access to payroll deduction IRAs could potentially boost retirement savings for employees at small firms. Increasing access to payroll deduction IRAs could significantly increase retirement savings for employees at small firms. Currently, not all workers participate in retirement plans offered by their employers, with participation rates ranging from 20% to 25%. Employers can boost employee savings rates by adopting automatic escalation of contributions, gradually increasing employee contributions each year until reaching a target rate, such as 10% of pay. This approach, along with automatic enrollment, can help more employees save for retirement. Employers can increase employee savings rates by adopting automatic escalation of contributions, gradually increasing contributions each year until reaching a target rate, such as 10% of pay. In most DC plans, workers must decide whether to participate, how much to contribute, and how to invest. Some employers offer life-cycle funds that adjust contributions based on expected retirement date. Plan sponsors also provide investment education and may offer professional investment advice. Excessive fees can reduce retirement account balances, but participants often struggle to understand fee details from their account statements. Improving fee disclosure in 401(k) plans can help participants compare fees and services, potentially driving down costs. Money can \"leak\" from accounts before retirement through job changes or hardship distributions, with a 10% tax penalty on early withdrawals to discourage this behavior. Retirement savings in 401(k) accounts should be dedicated to preparing for retirement. Workers nearing retirement may not have a defined benefit pension and will need to decide how to convert their savings into retirement income. One risk they face is depleting their savings too quickly. Income annuities can help insure against outliving savings but are not widely used. Developing strategies to help retirees manage their retirement income will be a key public policy challenge in the coming years. The focus in the coming years will be on developing strategies to help retirees manage their retirement savings wisely for financial independence throughout retirement."
