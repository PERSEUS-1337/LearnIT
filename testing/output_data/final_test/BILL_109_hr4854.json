    "content": "The \"Rural Communities Investment Act of 2006\" is cited as the short title. It includes an exclusion for interest on loans secured by agricultural real estate and rural housing under section 139B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The exclusion under section 139B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 states that interest received by a qualified lender on a qualified real estate loan is not included in gross income. A qualified lender is defined as a bank or savings association with insured deposits, while a qualified real estate loan includes indebtedness secured by agricultural real estate or rural housing. The term 'agricultural real estate' refers to property used for producing agricultural products, while 'rural housing' pertains to housing in rural areas. The term 'rural housing' refers to single-family residences in rural areas that serve as the borrower's primary residence. The determination of rural housing eligibility is based on the property's location at the time the indebtedness originates. A 'rural area' is defined as an area with a population of 2,500 or less, not within a metropolitan statistical area. Qualified real estate loans with a population of 2,500 or less in rural areas are treated as tax-exempt obligations under section 265, with financial institutions including qualified lenders in the allocation of interest expenses. The text defines a qualified real estate loan for small borrowers with a limit of $10,000,000 in loans per calendar year. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act."
