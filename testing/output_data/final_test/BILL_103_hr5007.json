    "content": "The Act titled \"National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994\" includes findings, purposes, and definitions. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 identifies the need for a new contracting process in the National Forest System to address issues like heavy fuel loads, tree density, and threats from fires, disease, and insects. The current authority does not allow for the distribution of revenues from timber sales for ecosystem restoration work under a single contract. A new contracting process is necessary to improve forest resource conditions through ecosystem management. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 emphasizes the importance of ecosystem management for improving forest resources and species viability on National Forest System lands. It also aims to create employment opportunities and economic stability for communities near forest units. The Act seeks to enhance forest health, provide flexibility in procurement and funding practices, and distribute revenues from timber sales for ecosystem restoration work. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 aims to improve forest resources through ecosystem management. It grants the Secretary of Agriculture authority to enter stewardship contracts to meet management requirements outlined in various laws. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to enter stewardship contracts for the improvement and restoration of forest ecosystems. Definitions include the Stewardship Account, stewardship contract, Secretary of Agriculture, and resource activities. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to enter contracts for habitat enhancement, silvicultural treatments, watershed improvement, fuel treatments, and road obliteration. A resource manager is the line officer responsible for project decisions on a national forest unit. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to enter contracts for various forest management activities. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 authorizes the Secretary to establish a program using stewardship contracts for timber sales on National Forest System lands. Contracts must focus on forest health, sustainable ecosystems, and economic support for forest-dependent communities. A standard stewardship contract will be developed for use throughout the National Forest System, allowing resource managers to enter into contracts with qualified non-Federal entities. The contracts should outline the desired future condition for each resource managed and the evaluation criteria to be used. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 authorizes the Secretary to establish a program using stewardship contracts for timber sales on National Forest System lands. Contracts must focus on forest health, sustainable ecosystems, and economic support for forest-dependent communities. The Secretary shall ensure preferential treatment for small businesses in awarding stewardship contracts. Stewardship contracts' length shall comply with the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Selection of areas for contracts should prioritize improving forest health, soil and water quality, and wildlife habitat. The National Forest Stewardship Contracting Act of 1994 allows the Secretary to use stewardship contracts for timber sales on National Forest System lands. Contracts focus on forest health, sustainable ecosystems, and supporting forest-dependent communities. The Secretary can use revenues from timber sales to offset costs of other resource activities. Required deposits to the National Forest Fund must still be made, and a portion of timber revenues will go to States as mandated by previous Acts. The Secretary can use revenues from timber sales to make payments before using funds from stewardship contracts. Appropriated funds can be included in a stewardship contract if available from the current annual appropriation and provided for the benefiting function. SEC. 4. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES. Receipts from timber and forest products payments go into the Stewardship Account for funding resource activities and State payments. The Secretary can use the funds until expended, with excess amounts transferred to the Treasury. At least 80% of funds for resource activities must be used for direct costs. Reporting requirements are included in the annual report to the Secretary. The Secretary's annual report to Congress must include a summary of revenues, expenditures, and achievements related to stewardship contracts. SEC. 5. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. Stewardship contracts must comply with existing laws, without modifying any other laws except as explicitly provided in this Act."
