    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides medical assistance for low-income individuals. The ACA Medicaid expansion allows individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level to be eligible for Medicaid. States have the option to participate in Medicaid, with flexibility to cover mandatory and optional populations and services, leading to variation among states. Medicaid is a joint federal-state program with substantial variation among states in terms of eligibility, benefits, and provider payment rates. States incur costs by paying service providers and performing administrative activities, with the federal government reimbursing a share of these costs through the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). FMAP rates vary by state and are inversely related to per capita income, ranging from 50% to 74% for FY2016. States are required to make disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals treating low-income patients. The provision of Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding aims to support hospitals treating low-income patients who are often uninsured or Medicaid enrollees. DSH funding is capped, with each state receiving an annual federal allotment. In FY2015, states received a total of $11.9 billion in federal DSH funding. This report outlines how state DSH allotments are calculated, exceptions to the calculation, and defines DSH hospitals and payments. Medicaid DSH payments were established in 1981 to change Medicaid payment rates to hospitals. This law shifted the responsibility for determining Medicaid payment rates to the states and required rates to consider hospitals serving a disproportionate number of low-income patients. The Medicaid DSH payments were established in 1981 to support hospitals serving a high number of low-income patients. These hospitals heavily rely on Medicaid payments as their patients are mostly Medicaid enrollees or uninsured. Despite the requirement for DSH payments, many states did not comply in the 1980s, leading to additional federal laws to enforce these payments. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1986 and 1987 aimed to support state flexibility in making Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments under Medicaid. DSH payments grew significantly in the early 1990s, reaching $17.4 billion in FY1992, accounting for 15.0% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. The increase was not solely due to congressional laws but reflected the overall growth in Medicaid spending. The growth in Medicaid expenditures in the early 1990s was not solely due to congressional laws but also states' increased use of provider taxes and donations. Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments allowed states to draw down unlimited federal funds by increasing DSH payments and taxing away the state share. Congressional action in 1991 established ceilings on federal Medicaid DSH funding for each state. Since FY1993, each state has had its own DSH limit, known as a \"DSH allotment,\" which caps federal Medicaid funding. States receive an annual DSH allotment based on their FY1992 DSH payments, leading to disparities in allotments. The methodology for calculating states' annual DSH allotments has evolved over time, aiming to reduce disparities in funding. Currently, states' Medicaid DSH allotments are based on the prior year's DSH allotment, adjusted for the consumer price index. Louisiana will now receive a Medicaid DSH allotment based on the prior year's allotment increased by the percentage change in CPI-U. Each state's allotment is capped at 12% of its total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. Federal regulations also set a national DSH target to limit aggregate DSH payments. The regulations set a national DSH payment limit of 12% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures for all states. This limit applies to both federal and state spending. CMS publishes preliminary DSH allotments based on estimated Medicaid expenditures before the fiscal year, with final allotments calculated using actual expenditure data. Annual allotments are published in the Federal Register. The Federal Register publishes final DSH allotments for FY2013 and preliminary DSH allotments for FY2015. DSH allotments for FY2012 through FY2015 are shown in Table 2. Some states have alternative methods for determining their DSH allotments. Low DSH states now receive the same annual percentage increases as other states. Hawaii and Tennessee have special statutory arrangements for their DSH allotments. Special rules for low DSH states were established by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) amended the definition of low DSH state, providing greater annual increases to their DSH allotments. States designated as low DSH states in FY2004 continue to be low DSH states regardless of their DSH expenditures in later years. In FY2004, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act defined low DSH states, including Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. These states received a 16% increase in DSH allotments from FY2004 to FY2008. From FY2009 onwards, low DSH states receive DSH allotments adjusted by the CPI-U. Tennessee and Hawaii have their own Medicaid programs. Since FY2007, Tennessee and Hawaii have received DSH allotments through special statutory authority after waivers from making Medicaid DSH payments. Hawaii's DSH allotment was $10 million for FY2007 to FY2011, and $10 million split into two periods for FY2012 under the ACA. Tennessee also received federal DSH funding from FY2007 to FY2015. For FY2012, Hawaii's DSH allotment was $2.5 million for the first quarter and $7.5 million for the remaining three quarters. From FY2013 onwards, Hawaii's DSH allotment will increase like low DSH states. Tennessee's DSH allotment from FY2007 to FY2011 was $305.4 million, based on the federal share of DSH payments in TennCare for the demonstration year ending in 2006. In FY2012, Tennessee had access to $70.1 million in federal DSH funding, with $47.2 million not subject to the 30% limit. In FY2013, Tennessee received a DSH allotment of $53.1 million not subject to the limit. After FY2013, Tennessee did not receive a federal DSH allotment and no Medicaid DSH allotment in FY2014. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 provided Tennessee with a $53.1 million Medicaid DSH allotment annually from FY2015 to FY2025. The ACA aimed to reduce uninsured individuals through insurance coverage provisions, leading to planned reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments from FY2014 to FY2020. The ACA aimed to reduce uninsured individuals through insurance coverage provisions, leading to planned reductions in Medicaid DSH allotments from FY2014 to FY2020. Despite assumptions that reducing the uninsured would decrease the need for Medicaid DSH payments, the ACA was structured so that DSH allotments would return to pre-ACA levels by FY2021. However, subsequent laws have amended these reductions, extending them through FY2025. Current law shows aggregate reductions of $2.0 billion in FY2018, $3.0 billion in FY2019, $4.0 billion in FY2020, $5.0 billion in FY2021, $6.0 billion in FY2022, $7.0 billion in FY2023, $8.0 billion in FY2024, and $8.0 billion in FY2025. In FY2026, DSH allotments are set to return to pre-ACA levels. States have flexibility in defining DSH hospitals and calculating payments, following federal criteria. All DSH hospitals must have at least two obstetricians willing to serve Medicaid patients. In FY2026, DSH allotments are set to return to pre-ACA levels. States have flexibility in defining DSH hospitals and calculating payments, with staff privileges willing to serve Medicaid patients. States can identify as many or as few hospitals as DSH hospitals based on Medicaid utilization rates. There is variation across states in the proportion and types of hospitals designated as DSH hospitals, with some targeting funds to a few hospitals and others to all hospitals with Medicaid utilization rates above 1%. States also have flexibility in distributing DSH funds among hospitals. The federal government sets criteria for distributing DSH funds to hospitals, but states have flexibility in determining specific payment amounts. States must make minimum payments to DSH hospitals using one of three methodologies, with payments subject to a cap. This cap limits DSH payments to 100% of the cost of services provided to Medicaid and uninsured patients. The hospital-specific DSH limit defines uninsured patients as those without health insurance or third-party coverage for services provided during the year. CMS issued a final rule in December 2014 to clarify this definition. The State Medicaid Director Letter previously outlined that individuals without applicable health insurance are considered uninsured. This interpretation was in effect until January 19, 2009. The 2008 DSH final rule redefined \"uninsured\" as individuals without a legally liable third-party payer for hospital services, superseding the 1994 State Medicaid Director Letter's guidance. This raised concerns as it seemed to exclude many services from uncompensated care for Medicaid DSH purposes. The 2008 DSH final rule redefined \"uninsured\" for Medicaid DSH purposes, excluding services not covered by insurance. In response, CMS issued a final rule in 2014, changing the definition to include service-specific coverage determination. This new definition includes services beyond benefit package limits and lifetime insurance caps. Federal statute limits DSH payments for mental health facilities. The 2008 DSH final rule redefined \"uninsured\" for Medicaid DSH purposes, excluding services not covered by insurance. In response, CMS issued a final rule in 2014, changing the definition to include service-specific coverage determination. This new definition includes services beyond benefit package limits and lifetime insurance caps. Federal statute limits DSH payments for mental health facilities, including institutions for mental disease (IMDs), above state-specific dollar limits for federal matching funds. Each state has an IMD DSH limit based on FY1995 expenditures and current year total DSH allotment. Total DSH payments to hospitals and mental health facilities must not exceed the state's DSH allotments. The DSH allotments control Medicaid DSH expenditures, with limits published in Federal Register notices. Total DSH expenditures have remained stable since FY1993, totaling $18.6 billion in FY2015. The federal share was $10.6 billion. The law sets a national DSH payment limit at 12% of total Medicaid medical assistance spending. The national DSH payment limit is set at 12% of total Medicaid medical assistance spending for all states and the District of Columbia, restricting both federal and state expenditures. This limit applies to aggregate DSH payments, including federal and state funds, to ensure they do not exceed 12% of total Medicaid spending. Each state's DSH allotments are also capped at 12% of their Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. The federal share of DSH expenditures cannot exceed 12% of each state's total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. Despite the possibility of surpassing the national DSH target, the implementation of DSH allotments effectively brought payments under the 12% limit within a few years. In FY1993, DSH allotments were implemented, and by FY1996, total DSH expenditures fell below 12% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. By FY2015, DSH expenditures accounted for 3.5% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures, with 4 states (New York, California, Texas, and Louisiana) making up half of the expenditures. Top spending states like New York, California, and Texas also accounted for a large portion of total Medicaid DSH expenditures. Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina were among the states with lower DSH expenditures. Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina ranked high in Medicaid DSH expenditures relative to their total Medicaid budgets for FY2015. There is significant variation among states in DSH program structures and expenditure levels. In FY2015, DSH expenditures varied among states, with Louisiana having the highest at 16.9% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures. Nationally, 84% of DSH payments go to hospitals, while 16% go to IMDs. Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, and South Carolina had high Medicaid DSH expenditures compared to their total Medicaid budgets. In FY2015, most states allocated DSH expenditures to hospitals, with some states focusing on IMDs and other mental health facilities. Maine directed all DSH expenditures to IMDs and mental health facilities. Since FY1993, states have been required to provide quarterly reports on DSH payments to hospitals, with reporting requirements enhanced in 1997 and 2003 in response to audits and reports on state violations in the DSH program. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the MMA mandated states to provide annual reports on DSH funds allocation to hospitals. Reports must include detailed information on DSH payments, Medicaid utilization rates, uncompensated care, and audits to verify payment retention. Hospitals must undergo annual audits to verify DSH payment retention and compliance with hospital-specific limits. Uncompensated care includes inpatient and outpatient services, with states required to document and retain records of DSH payments. Failure to submit audits on time may result in loss of federal DSH matching funds for subsequent years. Findings from audits for SPRY2005 to SPRY2010 are not given significant weight. Since FY1993, DSH payments have remained stable, but have decreased as a percentage of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures from 15.0% in FY1992 to 3.5% in FY2015. Audit findings for SPRY2011 and after showing DSH payments exceeding hospital-specific cost limits are considered overpayments, requiring the state to return the excess federal funds unless redistributed to other qualifying hospitals. DSH expenditures will continue to decline due to reductions, impacting Medicaid assistance expenditures differently over the next few years. The impact of DSH reductions on state assistance expenditures varies by state based on uninsurance rates, DSH payment targeting, and whether a state is a \"low DSH state.\" The reductions are set to end in FY2025, with allotments returning to pre-reduction levels in FY2026. The future of Medicaid DSH payments is uncertain, as Congress may make further changes. Medicaid DSH funding limits were established in 1991, and states may see modifications to DSH roles in Medicaid as experience with ACA expansion grows. The DSH allotments for each state have been calculated by CMS since FY1993, with methodologies changing over the years. In FY1993, allotments were based on FY1992 DSH payments, leading to funding inequities. From FY1994 to FY1997, allotments were based on the prior year's allotment. From FY1994 to FY1997, DSH allotments for each state were determined based on whether they were classified as \"high-DSH\" or \"low-DSH\" states. \"High-DSH\" states did not receive an increase to their allotment, while \"low-DSH\" states had their allotment growth factor based on the projected percentage increase in total Medicaid expenditures. However, \"low-DSH\" states' allotments could not exceed 12% of their total medical assistance expenditures. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA; P.L. 105-33) reduced Medicaid DSH expenditures by implementing fixed state DSH allotments for FY1998 through FY2002. The aggregate fixed allotments for FY1998 totaled $10.3 billion, decreasing to $10.0 billion for FY1999 and $9.3 billion for FY2000. Legislative adjustments were made to the fixed DSH allotments for specific states. The Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (P.L. 105-277) and subsequent legislation increased DSH allotments for certain states in FY1999, FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 eliminated DSH reductions for FY2001 and FY2002, providing states with increases to their DSH allotments. The DSH allotments for FY1999 and FY2000 were determined by increasing each state's prior year allotment by the percent change in CPI-U. State DSH allotments could not exceed 12% of total medical assistance expenditures. \"Extremely low DSH states\" had special rules, with FY2001 allotments increased to 1% of total medical assistance expenditures. The DSH allotments for FY2001 and FY2003 were determined based on CPI-U changes, subject to the 12% rule. FY2003 allotments were lower for most states compared to FY2002 due to discrepancies in actual allotments. Extremely low DSH states received higher allotments based on actual FY2002 amounts. The MMA in 2003 addressed the drop in DSH allotments for many states. The MMA in 2003 addressed the drop in DSH allotments for many states by exempting FY2002 amounts from the 12% rule and providing a 16% increase for FY2004. Low DSH states were defined as those with DSH payments less than 3% of total Medicaid expenditures in FY2000, receiving a 16% increase in FY2004. State DSH allotments after FY2004 are set to be equal to FY2004 amounts, unless the pre-MMA calculation would result in a higher allotment. Allotments under the pre-MMA calculation would be higher, with DSH allotments for low DSH states increasing by 16% from FY2004 to FY2008. From FY2009 forward, low DSH states receive allotments based on the percentage change in the CPI-U, similar to non-low DSH states. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased the fixed DSH allotments for the District of Columbia for FY2000 to FY2002, resulting in a $20.0 million increase for FY2006. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily raised states' DSH allotments for FY2009 and FY2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 increased states' DSH allotments for FY2009 and FY2010 to 102.5% of the previous year's allotment. The provisions did not apply to states with higher DSH allotments without the Act. Post FY2010, DSH allotments returned to pre-ARRA levels. States cannot exceed state-specific aggregate limits for DSH payments to IMDs and mental health facilities. The state's DSH expenditures to IMDs and mental health facilities are limited to the lesser of FY1995 expenditures or the product of the current year's DSH allotment and applicable percentage. There is variation in DSH payments among states, with 84% allocated to hospitals and 16% to IMDs and mental health facilities. Nationally, 84% of Medicaid DSH expenditures go to hospitals. In FY2015, states allocated DSH expenditures to hospitals and IMDs/mental health facilities. Most states focused on hospitals, with some like Maine directing all DSH funds to IMDs/mental health facilities. DSH expenditures ranged from 0.1% to 16.9% of total Medicaid medical assistance expenditures in different states."
