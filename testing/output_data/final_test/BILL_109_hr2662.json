    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005\". Congress finds that violence motivated by race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability is a serious national problem that disrupts communities and is inadequately addressed by existing federal law. State and local authorities prosecute the majority of these crimes but could benefit from greater federal assistance. Violence motivated by bias devastates victims, their families, friends, and communities. It affects interstate commerce by impeding movement, forcing relocation, hindering purchases, employment, and commercial activities. Perpetrators cross state lines to commit such violence. Violence motivated by bias utilizes interstate commerce to facilitate its commission. It is historically linked to slavery and involuntary servitude, targeting individuals based on race, color, or ancestry. Eliminating racially motivated violence is crucial in eradicating the remnants of slavery. To eliminate the remnants of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults based on real or perceived religions or national origins, as certain groups were historically perceived as distinct races. Federal jurisdiction over bias-motivated violent crimes allows authorities to address such incidents effectively. The seriousness and interstate nature of bias-motivated crimes warrant Federal assistance for investigation and prosecution, enabling collaboration between Federal, State, and local authorities. The Act defines \"hate crime\" in alignment with the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It also supports criminal investigations and prosecutions by state and local law enforcement officials. The Attorney General may provide various forms of assistance in criminal investigations or prosecutions of violent crimes or felonies motivated by prejudice based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability at the request of a State or Indian tribe law enforcement official. The Attorney General may prioritize providing assistance for hate crimes committed by offenders in multiple states or rural jurisdictions with limited resources. Grants can be awarded to help cover the extraordinary expenses of investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, with a focus on addressing the concerns of all affected parties. Each State seeking a grant under this subsection must submit an application to the Attorney General within a specified 60-day period, meeting the requirements set forth by the Attorney General. To apply for assistance under this subsection, a State or tribal official must describe the need for the grant, certify lack of resources for investigating or prosecuting hate crimes, demonstrate consultation with victim services programs. The Attorney General must approve or disapprove grant applications within 30 business days. Grants cannot exceed $100,000 for a single jurisdiction in a year. A report must be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2006, detailing the grants. The Attorney General must approve grant applications within 30 days. Grants cannot exceed $100,000 per jurisdiction per year. A report on grant applications, awards, and expenditures must be submitted to Congress. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. SEC. 5. GRANT PROGRAM. The Office of Justice Programs will award grants to combat hate crimes by juveniles. Grants will support programs for training law enforcement in identifying, investigating, prosecuting, and preventing hate crimes. Authorization of appropriations is provided. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. Authorized appropriations for the Department of Treasury and Department of Justice, including the Community Relations Service, for fiscal years 2006-2008 to increase personnel to prevent and respond to hate crime violations under section 249 of title 18, US Code. The amendment to Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, introduces a new section on hate crime acts, specifying penalties for causing bodily harm based on race, color, religion, or national origin. Penalties include imprisonment up to 10 years, fines, or both, with harsher punishments for certain circumstances. The new section on hate crime acts in Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, imposes penalties for causing bodily harm based on certain factors, including death resulting from the offense or offenses involving kidnaping, sexual abuse, or attempted killing. The new section in Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, imposes penalties for using explosive or incendiary devices to cause bodily harm based on factors like religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. Penalties include imprisonment up to 10 years, fines, or both. If death results from the offense or if it involves kidnapping, sexual abuse, or attempted killing, the penalties increase to imprisonment for any term of years or life, fines, or both. The new section in Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code, imposes penalties for aggravated sexual abuse, attempted killing, or using interstate commerce. The defendant must use a channel of interstate or foreign commerce, employ a weapon that has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or interfere with the victim's commercial activity to be penalized under the new section in Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code. The new section in Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code requires certification from the Attorney General for prosecution of offenses involving discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. The defendant must have used interstate or foreign commerce channels or weapons, or interfered with commercial activity of the victim. The new section in Chapter 13 of title 18, United States Code requires certification from the Attorney General for prosecution of offenses involving discrimination based on various factors. The State or local law enforcement officials can consult regarding prosecution, and if certain conditions are met, the Federal Government can assume jurisdiction. Definitions for 'explosive or incendiary device' and 'firearm' are provided in the section. The term 'gender identity' is defined as actual or perceived gender-related characteristics in this chapter. In a prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence of expression or associations of the defendant may not be introduced as substantive evidence at trial, unless it specifically relates to that offense. SEC. 8 of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act is amended to include \"gender and gender identity\" in the statistics. SEC. 9 states that if any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
