    "content": "The \"Guaranteeing Airport Physical Screening Standards Act of 2005\" requires screening of all individuals and property entering secure areas of an airport. The \"Guaranteeing Airport Physical Screening Standards Act of 2005\" mandates physical screening for metal objects and random screenings at airport entrances until full compliance with the requirements is achieved. Random screenings and inspections, as mandated by the \"Guaranteeing Airport Physical Screening Standards Act of 2005,\" must ensure the level of protection specified in the act and be conducted unannounced 24 hours a day. SEC. 3. The Secretary of Homeland Security can hire necessary screeners for aviation security. Authorization of appropriations is provided. SEC. 4. Addresses airport site access and perimeter security. The sense of Congress is that security directives issued by the Acting Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration in 2004 are an improvement but not enough for airport access controls. The Secretary of Homeland Security must require airport personnel accessing sterile areas to undergo security screening equivalent to passengers within 6 months of this Act. Waivers may be granted on an airport-by-airport basis with notification to Congress. Waivers may be granted on an airport-by-airport basis for up to 7 days, with multiple waivers allowed. The Secretary must estimate when airports will comply with regulations. Background checks for unescorted airport personnel include fingerprint-based criminal history checks or checks of the National Criminal Information Center. The Criminal Information Center requires background checks for airport personnel, including local criminal history checks, verification of previous employment, and identity verification. This applies to all airport personnel hired more than 3 months after the enactment of the Act. The Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a report to Congress by January 31, 2006. The report due by January 31, 2006, must include ongoing efforts and timelines for developing uniform screening standards for airport personnel, assessing technologies for securing airport perimeters, and conducting vulnerability assessments. No new authority is granted to individuals without regular access to secure areas before the Act's enactment. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to airport security, including the sterile area, secure area, and airport personnel."
