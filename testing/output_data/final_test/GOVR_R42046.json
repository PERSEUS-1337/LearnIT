    "content": "The Horn of Africa region is experiencing its worst drought in 60 years, affecting over 13.3 million people, with 4 million in acute need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions in Somalia have led to a refugee crisis in Kenya and Ethiopia. Despite efforts by the US and international community, needs may not be met until 2012. Key priorities include food, water, health, and protection. The US has been the largest donor, providing over $650.5 million in FY2011 and nearly $220 million in FY2012. Long-term responses are also being developed. The humanitarian emergency in the Horn of Africa region, exacerbated by factors like poor infrastructure and internal unrest, gained international attention in 2011. The 112th Congress has been addressing the crisis through hearings, legislation, and correspondence with the Administration. The drought in the region reached crisis levels in July 2011, leading to a famine declaration for southern Somalia by the United Nations. Congress is expected to continue monitoring and responding to events in the Horn. In early August and September, the United Nations identified additional areas in southern Somalia affected by drought. The crisis was elevated to a major emergency in July, leading to increased resources and focus within UNOCHA. By mid-November, three famine areas improved to pre-famine levels due to international assistance despite access constraints in Somalia. The response to the famine in Somalia relies on local and international partners with long-term presence in the region. Famine persists in three areas, while 4 million Somalis are in acute food crisis. The drought crisis status has been reclassified to emergency, with 250,000 at risk of starvation. The October-December 2011 rains brought relief but also caused flooding and displacement in some areas. The heavy rains in some areas caused flooding and displacement, impacting relief efforts and creating logistical problems. Security issues along the Kenya-Somali border and within the Dadaab refugee camp complex, as well as restrictions on humanitarian access in Somalia by Al Shabaab, continue to hinder relief efforts. The situation in the Horn of Africa remains the worst humanitarian crisis in the world due to the combined impact of drought and ongoing conflicts. The humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa, worsened by drought and conflict, is expected to continue into 2012. Experts warn that drought conditions may worsen during the dry season, leading to a heightened need for sustained international attention and funding. Regional instability is fueled by poor governance, corruption, and border disputes, with easy access to small arms exacerbating insecurity. The countries in the Horn of Africa face regional and localized insecurity due to the presence of terrorist groups. These countries rank poorly on freedom indexes and struggle with development challenges, being among the world's poorest. The majority of the population relies on agriculture or nomadic pastoralism, making them vulnerable to drought and food insecurity. Humanitarian crisis in the region is exacerbated by poor planning and policies. The humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa is worsened by poor planning and policies, making populations more vulnerable to drought. The international community has established early warning systems and safety nets to mitigate the impact of poor climate conditions. Rising food and fuel prices have left many families struggling, while poor infrastructure and insecurity limit humanitarian access in some areas, particularly in Somalia. Terrorism, piracy, human trafficking, and famine in southern Somalia are symptoms of the wider instability that has plagued the country since 1991. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia, established in 2004, has struggled to provide security and basic services outside of Mogadishu. Factional fighting between TFG-allied forces, Al Shabaab, and clan-based militias continues, hindering efforts to expand TFG's authority. A roadmap towards a new constitution and elections in 2012 was agreed upon in a UN-sponsored meeting, but many analysts doubt the TFG's ability to extend its authority beyond Mogadishu in the near future. The roadmap aims to expand the TFG's authority beyond Mogadishu, but doubts remain about its feasibility. AMISOM supports the TFG in Somalia, with US backing. In Kenya, droughts in 2011 led to food and fuel price hikes, affecting millions. Ethiopia, with over 90 million people, faces internal unrest and frequent drought despite recent economic growth. The government continues to deal with ethnic insurgencies, including in the Ogaden region near Somalia. The 2010 elections were deemed peaceful but did not meet international standards. The United States views Ethiopia as an important ally in a region marked by violence and instability, despite concerns about human rights and democracy. Eritrea gained independence in 1991 after a 30-year armed struggle against Ethiopia and is considered one of the most authoritarian countries in the world. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about Eritrea's human rights record, its role in Somalia, and border disputes with Djibouti and Ethiopia. Eritrea is under a U.N. arms embargo for reported efforts to destabilize the region, including Somalia. The U.S. has criticized Eritrea for being a repressive regime that fails to address humanitarian needs. Eritrean officials deny reports of a humanitarian crisis, stating they have food reserves. Djibouti gained independence from France in 1977 and is a small, arid country. Djibouti gained independence from France in June 1977. Hassan Gouled Aptidon, the first head of state, brought stability and a moderate standard of living. The country faces challenges due to a large number of refugees from Somalia and Ethiopia. Djibouti hosts U.S. and French military forces, contributing to the economy and providing employment. The country benefits from a busy international port and strong economic ties with Arab Gulf states. The United States considers Djibouti an important regional partner in counterterrorism efforts. UNOCHA estimates 13.3 million people in the Horn Region need assistance, with 250,000 at risk of starvation. The crisis has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths, with hundreds dying daily, including many children. UNICEF estimates one child dies every six minutes. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates one child is dying every six minutes in the crisis caused by drought and conflict in southern and central Somalia. The U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) Famine Early Warning System (FEWS NET) reports crop failures, loss of livelihoods, population displacement, and famine in the region due to late and erratic rains. Food prices have soared with staple food prices rising by 240% in Somalia, 100% in Ethiopia, and 51% in Kenya. Diesel prices also increased significantly. Critical services like transport, health facilities, food distribution, and water trucking are impacted by fuel price increases in Somalia and Kenya. High malnutrition levels are reported in northern and eastern Kenya, southern Ethiopia, and central and southern Somalia. Poor families struggle to afford food and fuel, leading to internal and cross-border migration. Some regions are experiencing improved rainfall, easing pastoral resource shortages. Food security is expected to stabilize in areas like southern and southeastern Ethiopia, with above-normal rains in Kenya indicating potential improvements. The rains have been above normal, indicating likely improvements in pastoral conditions and crop production. However, food insecurity is expected to persist in the Horn countries into 2012, particularly in southern Somalia. In Ethiopia, above average food needs are likely to persist, with about 4 million people still requiring humanitarian assistance. In Kenya, poor rainfall in the northeast suggests that food needs will be above average. In Somalia, famine is expected to persist into January-February due to high food prices, limited crop production, and assistance gaps. Food assistance needs in February 2012 will remain far above typical levels. Population movements occur within affected countries or to nearby countries in crises. Vulnerable populations include IDPs in Somalia, newly arrived refugees in Ethiopia and Kenya, and civilians. Humanitarian agencies are concerned about health issues among vulnerable populations in Somalia and refugee camps in Kenya. Preventing diseases like measles, cholera, and malaria is crucial due to poor sanitation, limited safe water, and overcrowded living conditions. The fatality rate, especially among children, is high. Immunization against measles in Somalia is low. Refugees arriving at reception centers are closely monitored for any health issues. The outbreak of diseases like measles and acute watery diarrhea is affecting IDPs in Somalia, exacerbated by the rainy season and flooding. Continuing insecurity and drought have disproportionately impacted the country, with roughly 4 million people in need of food, water, vaccinations, and healthcare. This includes nearly 1.5 million Somali IDPs. In Somalia, over 300 IDP camps in Mogadishu house at least 370,000 IDPs, with restricted access due to Al Shabaab insurgency hindering aid delivery. Many have fled to refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. Despite improvements, vulnerable populations still face the risk of famine resurgence in 2012. Assistance efforts in 2012 focus on providing life-saving aid, protecting livelihoods, and strengthening protection for vulnerable populations in Somalia. The humanitarian community is finding innovative ways to reach hard-to-access areas. Instability in Somalia has worsened the regional humanitarian situation, with nearly one million Somali refugees in neighboring countries. Somali refugees continue to arrive at camps in Kenya and Ethiopia at a rate of approximately 3,300 per day. Refugees from Somalia were arriving at camps in Kenya and Ethiopia at a rate of approximately 3,300 per day, with many in critical condition and children particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. The numbers dropped drastically in Ethiopia by mid-August for unknown reasons, while in mid-September, the influx in Kenya slowed to 1,100 per day and ranged from 350 to none in Ethiopia. In Yemen, 3,700 Somalis arrived by boat in August, the highest monthly influx in 2011. The Dollo Ado refugee camp in Ethiopia near the Somali border has tripled in size in 2011, currently hosting nearly 140,000 refugees. Kenya's Dadaab refugee complex is the largest in the world, with four sites hosting nearly 140,000 refugees. Established 20 years ago, some families have lived there for two decades, including over 6,000 third-generation refugees. Originally built for 90,000 refugees, Dadaab now houses almost half a million people, making it the country's fourth-largest population center. Nairobi and Kakuma also host tens of thousands of Somali refugees. The Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya, near the South Sudan border, hosts tens of thousands of Somali refugees. Rising insecurity led to the suspension of aid efforts in October 2011. Security threats and heavy rains continue to limit aid delivery. Overcrowding is a problem with 463,000 registered refugees. Relocation of refugees has been suspended due to insecurity. UNHCR and partners are working to find solutions to continue operations beyond life-saving assistance. The 2012 humanitarian response in Kenya will focus on addressing acute needs like drought, floods, refugee crisis, and building resilience in communities. Over 3.75 million people in Kenya are in need of food assistance due to the drought. Flooding displaced 80,000 people in various parts of the country, but the waters have since subsided. Kenya and Ethiopia are concerned about the economic impact of these crises. Kenya and Ethiopia are facing challenges with refugees crossing their borders, leading to strain on local resources and tensions with host communities. Reports indicate refugees are vulnerable to violence and criminal targeting. Kenya has been accused of forcibly returning refugees to Somalia, which goes against international refugee conventions. In 2011, Kenya launched a military offensive into Somalia. The Kenyan government launched a military offensive into Somalia to defend against terrorist threats from Al Shabaab. Kenya's operation is supported by the TFG and African regional authorities, aiming to create a buffer zone and promote refugee returns. Al Shabaab has threatened retaliation, causing concerns about humanitarian impact in southern Somalia. The United Nations and the United States are actively involved in the region. The United States is heavily involved in the humanitarian response in the Horn of Africa, with major U.N. relief agencies, international NGOs, and other organizations operating relief projects in the region. International recovery efforts require coordination among various actors and entities, including U.N. agencies, international organizations, NGOs, PVOs, and donors. Humanitarian clusters are established during crises to coordinate partners and prioritize resources. In the Horn of Africa region, humanitarian clusters led by aid agencies or government ministries coordinate partners and prioritize resources during crises. In Somalia and Ethiopia, U.N.-led clusters focus on activities like food aid, health, shelter, and protection. In Kenya, the government is responsible for clusters, while in Djibouti, a U.N. Development Program focal point is assigned. In the Horn of Africa region, humanitarian clusters are led by aid agencies or government ministries to coordinate partners and prioritize resources during crises. The largest presence of the Regional Head of Office for UNOCHA is in Nairobi, Kenya, to gain access to Somalia. U.N. agencies have staff in all affected countries, with humanitarian coordinators leading U.N. Country Teams in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The World Food Program estimates that over 13 million people in the Horn are in need of food and humanitarian assistance, with 9.6 million identified for near-term food aid. Currently, WFP is providing food assistance to about 7.4 million drought-affected people in the region. The World Food Program (WFP) is facing funding challenges in its humanitarian relief efforts in the Horn of Africa, with $250 million of a $760 million operation remaining unfunded as of September 15, 2011. In Kenya, WFP is transitioning to recovery activities like food-for-assets and cash-for-assets programs to help communities manage and recover from drought. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) organized an emergency meeting in Rome on July 25, 2011. The United Nations organized an emergency meeting in Rome on July 25, 2011, to address the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa. The meeting focused on the need for a \"twin-track\" program to avert the crisis and build long-term food security in the region. FAO is currently operating relief and early recovery programs in all affected countries, focusing on restoring crop production capacity through the distribution of agricultural inputs and technical assistance. The United Nations organized an emergency meeting in Rome on July 25, 2011, to address the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa. FAO is currently providing relief and early recovery programs in all affected countries, focusing on restoring crop production capacity through the distribution of agricultural inputs and technical assistance. Other donor coordination initiatives include pledges of aid from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the African Union. A Ministerial Mini-Summit on the Humanitarian Response in the Horn of Africa resulted in new pledges of humanitarian aid totaling more than $218 million. Somalia faces challenges for humanitarian aid organizations due to poor infrastructure and insecurity. The country's infrastructure is damaged from conflict, with limited ports and coordination for aid. Al Shabaab obstructs aid delivery and threatens relief efforts, making South-central Somalia one of the most hostile environments for aid workers. In Somalia, Al Shabaab hinders aid delivery through attacks on civilians and aid convoys, extortion, and threats. The security situation has forced many aid groups to leave Al Shabaab-controlled areas, with the World Food Programme suspending operations in the south in 2010 due to growing threats and intimidation. Al Shabaab banned WFP from areas under its control due to alleged hidden agendas and accused the United Nations of exaggerating the severity of the drought. Despite restrictions, WFP scaled up assistance in Somalia, opening new routes by land and air to serve famine-stricken areas. Food aid airlifts to Mogadishu and a new logistics corridor through Ethiopia were established. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has increased food aid delivery to 1.1 million southern Somalis affected by drought and conflict. Other relief organizations continue operations in Al Shabaab-controlled areas through local partners. The United States and other donors support cash-for-work programs. The United States and other donors are providing support for cash-for-work and voucher programs in areas with limited access. Efforts to reach affected populations in southern Somalia with food aid have been effective in reducing famine conditions, but concerns have been raised about new Al Shabaab restrictions impacting relief efforts. Al Shabaab has banned 16 U.N. agencies and international NGOs, which could seriously affect life-saving operations in their areas. Donor funding for the Horn of Africa crisis mainly goes to U.N. appeals. The United Nations issued appeals for emergency financial assistance in Somalia, Kenya, and Djibouti, totaling over $2.42 billion by the end of 2010. $2.1 billion in commitments and contributions had been received by January 5, 2012. The U.N. Central Emergency Response Fund released $128.2 million in 2011 for immediate humanitarian needs in the region. In December 2011, consolidated appeals for 2012 were launched for Somalia, Kenya, and Djibouti. The Somalia 2012 Consolidated Appeal includes 350 projects from 148 organizations and requires $1.5 billion to respond to the most urgent life-saving needs of 4 million people. The 2012 Kenya Emergency Humanitarian Response Plan (EHRP) appeal seeks $764 million to address humanitarian needs and build resilience to disasters. The 2012 Djibouti Consolidated Appeal seeks $79.1 million to assist vulnerable households and refugees affected by drought. The funding appeal for humanitarian assistance in the Horn of Africa has not been finalized yet, with a completion expected in late January 2012. Non-appeal committed funding totaled over $928 million as of January 5, 2012, with additional pledges from traditional and non-traditional donors like the United States, United Kingdom, Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) members, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates, along with other countries, have responded to the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa. The funding situation is complex, with a mix of appeal and non-appeal based contributions. However, a complete record of international contributions is not available due to delays and difficulties in valuing in-kind contributions. While aid agencies blame Al Shabaab for hindering assistance in Somalia, some criticize Western donors for initially not providing enough resources. Despite improvements in funding in the short term, concerns persist about sustaining support throughout the crisis. The U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea reported that Al Shabaab is the main obstacle to humanitarian access in Somalia. Exogenous factors like decreased international funding and donor regulations also contribute to the challenging environment. Despite some improvements in funding, concerns remain about sustaining support through the crisis expected to last into 2012. In 2010, there was an overall decrease in international funding for humanitarian assistance to Somalia. USAID launched the Famine, War, Drought (FWD) relief campaign in September 2011 to increase public engagement. The U.S. government is collaborating with NGOs, the United Nations, and diaspora communities to raise awareness and seek private donations to address the crisis. The focus is not only on short-term response but also on building capacity to prevent future famines in the region. In coordination with the international community, the U.S. government has prepositioned food stocks, increased funding for early warning systems, and provided assistance in health, water, and sanitation sectors in the Horn region. USAID activated a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and set up a task force to coordinate the humanitarian response to the drought crisis. The U.S. government is the largest bilateral donor of emergency assistance in the eastern Horn of Africa. In FY2011 and FY2012, the United States provided significant humanitarian assistance to the Horn of Africa, with a focus on emergency food aid. USAID reported allocating $650.5 million in FY2011, with $435.2 million for food aid. In FY2012, $220 million was allocated, with $194 million for food aid. This aid supported the distribution of 492,530 metric tons of food in FY2011 and 144,880 metric tons in FY2012. The U.S. primarily provided food aid through Food for Peace Title II and International Disaster Assistance. Additionally, the U.S. is working on long-term aid strategies to help build safety net programs and develop agricultural sectors in the region. In the Horn of Africa, the United States is providing assistance through programs like Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program and USAID's Feed the Future to develop agricultural sectors and address hunger. In Kenya, the U.S. is supporting agricultural development programs focusing on staple food value chains, livestock, rural finance, policy analysis, and water and sanitation. Aid delivery in Somalia is hindered by donor restrictions, including U.S. sanctions, which may benefit Al Shabaab, a designated terrorist organization. Al Shabaab earns revenue through taxation in southern Somalia and does not exempt aid agencies from its revenue generation efforts. Al Shabaab in Somalia demands fees and bribes from aid agencies, steals aid shipments, and benefits from transport contracts. Aid agencies fear prosecution in the U.S. for providing material support to terrorists. Questions arose in 2009 about the need for licenses for humanitarian programs in Somalia under U.S. sanctions regulations. Several USAID grantees in Somalia expressed concerns about reporting violations to the U.S. government, leading to stalled humanitarian aid delivery in south-central Somalia. NGOs funded by USAID in northern Somalia were restricted from operating in Al Shabaab-controlled areas. In southern Somalia, grant processing for new programs was suspended for nearly eight months in FY2011, despite warnings about the crisis. Some Members of Congress sought clarification on sanctions-licensing and aid delivery policies in Somalia. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on aid delivery in August 2011. The U.N. Security Council has targeted individuals and entities threatening peace in Somalia since 2008. Member states must block entry or transit of designated individuals and entities and freeze their funds and assets. Al Shabaab and its leaders are among those designated. In March 2010, the Security Council authorized member states to release funds for humanitarian assistance in Somalia. The Security Council extended the humanitarian exemption in Somalia to address the crisis and obstacles to aid delivery. They condemned obstruction of aid and attacks on humanitarian workers, expanding the embargo to target individuals and entities threatening peace and stability. The UN Security Council extended the humanitarian exemption in Somalia to address the crisis and obstacles to aid delivery. They condemned obstruction of aid and attacks on humanitarian workers, expanding the embargo to target individuals and entities threatening peace and stability. The latest resolution also reinforces member states' authority to provide humanitarian assistance through July 2012, urging an end to the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea is subject to a Security Council-ordered arms embargo for its conflict with Djibouti, efforts to undermine peace in Somalia, and failure to comply with the arms embargo on Somalia. The Security Council condemned Eritrea's support for armed groups undermining peace in Somalia and the region, demanding Eritrea to cease destabilizing efforts, including taxing its diaspora and exploiting its mining sector. Sanctions were threatened against violators of peace standards. The Security Council condemned Eritrea's support for armed groups in Somalia and the region, demanding it to cease destabilizing efforts. The Secretary-General is required to report on Eritrea's activities within six months, potentially leading to more punitive U.N. measures. The United States typically leads and contributes to humanitarian relief efforts, but finding resources to sustain aid pledges may be challenging amid budget deficits. Finding resources to sustain U.S. aid pledges may be difficult, as seen after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the earthquake in Haiti. Some Members of Congress expressed concern about funding depletion for disaster relief, but accounts were restored through supplemental appropriations. In Haiti, relief funding reimbursed previous aid provided. The U.S. international relief and development agencies, along with hunger advocacy groups, are concerned about cuts in funds for international food aid. The FY2011 continuing resolution reduced international food aid by over 18%. Congress may reevaluate U.S. assistance priorities to the Horn of Africa. H.R. 2112 provides U.S. food aid. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012 allocates $1.466 billion for U.S. food aid in FY2012, $31 million less than FY2011. H.R. 2055 (P.L. 112-74) appropriates $5.520 billion for development assistance in FY2012, $30 million more than FY2011. The Senate report calls for $1.3 billion for the Feed the Future Initiative. International Disaster and Famine Assistance appropriations increased by over $100 million in FY2012. The U.N. Sanctions Monitoring Group on Somalia raised concerns about large-scale diversion of food aid by WFP in 2010. WFP has improved accountability and transparency in food distribution, especially in Mogadishu. Recent reports of food aid diversion in Mogadishu are being investigated by WFP to ensure accountability and tracking of food assistance. The scale of diversion is unknown, but there are allegations of significant theft. The Obama Administration issued new guidance to prevent aid theft in Somalia. The Treasury Department has not extended a general license for humanitarian operations in Al Shabaab-controlled areas, but aid organizations can apply for specific licenses. The NGO community welcomes the efforts to ease legal restrictions on U.S.-funded programs. The Obama Administration issued new guidance to prevent aid theft in Somalia, with concerns that aid groups might face penalties under U.S. sanctions for inadvertently benefiting Al Shabaab. NGOs operating in Somalia must ensure compliance with U.S. legal requirements, but the current framework lacks authorization for transactions necessary for aid delivery in Al Shabaab-controlled areas. The drought in the Horn of Africa has drawn global attention, with governments and organizations seeking donor contributions. There are challenges in delivering aid in Al Shabaab-controlled areas due to lack of authorization and concerns about inadvertently benefiting the terrorist group. The crisis has sparked discussions on incorporating humanitarian concerns into the terrorist designation process and licensing of relief efforts. The drought in the Horn of Africa has led to the worst international humanitarian crisis. Funding challenges exist due to uncertainties in donor contributions and the need to maintain funding priorities amid a global economic downturn. The United States is the largest donor in the Horn of Africa humanitarian crisis, facing budgetary pressures. The crisis is prolonged by internal conflicts and weather uncertainties. Delivering aid in Somalia is complicated by factors like piracy and banditry. The United States and its international partners are working to deliver aid in Somalia despite challenges such as pirates, bandits, terrorists, and poor infrastructure. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) aims to support dialogue, provide protection to government institutions, and assist in training Somali security forces. Resolution 1863 expressed the intent to establish a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation in Somalia as a follow-on force to AMISOM. The UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 63/275A to establish a Special Account for supporting AMISOM. Resolution 1964 (2010) authorized an increase in AMISOM's troop size to 12,000 and extended its mandate until October 31, 2012. The resolution supported the development of a guard force within AMISOM to provide security and protection services to the international community. The Horn of Africa is a highly unstable region plagued by civil wars, political turmoil, famine, and terrorist threats. Humanitarian crises are exacerbated by internal conflicts, poverty, and scarce resources. Adjustments to AMISOM troop levels may be necessary as the mission progresses. The Horn of Africa faces instability due to factors like poverty, unemployment, and conflicts with neighboring countries. Despite peace agreements, ongoing wars persist, such as between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Somalia remains in anarchy despite attempts at peace agreements. Ethiopia intervened in Somalia in 2006 to install the Transitional Federal Government. In June 2006, Ethiopia intervened in Somalia to oust the CIC and install the TFG in Mogadishu, leading to increased instability. Somalia has faced conflict and famine since the collapse of the central government in 1991, resulting in an estimated 300,000 deaths during the civil war. The United Nations established UNOSOM I in 1992 to provide humanitarian relief, but security concerns hindered operations, leading to a request for military support. In December 1992, the United Nations and United States authorized military support for humanitarian operations in Somalia under U.S. command. President George H. W. Bush deployed 25,000 U.S. troops as part of Operation Restore Hope, which experts believe saved many lives. President Bill Clinton later reduced American involvement, and the Council expanded the operation in March 1993. In January 1993, American involvement in Somalia was reduced. In March 1993, the UN Operation in Somalia was expanded and designated as UNOSOM II. The US transferred command to UNOSOM II, but US troops remained. The deaths of 18 American soldiers in October 1993 led to the end of US participation in peacekeeping in Somalia. US troops left in March 1994, and UNOSOM II ended its mission in spring 1995. In October 2002, a peace process was launched by IGAD to end factional fighting in Somalia. In August 2004, a 275-member Somali Transitional Parliament was inaugurated in Kenya. In October 2004, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed was elected as the new president of Somalia. In June 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) took control of Mogadishu. Ethiopian troops captured Mogadishu in December 2006. Fighting intensified in 2008 between insurgent groups and Ethiopian-Somali Transitional Federal Government forces. President Yusuf resigned in late December 2008. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad was elected president in January 2009. In January 2009, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad was elected as president of the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS). Ethiopian forces completed their withdrawal from Somalia. The United States has been actively engaged in the Horn of Africa region for over 50 years, playing key roles in conflict resolution and providing humanitarian assistance. U.S. engagement in Somalia has been marginal compared to its involvement in Ethiopia and other countries in the region. Relations between Eritrea and the United States are poor, while relations between Ethiopia and the United States are strong. Some Members of Congress have criticized Ethiopia's human rights record and handling of elections. Congress has been actively involved in the Horn of Africa, passing legislation to address the humanitarian crisis in Somalia in 1992. Senator Nancy Kassebaum advocated for increased U.S. engagement in Somalia. Nancy Kassebaum advocated for increased U.S. engagement in Somalia and recommended the United Nations appoint a Special Envoy. The Select Committee on Hunger and Congress have been active in addressing political, humanitarian, and human rights issues in the Horn of Africa region. The U.S. Government is a leader in providing relief efforts for international disasters. The President has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters, with the U.S. government leading relief efforts through various agencies. Humanitarian assistance includes urgent food, shelter, and medical aid, with funds used for services or grants to international organizations and NGOs. The U.S. government, through agencies like USAID, coordinates with international organizations, governments of disaster-affected countries, NGOs, and PVOs to provide humanitarian assistance. USAID's OFDA in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance offers immediate relief and can deploy Disaster Assistance Response Teams quickly. It has the authority to borrow resources from other parts of USAID and federal agencies. The U.S. government administers humanitarian aid through agencies like USAID, which includes Food For Peace (FFP) for emergency food aid and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) for post-disaster transition assistance. The Department of Defense (DOD) also provides humanitarian support through programs like the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP) and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). The U.S. government provides humanitarian aid through agencies like USAID, which includes Food For Peace (FFP) for emergency food aid and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) for post-disaster transition assistance. The President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters, and may use the Denton program for transportation of humanitarian goods. Assistance is provided for 30 to 90 days after a disaster, with continued support through other channels like regular country development programs of USAID and State Department programs for refugees and the displaced. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) provides flexibility for the President to respond to refugee emergencies. The U.S. government provides humanitarian aid through agencies like USAID, including assistance for refugees and displaced populations. The President has authority to respond to refugee emergencies using the Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA). Legislation in the 112th Congress focused on the Horn of Africa crisis, commending U.S. contributions and promoting stability in Somalia. The resolution calls for continued U.S. government resources to alleviate poverty and hunger in the region. It was introduced in July 2011 and referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The House passed the Agriculture Appropriations Act in June 2011, allocating funds for Food for Peace Title II grants. The Senate recommended an increased appropriation of $1,562,000,000 citing the famine in the Horn of Africa region. The Senate passed a bill on November 1, 2011, appropriating $1,466,000,000 for Food for Peace Title II grants. The conferees expressed concern about the limited funding due to the famine in the Horn of Africa region. The amount was $200,000,000 less than requested by the President and below past grant appropriations. Constraints from the Budget Control Act of 2011 were cited. Plans were made to monitor conditions in Africa and take necessary steps if conditions change. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 allocated $150 million for international disaster assistance to respond to crises in conflict-affected areas like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen, and the Horn of Africa. The funds were designated for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. The U.S. allocated $150 million for international disaster assistance in conflict-affected areas like the Horn of Africa. USAID provides information and links for donations and crisis response efforts. The curr_chunk provides detailed information about the crisis in the Horn of Africa, including official statements, fact sheets, and maps from various organizations such as the U.S. government, Famine Early Warning Systems Network, United Nations, and UNICEF. Various organizations are providing aid in the Horn of Africa crisis, including UNICEF, UNHCR, OCHA, WFP, and the Red Cross Movement. Other resources like Action Against Hunger are also involved. Various organizations are providing aid in the Horn of Africa crisis, including UNICEF, UNHCR, OCHA, WFP, and the Red Cross Movement.
