    "content": "FOIA allows requests for agency information to be submitted in various formats like mail, email, web form, or fax. It mandates the disclosure of certain agency information and outlines how agencies should respond to requests, including response time, cost recovery, and exemptions from public disclosure. FOIA mandates agencies to disclose information upon request, with response time guidelines. Agencies may exempt information from disclosure under nine exemptions. Requests may be processed within 20 days, with possible extensions for complex requests. Responses may include providing requested information, redacted information, stating no responsive records, or denying requests based on exemptions. Requesters can appeal adverse decisions. Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways: certain information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration, and processes for locating information may change due to remote work or administrative leave. FOIA requests can be expedited if the requester demonstrates a compelling need, defined as a threat to life or physical safety, or an urgency to inform the public about federal government activities. Agencies may also expedite FOIA requests as soon as practicable. Government agencies may establish additional standards for granting expedited processing of FOIA requests. They must respond to most requests within 20 days and decide on expedited processing within 10 days. Searching for information in response to FOIA requests may require manual review as not all information is available digitally. There is no central office handling FOIA requests for all federal departments, with various officials working to ensure the process runs smoothly. As of March 26, 2020, CRS identified statements by 13 agencies regarding COVID-19's impact on FOIA requests. Due to COVID-19, some or all members of an agency's FOIA team may be working offsite, affecting the availability of paper records for requests. Challenges in locating information may vary among agencies during the outbreak. Table 1 presents recent statements from 13 agencies on the impact of COVID-19 on FOIA request processing. 8 agencies changed the method of submitting FOIA requests, some mention delays due to COVID-19. 6 agencies have additional allowances for expediting requests. Five of the six agencies have established additional allowances for expediting FOIA requests, with reasons including impacts on due process rights, public confidence, humanitarian needs, and discretion of the FOIA Officer."
