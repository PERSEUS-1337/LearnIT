Additionally, liability protections are provided for operators under this new domain. SEC. 5. LIABILITY PROTECTIONS. Operators of the new domain are not considered publishers of content provided by others. They are not liable for restricting access to harmful material for minors or providing technical means to do so. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. Any person violating section 4 or requirements for registrants in the new domain under section 2(b) will face civil penalties set by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary has the power to enforce these provisions, conduct audits for compliance, and collect civil penalties. The Secretary of Commerce will conduct outreach to publicize the availability of the new domain. The program will start within 30 days of the domain becoming operational.
