The Act \"Next Generation Radiation Screening Act of 2008\" introduces new sections in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, emphasizing the catastrophic consequences of radiological or nuclear terrorism and the importance of the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) system in screening passengers and cargo for such materials. It highlights the continuous need for improvement in the ASP system and the potential limitations of delaying its deployment for additional functionality. The Act emphasizes the need for the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) system in screening for radiological or nuclear materials. It calls for an agreement on the minimum functionality of ASP for deployment by Customs and Border Protection, with a report to Congress required within 60 days. \"Criteria for certification under SEC. 1909 are outlined.\" Congress finds that special consideration should be given to the challenges of detecting illicit radiological or nuclear material in the presence of naturally occurring radiation or legitimate sources. The Secretary is required to certify operational effectiveness before funds can be used for full-scale procurement of the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal. The Secretary must certify operational effectiveness before full-scale procurement of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal Monitors. Separate certifications are required for primary and secondary deployment, addressing unique operational requirements. The Secretary is also mandated to develop quantitative metrics, in consultation with the National Academies, to demonstrate increased operational effectiveness of deploying the ASP in Primary and Secondary. The ASP deployment in Primary and Secondary Screening sites must be certified for operational effectiveness by the Secretary. Metrics for certification include a quantitative definition of effectiveness, threat materials, masking scenarios, cost benefit analysis, and other relevant measures determined by the Director and Commissioner. External reviews are considered in the decision to certify the ASP. The Secretary may certify the ASP for operational effectiveness by considering reports from the Government Accountability Office, an assessment by the Independent Review Team, consultation with the National Academies, and any other relevant information. \"Authorization of Securing the Cities Initiative under SEC. 1910.\" Congress authorizes the Securing the Cities Initiative, which utilizes advanced radiation detection technology to detect nuclear and radiological material in urban areas. The initiative promotes collaboration among Federal, State, and local partners. $40,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009, with additional funding for subsequent years. The Securing the Cities Initiative utilizes advanced radiation detection technology to detect nuclear and radiological material in urban areas. Congress authorizes $40,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 with additional funding for subsequent years. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Sec. 1908-1910 cover advanced spectroscopic portal monitors, certification criteria, and authorization of the Securing the Cities Initiative. Passed by the House of Representatives on July 30, 2008."
