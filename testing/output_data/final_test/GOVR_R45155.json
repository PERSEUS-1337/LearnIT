    "content": "The issue of sexual harassment in the workplace has gained attention due to reports of harassment by high-level executives and employees. This report discusses legal issues related to sexual harassment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This report examines how the Supreme Court and federal appellate courts have defined the scope of protection under Title VII against sexual harassment, including the \"severe or pervasive\" standard for harassment claims. It also discusses limits on employer liability and retaliation for reporting harassment. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, but does not expressly prohibit harassment. Federal courts interpret Title VII to prohibit harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Harassment claims are framed as violations of Title VII's prohibition against a discriminatory and abusive work environment. The legal standard for analyzing harassment claims focuses on whether the conduct is \"severe or pervasive\" enough to create a hostile work environment. The legal standard for analyzing harassment claims under Title VII focuses on whether the alleged conduct is \"severe or pervasive\" enough to create an abusive or hostile work environment. To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must establish the elements of a hostile work environment and show a basis for holding the employer liable. Courts may also consider quid pro quo harassment in their analysis. The legal standard for analyzing harassment claims under Title VII focuses on whether the alleged conduct is \"severe or pervasive\" enough to create an abusive or hostile work environment. To prevail on such a claim, a plaintiff must establish the elements of a hostile work environment and show a basis for holding the employer liable. The last objective prong typically constitutes the most probing aspect of the analysis, where courts apply language from the Supreme Court decision, Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., to assess the severity or pervasiveness of the conduct. The legal standard for analyzing harassment claims under Title VII focuses on whether the alleged conduct is \"severe or pervasive\" enough to create an abusive or hostile work environment. The Court has emphasized that conduct must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment, to prevent Title VII from becoming a 'general civility code.' Simple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents will not usually amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment. Failure to show sufficient severity or pervasiveness is often the basis for dismissal of a Title VII harassment claim. Courts often dismiss Title VII harassment claims when the alleged conduct is not severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. The difficulty lies in determining the threshold for actionable harassment, with federal circuit courts showing variance in their interpretations. Appellate courts emphasize the frequency of the harassing conduct when applying the legal standard set by the Supreme Court in Harris. Appellate courts apply the \"severe or pervasive\" standard to harassment claims, focusing on the frequency, duration, and severity of the conduct. Courts readily find conduct severe when it involves rape, physical threats, solicitation for sex, touching intimate body parts, or regular verbal harassment. Despite similar facts, federal appellate case law shows divergent analyses. Selected cases demonstrate the application of the standard to egregious behavior, such as in Turner v. The Saloon, Ltd. In Turner v. The Saloon, Ltd., the Seventh Circuit found evidence of severe harassment, including grabbing genitals, asking for kisses, and inappropriate touching. In contrast, in LeGrand v. Area Resources for Community and Human Services, the Eighth Circuit deemed similar actions insufficient for a harassment claim. In Gerald v. University of Puerto Rico, the harasser's conduct included solicitation for sex and touching the victim's breast, deemed severe harassment. However, in Brooks v. City of San Mateo, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the harasser's actions, including touching the plaintiff's stomach and making sexual comments, did not constitute severe harassment. The court emphasized the conduct as \"highly reprehensible\" but characterized it as a single episode of harassment. In Turner, touching of an intimate body part weighed heavily in determining harassment severity. In LeGrand, the court viewed the conduct as \"manifestly inappropriate\" but only as \"three isolated incidents.\" The court in LeGrand characterized the conduct as \"manifestly inappropriate\" and consisting of \"three isolated incidents\" over a nine-month period, which was not deemed severe or pervasive enough to poison the plaintiff's work environment. Circuit precedent establishes minimum thresholds for actionable harassment, shaping recent analyses by determining what conduct is insufficient to meet the required severity or pervasiveness. The Fifth Circuit held in Shepherd v. Comptroller of Public Accounts of State of Texas that harassment involving remarks about the plaintiff's appearance and inappropriate physical contact did not amount to actionable conduct under Title VII. Despite criticism, courts still rely on Shepherd as precedent for conduct insufficient to create a hostile work environment. The legal standard for evaluating employer liability for workplace harassment under Title VII is based on Supreme Court decisions such as Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth. The plaintiff must establish a basis for holding the employer liable for the harassment, even if the conduct was found to be severe or pervasive. The legal standard for evaluating employer liability for workplace harassment under Title VII is based on Supreme Court decisions such as Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth. Liability for workplace harassment is not expressly included in Title VII, and employer liability depends on whether the harassing employee was a supervisor and if the harassment led to a \"tangible employment action.\" If the harasser was the victim's supervisor and the harassment resulted in a tangible employment action, the employer may be held liable. The Supreme Court decisions in Faragher and Ellerth established employer liability for workplace harassment. If the harassment led to a \"tangible employment action,\" the employer is strictly liable. If the harasser was a supervisor but the harassment did not result in a tangible employment action, the employer can use an affirmative defense. The Court noted that workplace harassment is facilitated by the employment context and a supervisor's power makes their conduct particularly threatening. The Court in Faragher and Ellerth established employer liability for workplace harassment, with strict liability for tangible employment actions. Despite the facilitation of harassment by the employment context, vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory authority requires more than just the existence of the agency relation. The Court established employer liability for workplace harassment, with strict liability for tangible employment actions. When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision against an employee, the employer is held accountable as the supervisor's actions are attributable to the employer for Title VII purposes. The Court established employer liability for workplace harassment, with strict liability for tangible employment actions. In cases where a supervisor's harassment does not result in a tangible employment action, the employer can still be vicariously liable but may raise an affirmative defense known as the Faragher-Ellerth defense. This defense requires the employer to establish specific elements by a preponderance of the evidence. The employer must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct any sexually harassing behavior, and that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventative or corrective opportunities. Circuit courts analyze employer liability under the negligence standard if the harasser was a co-worker, with the burden of proof on the plaintiff. Federal courts of appeals evaluate the applicability of the Faragher-Ellerth defense and whether the employer has provided sufficient evidence to establish both elements. The employer must show they took reasonable steps to prevent and address sexual harassment, and the employee failed to utilize available resources. This defense can absolve the employer of liability for supervisory harassment, regardless of its severity. Factors considered include the nature of the harassment, timeliness of response, investigation details, anti-harassment policies, and overall prevention efforts. The Tenth Circuit found that an employer, a sheriff's office, failed to satisfy the defense prong of preventing harassment, citing issues with the investigation conducted by an untrained detective who was a friend of the alleged harasser. The detective focused on gathering details about the plaintiff's sex life instead of the sexual assault allegations, leading to the sheriff halting the investigation. The harasser resigned, but the court ruled that this alone does not absolve liability. In a separate case, an employer's investigation found nonsexual harassment, but the court still held them liable. The employer failed to provide investigation results to plaintiffs, shared information with harasser, and allowed harasser to remain in plaintiffs' work area. Court acknowledged flaws in the investigation but noted that harassing behavior stopped when reported to upper management. The second prong of the defense examines the employer's procedures for reporting harassment and the plaintiff's actions. The court analyzed the plaintiff's delay in reporting harassment, considering her fear of retaliation and the supervisor's threats. The First Circuit found the plaintiff's one-year delay in reporting an assault reasonable, noting her young age and the supervisor's intimidation tactics. The supervisor threatened the employee with firing if she reported the assault, citing influential ties to the company owner. The Eighth Circuit ruled that the plaintiffs, police officers, acted unreasonably in their harassment case, rejecting their fears of retaliation and bias in the investigation. The court acknowledged the challenges of lodging complaints and the psychological burden involved. The court ruled that the plaintiffs' fear of retaliation did not excuse their delay in reporting harassment. Employer liability for harassment by a supervisor can be avoided with the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense, but for harassment by a co-worker, negligence in allowing the harassment to persist must be proven. Courts determine employer liability for harassment based on whether the employer knew or should have known of the offensive conduct and failed to take appropriate action. Reporting to designated management personnel counts as notice, but reporting to others may not. The enterprise must have a reasonable chance to respond to the information for liability to apply. The court will consider if the complainant had a reasonable chance to report the harassment to someone who could address it. Even if there was no formal report, if a manager witnessed the misconduct, it could still be considered notice. Employers cannot avoid liability by ignoring or not having proper procedures for reporting misconduct. Lack of mechanisms for reporting harassment may lead to constructive knowledge of the issue. Knowledge of harassment can be imputed to the employer even without direct evidence of a report or manager witnessing the harassment. In cases like Duch v. Jakubek and Hawkins v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., courts found that employers could be held liable for harassment if there is evidence that they should have known about it, even without a formal report. Employers cannot avoid liability by ignoring harassment or lacking proper reporting procedures. The court emphasized that even though the plaintiff had not reported individual incidents of harassment, she had complained about her co-worker's behavior and asked for a transfer. The harasser had a history of sexual harassment, showing that the employer should have been aware of the harassment. To establish negligence, the employer must take prompt and appropriate corrective action to end the harassment and prevent it from recurring. Employers must take actions to end current harassment and prevent future incidents in the workplace. In Berry v. Delta Airlines, the employer's prompt and appropriate response, including contacting the EEOC, conducting an investigation, and separating the harasser from the victim, was deemed sufficient by the court. Despite the plaintiff's argument for more actions, such as earlier separation or discussion sessions, courts have ruled that similar responses were inadequate in other cases. Employers must take prompt and appropriate actions to address workplace harassment. In one case, an employer's response, which included transferring the plaintiff to another shift, conducting an investigation, and sending a letter informing the complainant of the outcome, was deemed insufficient by the appeals court. Simply stopping the harassment may not be enough to demonstrate an effective remedial response by the employer. The court found the employer's response to workplace harassment insufficient, as the harasser had a history of inappropriate conduct and lying about it. The legal implications of the harasser being a supervisor or co-worker were significant under the Faragher-Ellerth paradigm. If the harasser is a supervisor, the employer is strictly liable or liable unless it can establish an affirmative defense. If the harasser is a co-worker, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff to establish a hostile work environment claim. The legal significance of the harasser's status as a supervisor or co-worker is crucial in determining employer liability for workplace harassment. The burden of proof differs depending on the harasser's status, with stricter liability for supervisors and a heavier burden on the plaintiff for co-workers. Disagreements among circuit courts on evidence of supervisory status were addressed by the Supreme Court in Vance v. Ball State University in 2013. In Vance v. Ball State University in 2013, the Supreme Court defined a supervisor as one who has the authority to take actions in the workplace such as hiring, firing, making promotion decisions, or causing significant changes in benefits. This narrowed the definition of supervisor used by lower courts and rejected a definition based on directing the victim's daily work. In Vance v. Ball State University in 2013, the Supreme Court defined a supervisor as one with the authority to take actions in the workplace like hiring, firing, making promotion decisions, or causing significant changes in benefits. This definition was based on a structured framework from previous cases, drawing a clear line between co-workers and supervisors, with the defining characteristic being the authority to take tangible employment actions. The Supreme Court defined a supervisor as one empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions, contrasting it with the vague standard proposed by the government in Vance v. Ball State University. The Court emphasized the clarity of its standard and criticized the EEOC's definition, stating that the number and importance of tasks are factors to consider. The Supreme Court defined a supervisor as one empowered by the employer to take tangible employment actions, criticizing the EEOC's vague standard. The Court highlighted the ambiguity of the EEOC's definition and expressed concerns about the practical challenges it would pose for lower courts and juries. The Court also addressed the potential for employers to concentrate authority in a few individuals to avoid liability, stating that negligence would still lead to liability. The Supreme Court clarified that an employer could still be liable for a hostile work environment due to negligence. It emphasized that even if authority was concentrated in a few individuals, the employer could be held accountable for delegating power to take employment actions. The negligence standard was deemed sufficient to protect employees from harassment, with the nature and degree of the harasser's authority being a crucial factor. The Court's decision emphasized that the nature and degree of the harasser's authority is crucial in determining employer negligence in harassment cases. The dissent criticized the majority opinion for being employer-friendly and potentially leaving harassment victims without effective remedies, disregarding workplace realities and the objective of Title VII. The EEOC's definition of a supervisor was also discussed in the dissent. The dissent criticized the majority opinion for potentially leaving harassment victims without effective remedies, emphasizing the importance of the harasser's authority in determining employer negligence in harassment cases. The EEOC's definition of a supervisor was also discussed, with the dissent highlighting that an employee with authority to increase workload or assign undesirable tasks could constitute a supervisor. The dissent highlighted a case where harassers with authority over a subordinate used their position to inflict harassment, despite lacking the ability to hire or fire the victims. The harassers controlled the conditions of the victim's work environment and subjected her to sexually vulgar remarks and unwanted sexual advances during a training program. The dissent disagreed with the Court's definition of a supervisor in a case involving harassers who used their authority to harass a subordinate. They questioned the clarity of the definition and raised concerns about what constitutes a tangible employment action. The dissent disagreed with the Court's definition of a supervisor for vicarious liability purposes under the new standard. They argued that the negligence standard provided less protection to harassment victims compared to the Faragher-Ellerth framework. The dissent also highlighted the burden on the plaintiff to prove negligence, creating a more challenging process for victims. The dissent criticized the Court's definition of a supervisor for vicarious liability, arguing it provided less protection to harassment victims. They called on Congress to correct the error and restore robust workplace harassment protections. Federal courts have generally applied the Vance standard, requiring evidence that the harasser had authority to take tangible employment actions to be considered a supervisor. Disagreement exists among courts regarding Vance's application to delegated authority scenarios. In Kramer v. Wasatch County Sheriff's Office, the Tenth Circuit determined that a sergeant was the plaintiff's supervisor based on the reliance on his recommendations for employment decisions. In contrast, the Sixth Circuit in EEOC v. AutoZone, Inc. found that a store manager, despite having some authority, was not considered a supervisor of the employees he harassed. The court held that the harasser in question did not have the authority to take tangible employment actions, such as demotions or promotions, and therefore was not considered the victims' supervisor. The employer did not blindly delegate responsibilities to the harasser or rely solely on his recommendations for hiring decisions. The harasser's ability to influence the decision-maker was not enough to make him the victims' supervisor, despite being able to hire hourly employees. The harasser in question did not have the authority to take tangible employment actions, such as demotions or promotions, and therefore was not considered the victims' supervisor. However, some courts have recognized harassers as supervisors under Title VII, based on their authority to make decisions affecting an employee's pay and hours. Title VII violations can also be established with evidence of quid pro quo harassment, where a supervisor takes a \"tangible employment action\" against an employee. Some federal courts require evidence of a tangible employment action resulting from refusal to submit to sexual demands for a quid pro quo claim. This action can include firing or denying a promotion. If a tangible employment action is proven, the severity or pervasiveness of harassment is not required to establish the claim. The legal standard for hostile work environment claims does not apply to quid pro quo claims. In quid pro quo claims, a tangible employment action resulting from refusal to submit to sexual demands alters the terms of employment. Courts hold employers strictly liable for quid pro quo harassment without evidence of tangible employment action. Without such action, courts analyze the claim as a \"hostile work environment\" requiring harassment to be \"severe or pervasive\" for a Title VII violation. The Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that a supervisor's implicit or explicit communication making submission to sexual conduct a condition for employment constitutes a tangible employment action, triggering strict liability for harassment. In Jin v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the Second Circuit found that a supervisor's demands for sexual acts under threat of termination constituted a tangible employment action. The court explained that a tangible employment action occurs when a harasser uses supervisory authority to require submission to sexual acts as a condition for continued employment. This action makes the employer liable, as the harasser threatens termination if the submission is not met. Holding an employer strictly liable for such actions is consistent with previous court decisions. In Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, the Supreme Court recognized constructive discharge claims under Title VII. This involved a female employee forced to resign due to intolerable sexual harassment by supervisors. The harassment included inappropriate behavior, genital grabbing, belittlement, intimidation, and wrongful arrest. The Supreme Court recognized constructive discharge claims under Title VII in Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders. This involved a female employee forced to resign due to intolerable sexual harassment by supervisors, including inappropriate behavior, genital grabbing, belittlement, intimidation, and wrongful arrest. The Court held that constructive discharge in sexual harassment cases could be characterized as an \"aggravated case\" of sexual harassment or a hostile work environment. A plaintiff must show working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. The Supreme Court in Suders recognized constructive discharge claims under Title VII, where the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to raise genuine issues of material facts on her claim. The conduct must be worse than \"severe or pervasive\" harassment, and the Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense can be raised by an employer in a constructive discharge claim. The Supreme Court in Suders acknowledged constructive discharge claims under Title VII, where the plaintiff must show evidence of genuine issues of material facts. The Faragher-Ellerth defense can be used by an employer in a constructive discharge claim if the plaintiff quits in response to an employer-sanctioned adverse action officially changing their employment status or situation. This raises the question of when a constructive discharge is the result of an \"official act.\" The Court defined an \"official act\" as an adverse action officially changing the plaintiff's employment status or situation. The Court discussed cases where the issue of \"official act\" in constructive discharge claims was raised. In Reed v. MBNA Marketing Systems, Inc., the supervisor's conduct was deemed unofficial, allowing the defendant to raise an affirmative defense. In contrast, Robinson v. Sappington involved an official act of transferring the plaintiff, precluding the defendant from using the Faragher-Ellerth defense. Lower courts have required a formal change in the employee's status to constitute an \"official act\" since Suders. In Whitten v. Fred's, Inc., the Fourth Circuit addressed a sexual harassment claim where the plaintiff's supervisor's actions were not considered an \"official act.\" The supervisor's supervisor failed to take any action to change the plaintiff's employment status. In Suders, the Court stated that a prevailing constructive discharge plaintiff is entitled to all damages available for formal discharge, including backpay and frontpay. Harassment claims under Title VII must be based on an individual's protected characteristic, such as race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Plaintiffs may face challenges in proving harassment was due to a protected characteristic, especially in cases where the harasser and victim share the same sex. In Offshore Services, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII claims of same-sex harassment are valid if it meets statutory requirements based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Court rejected the argument that same-sex harassment should be excluded from Title VII liability, stating that discrimination based on sex is grounds for liability. The Supreme Court ruled in Offshore Services, Inc. that Title VII claims of same-sex harassment are valid if it meets statutory requirements based on discrimination \"because of . . . sex.\" The Court emphasized that discrimination based on sex is grounds for liability, regardless of the sex of the individuals involved. In cases of same-sex harassment, the plaintiff must prove that the harassment occurred because of their sex, presenting a distinctive challenge compared to typical sexual harassment cases. In same-sex harassment claims, the Court suggested three \"routes\" by which a plaintiff could prove that the harassing conduct was because of the plaintiff's sex. Lower courts have generally held that the methods suggested in Oncale are not exclusive, allowing plaintiffs flexibility in showing that harassment was because of sex. The Court in Oncale explained that evaluating same-sex harassment based on the plaintiff's sex requires careful consideration of the social context. Common sense and sensitivity to social context help distinguish between teasing and abusive behavior. The Oncale routes offer important guidelines for lower courts in harassment cases. In same-sex harassment cases, plaintiffs often rely on three evidentiary routes outlined in Oncale to establish harassment based on sex. A study of 105 cases found that the first route, evidence of homosexuality or sexual desire, was used in 40 cases, while the third route was utilized in 25 cases. The second route, \"general hostility,\" was less common, with only four cases relying on it. The effectiveness of this route is limited as plaintiffs often opt for evidence of differential treatment instead. An example from Cherry v. Shaw Coastal illustrates how these evidentiary routes are applied in practice. In Chavez v. Thomas & Betts Corp., a female plaintiff alleged sexual harassment by her female supervisor, who targeted her as a woman and humiliated her in front of men at work. The court found sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the supervisor's conduct was sexual in nature. In a case where a female plaintiff alleged sexual harassment by her female supervisor, the court found evidence supporting the sexual nature of the supervisor's conduct. The court concluded that differential treatment based on sex was enough for a reasonable jury to determine harassment. However, difficulty arises when evidence does not clearly show sexual desire or differential treatment, as seen in a case where a female plaintiff failed to prove that sexualized harassment was motivated by her sex. The conduct was motivated by the supervisor's general hostility toward women or sexual desire. Courts distinguish between sexualized bullying and harassment \"because of\" sex. Some same-sex harassment cases have succeeded by showing the plaintiff was harassed for failing to conform to gender stereotypes. In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court held that sex discrimination under Title VII could occur when an employer discriminates based on the employee's failure to fit within a sex-based stereotype. Some courts have found that harassment on the basis of sex can occur when an employee fails to conform to sex-based stereotypes. In EEOC v. Boh Bros. Constr. Co., LLC, a same-sex harassment case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that harassment was based on the victim's non-conformity to male sex stereotypes. The supervisor used feminine epithets towards the plaintiff, indicating discrimination based on sex-stereotyping. Courts are divided on whether sexual orientation discrimination is protected under Title VII as \"discrimination on the basis of sex.\" However, claims involving sex-stereotyping may still be permitted to proceed, especially when the plaintiff shows sex-stereotyping as the basis for harassment. Title VII's anti-retaliation provision prohibits employers from discriminating against an employee for reporting unlawful employment practices under Title VII. Employees who report sexual harassment in the workplace under Title VII may be protected from retaliation like termination or demotion. To establish a retaliation claim, the plaintiff must show engaging in \"protected activity\" by reporting discriminatory conduct or filing an EEOC charge. Courts also require a \"good faith\" belief that the reported conduct was unlawful under Title VII for the opposition to be protected. Courts apply a \"reasonable belief\" standard to determine if an employee's report of harassment is protected under Title VII. This standard evaluates whether the reported conduct was close enough to Title VII standards, including reports of being a victim of harassment, observing harassment towards others, or supporting another employee's report of sexual harassment. In Title VII retaliation claims, a court's determination of \"reasonableness\" relies on precedent dictating what constitutes severe or pervasive conduct. For example, the Seventh Circuit found it reasonable for a plaintiff to report harassment when a male co-worker sat on her lap and made unwelcome comments about her appearance, citing unwanted physical contact as severe conduct in sexual harassment cases. The Eleventh Circuit held that evidence did not show the plaintiff was objectively reasonable in believing the conduct she experienced was unlawful harassment. Her supervisor made inappropriate comments about her breasts, but the court viewed it as \"simple teasing\" and not severe enough to support a reasonable belief of unlawful behavior. The Eleventh Circuit dismissed a retaliation claim in an unlawful employment practice, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Clark County School District v. Breeden. Breeden addressed a Title VII retaliation claim where the reported conduct was deemed not objectively reasonable. The plaintiff's complaint involved inappropriate comments from a male co-worker and supervisor during a job applicant review meeting. The plaintiff's supervisor read a sexually explicit comment made by a job applicant out loud during a review meeting. The plaintiff did not find the comment offensive, and the court deemed the exchange as not constituting unlawful harassment. The Court in Breeden analyzed a plaintiff's objective reasonableness regarding a complaint of an \"isolated incident.\" Some courts have held that a plaintiff's objective reasonableness can be established by reporting an incident of humiliating or physically threatening conduct. In Montell v. Diversified Clinical Services, Inc., the Sixth Circuit rejected the defendant's argument that the plaintiff could not have reasonably believed her supervisor's comments were unlawful sexual harassment. The court explained that the plaintiff's report to HR about her supervisor's inappropriate comments was objectively reasonable, considering the sexual nature of the comments and the power dynamic between supervisor and subordinate. The evidence showed she could have had an objectively reasonable belief of harassment. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to show she could have had an objectively reasonable belief, and that whether she did in fact have such a belief, \"a question of credibility, must be left to a jury.\" Title VII's anti-retaliation provision has two clauses, the \"opposition\" and \"participation\" clauses. Federal courts have held that an employee's participation in an internal investigation may not be protected under Title VII. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether disclosures in an internal harassment investigation are protected under Title VII, but has held that reports of sexual harassment in an internal investigation may be protected opposition. The Supreme Court's 2009 decision in Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County established that reporting discrimination during an employer's internal investigation can be protected opposition under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision. This case involved a plaintiff who was fired for reporting harassment during an internal investigation into a male manager's behavior. The plaintiff's disclosures during the investigation were deemed protected opposition. The Supreme Court discussed the definition of \"opposed\" in the context of protected opposition under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision. The plaintiff's report of harassing behavior was considered opposition, as it involved resisting or antagonizing the behavior. The Supreme Court clarified that reporting discrimination to an employer constitutes opposition under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, even if done in response to a question. The Court emphasized the importance of protecting employees who speak out against discrimination to prevent a \"catch-22\" situation. The Court emphasized the importance of protecting employees who report discrimination, highlighting the potential \"catch-22\" situation. This includes scenarios where an employee faces retaliation for reporting a potential Title VII violation, leading to retaliatory harassment. There is disagreement among circuit courts on how to analyze retaliatory harassment claims, specifically regarding the applicability of the \"severe or pervasive\" standard in Harris. The Supreme Court decision in Burlington Northern v. White sets the legal standard for evaluating actionable retaliation under Title VII. Leading up to this decision, circuit courts had varying requirements for what constitutes retaliation, with some requiring demotion or firing by the employer, while others did not limit it to such \"ultimate\" employment decisions. The Supreme Court rejected limiting actionable retaliation to only workplace-related acts and held that it includes conduct that could dissuade a reasonable worker from reporting discrimination. Circuit courts apply this standard to various retaliation claims, with some applying it to claims of retaliatory harassment. The Court in Burlington Northern emphasized differences in Title VII's antidiscrimination and anti-retaliation provisions, stating they prohibit different types of conduct for different purposes. The Supreme Court clarified that actionable retaliation under Title VII includes conduct that could deter a reasonable worker from reporting discrimination, emphasizing the differences between antidiscrimination and anti-retaliation provisions in the statute. The Supreme Court ruled that actionable retaliation under Title VII extends beyond workplace-related actions, emphasizing the need for broad protection to deter various forms of retaliation. This interpretation was applied in the case of Burlington Northern, where the plaintiff, Sheila White, was found to have been retaliated against for reporting discrimination. Burlington reassigned and suspended Sheila White in retaliation for reporting her supervisor's negative comments about women to Burlington officials. She was reassigned to a more arduous job after reporting the comments, and when she filed an EEOC charge, she was suspended without pay. The Court found that both the reassignment and suspension violated Title VII's anti-retaliation provision. The Court found that the reassignment to a more arduous job and the 37-day suspension without pay constituted actionable retaliation against Sheila White for reporting discrimination. The Court noted that such actions could deter employees from reporting Title VII violations. The Court emphasized the importance of context in determining retaliatory harassment for reporting a Title VII violation. Circuit courts have conflicting standards, with some applying Burlington Northern to assess actionable conduct and others applying Harris to require severe or pervasive harassment for a hostile work environment claim. The Third Circuit has held that for claims of retaliatory harassment under Title VII, it is not necessary to prove that the harassment was severe or pervasive to be considered actionable. This differs from the conflicting standards in other circuit courts, where some apply Burlington Northern and others apply Harris to assess retaliatory harassment. The court in Northern explained that for claims of retaliatory harassment under Title VII, a reasonable employee would find the alleged actions materially adverse if they would deter them from exercising their rights. This includes poor treatment such as yelling and withholding resources after a complaint. The Second Circuit also applies this standard to evaluate whether harassment in retaliation for a discrimination complaint constitutes actionable retaliation. The Eleventh Circuit analyzes retaliatory harassment claims by requiring evidence that the conduct was severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. Other circuits also require a showing of severe or pervasive harassment for conduct to be considered actionable retaliation. The Eleventh Circuit and other circuits require evidence of severe or pervasive conduct for retaliatory harassment claims to be considered actionable. Some circuits have applied the Burlington Northern standard to other types of retaliation, but there is uncertainty about the standard for Title VII retaliatory harassment claims. The Seventh Circuit recently ruled that a claim failed because the alleged retaliation was not severe enough to dissuade a reasonable employee, while the D.C. Circuit concluded that harassing acts would not dissuade a reasonable employee from reporting discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 allows for compensatory damages in cases of intentional discrimination, including sexual harassment. These damages can cover various losses such as emotional pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. Different courts have varying standards for retaliatory harassment claims, with some requiring severe or pervasive conduct to be considered actionable. The standard for Title VII retaliatory harassment claims is still uncertain, with disagreement among courts on how to analyze such claims. A plaintiff in a Title VII sexual harassment case can recover compensatory damages for emotional pain, suffering, anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. Punitive damages can be awarded against nongovernmental entities for malice or reckless indifference to federally protected rights. The total damages are limited by statute based on the number of employees the employer has. Constructively discharged complainants may also receive backpay or frontpay. Injunctive relief can be sought in addition to damages. In Title VII cases, plaintiffs can recover compensatory damages for emotional distress and punitive damages for malicious behavior. Injunctive relief may also be granted to prevent further violations. Reasonable attorney's fees are available to prevailing parties. Prevailing parties in legal cases can recover attorney fees, with prevailing plaintiffs receiving fees that materially alter the legal relationship between parties. Defendants can only receive fees if the plaintiff's claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless."
