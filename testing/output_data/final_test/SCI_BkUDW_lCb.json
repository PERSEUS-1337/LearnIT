    "content": "The digitization of data has made datasets available in relational databases and spreadsheet tables. A system is presented that allows querying data tables using natural language questions, translating them into SQL queries using a deep sequence to sequence model. The decoder uses a type system of SQL expressions to structure the output prediction, either copying an output token from the input question or generating it from a fixed vocabulary. A value-based loss function improves training of the model. The model is evaluated on WikiSQL. Our model, trained using supervised learning, outperforms the Seq2SQL model that uses reinforcement learning on the WikiSQL dataset. The goal is to build semantic parsers that can translate natural language questions into executable programs to improve data accessibility for end-users. The recent work has shown that recurrent neural networks with attention and copying mechanisms can effectively build successful semantic parsers. The Seq2SQL model introduces separate decoders for different parts of a query, increasing prediction accuracy. Reinforcement learning further improves the model by allowing it to learn semantically equivalent queries beyond supervision. This paper presents a new encoder-decoder model for natural language to SQL program translation and a training approach for effective and stable learning. The model uses a type system to control the decoding process in generating answers from SQL programs. It encodes table columns and user questions with a bidirectional LSTM for effective learning. The model utilizes a bidirectional LSTM to encode table columns and user questions, and then decodes the hidden state with a typed LSTM. It employs a new value-based loss function to train the model effectively in copying correct values, outperforming direct supervision on pointers. Our approach, evaluated on the WikiSQL dataset, outperforms the Seq2SQL model without reinforcement learning. A series of ablation experiments analyze the model's components, which include an RNN-based encoder-decoder with attention and copying mechanisms. The model utilizes the known SQL structure to determine the output type during query generation. The model utilizes a bidirectional RNN with LSTM cells for encoding and decoding SQL queries. It determines the output type based on the SQL structure, using a specialized decoder for generating column names or constants, and a built-in vocabulary for SQL operators. The encoder input includes table headers and user queries concatenated together. The model uses a bidirectional RNN with LSTM cells for encoding and decoding SQL queries. It combines pre-trained character n-gram and global word embeddings to handle different tokens in the input query. The embeddings are concatenated to compute a joint representation for table headers and user queries. The model utilizes GloVe embeddings and a bidirectional RNN with LSTM cells for encoding SQL queries. It incorporates pre-trained character n-gram and global word embeddings to handle various tokens in the input query, improving decoding performance by abstracting types from the grammar of the target language. Based on the tokens generated so far, the model can determine the type of the next token to generate. Three different cases are distinguished: output from predefined terminals, column names copied from the table header or question section, and constants copied from the question section. The SQL grammar is represented as \"Select s c From t Where (c op v) *\", allowing for the description of output types. The model uses a standard RNN with attention to generate the target program. The decoder is specialized based on the output token type. Initializing the decoder with hidden states from the table header improves decoding accuracy. Different output layers are defined for the three output types. The input to the next decoder cell is a concatenation of the token embedding and attention vector. The model generates output by copying a token from the input sequence based on attention values. The decoder considers only the question part of the input and reuses the embedding of the copied token for the next decoder cell. This construction allows for easy exchange or extension of decoder types. The model is trained on question-SQL program pairs, with different decoder cells trained using various loss functions. The objective is to copy a correct token from the input to the output, requiring finding the index of the target token in the input. Multiple indices may exist if the target token appears multiple times in the input. The model is trained on question-SQL program pairs, with different decoder cells trained using various loss functions. Two loss functions are defined for cases where the target token appears multiple times in the input: Pointer-based loss and Value-based loss. The Value-based loss function allows the decoder to choose any one of the input tokens with the correct value. The model is trained on question-SQL program pairs using different loss functions for decoder cells. Two loss functions are defined for cases where the target token appears multiple times in the input: Pointer-based loss and Value-based loss. The Value-based loss function allows the decoder to choose any one of the input tokens with the correct value. The strategies for calculating the probability of copying a token in the input vocabulary are evaluated on the WikiSQL dataset to analyze their contributions. The dataset is preprocessed by normalizing punctuation, cases, and formats of tables and question-query pairs using Stanford Stanza. This aims to ensure consistency and eliminate inconsistencies caused by different whitespace. After preprocessing the dataset by normalizing punctuation, cases, and formats, the training set is filtered to remove pairs with ground truth solutions containing constants not mentioned in the question. The model is trained and tuned only on the filtered training and dev sets. The model is trained and tuned on the filtered training and dev sets, with evaluation reported on the full dev and test sets. Table entry mentions in the question are annotated with their corresponding column names if they uniquely belong to one column, aiding in linking special column entries with their information. The model is trained using pre-trained n-gram and GloVe word embeddings, with a 3-layer bidirectional LSTM RNN architecture. Training includes gradient clipping and noise addition for stability. The model's performance is compared against other models on the dev set, showing accuracy based on syntax match and query execution results. Our best model achieves 61.0% execution accuracy on the filtered dev set, trained with a value-based loss and sum-transfer strategy. Ablation tests were conducted to analyze different sub-components of the model, showing significant improvement over prior work. The model accuracy on the development set is plotted in FIG4, comparing typed and untyped decoders. Types do not significantly improve performance but help stabilize the model faster. Loss function comparison shows sum-transfer strategy improves training stability and accuracy. Value-based loss with max-transfer strategy performs the best. The study compares value-based loss with max-transfer strategy to pointer-based loss in pointer models, showing sensitivity to initialization. Column annotation improves model accuracy by 7.5% by linking entities with their columns, suggesting a performance boost. The study compares value-based loss with max-transfer strategy to pointer-based loss in pointer models, showing sensitivity to initialization. Column annotation improves model accuracy by 7.5% by linking entities with their columns, suggesting a performance boost. On the other hand, typed decoding and the value-based loss function alone achieve \u223c52.5% accuracy on unannotated questions, surpassing the Seq2SQL baseline. Different input token embeddings are studied, showing that untrainable embeddings can prevent over-fitting. Errors made by the model are classified by the part of a query that was incorrectly predicted, with a significant percentage of cases involving wrong aggregation functions, copied column names, and mistakes in predicates. The model's errors in predictions are mainly due to selecting the wrong column to compare to, lack of understanding of table content, and limitations in supporting multiple pointer headers. Improving the model by embedding table content with the question could potentially enhance its performance. The model's errors in predictions are mainly due to selecting the wrong column to compare to, lack of understanding of table content, and limitations in supporting multiple pointer headers. Improving the model by embedding table content with the question could potentially enhance its performance. Extending the model with multiple constant pointers per slot or introducing an extra decoding layer for constant rewriting could improve the model. Training the model with a reinforcement loop to punish ill-formed queries and reward semantically equivalent ones could further improve results. Our model simplifies the decoding process by using a sequence decoder instead of a full parse tree, making it easier to implement and train. It is the first to use target token type information to specialize the decoder for copying from a specific set of input tokens. Unlike previous approaches, we use types to restrict locations in the input to point to, and have developed a new training objective to handle pointer aliases. Pointer and copy networks have been successfully used in various applications, such as interactive conversation and program generation. Our model follows neural program synthesis models, training directly with question program pairs. Entity linking is a technique orthogonal to neural encoder-decoder models, potentially addressing limitations in column annotation. Reinforcement learning allows the model to learn semantically equivalent solutions and can be combined to improve accuracy. Our new neural architecture translates natural language questions into SQL queries using a sequence to sequence model. It uses a type system to guide token generation or copying from the input. A sum-transfer value based loss function efficiently trains the model, outperforming the current state-of-the-art Seq2SQL model on the WikiSQL dataset."
