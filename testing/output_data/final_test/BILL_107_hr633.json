Congress finds that heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death among females in the United States, with more than 500,000 women dying each year. About 1 in 5 females have some form of cardiovascular disease, which kills more American women than the next 14 causes of death combined. Cardiovascular disease in women is often undetected and untreated until it becomes severe, leading to 38 percent of women who have heart attacks dying within 1 year. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers in women, but better nutrition and lifestyle changes can help prevent and treat obesity. Additionally, osteoporosis affects over 20,000,000 American women. Osteoporosis affects over 20,000,000 American women, with more than half of women over 65 having the condition. One out of every 2 women over 50 will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetime. The national annual costs associated with osteoporosis are estimated at $14 billion. Physical activity, muscular strength, balance, adequate vitamin D, and calcium intake are crucial for bone health. Research shows that being uninsured can hinder access to healthcare and lead to poorer health outcomes. Expansion of the WISEWOMAN program has provided preventive health services to thousands of women, identifying risk factors for heart disease and leading to improved weight management, lower blood pressure, and lower cholesterol. This program aims to reduce women's risk of illness and death. The WISEWOMAN program aims to reduce women's risk of illness and death by providing preventive health services, including identifying risk factors for heart disease and improving weight management, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. States could further reduce women's risk by offering comprehensive preventive services to low-income and uninsured women. Supplemental grants are provided for additional preventive health services for women under Section 1509 of the Public Health Service Act, establishing a program for these services. The Secretary may award grants to States for preventive health services like screenings for diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and obesity, as well as health education and interventions for behavioral risk factors. The Secretary may award grants to States for preventive health services, including screenings for diseases like cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and obesity, as well as interventions for behavioral risk factors. The grant recipients must provide appropriate referrals for medical treatment and follow-up services for women receiving these services. Additionally, activities conducted under the grant must be evaluated through surveillance, research, or program monitoring. The State must agree to provide services in conjunction with entities screening women for breast or cervical cancer. The provisions of this title apply to grants for preventive health services, including screenings for diseases like cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, and obesity. Funding of $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, and $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 is authorized, with additional funding as necessary for subsequent years. No additional resources can be appropriated unless the amount under section 1510(a) is appropriated for the same fiscal year. The amount appropriated under section 1510(a) for the fiscal year must be at least $173,920,000."
