    "content": "The U.S. military has dominated state-on-state conflict since the Soviet Union's disintegration. Recent conflicts have shown effectiveness against other countries' armed forces, but struggle against non-state actors like terrorists and insurgents. Non-state actors were once considered less threatening than enemy nation-states. The U.S. military's dominance in state-on-state conflict has been challenged by non-state actors like terrorists. Military aviation is crucial in combating these threats, presenting unique challenges for decision makers. The issues for Congress include funding and organizing U.S. military aviation forces to combat non-state actors. Friction may arise over funding priorities for major weapons programs versus terrorism-relevant technologies. Military aviation plays a key role in operations against non-state actors, with potential options for consideration. The U.S. armed forces are primarily focused on conventional warfare but are now facing challenges from non-state actors. The Department of Defense is taking steps to address these challenges in long-term military plans and policies. Regional combatant commanders are developing new war plans to prevent postwar instability like in Iraq. The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) aims to shift focus from conventional warfare to countering terrorism. U.S. military forces may target countries sponsoring terrorism. Challenges in using military aviation against non-state actors include operational, mindset, and cost challenges. Non-state actors pose operational challenges for U.S. forces due to difficulties in target identification and lack of high-value targets. Targeting non-state actors in direct combat is a core challenge as they blend into civilian populations and lack recognizable formations or infrastructure. Non-state actors like Al Qaeda present challenges for military planners due to their opaque leadership structure and diffuse operations. Identifying and engaging these targets is difficult, especially when concerns over collateral damage arise. Even conventional state-on-state conflicts face similar challenges when non-combatants are used as shields. The challenges of engaging non-state actors like Al Qaeda include concerns over collateral damage and the need for extreme precision in delivering weapons effects. A RAND study highlighted the difficulty of identifying and engaging terrorists without harming civilians. Combatting non-state actors may require different training, tactics, and rules of engagement compared to conventional warfare, necessitating a shift in politico-military mindset. Non-state actors like Palestinian terrorist groups may define victory differently, focusing on survival rather than rapid defeat. Their strategy of protracted war aims to prevent decisive victories by military forces. This mindset challenges traditional military concerns and requires a shift in approach when engaging non-state actors. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 have prompted a shift in mindset towards preemptive military action to prevent non-state actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The definition of \"imminent\" threat is debated, and the US aims to prevent non-state actors from taking over large territories within nation-states. Non-state actors pose a threat by potentially taking over territories to train terrorists and launch global attacks. Engaging civilians is crucial in countering these actors, as winning their support is a significant part of the counter-insurgency strategy. The shooting aspect is only a small part of the challenge, with the majority being gaining the people's cooperation. Non-state actors pose a threat due to their cost-effective methods, such as acquiring inexpensive weapons like MANPADS. Military activities like destroying buildings may hinder winning civilian support, crucial in countering these actors. The cost of defending against non-state actors can be high, with potential radicalization of populations and damage to the US image worldwide. The cost of defending against non-state actors, such as those using MANPADS, can be significant. Fielding technologies on commercial aircraft for defense could cost the US $10 billion. Close Air Support (CAS) missions are crucial in combating non-state actors effectively. Close Air Support (CAS) missions are essential for combating non-state actors effectively, requiring detailed integration of air missions with ground forces. Key functions include tracking enemy forces, delivering weapons against moving targets, and coordinating air and ground forces to reduce fratricide. CAS has historically been neglected in favor of more glamorous missions like air-to-air combat. Assessing the evolution of CAS missions and addressing key challenges provides a framework for applying military aviation against non-state actors. Recent activity within DOD suggests that Close Air Support (CAS) is receiving increased attention as a growing mission area due to changes in adversaries, new technologies, and evolving airpower strategy. Operation Desert Storm in 1991 involved a 38-day air campaign targeting Iraq's strategic assets before the ground campaign, with CAS accounting for 8% of combat sorties flown. CAS accounted for 8% of combat sorties in Operation Desert Storm. In Operation Allied Force, CAS missions made up 26% of combat sorties, a higher percentage than in Iraq. CAS effectiveness in Operation Enduring Freedom against Taliban and Al Qaeda forces was widely reported. The Air Force conducted CAS missions differently in this conflict, attacking enemies in close proximity to friendly forces. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, there was a heavy reliance on close air support (CAS) missions, with 79% of combat sorties being CAS sorties by the end of state-on-state hostilities in May 2003. This reliance on CAS helped U.S. ground forces advance quickly through Iraq by replacing the fire support normally provided by heavy artillery. Despite the apparent increase in attention to CAS, there were shortcomings in the contemporary prosecution of CAS missions, leading to issues such as fratricide and slow responses to ground forces. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, there was heavy reliance on close air support missions, with shortcomings leading to fratricide and slow responses to ground forces. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are small military units with specialized training and equipment, capable of direct and indirect action against non-state actors. Special Operations Forces (SOF) conduct aviation-related actions against non-state actors, including intelligence collection, clandestine force insertion, rescues, and high-value terrorist captures. They also control strike aircraft, as seen in Operation Enduring Freedom where they worked with Afghan forces to target the Taliban and Al Qaeda. SOF's ability to control aircraft clandestinely sets them apart from conventional military tactical air controllers. Additionally, SOF can engage in Aviation-Foreign Internal Defense (A-FID) missions. Special Operations Forces conduct Aviation-Foreign Internal Defense (A-FID) missions, advising foreign governments in defense strategies. A-FID involves training and advising foreign aviation forces to support their internal defense and development. The Air Force's 6th Special Operations Squadron (6SOS) is the sole DOD organization tasked with Aviation-Foreign Internal Defense (A-FID) missions. It was created in 1994 and advises foreign countries on using airpower against terrorists and insurgents. The 6SOS focuses on conveying combat and combat support skills relevant to FID, such as night flying and the use of gunships. The 6th Special Operations Squadron (6SOS) advises foreign countries on combat skills for Aviation-Foreign Internal Defense (A-FID) missions, including night flying, gunship use, air/ground coordination, fire support, medical evacuation, air assault, and insertion/extraction. They also provide assistance in aviation support like maintenance, ground safety, SERE, airbase defense, and C3. A-FID advisors help integrate foreign air forces into coalition operations, establish relationships, and support U.S. combatant commanders. The use of air assets in anti-terrorist missions has increased since September 11, with successful strikes on Al Qaeda figures. However, the effectiveness of air power in comparison to other methods is debated, as some operatives have been captured instead of killed in air strikes. The capture of senior Al Qaeda operative Khalid Shaykh Mohammad in March 2003, along with other key operatives like Abu Faraj al-Libi, has significantly impacted Al Qaeda's operations. Additionally, other fighters and operatives were captured in ground operations in Afghanistan, including Ahmed Abd al-Rahman, son of Umar Abd al-Rahman, who was killed fighting alongside Taliban forces. The success of air strikes on terrorist leaders depends on precise intelligence on their whereabouts. It is unclear if attacking individual terrorist leaders contributes to reducing terrorist operations. The effectiveness of a terrorist organization can be reduced by various factors, such as a decrease in popular support, deaths of leaders, internal splits, economic improvements, and availability of replacements. The impact of targeted strikes on terrorist groups depends on their leadership breadth and capabilities of lower-ranking members. Ethnic or territorial groups may be more resilient to leader deaths than ideology-based organizations. One of the first uses of U.S. air power in an anti-terrorism mission was the April 1980 attempt to rescue U.S. diplomats and other Americans held hostage by the revolutionary government in Iran. The mission involved aircraft meeting up with helicopters at a remote Iranian desert landing strip called \"Desert One\" with the plan to raid facilities holding the hostages. The U.S. commandos attempted to rescue hostages in Tehran but aborted the mission at Desert One due to mechanical issues, resulting in a collision that killed eight military personnel. This failure led to a focus on unconventional warfare and strengthening special operations forces. Another early use of U.S. air power in an anti-terrorism mission occurred in October 1985. In October 1985, the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by gunmen of the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) led to the death of an American passenger. The hijackers were intercepted by U.S. Navy F-14 aircraft and taken into custody by Italian authorities. Abu Abbas, the leader of the PLF, was later convicted in absentia and captured by U.S. forces in 2003. In Baghdad, a key Al Qaeda leader, Mohammad Atef, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in November 2001. Atef's death dealt a significant blow to the Al Qaeda leadership structure as he had been a close associate of Osama bin Laden for ten years and was involved in planning anti-U.S. operations. The death of Mohammad Atef in a U.S. drone strike in November 2001 significantly impacted Al Qaeda's leadership structure. Additionally, U.S. warplanes targeted and killed Juma Namangani, a military leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), in late November 2001, which experts believe set back IMU operations significantly. Experts agree that Namangani's death had a significant impact on IMU operations, with the group only now beginning to resume activities in Uzbekistan. Tahir Yuldashev, the surviving co-founder, has struggled to maintain cohesion within the IMU following Namangani's death. In November 2002, a U.S. Predator drone killed Al Qaeda leader Ali Qaed Sinan al-Harithi in Yemen, who was a key suspect in the USS Cole bombing. Yemen provided information to U.S. intelligence for the successful targeting of Harithi. The overall effect of the strike on Al Qaeda is challenging to measure. The strike on Al Qaeda leader Ali Qaed Sinan al-Harithi in Yemen had a significant impact on the group's operations in Yemen. Another Al Qaeda operative, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was arrested by the United Arab Emirates. A Predator drone strike in June 2004 targeted and killed pro-Al Qaeda Pakistani militant Nek Mohammad, who had helped top Al Qaeda operatives escape a Pakistani sweep operation. Nek Mohammad's death did not lead to the capture of any high-value Al Qaeda members. The Predator drone strike in Damadola, northwest Pakistan targeted Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top associate of bin Laden. The strike hit several Al Qaeda figures, including Abu Khabab al-Masri and Zawahiri's son-in-law. Al Qaeda's top chemical weaponry expert Abu Khabab al-Masri, Zawahiri's son-in-law, and other Egyptian Al Qaeda figures were targeted in a Predator drone strike in Damadola, northwest Pakistan. Zawahiri did not attend the event and was not hit, but the strike killed non-combatants and sparked protests in Pakistan. Pakistan's Prime Minister condemned the strike, stating they were not informed in advance, despite providing intelligence for the operation. The air strikes relied on precise intelligence from allied sources. The effectiveness of air strikes against Al Qaeda camps depended on precise intelligence from allied sources on the ground. In some cases, strikes were not carried out due to a lack of timely actionable intelligence. For example, Predator drones spotted Al Qaeda training camps before the September 11 attacks, but no strike was ordered. Similarly, airstrikes in Afghanistan in 1998 and discussions about targeting a camp in northern Iraq before Operation Iraqi Freedom did not result in strikes. Since the 2003 war began, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi has become a major leader of the anti-U.S. insurgency in Iraq. Despite several U.S. air strikes and raids on suspected Zarqawi headquarters, he has not been captured or killed. The use of air power against terrorist leaders is a recent development post-September 11, with U.S. planners drawing on Israel's long-standing use of this method. Israel has used airpower against militants for many years. In 1992, Israel used a Hellfire missile to kill the leader of Lebanese Hizballah, Abbas Musawi. Hizballah, backed by Iran and Syria, was a strong opponent of Israel in south Lebanon. Despite this strike, the outcomes were mixed. The killing of Abbas Musawi by Israel in 1992 did not significantly weaken Hizballah, leading to retaliation in the form of a bombing in Buenos Aires. Hizballah was also responsible for the bombing of an Argentine-Jewish cultural center in 1994. In 2004, Israeli helicopters targeted and killed two major leaders of Hamas, a Palestinian group known for suicide bombings against Israeli targets. In early 2004, Hamas leaders Shaykh Ahmad Yassin and Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi were killed by Israel. Another Hamas operative, Adnan Ghoul, was killed later in the year. The impact of these strikes on Hamas is uncertain, as the organization has many supporters and new leaders ready to take over. The decrease in Hamas suicide bombings in 2004 is attributed to Israel's construction of a security fence. Israel's targeted killings have not significantly impacted Hamas' institutional capabilities, and the strikes have not led to sustained popular Palestinian unrest against Israel. In an early targeted killing operation in 1988, an Israeli commando team raided a Tunis beachfront villa to kill a senior PLO military commander, Khalil Wazir (Abu Jihad). Israeli air power played a support role in the operation, with Boeing 707s conducting electronic warfare and maintaining communication with the Israeli Defense Ministry. The Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv supported a raid on a Tunis beachfront villa to kill senior PLO military commander Khalil Wazir. Israeli aircraft protected the sea craft during the operation, with helicopters on standby. The implications of the raid on Wazir are subject to speculation, with some suggesting it may have influenced PLO leader Yasir Arafat to renounce terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist. The Israeli raid on a Tunis villa targeted PLO commander Khalil Wazir, with speculation that his assassination could have prevented the rise of more militant PLO factions. Israel's successful 1976 operation in Entebbe to rescue hijacked civilians was aided by the C-130 \"Hercules\" aircraft. The C-130 \"Hercules\" aircraft played a crucial role in the Israeli raid on Entebbe, carrying the raiding party and equipment 2,500 miles to the airfield. There are concerns in defense circles about the focus of military aviation on conventional warfare over irregular warfare, with a need to reshape forces for small wars while maintaining capability for major conflicts. The text discusses the importance of utilizing airpower against non-state actors, highlighting the need for training, doctrine, planning, and strategy in this area. It points out a lack of focus on combating terrorism in the Air Force's doctrine document, suggesting a potential shortfall in understanding how airpower can be effectively employed in such scenarios. The lack of understanding of how airpower can contribute to irregular warfare was evident in the premature dismantling of air-ground coordination after the capture of Baghdad by the Army's 3rd Infantry Division. The Air Component Coordination Element (ACCE) was dissolved in late April 2003 despite its effective coordination of ground and aviation forces during the war in Iraq. In late April 2003, as major combat operations in Iraq were ending, military leaders began reexamining ground combat tactics. The Army issued a field guide on counter-insurgency warfare in November 2004, acknowledging the changing nature of warfare. The Marine Corps updated its Small Wars Manual in 2004. There is a need to reassess the DOD's airpower strategy to effectively combat non-state actors in the future. This report evaluates potential changes to DOD acquisition priorities and mindset. The report evaluates potential changes to DOD acquisition priorities, focusing on military aviation to equip U.S. air forces combating non-state actors. Possible systems include sensors, intelligence, battle management, manned and unmanned aircraft, and munitions. Improvements in airborne sensors, intelligence, and battle management are crucial for enhancing U.S. capabilities against non-state actors, with functions like detection, discrimination, and decision making being key. The DOD operates various aerial sensor platforms like U-2, E-8 JSTARS, RC-135 Rivet Joint, and UAVs for military missions. These platforms are high demand/low density and may not fully meet the needs for non-state actor missions. The use of smaller UAVs by ground groups could be more relevant for addressing the non-state actor problem. The fielding of smaller UAVs by ground forces, particularly Special Operations Forces (SOF), is gaining popularity. The U.S. Marines are satisfied with the Dragon Eye surveillance UAV used in Iraq. The Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) leads in deploying small UAVs like the \"Batcam\" for targeting enemy forces. DARPA and other research organizations are developing even smaller \"micro-UAVs\" (MAVs) for urban anti-terrorist operations and locating high-value targets like bin Laden. Unmanned aerostats offer surveillance advantages against non-state actors by elevating sensors above the ground for extended periods. They provide a tool to counter small irregular forces reliant on concealment. Aerostats can address limitations of satellites and have been deployed in limited numbers. The allocation of resources between small tactical UAVs like Batcam and more advanced UAVs like Predator is a key question for the Department of Defense. The top budgeted DOD UAV programs FY2004-FY2009 are J-UCAS, Global Hawk, and Predator, taking the majority of UAV funding. These systems are mainly used by higher level theater commanders, not tactical-level ground forces. The DOD needs to consider investing in cost-effective unmanned aerostats for surveillance and communications compared to more expensive manned aircraft or satellite systems. New sensor platforms with advanced sensors like synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are needed to improve U.S. forces' ability to detect and monitor small groups of enemy combatants. Improved sensor platforms with advanced sensors like synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating in UHF and VHF are valuable for detecting stationary targets under trees or camouflage. Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars have been used by U.S. forces since 1991, proving useful in targeting irregular groups. However, limitations such as insufficient coverage, lack of optimal base access, and obstacles like terrain and foliage hindering detection have been noted. Additionally, improved electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors are essential for detecting non-state actors. Improved electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors are crucial for detecting non-state actors, especially in remote environments. Miniaturization of these sensors is key for easier deployment in aerial platforms and by small forces. The Army is developing miniature IR cameras weighing only three ounces and costing under $500. However, there are concerns about the focus on developing smaller, simpler sensors compared to larger, more sophisticated ones. Detecting small groups of people and distinguishing between enemy combatants and non-combatants can be challenging in many scenarios. Gathering actionable intelligence is crucial for distinguishing enemy combatants from non-combatants. The US military is focusing on understanding criminal, terrorist, and insurgent networks, with a new program to develop intelligence devices for tracking potential threats. This effort may involve multiple airborne sensor and intelligence assets. The US military is utilizing multiple airborne sensor and intelligence assets to track and target potential threats, including small groups or individuals. There is a caution against over-reliance on signals intelligence (SIGINT) as terrorists and guerrillas may not always use the technology we expect them to use. The Air Force uses SIGINT to locate enemy electronic emissions, such as terrorists' mobile phones. HUMINT is also used to track terrorists, although it is not a recognized U.S. strength. DOD's SOF can gather intelligence by questioning captured terrorists, revealing weapons and imminent terrorist operations. Military Special Operations Forces (SOF) and CIA paramilitary forces utilize airpower for situational awareness and infiltration/extraction during HUMINT-oriented operations to gather intelligence on terrorists. There is a need to oversee DOD sensor acquisition plans to focus on systems relevant to non-state actor threats, such as rockets, mortars, RPGs, and MANPADS. Persistent aerial ISR platforms are crucial for wide-area coverage in counter guerrilla operations. Persistent aerial ISR platforms like tethered blimps, UAVs, or manned aircraft are essential for detecting fleeting targets, especially in non-state actor missions. Acquisition priorities should focus on distributing sensor information effectively and maintaining accurate knowledge of friendly ground forces. U.S. air forces have successfully located and attacked small groups of non-state actors with the help of terminal air controllers providing target coordinates. Acquisition issues include lack of uniformity in equipment, heavy battlefield air operations kits weighing 160 lbs, and the need to reduce equipment weight for increased mobility and survivability. Improvements in equipment for Special Operations Forces (SOF) and terminal air controllers could enhance effectiveness, but these resources may remain specialized and limited. Prioritizing battle management programs like network-centric warfare (NCW) could aid in detecting, tracking, and targeting non-state actors. Programs such as Affordable Moving Surface Target Engagement (AMSTE) and Advanced Tactical Targeting Technology are examples of initiatives in this area. Investing in battle management technologies like AMSTE and AT3 can improve decision-making against fleeting targets and reduce costs in combating non-state actors. Programs such as the Army's Blue Force Tracker can enhance the ability to engage terrorists while ensuring the safety of U.S. and friendly forces. Additionally, exploring close air support missions from high altitudes may be beneficial for air forces. The military is considering conducting close air support missions from high altitudes with GPS-guided munitions, which are precise but reliant on accurate geographical coordinates. Some argue that pilots flying at low altitudes have better situational awareness to avoid mistakes that could lead to fratricide. Blue Force Tracker and similar systems could help regain ground situational awareness lost at high altitudes, especially for special operations helicopters. Various procurement and modification efforts are being proposed to enhance aviation capabilities. The military services have proposed procurement and modification efforts to enhance aviation capabilities against non-state actors, focusing on strike, insertion/extraction, airlift, and command and control domains. The Air Force's A-10 Warthogs and AC-130 gunships specialize in attacking non-state actors, with plans to upgrade the A-10s with Precision Engagement (PE) upgrades costing $600,000 per aircraft. The upgrades will include advanced targeting pods, improved cockpit displays, new data link integration, and the ability to deliver GPS-guided munitions. PE variants of the A-10 are expected to be fielded between 2007 and 2009. The A-10 Warthogs are planned to receive Precision Engagement upgrades to deliver GPS-guided munitions. A Service Life Extension Program is being considered to keep the A-10 flying until 2025 when it may be replaced by the F-35 JSF. Some A-10s may be retired to fund upgrades, similar to the B-1 bomber situation. The Marine Corps plans to procure STOVL aircraft. The Marine Corps plans to procure STOVL variants of the F-35 to replace its AV-8B Harrier/F/A-18 aircraft for close air support missions. The Air Force also plans to procure STOVL F-35s to replace the A-10, with the F-22 being considered for CAS missions as well. The effectiveness of these aircraft in these roles is uncertain due to potential high costs and unnecessary attributes like high maneuverability and speed. The Air Force is upgrading the A-10 with modern avionics and targeting capabilities to remain effective until 2030. The Air Force Special Operations Command operates AC-130 gunships with unique capabilities, including using Predator UAV video images for attacking moving targets. The AC-130 gunship's use of video images to attack moving targets was prominent during the war in Afghanistan, showcasing its firepower and precision. However, concerns about its survivability, especially against shoulder-fired missiles, limit its daytime missions. The Air Force could enhance the AC-130's survivability by improving defensive measures, developing new weapons, or exploring alternative close air support options. The Air Force is considering fielding new weapons for the AC-130 gunship to maintain precision and firepower at greater distances. Collaboration with UAVs is being explored for increased situational awareness. Techniques to reduce the AC-130's signature are being considered, but their effectiveness is uncertain due to the aircraft's visibility. The possibility of a future gunship based on the C-17 is being evaluated for its potential cost-effectiveness. The standard C-130J Hercules transport costs around $50 million, while the upgraded AC-130U is priced at $190 million per aircraft. The potential cost of an AC-17 gunship is estimated to be $340 million each, $140 million more than a C-17. The development of UAVs as a replacement for the AC-130 is being considered, with a focus on increasing autonomy and network-centric warfare. The issue of who should operate the AC-130 and its replacement is also being discussed. The AC-130 gunship is currently operated by AFSOC, but there are discussions about allowing conventional Air Force units and the Marine Corps to operate it. The potential cost of an AC-17 gunship is estimated to be $340 million each. The Army is also speeding up efforts to field its Extended Range Multi-Purpose UAV with plans to integrate munitions like AGM-114 Hellfire and Viper Strike. The Army is looking to integrate munitions like AGM-114 Hellfire, Viper Strike, and BLU-108 Skeet onto future UAVs to be fielded in FY2009. There were reports of weaponized Hunter UAVs deployed in the past, but recent denials suggest classification issues. The effectiveness of armed UAV program management and their capabilities compared to existing UAVs like Predator are key concerns. In FY2005, congressional appropriators cut $200 million from the J-UCAS program budget due to lack of coordination with military services. The program faced management issues and was transferred from DARPA to a joint office. DARPA also canceled the UCAR program in 2004 after the Army withdrew funding. Airlift capabilities may become more important in combating terrorists, impacting acquisition priorities. Roles and missions debates among the services are ongoing. The importance of effective airlift in operations against non-state actors has been recognized for some time. U.S. armed forces fighting non-state actors are likely to encounter dangerous roads, with insurgents employing ambushes, drive-by shootings, and improvised exploding devices (IEDs). Senior DOD leaders responded to the dangerous situation on the ground in mid-December 2004. Senior DOD leaders responded to the dangerous situation on the ground by increasing military cargo hauls via air transportation to protect lives. The effectiveness of using C-130 Hercules airlifters for delivering supplies to remote areas is being questioned due to recent helicopter losses to enemy action. The U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) requires a short-takeoff-and-landing (STOL) aircraft for intra-theater airlift. The Army plans to procure up to 145 Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) to replace aging C-23 Sherpa and C-12 Huron Aircraft. Leading contenders for the contract are the Alenia Aeronautica C-27J and the CASA C-295, with a debate on whether a U.S.-manufactured aircraft would better meet the requirement. The potential procurement of the Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) has caused tension between the Air Force and the Army. The Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) is responsible for strategic and tactical airlift missions, while the Army operates many intra-theater aircraft. Negotiations were ongoing in January 2006 for the procurement of this aircraft. Increased use of small airlifters to support ground troops could pose logistical challenges. The potential procurement of the Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) has caused tension between the Air Force and the Army. The Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) is responsible for strategic and tactical airlift missions, while the Army operates many intra-theater aircraft. Negotiations were ongoing in January 2006 for the procurement of this aircraft. Increased use of small airlifters to support ground troops could pose logistical challenges. Small air units on outlying auxiliary fields face challenges in supplying fuel, ammunition, and other supplies. Efforts may be needed to protect aircraft and personnel, including using UAVs for tactical airlift missions. UAVs are used for tactical airlift of critical payloads like blood plasma, night vision devices, and ammunition. Special Operations Forces use specialized aircraft for covert insertion, extraction, and combat search and rescue missions. Upgrades are being made to improve aircraft capabilities and extend their lifespan. The Air Force is upgrading various aircraft, such as the HH-60G, MH-53J/M Pave Low, and MC-130E/H Combat Talon, with enhancements for propulsion, survivability, and self-protection. Plans include reducing the Pave Low inventory and converting C-130Hs to MC-130H configuration. The Army is upgrading the MH-47G with radar, communications, navigation, survivability, and weapons enhancements to extend its lifespan. New aircraft are being considered for stealthy movement of Special Operations Forces in anti-terrorism or counterinsurgency operations. The V-22 Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft with new capabilities for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Its development has faced challenges and uncertainties. The Air Force considered using the V-22 for CSAR missions but decided to develop the Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) in 2004, later renamed the CSAR-X program. The CSAR-X program could cost $6 billion for 194 aircraft. The Air Force Special Operations command is also studying the M-X aircraft for future CSAR missions. The acquisition of aircraft for CSAR missions raises concerns about cost and need. Specialized equipment makes these aircraft expensive to procure and operate. The Air Force's CSAR-X program is expected to cost $6 billion for 194 new aircraft, with potential increased O&M costs. Replacing the HH-60 with a new helicopter could not only incur $6 billion in new spending but also raise O&M costs unnecessarily. The DOD faces potential budget cuts in the FY2006 budget process, with recommendations to terminate the C-130J and trim aircraft purchases. This could impact SOF-related aircraft programs by reducing funds or driving up costs. The potential proliferation of integrated air defense systems (IADS) is a primary justification for developing advanced combat aircraft like the F/A-22 Raptor. It is uncertain if IADS will pose as much of a threat to low-flying helicopters with self-protection equipment as they will to high-flying fixed-wing aircraft. Iraq's IADS was not as effective against AH-64 Apache helicopters during Operation Desert Storm. The AH-64 Apache helicopters led the first shots in the war against Iraq's integrated air defense systems (IADS), followed by special operations' MH-53 helicopters. Helicopters were chosen for their survivability over fixed-wing aircraft to degrade the IADS. Different perspectives exist among the Services regarding the vulnerability of helicopters, with the Air Force seeking the CSAR-X for increased survivability, while the Army believes their H-60 helicopters are sufficiently survivable with upgrades. Advanced IADS will be used exclusively by nation states, not non-state actors. Non-state actors are likely to use man-portable or easily transportable air defense systems, rather than advanced ones. The need for new SOF helicopters may arise in conflicts with states sponsoring terrorism, not with terrorists or insurgents directly. Command and control aircraft may be necessary for coordinating air support in regions with limited military infrastructure or rapid ground force movements. The Air Force lacks dedicated command-and-control aircraft for ground forces requesting air support, following the retirement of the EC-130E ABCCC in 2002. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, E-3C AWACS took on some ABCCC tasks but faced communication challenges. Ground-based air-control staff in Kuwait sometimes lost contact with attack aircraft in Baghdad. Air Force officers preferred the EC-130E for CAS and CSAR communications, expressing uncertainty about AWACS fulfilling ABCCC's combat role. The Air Force's E-10A aircraft could potentially replace the retired EC-130E ABCCC for ground forces requesting air support. However, funding cuts have delayed the program, with advanced capabilities currently unfunded. Press reports suggest a significant reduction in the E-10 program in the DOD's FY2007 budget. The Air Force's E-10 program in the DOD's FY2007 budget has seen significant reductions. While the Air Force has decreased its airborne command and control capabilities, the Marine Corps and Army are increasing theirs. The Marine Corps operates DASC(A) terminals on KC-130 aircraft, used extensively in Operation Iraqi Freedom but needing upgrades for effectiveness. The system currently relies on paper copies of the daily air tasking order, limiting its capabilities. The Army has been using prototypes of its Army Airborne Command and Control System (A2C2S) in Iraq for approximately one year. The A2C2S, based on UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters, serves as a flying command post for brigade-level commanders to maintain digital command, control, and communications of ground forces. Low rate initial production of the A2C2S began in December 2004, with potential fielding of up to 120 systems. DOD R&D efforts are focused on network-centric approaches to warfighting, with UAVs being a likely platform for these networks. In December 2004, Boeing demonstrated high-speed, secure wireless communications relay on its ScanEagle UAV. DOD has over 400 UAVs supporting combat operations globally, a significant increase from two years ago. Air Force Chief of Staff mentioned around 450 UAVs operating in Iraq, highlighting the need for better organization. In Iraq, there are around 450 UAVs operating, indicating a need for better organization of the large fleet. Non-state actors present smaller, softer targets and often hide behind civilians or civilian infrastructure. The use of smaller, less destructive ordnance against these actors has been recognized for 50 years. Increasing DOD capabilities against non-state actors involves enhancing the precision of weapon delivery. The Air Force is developing the Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), a smaller and more precise weapon than traditional bombs, to target non-state actors more effectively. The goal is to reduce unintended damage to noncombatants or friendly troops by using smaller ordnance. The 16 lb warhead on the AGM-114 Hellfire anti-armor munition is suggested as a better option for soft terrorist targets in close proximity. In recent conflicts, the use of inert practice bombs and Hellfire anti-armor munitions has been explored to minimize collateral damage. However, the non-exploding bombs were often ineffective due to ricocheting. Suggestions for nonexplosive kinetic devices and better utilization of aircraft guns for precision attacks on non-state actors have been proposed. Aerial guns range from .50 caliber machine guns to 105mm cannons, capable of destroying vehicles and buildings. Efforts to reduce ricocheting of bullets are being made to minimize unintended damage, with inert aircraft rounds being developed to decrease ricochet chances by 90%. Aerial guns are most effective against ground targets, but precautions are needed to prevent collateral damage in urban settings. Currently, aerial guns are most effective against ground targets when the aircraft flies at relatively low altitudes, where the aircraft is vulnerable to ground fire. Developing fire-control software for accurate strafing at safe altitudes is suggested. Ground forces have been developing non-lethal weapons for years, such as rubber bullets and tear gas, based on law enforcement experience. Basing non-lethal weapons on military aircraft is gaining momentum, offering a way to detain individuals from the air until ground elements take custody of them. Non-lethal weapons can be employed from the air to disperse crowds, hold them in place, track movement, or incapacitate vehicles. Examples include directed-energy weapons like the Active Denial System and acoustic weapons like The Shout developed by Israel. These weapons could potentially be airdropped for riot control purposes. Non-lethal weapons like \"flash bang\" grenades and electronic incapacitation devices can be airdelivered. The Coast Guard is developing Boat Trap, a propeller-fouling device deployed from helicopters to stop boats. Air delivered dyes and artificial \"snow\" could be used for identification and tracking purposes.

The funding and pursuit of potential munitions improvements relevant to non-state actor threats are being questioned, along with the risks and complications of fielding inert weapons and non-lethal devices. High power requirements, heat generation, and policy constraints on chemical and biological weapons must be considered when implementing new acquisition priorities. The implementation of new acquisition priorities to combat non-state actors may be challenging, especially in making changes to airpower planning, doctrine, coordination, strategy, and tactics. Two overarching mindset changes to consider are Decentralization vs Centralization and Indirect vs Direct Action in employing airpower against modern conventional enemies. The focus is on disrupting the enemy's OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). The OODA loop is a construct for enemy military decision making. Airpower planners aim to disrupt this loop to achieve a strategic effect. Guerrillas, like criminals, follow a strategy of 'protracted war' to avoid rapid defeat. Organizations like Al Qaeda have decentralized command and control systems. The OODA loop is used by enemy military for decision making. Policy makers question if current DOD doctrine is effective against decentralized non-state actors. Air Force and Army lack exercises for close air support. Decentralization is key in fighting non-traditional foes. The U.S. military could benefit from decentralized planning and command when fighting non-traditional enemies, despite traditional centralized air doctrine. The Marine Corps' Small Wars Manual emphasizes matching enemy decentralization with fluid command and independence of action. The U.S. military could benefit from decentralized planning and command when fighting non-traditional enemies, matching enemy decentralization with fluid command and independence of action. Air observers in small wars operations must have greater latitude in assessing ground situations. Contemporary analysts suggest that airpower should emulate law enforcement activities in combating non-state actors. Decentralizing air operations for close air support against non-state actors could involve coordination. Decentralizing air operations for close air support against non-state actors involves coordinating air and ground forces at lower levels of organization within and between Services. The Army is moving aircraft and aviation personnel from corps to division level, with a brigade aviation element attached to all Army ground brigades. Questions remain about the effectiveness of this shift in organizational structure. The Army is considering moving aircraft and personnel from corps to division level to improve aviation support to small Army organizations. There are concerns about coordinating air and ground operations at lower levels based on mission needs. Increasing the use of UAVs could enhance airpower for ground troops and decentralize airpower planning. The Army plans to field three classes of UAVs, with the smallest system intended for use at the platoon level. Pervasively deploying UAVs among the Army's or the Marine Corps' smallest ground units could facilitate detection, targeting of non-state actors, and communication with larger units. UAVs could potentially replace manned aviation for roles like tactical airlift and medical resupply, allowing small units to employ them more responsively. Operational coordination between services typically occurs at battalion level and higher, with Tactical Air Control Parties coordinating air strikes. The Army is interested in increasing training for artillery fire support officers to control aircraft. There is a suggestion to embed air controllers in smaller Army units, like companies or platoons, to decentralize air-to-ground coordination. However, there is a need for additional personnel trained for this mission. A joint force air controller program with standardized training and procedures may be considered. The Army is looking to train its own soldiers to call in air strikes to supplement the Air Force. The Air Force is hesitant and prefers to increase their own air controllers. Air Force officials question if there are enough planes to train more Army controllers due to cultural differences in how airpower is perceived between the two branches. The Marine Corps is facing a shortage of air controllers for company-sized units. To address this, non-aviators are being trained for this role. The Air Force created a Joint Air-Ground Operations office in 2004, focusing on technology improvements rather than doctrinal considerations. Resolving the shortage of air controllers may require senior oversight. The decentralization of air-ground operations may require oversight from senior decision makers. The question for policy makers is how much emphasis should be placed on involving airpower directly against non-state actors, compared to advising and supporting allied airpower activities or allocating resources mainly to ground units searching for terrorist leaders. This decision could impact procurement, training, and O&M budgets. Air forces engaged in direct action against non-state actors face challenges in politically charged environments where their presence can worsen tensions between governments friendly to the United States and local populations sympathetic to terrorists. The Army and Marine Corps highlight the challenges of engaging non-state actors in counterinsurgency operations, emphasizing the risks of a long-term U.S. combat role undermining host nation legitimacy and alienating hostile cultures. Specialized equipment and highly trained personnel are needed for such operations, which could strain resources and impact procurement decisions. Fighting non-state actors requires seasoned pilots and specialized forces, adding complexity to military operations. The growing need to combat non-state actors may stress the current force structure or require an increase. Indirect military aviation involvement in conflicts with non-state actors, such as A-FID, is crucial. Training and assisting other nations' forces in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations is vital. Strengthening friendly-nation airpower could reduce direct U.S. involvement, and good A-FID can provide competent coalition partners, expanding options for U.S. commanders. Some argue that the DOD already focuses too much on direct action. Some argue that the DOD already over-emphasizes direct action against non-state actors, with a focus on specialized aircraft like the AC-130 and CV-22. Advocates for increasing supporting airpower functions, like advising allies in aviation foreign internal defense, believe it aligns with national strategy. Aviation Foreign Internal Defense (A-FID) advocates support the idea of assisting others in defending themselves, aligning with national strategy and the 2003 National Security Strategy. A-FID operations are seen as crucial in shaping foreign air forces and promoting stability in neighboring countries. The A-FID advisors aim to improve Pakistani AirForce's counter guerrilla capabilities to steer them towards building a coast guard instead of a navy, reducing the risk of alienating local populations. A-FID is considered a complement to direct action by the Air Force Special Operations Command, but policymakers may consider increasing resources to elevate A-FID to an equal activity scope as direct action. The 6SOS has an annual budget of approximately $5.6 million. The 6SOS has a small budget of $5.6 million, which is a fraction of the Special Operations Command's budget. They face challenges in acquiring necessary aircraft and require specialized training for their personnel to operate independently in foreign environments. Increasing the 6SOS budget could improve training and personnel numbers, but advancing A-FID activities may require more than just additional resources. The 6SOS has faced challenges due to lack of visibility and influence within the Air Force, hindering its A-FID capabilities. Suggestions to improve traction include requesting annual reports on A-FID, elevating the squadron commander's rank, or making it a joint organization. In November 2005, 2,660 Marines joined the Special Operations Command, including specialists in intelligence and logistics, presenting an opportunity to enhance A-FID capabilities. Adding Marines to the 6SOS could enhance the squadron's capabilities by introducing Marine Corps experience with close air support and FID. This joint capability in A-FID may increase the bureaucratic prominence of the 6SOS, although cultural integration of Air Force and Marine Corps aviation assets could take time to implement."
