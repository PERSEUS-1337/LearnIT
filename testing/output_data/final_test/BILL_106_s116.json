The majority of the remaining funds are allotted to States for distribution to service delivery areas within each State. Regulations will specify how funds for territories should be used. The State allocates funds to service delivery areas based on a formula determined by the Secretary. 33\\1/3\\ percent of the funds are allocated based on the number of unemployed individuals in each area compared to the total number in all areas.
