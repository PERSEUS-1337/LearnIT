    "content": "A tort is a civil wrong where an injured party seeks remedy, usually in the form of damages, arising from breaches of duties imposed by law. Unlike contractual remedies, which stem from breaches of duties in agreements, tort suits are based on legal duties. Tort law covers various civil wrongs like intentional interference with a person, property interference, and negligence. Negligence involves careless or unintentional harm, requiring the plaintiff to prove the defendant's fault by a preponderance of evidence. In negligence cases, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant breached a legal duty by failing to exercise reasonable care, causing harm to the plaintiff. Contractors can be held liable for the actions of their employees under respondeat superior. Contractors often raise defenses like the FTCA, political question doctrine, and derivative immunities in tort claims related to military operations. These defenses involve legal issues such as federal-state law interaction, separation of powers, and protection of the federal government's monetary interests. The federal government enjoys sovereign immunity unless it consents to suit, as specified in the FTCA. The FTCA generally waives the federal government's immunity from tort liability but has exceptions where sovereign immunity is retained, such as claims arising in a foreign country or damages caused by monetary system regulation. Contractors argue for extension of FTCA exceptions to them under preemption doctrine, where federal law supersedes state law. The FTCA exceptions, such as the government contractor defense and combatant activities exception, are used by contractors to protect themselves from tort liability. The discretionary function exception allows the government to maintain sovereign immunity for claims related to discretionary functions or duties. This tension between the FTCA exceptions and imposing tort liability on the government is a key issue. The Supreme Court's 1988 decision in Boyle v. United Technologies Corporation created the government contractor defense, which immunizes contractors from liability for harms caused by defects in government-approved designs. Lower courts have since grappled with whether this defense applies to manufacturing defect claims and claims arising from service contracts. In Boyle, a Marine pilot died in a helicopter crash off the coast of Virginia Beach, leading to a lawsuit against the contractor that built the helicopter to government specifications. The defendant contractor argued for contractor immunity from liability for defects in government-selected designs through a judicially created tort immunity based on the FTCA's discretionary exception. The plaintiff disagreed, stating that courts cannot preempt state law by immunizing contractors without legislative authorization. However, the Court held that judicially created rules can replace state law in areas involving federal interests committed to federal control. The Court applied a two-part test to determine preemption of state law by a judicially created rule, focusing on uniquely federal interests and significant conflicts with federal policy. State law preemption was found appropriate in this case due to the impact on government contracts. The Court concluded that a conflict exists between the discretionary function exception to the FTCA and holding contractors liable under state tort law for design defects in military equipment. Contractors would pass liability costs to the government, contradicting the purpose of the discretionary function exception. The Court found a conflict between the discretionary function exception and holding contractors liable under state tort law for defects in government-selected designs. It preempted state tort law with a judicially created rule for contractor immunity from tort liability to protect the federal interest underlying the discretionary function exception. The Court created a rule to immunize contractors from state tort liability if the United States approved precise specifications, the equipment conformed to those specifications, and the contractor warned the United States about known dangers. The government contractor defense created by the Supreme Court in Boyle immunizes contractors from tort liability for defects in government-approved product designs. However, it does not address whether contractors are immune from liability for manufacturing defects. Lower courts have differed on preempting state tort claims against contractors for manufacturing defects. In a 1993 case, the U.S. District Court in California used Boyle to immunize contractors from liability for manufacturing defects in specific circumstances. In Bentzlin v. Hughes Aircraft Company, six Marines were killed in Kuwait by a missile fired from a U.S. aircraft. The court ruled that the manufacturer was not liable for a manufacturing defect that caused the missile to miss its target and hit the Marines' vehicle, citing the discretionary function exception of the FTCA. This exception grants immunity to contractors for tort liability when sophisticated weaponry designed for combat use is involved. In McMahon v. General Dynamics Corporation, the court ruled that the discretionary function exception does not apply to manufacturing defects. The plaintiff alleged injury from a machine gun defect and sued the contractor, arguing that Boyle did not immunize them. The court agreed, stating that Boyle only applies to government discretion, not manufacturing errors. The court in McMahon v. General Dynamics Corporation ruled that the discretionary function exception does not apply to manufacturing defects. The government contractor defense to manufacturing defect claims is unsettled, with differing outcomes in McMahon and Bentzlin cases. It is unclear how other courts may interpret the government contractor defense in relation to manufacturing claims. Boyle did not address whether the defense extends to contractors performing service contracts. The government contractor defense extends to contractors performing service contracts, as seen in the Hudgens v. Bell Helicopters/Textron case where the defense immunized a contractor whose negligence led to injuries. The contractor in the case failed to properly maintain the helicopter's faulty tail fin, leading to a lawsuit. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that the government contractor defense can apply to service contracts, as government procedures govern contract performance. This defense aims to prevent circumvention of government discretion in creating maintenance protocols. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that the government contractor defense can apply to service contracts, with specific criteria for immunity from tort liability. This defense aims to prevent circumvention of government discretion in creating maintenance protocols. The court considered maintenance procedures in the contract, found government contractor defense applicable, and affirmed summary judgment in favor of the contractor. The Fifth Circuit also recognized this defense in service contracts, modifying Boyle's three-part test. The government contractor defense was applied based on precise specifications provided to the contractor, with the Fifth Circuit emphasizing that specific specifications for one aspect of a project do not extend immunity to the entire project. Courts have used the rationale in Boyle to grant immunity to contractors under the combatant activities exception of the FTCA, which is another example of the government retaining sovereign immunity. The government contractor defense under the combatant activities exception of the FTCA has led to varying court decisions on extending immunity to contractors for tort liability during wartime. Some courts have declined to extend the exception, while others have done so based on their interpretation of combatant activities and federal policy. In McMahon v. Presidential Airways, the U.S. District Court rejected a contractor's argument for immunity under the combatant activities exception of the FTCA. The court determined that contractors only have immunity under the government contractor defense created by the Supreme Court in Boyle, not under the combatant activities exception. The court in McMahon v. Presidential Airways rejected a contractor's claim for immunity under the combatant activities exception of the FTCA, stating that contractors are only immune under the government contractor defense established by the Supreme Court in Boyle. The definition of \"combatant activities\" remains unclear as courts have differed in their interpretations, with some extending the exception to contractors while others have not. Two definitions of combatant activities have emerged: a narrow one from Skeels v. United States and a broader one from Johnson v. United States. Modern cases involving contractors use either definition in defense to tort claims. In Skeels, a man fishing off the coast of Texas died when a pipe particle fell from a U.S.-owned airplane, leading to a negligence lawsuit against the government during World War II. The government was sued for negligence during World War II for using an airplane in combat training exercises. The court rejected the government's defense based on the definition of \"combatant activities\" as engaging in physical force, not just practice or training activities. Johnson's definition of combatant activities is broader than Skeels'. The Ninth Circuit in Johnson looked at the FTCA's wording to define \"combatant activities\" as involving physical violence and activities related to actual hostilities. This interpretation contrasts with the court in Skeels, which initially examined the FTCA's legislative history but found it unhelpful. The Ninth Circuit concluded that \"combat\" refers to physical violence and \"combatant\" pertains to actual hostilities, encompassing both physical violence and activities directly connected to hostilities. In defining combatant activities for tort suits against government contractors, courts have mostly used the Johnson definition over the Skeels definition. However, a recent decision by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia applied the Skeels definition, stating that providing services in support of a war effort does not necessarily constitute combatant activities. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia applied the Skeels definition of \"combatant activities\" in a case involving government contractors. The court rejected the defendants' motion to dismiss, but the Fourth Circuit later reversed, finding that the combatant activities exception shielded the contractors from tort liability. The Fourth Circuit did not specify whether the Johnson or Skeels definition was correct, leaving room for other jurisdictions to follow the narrow definition in Skeels. The Ninth Circuit relied on Boyle and the combatant activities exception to craft a narrow immunity that applies only to claims against contractors by 'enemies' of the U.S. during time of war. In Koohi v. Varian Associates, Inc., the U.S. was engaged in hostilities with Iran, and a U.S. naval cruiser shot down an Iranian civilian aircraft over Iranian waters after mistaking it for a fighter jet. The plaintiffs were heirs of people who subsequently died, and they sued the contractor responsible for designing the naval cruiser's Aegis Air Defense System. The Ninth Circuit applied the combatant activities exception to determine contractor tort immunity in the case involving a U.S. naval cruiser shooting down an Iranian civilian aircraft. The court found that allowing U.S. enemies to impose tort liability on contractors would conflict with the federal policy of owing no duty of care to enemies during times of war. The Ninth Circuit extended the combatant activities exception to contractors, immunizing them against tort suits for acts against U.S. enemies during wartime. This ruling was influenced by the case involving a U.S. naval cruiser shooting down an Iranian civilian aircraft, which highlighted the policy of owing no duty of care to enemies during times of war. The combatant activities exception, as seen in the case of Bentzlin in 1993, extends immunity to contractors for acts against U.S. enemies during wartime. The U.S. District Court ruled that the exception preempts tort claims against a contractor, aligning with the premise that tort law objectives are incongruent with the government's actions. The court ruled that the government is immune from tort law related to combat actions, as punishing the government for war mistakes, compensating victims differently, and deterring necessary actions during war are incongruent with its combat interests. This immunity also extends to contractors, as the government is best positioned to monitor their actions and victims of contractor negligence should not be compensated differently. The court ruled that victims of contractor negligence during war should not be compensated differently from victims of war violence, as it could harm the government's military efforts. The court held that state tort claims against contractor were preempted by the combatant activities exception, which seeks to protect the government's combat interests. Bentzlin court did not provide a clear test for when this exception applies, but it could be interpreted to grant contractors broad immunity against tort claims related to combatant activities. The Saleh v. Titan Corporation case in 2009 extended the combatant activities exception to contractors providing services to the U.S. military in Iraq, granting them broad immunity against state tort claims arising from combatant activities. The D.C. Circuit extended the combatant activities exception to contractors engaged in combatant activities under military orders and command, granting them immunity against state tort claims. This decision aligns with the underlying policy of eliminating tort liability from the battlefield, as established in Boyle. The D.C. Circuit extended the combatant activities exception to contractors integrated into combatant activities under military command, granting them immunity from state tort claims. This decision aligns with the policy of eliminating tort liability from the battlefield, as established in Boyle. The Saleh rule provides contractors with greater protection against claims, regardless of the claimant's status, compared to the Koohi and Bentzlin rules. Courts have generally followed the Saleh rule in resolving combatant activities preemption claims. Contractors have also raised arguments based on the political question doctrine to avoid tort liability. The political question doctrine limits federal courts to hearing cases and controversies that are judicially resolvable, excluding political questions reserved for the legislative or executive branches. This doctrine originated from the Marbury v. Madison case in 1803 and was further defined in the Baker v. Carr case in 1962. In Baker v. Carr (1962), the Supreme Court established standards for determining a political question, including issues committed to the political branches, lack of judicial standards, and the need for nonjudicial discretion. The political question doctrine applies to cases involving military and foreign affairs, with contractors often using it to dismiss tort claims. Courts are more likely to apply the doctrine when the military largely controls the contractor's actions. The political question doctrine may foreclose justiciability of tort claims against contractors when the military exercises significant control over their actions. This is evident in cases like Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown & Root Services (2009) and Lane v. Halliburton (2008) involving accidents during contractor-operated fuel convoys in Iraq. Contributory negligence under state law may also impact the outcome of negligence claims, especially when the plaintiff is a government employee. The cases of Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown & Root Services and Lane v. Halliburton, both involving accidents during contractor-operated fuel convoys in Iraq, demonstrate the impact of the political question doctrine on tort claims against contractors. The Eleventh Circuit in Carmichael dismissed the case based on military control over convoys, while the Fifth Circuit in Lane reversed a dismissal, highlighting the complexity of evaluating contractor negligence in such situations. The Fifth Circuit reversed a district court decision dismissing a case on political question grounds. The court held that a contractor must show that the claim will require reexamination of a military decision and that the military decision is insulated from judicial review to invoke the first Baker factor. The court found that some allegations against the contractor could draw the court into consideration of the military's decision on force protection for convoys. However, the plaintiffs presented plausible factual allegations to establish other claims. The Fifth Circuit found that the plaintiffs' claims against the defendant contractor were separable from military decisions on force protection, allowing the case to proceed. The court emphasized the importance of using ordinary tort standards in evaluating claims against federal contractors to avoid dismissal on political question grounds. The Eleventh Circuit hesitated to apply new standards to the plaintiff's claims due to military control over the convoy. In contrast, the Fifth Circuit found traditional tort standards applicable in addressing similar claims. Timing of a defendant's motion to dismiss can impact the outcome, and courts should analyze questions posed before invoking the political question doctrine. The court's decision on whether to apply the political question doctrine depends on the case's history, the likelihood of a political question arising, and the implications of a judicial ruling. If a defendant files a motion to dismiss based on political question grounds early in the case, the court may not have enough information for a thorough analysis. However, the court may revisit the issue later in the litigation. Additionally, the political question doctrine may not prevent a tort suit against a contractor if the government is involved. The political question doctrine may prevent adjudication of a tort suit against a contractor if the government does not intervene on the contractor's behalf. The government's lack of interest, as shown by its failure to intervene, can influence a court's decision on whether a political question exists. The Third Circuit also found that the government's failure to take a formal position on a claim's justiciability through intervention suggests that the political question doctrine may not apply. The political question doctrine may be applicable in tort suits against contractors, especially when contributory negligence is a defense raised by defendants. This defense increases the likelihood of courts evaluating executive branch policies, particularly when plaintiffs are military or government personnel. The Fourth Circuit's decision in Taylor v. Kellogg, Brown, & Root Services exemplifies this scenario. In Taylor v. Kellogg, Brown, & Root Services, the Fourth Circuit ruled that the defendant's planned defense of contributory negligence would involve assessing a military decision, triggering the political question doctrine. Marines, including the plaintiff, were working on a replacement generator when technicians from the defendant turned on the main generator, leading to the plaintiff's electrocution. The defendant intended to argue contributory negligence and invoked the political question doctrine to dismiss the claim. The Fourth Circuit held that the political question doctrine barred the plaintiff's claim due to the defendant's contributory negligence defense involving the reasonableness of a military decision. Federal employees have absolute immunity under the Westfall Act, passed in 1988 in response to the Supreme Court's Westfall v. Erwin decision, which grants immunity for discretionary functions to promote effective government. Since 1988, federal employees have absolute immunity from tort suits when their tortious conduct occurs within the scope of their employment, thanks to the Westfall Act. Some government contractors have argued for derivative absolute immunity similar to federal employees, with some lower courts recognizing this under certain conditions. Some courts have recognized that contractors may have derivative absolute immunity against tort liability for discretionary functions performed within the scope of their employment. For example, in Martin v. Halliburton, the Fifth Circuit noted that non-governmental entities seeking protection under the Westfall decision must have their acts be discretionary. The Fourth Circuit has also held contractors immune in certain circumstances, as seen in Mangold v. Analytic Services, Incorporated, where a contractor's participation in an Air Force investigation led to immunity against tort claims. The Fourth Circuit held that a contractor cannot be liable for torts resulting from statements given during a government investigation, citing public interest in preventing waste, fraud, and mismanagement. This rule is based on the privilege to testify before government investigators with absolute immunity. In Mangold, the Fourth Circuit established a novel avenue for contractors to claim derivative absolute immunity, distinct from the federal official immunity recognized in Westfall. Contractors have argued for immunity based on the government's immunity in Feres v. United States, but this has not been widely accepted outside the Fourth Circuit. The Feres doctrine prohibits former servicemembers from suing the U.S. government for injuries related to their service, citing the federal relationship between the government and armed forces. Lower courts have interpreted this broadly, extending it to all claims by servicemembers against the government, regardless of who caused the harm. This has implications for lawsuits against contractors for negligence. The Feres doctrine prohibits servicemembers from suing the government for service-related injuries. Courts reject contractor arguments to broaden Feres doctrine for immunity. Indemnification agreements do not absolve contractors from tort liability; they compensate for losses incurred to third parties. Indemnification agreements in government contracts are limited by the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits open-ended agreements without statutory permission. Three statutes - P.L. 85-804, the Price-Anderson Act, and 10 U.S.C. \u00a72354 - allow agencies to enter into such agreements. P.L. 85-804, the Price-Anderson Act, and 10 U.S.C. \u00a72354 allow the President to authorize agencies to enter into contracts for national defense purposes, including indemnifying government contractors against unusually hazardous or nuclear risks. The Price-Anderson Act allows certain civilian agencies to provide indemnification for nuclear accidents to contractors who are not compensated for their losses. This act was enacted to encourage participation in DOE nuclear programs by mitigating uninsurable risks. The Price-Anderson Act allows civilian agencies to indemnify contractors participating in nuclear programs for uninsurable risks. 10 U.S.C. Section 2354 applies to research and development contracts, allowing military departments to include indemnification clauses for losses not covered by insurance. Indemnification can cover claims by third parties, litigation expenses, and property loss caused by \"unusually hazardous\" risks. Payments come from funds allocated for research and development. The government's reliance on contractors, especially in the military sector, has led to an increase in tort suits against them. This trend is expected to continue, including in military operations. Congress has not yet addressed the defenses contractors use to avoid tort liability or clarified when they can escape liability during government contract performance."
