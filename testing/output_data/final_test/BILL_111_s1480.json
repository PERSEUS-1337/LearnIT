    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Breakfast and Education Improvement Act of 2009\". Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of US students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. In fiscal year 2008, 8,520,000 students consumed free or reduced-price school breakfasts. As of the enactment of the Act, 83 percent of public schools provide 9,500,000 school breakfasts annually to at least 130,000 students. Less than half of low-income students benefit from these programs. Many low-income students can only afford one meal per day, with almost 17,000 schools not offering school breakfast programs. In 2008, 13,000,000 children in the US were living in poverty, and 11% of households were food insecure. Missing breakfast hinders academic performance in children. Provision 2 aims to address these issues. Provision 2 reduces burdens for schools providing universal free meals. Schools starting breakfast programs face hurdles like costs and low participation, needing extra resources. Districts using Provision 2 can offer free breakfast with 60-75% eligible students due to savings from reduced costs. Studies have shown that eating breakfast closer to class time improves student performance on standardized tests. Children experiencing hunger are more likely to have behavioral or attention problems. Eating a complete breakfast leads to fewer mistakes and faster work in math exercises. School breakfast programs improve math grades, attendance, and punctuality. Providing breakfast in the classroom enhances attentiveness and academic performance. Providing universal free breakfast, especially in the classroom, has been shown to increase school breakfast participation rates, decrease absences and tardiness, improve nutrition intake, and reduce the risk of being overweight. Use of local produce reduces fuel consumption rates associated with production. The Act aims to enhance student learning and classroom environment by expanding and enhancing school breakfast programs, particularly universal programs provided during the school day. It also emphasizes the use of local produce to reduce fuel consumption rates and promote education on nutrition, farming, sustainability, and energy efficiency. The Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is amended to include grants for expanding school breakfast programs to improve the health and education of children. The term \"qualifying school\" refers to a school where at least 65% of students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches. The Secretary will establish a grant program for local or state educational agencies based on this definition. The grants provided shall not exceed a certain amount determined by a specific calculation. The grant program provides funds to qualifying schools based on the number of schools and the maximum subgrant amount, or a fixed amount of $2,000,000. Local or state educational agencies must use the funds to award subgrants for activities outlined in the program. The grant program provides funds to qualifying schools through subgrants from local or state educational agencies. The amount and term of the subgrant are determined by the agency, with a maximum limit set. The grant program provides funds to qualifying schools through subgrants from local or state educational agencies. The maximum subgrant amount is $50,000 for a single fiscal year or $100,000 for all fiscal years, with a maximum term of 5 fiscal years. Priority is given to schools where 75% or more of students are eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches under the school lunch program. The grant program aims to establish connections between qualifying schools and local agricultural producers. Qualifying schools must have or intend to establish a universal free breakfast program or incorporate breakfast into the school day. The Secretary will provide information on effective strategies to increase school breakfast participation before awarding grants. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local or State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary. The Secretary will develop an application process and advertise the availability of funds to qualified schools. Qualifying schools can use the grant to establish, promote, or expand school programs. The grant can be used to establish, promote, or expand school breakfast programs, increase local food availability, provide nutritional education, extend breakfast availability, offer breakfast during the school day, and boost participation in the program. The grant can be used to establish, promote, or expand school breakfast programs, increase local food availability, provide nutritional education, extend breakfast availability, offer breakfast during the school day, and boost participation in the program. The funds can also be used to compensate for reduced and paid breakfast receipts when operating a universal free breakfast program and provide students with first-hand knowledge of food systems through various activities and collaborations with nutrition experts and nonprofit organizations. The qualifying school can collaborate with various entities to develop service-learning opportunities, compile data on the school breakfast program, and submit reports to the Secretary. All activities must adhere to nutritional guidelines and regulations. The Secretary, in consultation with educational agencies and qualifying schools, must submit an annual report to Congress on the impact of school breakfast programs on classroom performance. Minimum data collection standards will be provided to grant recipients. The evaluation of grant impacts includes assessing the cost-effectiveness of providing universal free breakfasts in qualified schools. Authorization of Appropriations: Such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 are authorized to carry out this section."
