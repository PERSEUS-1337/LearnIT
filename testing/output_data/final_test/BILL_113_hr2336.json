The deposit will cover administrative costs even if they exceed the deposit amount. Administrative costs include determining the mineral character of the land. The Secretary of the Interior determines the mineral character of the land and the fair market value of the mineral interest. Amounts paid to the Secretary of the Interior are deposited into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts."
