    "content": "There are federal restrictions on using appropriations, contract, or grant funds for lobbying purposes. These restrictions generally follow the funds themselves and do not limit advocacy activities with private resources. Specific restrictions for non-profit organizations using federal grant funds were established in 1984. Under current federal provisions, non-profit grantees cannot use federal grant funds for lobbying or political activities unless authorized by Congress. OMB Circular A-122 specifies that costs associated with influencing legislation or political campaigns are unallowable. Unallowable activities include attempting to influence the introduction or modification of legislation through communication with government officials, using publicity or propaganda, or engaging in lobbying campaigns. The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) apply to commercial and nonprofit contractors of the federal government, imposing rules on cost allowances for lobbying and political activities. Costs related to lobbying, public policy influence, advocacy, or political activities are not allocable to federal contracts. The \"Byrd Amendment\" also applies to recipients of federal contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, as well as subcontractors. The statutory and regulatory restrictions prohibit the use of federal funds to pay any person for influencing governmental decisions regarding federal contracts, grants, loans, or cooperative agreements. This includes state or local governments and their authorities. The regulations define \"influencing or attempting to influence\" as making communication or appearance before government officials. Federal contractors or grantees must disclose and certify their lobbying activities under the Byrd Amendment. While they cannot lobby for federal contracts or grants, general lobbying on public policy issues is allowed as long as it does not involve a \"covered action.\" The Byrd Amendment restricts lobbying activities related to federal grants, loans, contracts, and agreements. It does not apply to lobbying on general program legislation. The use of federal funds for lobbying specific actions is limited, but lobbying Congress on program legislation is not covered by the Byrd Amendment. Acquisition Regulation restricts the use of federal funds for lobbying activities, but recipients can use their own or non-federal funds for lobbying. The Byrd Amendment presumes non-federal funds were used for lobbying if the entity has resources other than federal funds. Appropriations law prohibits the use of federal funds for publicity or propaganda directed at legislation pending before Congress. The Government Accountability Office has stated that federal agencies must ensure that funds distributed to private parties are not used in violation of restrictions. This responsibility extends to grantees of federal agencies, who are expected to comply with general appropriations law restrictions. For example, a violation occurred when a local transportation authority used grant funds for a newsletter promoting a specific agenda. The Los Angeles Downtown People Mover Authority, a grantee of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, used grant funds to produce a newsletter urging support for continued funding from Congress. The Comptroller General found this violated the anti-lobbying statute. Later appropriations riders included restrictions on the use of federal appropriations by private contractors. The restriction on the use of federal appropriations prohibits the use of funds for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States, whether directly or indirectly through private contractors. This indicates Congress's emphasis on preventing agencies from using federal funds for such campaigns, even when carried out independently by contractors or grantees. The Government Accountability Office has traditionally interpreted these restrictions broadly. The interpretation of restrictions on federal agencies regarding lobbying campaigns focuses on limiting grassroots lobbying efforts. Agencies are allowed to communicate with the public and legislators about policies without strict prohibitions on expressing views on pending legislation. Congress did not intend to completely restrict agency officials from commenting on legislation, but rather to primarily limit expenditures on direct lobbying activities. The anti-lobbying restriction primarily applies to direct appeals to the public urging them to contact their elected representatives about pending legislation. Expenditures on public policy communications that are informational and not urging contact with legislators do not violate the restriction. For example, Department of Transportation expenditures on informational material about passive restraint systems did not violate the restriction. During Congress's consideration of airbags for cars, GAO noted that while the timing and location of displays seemed like a lobbying ploy, it was not illegal as there was no evidence of urging the public to contact elected representatives. Specific limitations on federal monies or programs also restrict the use of funds for lobbying or propaganda campaigns. Examples include violations found in HHS appropriations legislation. The Comptroller General found violations in HHS appropriations legislation when grant funds were used for lobbying activities, such as urging the public to contact Congress. This interpretation applies to grassroots lobbying campaigns by grantees and contractors. The Office of Legal Counsel has also offered an opinion on this matter. The Department of Justice's counsel has determined that the rider on grantees and contractors in certain appropriations laws is broader than general \"publicity and propaganda\" riders. This could apply to funding communications from contractors and grantees directly to Members of Congress on pending legislation or appropriations. The main prohibition on \"lobbying with appropriated funds\" is a federal criminal statute at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913, which prohibits the use of federal appropriations to influence Members of Congress or officials on various programs, legislation, or appropriations. Originally enacted in 1919, the law was previously interpreted to apply only to federal government officers and employees. The 2002 amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 broadened the prohibition on using federal appropriations for lobbying to cover all levels of government. This law, enacted in 1919, now applies to anyone using federal funds for lobbying, not just federal employees. Enforcement actions based on this provision have never been taken. The 2002 amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 expanded the ban on using federal funds for lobbying to all government levels. Enforcement actions have never been taken under this provision, which exempts certain communications to Congress regarding legislation or appropriations. The 2002 amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 expanded the ban on using federal funds for lobbying to all government levels. Enforcement actions have never been taken under this provision, which exempts certain communications to Congress regarding legislation or appropriations. Propaganda or publicity campaigns funded with appropriated monies urge the public to contact their congressman on an issue before Congress. Restrictions on lobbying may apply to tax-exempt organizations depending on their tax code provisions. Organizations exempt from federal income taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are limited in lobbying activities to maintain tax-exempt status. Lobbying cannot constitute a substantial part of their activities to preserve their preferred tax-exempt status. 501(c)(3) organizations can elect to adhere to specific percentage limitations on expenditures to avoid violating the \"substantial part\" rule. The expenditure test limits lobbying activities to 20% of the first $500,000 of total exempt-purpose expenditures, then decreasing percentages for higher expenditure amounts, with a total limit of $1,000,000. Additionally, there is a separate 25% limit for \"grassroots\" lobbying activities. The tax code limits lobbying by charitable organizations to 20% of the first $500,000 of total exempt-purpose expenditures, with decreasing percentages for higher amounts and a total limit of $1,000,000. There is also a separate 25% limit for grassroots lobbying activities, which involve advocacy to the general public to influence legislators on specific legislation. The definitions and exemptions of \"lobbying\" are crucial for organizations to adhere to expenditure limitations. Not all public advocacy activities are considered grassroots lobbying, and clear advocacy of specific legislation is not grassroots lobbying unless it encourages action. Not all communications to legislators are considered direct lobbying. The tax code exemptions include nonpartisan analysis, technical advice at the request of a governmental body, and self-defense activities. Tax-exempt organizations are allowed to engage in lobbying activities as long as they are related to their exempt function, such as providing technical advice to governmental bodies or engaging in self-defense communications. Lobbying activities by organizations under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code do not have tax consequences as long as they are in line with their exempt purpose. 501(c)(3) charitable organizations can establish a 501(c)(4) affiliate for unlimited lobbying and advocacy activities. The 501(c)(4) affiliate must be separately incorporated and funded independently from the tax-deductible contributions to the parent organization. Restrictions on lobbying activities apply if a 501(c)(4) organization receives federal funds. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, specifically the Simpson Amendment, restricts lobbying activities of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations receiving federal grants or loans. Originally covering all forms of federal monies, the provision now excludes contracts. The Simpson Amendment under P.L. 104-99 restricts lobbying activities for 501(c)(4) organizations receiving federal funds, but allows unlimited lobbying with organizational funds for federal contractors. Legal challenges have been avoided by interpreting the provision to permit lobbying with non-federal funds. The Simpson Amendment under P.L. 104-99 allows 501(c)(4) organizations to separately incorporate an affiliated 501(c)(4) to engage in unlimited lobbying with non-federal funds, avoiding legal challenges. Senator Simpson stated that splitting into two separate organizations would allow one to receive funds and lobby without limits, ensuring the protection of First Amendment rights. 501(c)(4) organizations can receive funds and lobby without limits. Section 501(c)(4)s receiving federal funds may not engage in \"lobbying activities,\" defined in the LDA as direct lobbying contacts and efforts. Organizations using private resources for grassroots lobbying and public advocacy are not engaging in prohibited lobbying activities under this provision. The Lobbying Disclosure Act's definitions of \"lobbying activities\" and \"lobbying contacts\" are important considerations. The Lobbying Disclosure Act's definitions of \"lobbying activities\" and \"lobbying contacts\" do not apply to grassroots lobbying and public advocacy. The \"Simpson Amendment\" does not restrict organizations from using private resources to lobby state or local legislators. Direct lobbying of Congress or high-level executive officials is considered a \"lobbying activity\" under the Act. Groups, individuals, or persons who are federal contractors or federal grantees may be required to file reports and disclosures if they engage in lobbying activities. Organizations engaging in lobbying through compensated personnel must register and file disclosure reports under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. Outside lobbying firms or individual lobbyists retained and compensated above a certain threshold to lobby for an organization/client are also subject to these requirements. Groups, individuals, or persons who are federal contractors or grantees may need to report lobbying activities. Lobbyists retained and compensated above a certain threshold to lobby for an organization/client must file disclosures under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. Non-profit organizations must also disclose lobbying activities, except for churches and their integrated auxiliaries. Recipients of federal grants or contracts must declare if they use their own funds to compensate a registered lobbyist to influence federal actions. Non-profit organizations with annual gross receipts over $25,000 must file Form 990 with the IRS, disclosing lobbying expenditures. Charitable 501(c)(3) organizations must also file Schedule A, detailing expenses for influencing legislation. \"Electing\" organizations must allocate expenses for grassroots and direct lobbying, while non-electing organizations must provide a detailed description of their lobbying activities to the IRS. Recipients of federal grants and contracts are prohibited from using federal funds for political campaign purposes or seeking reimbursement for campaign expenses. Non-profit organizations receiving federal funds are also restricted from using grant funds for political activities, in line with regulations on lobbying activities. OMB Circular A-122 prohibits the use of federal grant funds for political activities, including attempts to influence elections or support political parties. The Federal Acquisition Regulation applies to for-profit businesses contracting with the government in a similar manner. The regulations prohibit the use of federal contract funds for political campaign purposes, including influencing elections or supporting political parties. The Hatch Act also applies to employees of state and local governments regarding political activities. The Hatch Act provisions apply to employees of state and local governments involved in federally funded activities. While generally not applicable to personnel of private non-profit organizations receiving federal funds, there are exceptions where certain non-profit agencies are designated as \"state or local\" governmental agencies under specific federal programs. The Hatch Act applies to employees of state and local governments involved in federally funded activities. Certain private non-profit agencies receiving federal funds can be designated as \"state or local\" agencies under specific federal programs, such as the Community Services Block Grant Program. For entities receiving assistance under specific federal programs, such as the Community Services Block Grant Program, they are considered State or local agencies. These agencies must adhere to the restrictions outlined in the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan political activities or support for partisan candidates. The Hatch Act imposes restrictions on political activities of employees, including prohibiting the use of official authority to interfere in elections, coercing fellow employees to make contributions, and partisan candidacy for public office. The Hatch Act allows state and local employees to participate in political activities outside of work hours, except for specific restrictions. It does not apply to nonpartisan voter registration or get-out-the-vote campaigns. Employees negotiating a contract with the federal government are prohibited from making political contributions during the contract duration. The restriction on federal contractors prohibits making political contributions to parties or candidates in federal elections, but allows donations from personal assets of partners in partnerships. This restriction only applies to direct or indirect contributions to candidates, parties, or committees, not independent expenditures. Federal government contractors are prohibited from making contributions for federal elections. Federal contractors are prohibited from making contributions to federal elections but can establish separate segregated funds for voluntary contributions. Recipients of federal grants and contracts must use the funds for intended purposes. Violating regulations by using federal funds for partisan advocacy could constitute a conspiracy to defraud the government. The Supreme Court defines conspiracy to \"defraud the United States\" as interfering with lawful governmental functions through deceit or trickery. A court upheld a charge where individuals used federal funds for political objectives unrelated to legitimate business. In Pintar, the court found that the conspiracy count of defrauding the United States could be sustained without actual harm shown, as long as dishonest means were demonstrated, such as a pattern of concealment. Corporations and labor organizations are now prohibited from using treasury funds for campaign contributions in federal elections. The Supreme Court's ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission allows corporations to make unlimited independent campaign expenditures in federal elections from their general treasury funds. However, they are still prohibited from using these funds for campaign contributions. Corporations can establish separate segregated funds, known as political action committees (PACs), for receiving voluntary contributions from individuals for political campaign contributions. Non-profit organizations with tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code are restricted from participating in political campaigns. They can engage in nonpartisan activities related to elections while retaining their tax-exempt status. Voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives are examples of such activities. Nonprofit organizations with tax-exempt status can engage in nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. Nonpartisan activities are those that do not favor any particular political party and are considered beneficial for increasing civic participation. Nonprofit organizations with tax-exempt status can engage in nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This includes activities such as voter registration drives and get-out-the-vote campaigns, which are considered beneficial for increasing civic participation. Nonprofit organizations with tax-exempt status can engage in nonpartisan voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. Rules for contractors and grantees regarding registration and get-out-the-vote drives are similar to those for lobbying and campaign activities. Entities receiving federal contracts or grants can use their own resources for voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns, but federal grant monies must be used for specified purposes according to federal law and appropriation. Appropriations must be used only for their intended purposes as stated in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(a). In the grant context, funds must be used only for authorized purposes determined by relevant legislation. Grantees cannot use federal funds for voter registration or get-out-the-vote efforts unless specified in the grant or contract. Additional restrictions apply to non-profit and for-profit entities using federal funds for influencing activities. The Federal Acquisition Regulations do not explicitly cover nonpartisan voter registration activities funded by federal dollars. However, using federal grant and contract funds for such activities may be prohibited unless authorized by law. Specific restrictions on activities may be outlined in grant regulations, guidance, or agreements. Certain federal programs may have statutory limitations on the use of funds for certain activities, including voter-related efforts. Restrictions on using federal funds for voter registration or get-out-the-vote campaigns are outlined in the law establishing the Community Services Block Grant Program. This includes prohibitions on providing transportation to the polls or voter registration activities using program funds. Restrictions on using federal funds for voter registration or get-out-the-vote campaigns apply to the Community Services Block Grant Program, Head Start programs, and the Corporation for National and Community Service. These restrictions do not extend to organizations and activities outside of the federally assisted programs. The Legal Services Corporation prohibits attorneys from engaging in voter registration activities. Restrictions on using federal funds for voter registration or get-out-the-vote campaigns apply to certain programs, but not to organizations outside of these programs. Concerns arise regarding First Amendment rights if private entities are restricted from engaging in public advocacy or voter registration activities in exchange for federal funding. In Eastern Railroads President Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that lobbying activities are protected by the First Amendment, allowing rival businesses to lobby for favorable legislation without restriction. The Court emphasized the importance of lobbying in a representative democracy. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of lobbying, public advocacy, and political expression as crucial freedoms in preserving an open democracy. They have noted the national commitment to uninhibited debate on public issues. The Supreme Court has recognized lobbying, political speech, and expression as protected First Amendment rights, ensuring that regulations on these activities do not overly burden these rights. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court upheld limits on political contributions but struck down restrictions on certain entities' monetary amounts. The Supreme Court upheld limits on political contributions in Buckley v. Valeo but struck down restrictions on expenditure ceilings for political advocacy in federal elections. The Court emphasized that these restrictions directly limit political speech, which is essential for democracy and First Amendment freedoms. This decision reaffirmed the importance of unfettered political debate and advocacy by private parties in the context of political campaigns, as seen in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Political speech is crucial for democracy and holding officials accountable. The First Amendment protects citizens' right to inquire, hear, speak, and use information for informed decision-making. Laws that suppress political speech must be overcome to ensure a free exchange of ideas during political campaigns. When laws require disclosure of political advocacy activities, they undergo rigorous constitutional scrutiny due to potential deterrent effects on First Amendment rights. Congress has the authority to limit or regulate the use of appropriated funds. When legislative or regulatory provisions directly restrict political advocacy and expression of private entities receiving federal funds, it must be analyzed under heightened scrutiny of First Amendment principles. The Supreme Court has emphasized that restrictions on constitutionally protected activities cannot be justified easily. The Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions on constitutionally protected activities of private entities receiving federal funds must be analyzed under heightened scrutiny of First Amendment principles. Congress cannot redefine conditions on funding as program definitions to avoid First Amendment scrutiny. The government cannot deny benefits to individuals for exercising constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has established that the government cannot condition the receipt of public benefits on giving up protected First Amendment rights. This was affirmed in a lower federal court decision regarding lobbying by \"consumer groups\" seeking a state contract, where it was ruled that barring lobbying by state contractors with their own funds would violate their constitutional rights. The Attorney General's policy restricts the first amendment right to petition the government by deterring lobbying activities. Individuals and organizations are forced to choose between lobbying and receiving government benefits, which violates their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government cannot withhold benefits to restrict lobbying activities. The Supreme Court has established that receiving federal benefits cannot be conditioned upon giving up constitutional rights, specifically the First Amendment freedom of speech. This principle prevents the government from penalizing or inhibiting individuals for exercising their constitutionally protected interests. The Supreme Court has recognized the right of independent contractors not to be terminated for exercising their First Amendment rights. The Court prohibits the denial of governmental benefits for private parties who exercise their First Amendment rights of speech and advocacy. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government cannot deny benefits to individuals who exercise their First Amendment rights, even if they receive small subsidies. While the government can impose conditions on recipients of federal benefits, it cannot suppress their viewpoints on public matters. Justice Blackmun has stated that denying deductions for lobbying expenses is constitutional, but penalizing taxpayers who lobby by denying all business expense deductions would be unconstitutional. An attempt to deny deductions for business expenses to a taxpayer who lobbies would unconstitutionally penalize the exercise of First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has ruled that withholding all welfare benefits from someone who exercises the right to an abortion would likely be impermissible. In Speiser v. Randall, it was found that the state cannot condition eligibility for tax-exemption based on violations of First Amendment freedoms. The Supreme Court found the federal statutory ban on public broadcasters \"editorializing\" unconstitutional in Federal Communications Commission v. League of Women Voters of California. The ban on non-commercial broadcast stations receiving grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from providing their own expression and opinions on public interest matters was deemed unconstitutional as it was not narrowly tailored. The Supreme Court found the federal statutory ban on public broadcasters \"editorializing\" unconstitutional in Federal Communications Commission v. League of Women Voters of California, as it was not narrowly tailored to address the government's justifications. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the argument for maintaining restrictions on corporate campaign expenditures was dismissed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court dismissed the notion that government benefits could be given in exchange for forfeiting First Amendment privileges, stating that the state cannot require the forfeiture of First Amendment rights as a condition for special advantages granted to corporations. This raises questions about whether broad restrictions on independent expenditures for political speech by individuals, firms, associations, or corporations could be imposed as a condition for receiving federal grants. Under current federal law, government contractors are prohibited from making campaign contributions. The Supreme Court distinguishes between campaign contributions to candidates/parties and independent campaign expenditures, with the latter receiving greater First Amendment protection. Independent expenditures are not subject to the same corruption concerns due to the absence of pre-arrangement or coordination. The Buckley Court recognized the government's interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption in campaign contributions. They emphasized that independent expenditures, unlike direct contributions, do not pose a risk of quid pro quo corruption due to the absence of prearrangement or coordination with the candidate. The Supreme Court in Citizens United concluded that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption. This decision questioned the need for government restrictions on contractor expenditures for independent political speech. Subsequent to Citizens United, courts have been more critical of limitations on such expenditures. Subsequent to Citizens United, courts have been more critical of limitations on campaign contributions. One state Supreme Court invalidated a law against contributions by government contractors as an unconstitutional intrusion into First Amendment rights. Federal contribution limitations on groups making independent expenditures were also found unconstitutional. Congress can impose conditions on federal funds, but some cases found these conditions unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has allowed the government to impose restrictions on the use of federal funds by private parties for certain speech within a program partially funded by the government, as seen in Rust v. Sullivan. This restriction only applies to the federally funded program, not the recipient of the funds, who can still independently engage in the restricted speech. The Supreme Court in Rust v. Sullivan allowed the government to impose restrictions on the use of federal funds for certain activities within a program, without placing conditions on the recipient of the subsidy. The Court emphasized that the restrictions only apply to the particular program or service funded by the government, ensuring that public funds are spent for their authorized purposes. Chief Justice Rehnquist distinguished this from cases involving unconstitutional conditions where the government restricts the recipient of the subsidy from engaging in protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program. The Supreme Court has allowed the government to limit speech when funding activities or programs to ensure the message is not distorted, but this does not extend to all activities and programs. The Supreme Court has ruled that government restrictions on speech in funded activities do not apply to all programs. In Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, the Court overturned a restriction on grantees lobbying for changes in welfare legislation, stating that such speech cannot be considered \"government speech\" and is not subject to regulation under the government speech doctrine. The Supreme Court has engaged in reinterpretation of previous precedents on \"unconstitutional conditions\" cases, such as in Velazquez and Rust v. Sullivan. The Court discussed the concept of \"government speech\" in Rust and later cases, allowing viewpoint-based funding decisions when the government is the speaker or uses private speakers to convey program information. In some instances, private organizations may act as surrogates for government agencies in administering public funds or programs, leading to potential restrictions on partisan political activities under the Hatch Act. If private parties perform governmental functions or manage public programs on behalf of the government, limitations on their activities could be imposed. The Supreme Court has acknowledged limited speech restrictions like the Hatch Act to allow governmental entities to function effectively. However, this rationale may not apply strongly to contractors providing goods or services to the government. The Court emphasizes that while First Amendment rights are fundamental, they are not absolute and must be balanced with conflicting interests. The Supreme Court balances conflicting interests when limiting First Amendment rights, using \"strict scrutiny\" to assess if there are compelling governmental interests that outweigh the restrictions. If so, the Court examines if the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote those interests. The Supreme Court uses \"strict scrutiny\" to assess if compelling governmental interests outweigh restrictions on First Amendment rights. In cases involving political advocacy and lobbying disclosure, protecting governmental processes and preventing corruption and undue influences are important interests that may justify limitations on First Amendment activities. The Supreme Court has struck down restrictions on advocacy speech and political activities not narrowly tailored to prevent corruption or undue influence. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court found that restrictions on independent expenditures by private entities in political campaigns were not justified by the interest in preventing corruption. The Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions on independent expenditures do not prevent corruption. Legislation restricting private entities from engaging in political advocacy with their own resources may not prevent corruption or undue influence on government processes. The Supreme Court has determined that limitations on independent expenditures do not necessarily prevent corruption or undue influence on government processes. The absence of pre-arrangement or coordination with a candidate in making an \"independent expenditure\" by a private entity mitigates against corrupting influences or quid pro quo agreements. The Court also rejected the idea that limiting the influence of monied interests in political campaigns is a compelling government interest. The governmental interest in campaign finance regulation may be to protect government funds and programs by preventing the use of federal funds for unauthorized political activities. This includes avoiding the subsidizing of political advocacy or lobbying by private parties with federal dollars. Federal law does not require the government to directly fund private political activities. The federal government prohibits the use of contract or grant funds for lobbying and political purposes. It can limit funds for specific public purposes and does not have to subsidize private advocacy activities. The denial of tax deductions for lobbying expenses is permissible. The denial of tax deductions for lobbying expenses is permissible as individuals engaging in constitutionally protected activities must pay for those activities out of their own pockets, in line with the Internal Revenue Code. The government's interest is to avoid directly subsidizing private lobbying with public funds. The restriction on privately funded advocacy by grant or contract recipients may be considered over-inclusive and burdensome on First Amendment rights. A less restrictive approach could involve implementing more effective audits and regulations to prevent the use of federal funds for lobbying or political activities. The government's interest in limiting the use of federal funds for advocacy activities by private recipients is to prevent an indirect subsidy for political advocacy. This would not restrict protected First Amendment speech and would not punish entities for engaging in public advocacy on community, civic, and national issues. The argument for lobbying a tax exemption for organization activities is based on the concept of money being \"fungible\", allowing grants and contracts for public purposes to free up non-federal funds for other activities. However, questions arise regarding whether government grants or contracts for specific purposes are considered subsidies for private activities funded by non-federal sources. The Supreme Court has ruled that such grants do not constitute subsidies for other non-federally funded activities. In Liberty v. Regan, the Supreme Court ruled that providing grant funds to a religious organization for a secular purpose does not constitute a federal subsidy for other private, non-federally funded religious activities. The Court rejected the argument that all aid is forbidden because it frees up resources for religious ends. The Supreme Court has rejected the theory that government assistance to an organization for some activities could justify direct restrictions on protected First Amendment conduct in other independent activities. This concern may not be recognized as a \"compelling\" interest justifying restrictions on a private entity's use of its own resources outside of government-sponsored programs."
