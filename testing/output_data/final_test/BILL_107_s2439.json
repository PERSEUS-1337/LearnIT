    "content": "The \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2002\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings related to human cloning. Congress finds human cloning to be unsafe, immoral, and unacceptable. Federal legislation should prohibit all attempts at human cloning, with severe penalties for offenders. Recommendations from the National Academies and the National Bioethics Advisory Commission emphasize the importance of not hindering scientific research, such as nuclear transplantation for stem cells. The National Academies highlight significant differences between human cloning and nuclear transplantation. The National Academies found that nuclear transplantation, unlike human cloning, does not involve implantation of an embryo in a uterus and cannot produce a live-born animal. They concluded that scientific justifications for banning human cloning do not apply to nuclear transplantation, which has potential for treating diseases and increasing biological knowledge. The National Academies support nuclear transplantation research for treating various diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, and diabetes. This research could improve organ transplants by using stem cells to reduce rejection and eliminate the need for harmful immunosuppressive drugs. Nuclear transplantation is deemed valuable and should not be banned. The National Academies recommend close scrutiny and ethical requirements for nuclear transplantation research involving human subjects. Biomedical research facilities impact interstate commerce, and strict ethical standards should be applied to all research in this area. Patients regularly cross state lines to access clinical facilities, which are part of an interstate market involving biomedical research and the purchase of medical supplies. The Act aims to ban human cloning and safeguard medical research, including stem cell research. The Act prohibits human cloning, defining terms like human cloning, human somatic cell, nuclear transplantation, nucleus, and oocyte. The Act prohibits human cloning, including the use of oocytes for this purpose. It is illegal to conduct human cloning or ship cloned products across state or international borders. Violators face criminal fines and imprisonment. The Act prohibits human cloning and imposes penalties for violations, including a civil penalty of $1,000,000 or three times the gain from the violation. Property used in violations is subject to forfeiture. There is no private right of action for individuals. Ethical requirements for nuclear transplantation research are also outlined in the Public Health Service Act. ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR NUCLEAR TRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH, INCLUDING INFORMED CONSENT, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD REVIEW, AND SAFETY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION. Definitions for nuclear transplantation research are provided, including terms like human somatic cell, nuclear transplantation, nucleus, and oocyte. Research in this area must adhere to federal ethical standards outlined in specific regulations. The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2002 imposes civil penalties for intentional violations, with a maximum penalty of $250,000. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for enforcing this section."
