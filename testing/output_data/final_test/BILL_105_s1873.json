Congress finds that the threat of weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-range ballistic missiles is a serious security issue for the United States, as certified by President Clinton in 1994. This state of emergency was reaffirmed in subsequent years. In 1994, President Clinton emphasized the importance of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles for global security. He also highlighted Saddam Hussein's focus on developing weapons of mass destruction in 1998. The Senate affirmed in 1996 the critical need for the United States to defend against these threats. The United States faces an increasing threat of long-range ballistic missile attacks from various adversaries, including Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi who expressed the desire to possess missiles capable of reaching New York. The United States faces a growing threat of long-range ballistic missile attacks from adversaries like Abu Abbas and Saddam Hussein, who express ambitions of reaching American shores and possessing missiles capable of reaching Washington. It is crucial for the US and Israel to make peace with Palestinians before Arab countries acquire such capabilities. Iran's aggressive pursuit of medium-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Central Europe, aided by outside agents, demonstrates Tehran's intent to acquire increasingly longer-range ballistic missiles. Over 30 non-NATO countries possess ballistic missiles, with at least 10 developing new types. Ballistic missiles were used in one conflict from the end of World War II until 1980. Since 1980, thousands of ballistic missiles have been fired in at least six different conflicts. Countries hostile to the United States are developing ballistic missiles with greater range, such as North Korea's Taepo-Dong missiles capable of striking Alaska and Hawaii, and Iran's pursuit of longer-range ballistic missiles. Iran is developing ballistic missiles with ranges including the Shahab-3 and Shahab-4, capable of striking Central Europe. Iraq has produced the Al-Hussein missile with twice the range of its Scud Bs. Experience with shorter-range missiles aids in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The resources needed for building ballistic missiles are increasingly accessible globally. Advances in information technology have made technical information on missile design widely available. Components and materials for missile development are also more accessible in the aerospace industry. The demand for satellite-based telecommunications is contributing to the need for ballistic missiles. The demand for commercial Space Launch Vehicles, driven by telecommunications needs, is increasing. Russia and China are assisting rogue nations in developing ballistic missile programs, accelerating their efforts. China and Russia are the main suppliers of dual-use goods and modern weapons to countries of concern. Despite Russian assurances not to assist Iran with its ballistic missile program, there is a disconnect between reassurances and actual actions. China's actions in missile proliferation are also a concern. The Director of Central Intelligence expressed uncertainty about China's commitment to nonproliferation, stating that continued monitoring of Chinese activities is necessary. The United States' vulnerability to long-range ballistic missile attacks further motivates hostile nations to develop such weapons. The United States' vulnerability to long-range ballistic missile attacks motivates hostile nations to develop such weapons. The Intelligence Community has failed to anticipate past technical innovations, allowing rogue states to obtain or develop ballistic missiles with increasing range. In June 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence reported to Congress about Third World countries, like Iran, using legitimate commercial firms for procurement and developing complex networks. Additionally, gaps and uncertainties hinder predicting when other countries will deploy ICBMs. The Director also testified in 1997 that Iran would have a medium-range missile by 2007. The Director of Central Intelligence reported in 1997 that Iran could have a medium-range missile much sooner than previously assessed, potentially as early as late 1998. This failure to prepare for long-range ballistic missile threats could have severe national security consequences for the United States. The United States faces the threat of rogue nations acquiring long-range ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction, which could have catastrophic consequences for its citizens and property. This could also limit the US's options in dealing with regional threats, weaken alliances, and impact its world leadership position. The United States Senate emphasized the need for missile defenses to counter long-range ballistic missile threats in the START II Treaty resolution. Secretary of Defense Perry proposed a shift from Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) to Mutual Assured Safety (MAS) in the post-Cold War era. The Under Secretary of Defense for Policy highlighted the importance of new deterrent strategies in 1997. The United States Senate emphasized the need for missile defenses against long-range ballistic missile threats. The Defense for Policy testified to the Senate about the potential deployment of a limited national missile defense system in response to a rogue state developing long-range ICBMs capable of reaching the United States. Currently, the US has no defense deployed against such threats. The United States Senate highlighted the necessity of missile defenses against long-range ballistic missile threats. The Defense for Policy discussed the potential deployment of a limited national missile defense system to protect against rogue states with long-range ICBMs. The policy aims to deploy an effective National Missile Defense system to defend the US territory against limited ballistic missile attacks."
