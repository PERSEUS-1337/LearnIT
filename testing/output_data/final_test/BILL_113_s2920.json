    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nazi Social Security Benefits Termination Act of 2014\". It includes findings related to the termination of benefits. Congress finds that the United States has been a refuge for victims fleeing persecution and survivors of the Nazi Holocaust. To protect the integrity of the refugee system and ensure that former persecutors do not find safe haven, the US policy excludes those who participated in Nazi persecution. Laws were enacted to exclude or remove such individuals from the country. The US policy excludes individuals who participated in Nazi persecution from the benefits of citizenship or residency. Denial of federal public benefits to Nazi persecutors is addressed in Section 3.
