    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Southern High Plains Groundwater Resource Conservation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The High Plains Aquifer, including the Ogallala Aquifer, is crucial for the economy of communities in the region. Water levels in the aquifer have significantly declined, with the Southern Ogallala Aquifer experiencing over 100 feet of decline in certain areas from 1950 to 1997. The High Plains Aquifer has experienced significant declines, with some areas seeing over 100 feet of decline from 1950 to 1997. The saturated thickness has also decreased by over 50 percent in certain areas, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the region. Hydrological modeling by the US Geological Survey shows that reductions in groundwater pumping at the local level have limited impact on conserving the water table, discouraging individual water users from investing in conservation measures. Incentives for regional groundwater conservation are necessary to ensure sustainability. To promote groundwater conservation on the Southern High Plains and extend the usable life of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, water policymakers and users need reliable information on aquifer recharge rates, extraction rates, and water table levels. The text chunk is about defining terms related to groundwater conservation and the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The Act defines terms related to groundwater conservation, including the High Plains Aquifer and the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The High Plains Aquifer is a groundwater reserve depicted in a USGS publication, while the High Plains refers to the land surface above it in several states. The Southern Ogallala Aquifer is a part of the High Plains Aquifer located below 39 degrees north latitude in specific states. The term \"Southern High Plains\" refers to areas in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas overlying the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. The term \"Secretary\" can mean either the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture. \"Water conservation measures\" are actions that improve groundwater recharge rates or water use efficiencies. SEC. 4. HYDROLOGIC MAPPING, MODELING, AND MONITORING PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Interior, through the US Geological Survey, will develop a comprehensive program for mapping, modeling, and monitoring the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. This includes county-level maps and analysis of groundwater withdrawal rates, migration factors, and aquifer compaction effects on storage capacity. The Secretary will provide an annual report on the status of the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, including storage capacity, recharge rates, and saturated thickness loss. The report will be submitted to relevant committees and governors of specific states. SEC. 5. GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a groundwater conservation assistance program for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, providing financial and technical support for developing conservation plans in the Southern High Plains on a cost-share basis. Federal funding for plan development will not exceed 50 percent of the cost. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a groundwater conservation assistance program for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, providing financial and technical support for developing conservation plans in the Southern High Plains on a cost-share basis. Federal funding for plan development will not exceed $50,000. The Secretary will create a certification process for comprehensive groundwater conservation plans, covering a sufficient geographic area, including water conservation goals, and requiring annual evaluations for modifications if goals are not met. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a groundwater conservation assistance program for the Southern Ogallala Aquifer, providing financial and technical support for developing conservation plans in the Southern High Plains on a cost-share basis. Federal funding for plan development will not exceed $50,000. The Secretary will create a certification process for comprehensive groundwater conservation plans. Farming operations with certified conservation plans are eligible for assistance for water conservation projects. This includes grants of up to $50,000 for implementing on-farm water conservation measures, with a federal share of no more than 50 percent. Additionally, the Secretary will carry out an irrigated land reserve program until 2020. The Secretary will enroll lands in a groundwater conservation reserve program using multiple year contracts for irrigated lands to save groundwater resources. Eligible lands for the Conservation Reserve Program will receive 20 bid points for significant groundwater savings if removed from agricultural production. Authorization of appropriations includes $5,000,000 annually for hydrologic mapping, $5,000,000 annually for groundwater conservation planning, $30,000,000 annually for on-farm water conservation measures, and $30,000,000 annually for enrollment of lands in an Irrigated Lands Reserve until fiscal year 2020."
