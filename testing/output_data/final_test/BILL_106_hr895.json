    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Funding Act of 1999\". The Congress acknowledges the significant role of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in global population stabilization, women's empowerment, and healthcare. UNFPA focuses on maternal and child health programs, family planning services, contraception supply, HIV/AIDS prevention, and women's rights enhancement. It does not provide funding for abortion services. UNFPA aims to reduce abortion rates by improving access to contraceptives and treating complications. Despite operating in over 160 countries, it lost US funding in 1999, leading to significant negative impacts on women's health in the developing world. UNFPA assists countries in planning and slowing population growth to address global environmental problems. It upholds the right of individuals to decide on family planning without coercion. The UNFPA programs align with human rights principles and aim to address population issues without coercion. The US should address concerns about China's population policies through bilateral discussions on human rights, rather than withholding funding from UNFPA. UNFPA's new country program in China focuses on promoting voluntarism, expanding contraceptive choices, improving reproductive health services, and empowering women. The United States authorizes $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 for voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund, with limitations on the contribution amount. The United States allocates funds for voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, with a provision to withhold funds for the country program in China unless certain conditions are met. The President must certify that the program focuses on voluntary family planning and adheres to human rights principles. The International Conference on Population and Development principles are implemented in China without quotas or coercive measures, overseen by the UNFPA executive board, monitored for informed consent, and suspends operations for violations."
