    "content": "This report provides a historical overview of federal funding provided to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between FY1995 and FY2021. NIH is the primary federal agency for medical, health, and behavioral research, consisting of the Office of the Director (OD) and 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) focusing on health, human development, and biomedical science. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducts a wide range of research activities across various areas of human health and biology. More than 80% of its budget funds external research through grants and contracts, supporting over 300,000 individuals at research institutions nationwide. Additionally, about 10% of the budget is allocated to internal research conducted by NIH physicians and scientists. Funding for NIH primarily comes from annual Labor, HHS, and Education allocations. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland receives funding primarily from annual Labor, HHS, and Education (LHHS) Appropriations Acts. A smaller amount comes from the Superfund Research Program. The PHS Evaluation Tap transfer authority allows for redistribution of funds for program evaluation and implementation purposes. Since FY2010, the maximum set-aside level for NIH funding has been 2.5% of eligible appropriations. Funding for NIH also comes from LHHS appropriations, with additional funding from the NIH Innovation Account created by the Cures Act. Amounts transferred in pursuant to PHS tap are included in totals, but not amounts transferred out. Appropriations to the NIH Innovation Account are subtracted from cost estimates for enforcing discretionary spending limits. The NIH Innovation Account, authorized by the Cures Act, is not subject to discretionary spending limits. The NIH Director can transfer funds for specified purposes, with any unused amounts going back to the Innovation Account. Funding has been fully appropriated from FY2017 to FY2020, with $492 million for FY2020 and $404 million authorized for FY2021. Additionally, NIH receives $150 million annually for type 1 diabetes research under the PHSA Section 330B. The NIH received additional funding for diabetes research through FY2020 and partial-year FY2021. The total NIH program level for FY2020 includes discretionary LHHS appropriations, PHS program evaluation transfer, Superfund research program funding, and mandatory type 1 diabetes research program funding. The FY2021 budget documents show the NIH FY2020 program level as $41.685 billion. The NIH received emergency supplemental appropriations totaling $1.8 billion from the first and third coronavirus supplemental appropriations acts. An additional $1.8 billion was transferred from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to two NIH institutes and the Office of the Director. This results in a total funding increase of 8.6% over regular enacted FY2020 appropriations, amounting to not less than $3.6 billion across the three acts. Various transfer authorities allow for additional transfers to and from NIH accounts. President Trump's FY2021 initial budget request proposed a total program level of $38.694 billion for NIH, a decrease of $2.99 billion from FY2020-enacted levels. The proposed program level included appropriations from LHHS, transfers to NIH, funding for the Cures Act Innovation Account, Superfund Research Program, and mandatory type 1 diabetes program. All existing IC accounts would be maintained under the request. The FY2021 budget request proposed changes in funding levels for various programs within NIH. The Building and Facilities account would receive an increase in budget authority, while an amendment requested additional funding for NIAID to support research on infectious diseases, including coronaviruses. The FY2021 budget request includes a total program level of $39.133 billion for NIH, a decrease of $2.55 billion from FY2020. It also proposes consolidating AHRQ into NIH to form a new institute, NISRQ, with a total appropriation of $355.112 million. This would require amendments to the PHSA due to the current limit of 27 institutes. The FY2021 budget request includes $256.66 million in discretionary LHHS budget authority and $98.452 million in mandatory appropriations from the PCORTF. Congress did not adopt the Administration's proposal to consolidate AHRQ into NIH as NIRSQ. Funding levels for programs and activities within NIH accounts are based on the Administration's research priorities. Congress generally does not specify NIH funding for particular diseases or areas of research. Funding awards are made on a competitive basis through various mechanisms. NIH funding has fluctuated over the past 25 years, with periods of high and low growth. Between FY1994 and FY1998, funding increased from $11.0 billion to $13.7 billion. By FY2003, the budget doubled to $27.2 billion. Funding then increased gradually until FY2015, with occasional decreases in some years. From FY2016 to FY2020, NIH saw annual funding increases of over 5%. NIH funding has seen consistent increases from FY2016 to FY2020, with the largest single-year nominal dollar increase since FY2003 occurring from FY2017 to FY2018. Adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of NIH funding peaked in FY2003 and declined until recent back-to-back funding increases. The FY2021 budget request would still be 13.0% below the peak FY2003 program level. Congress and the President have been specifying funding levels for programs or research areas in recent years. In recent years, Congress and the President have specified funding levels for programs or research areas within NIH accounts. Funding is generally awarded competitively through various mechanisms to balance scientific opportunity with health priorities. In FY2020, Congress used explanatory language to designate IC funding for specific purposes. In FY2020, Congress specified funding levels for programs within NIH accounts through explanatory language, superseding amounts in the House report. Additional statements in both documents prioritize certain programs or research areas."
