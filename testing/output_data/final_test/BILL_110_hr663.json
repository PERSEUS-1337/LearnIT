The US Government should focus on the humanitarian impact of the war in Iraq, particularly the refugee crisis. Special attention should be given to vulnerable Iraqi refugee populations, including those who worked with the United States Armed Forces, ethnically mixed families, and religious minority groups. The President, through the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State, should negotiate refugee resettlement agreements or devise strategies for the admission of Iraqi refugees into the United States. The US Government should provide assistance to refugees for their well-being, safety, and integration. Congress believes the President should request additional funding for this purpose."
