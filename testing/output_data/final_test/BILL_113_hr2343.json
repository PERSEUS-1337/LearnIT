Congress finds that the United States is facing an obesity epidemic with 30.5% of children aged 10-17 being overweight or obese. This epidemic leads to increased rates of chronic illnesses and costs the US $147 million in medical expenses. Additionally, almost 25 million people live in low-income communities with limited access to healthy food options. Access to nutritious food is a significant issue in various low-income, rural, urban, and communities of color. Children from low-income families and African-American and Hispanic children are more likely to be overweight or obese. Access to healthy food is linked to lower levels of obesity and chronic illnesses. Studies show that availability of healthy foods increases consumption of fruits and vegetables. Leading public health experts support these findings. The Institute of Medicine and other health organizations advocate for improved access to supermarkets to combat obesity. Developing fresh food outlets creates jobs and supports economic growth in underserved areas. Supermarkets face barriers in opening stores in food deserts due to thin profit margins. Urban operators encounter challenges in providing healthy food options. Access to supermarkets in both urban and rural areas is hindered by various barriers such as high real estate costs, employee training needs, security expenses, zoning restrictions, increased food delivery costs, dispersed customer base, and limited access to affordable capital. Federal investments can attract private sector funding to address these challenges and improve access to healthy food options. Legislation establishing a national fund based on the Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Initiative aims to attract private sector investment, create jobs, and provide sustainable solutions to limited access to healthy food in underserved communities, addressing the obesity epidemic and economic revitalization in the United States. SEC. 242 of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 establishes the Healthy Food Financing Initiative to address limited access to healthy food in underserved communities. The purpose of this section is to enhance the authorities of the Secretary to support efforts to provide access to healthy food in underserved areas by establishing the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. This initiative aims to improve access to healthy foods, create and preserve quality jobs, and revitalize low-income communities by providing loans and grants to eligible fresh, healthy food retailers. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative aims to improve access to fresh, healthy food in underserved areas by providing financial and technical assistance to partnerships and funding eligible projects to attract retailers. The national fund manager, a certified community development financial institution, is responsible for managing the Initiative by raising private capital and supporting eligible projects. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative defines key terms such as partnership, perishable food, quality job, and staple food to ensure the program's effectiveness in improving access to fresh, healthy foods in underserved areas. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative defines 'staple food' as basic dietary items including bread, flour, fruits, vegetables, and meat. The Secretary will establish an initiative to achieve this purpose by providing funding to eligible projects. Funds provided to an entity shall be used to create revolving loan pools, provide grants, offer technical assistance, and cover administrative costs for eligible projects and partnerships. The national fund manager can use up to 10 percent of Federal funds for administrative expenses. Eligible projects must expand staple food availability in underserved areas with moderate- and low-income populations. The Initiative prioritizes projects in severely distressed low-income communities and aims to expand staple food availability in underserved areas. Retail outlets in these areas can accept benefits under the supplemental nutrition assistance program. The Initiative prioritizes projects in severely distressed low-income communities. Projects must meet specific criteria, including creating quality jobs for low-income residents, supporting regional food systems, accessibility by public transit, involving women- or minority-owned businesses, and receiving funding. The project receives funding from other sources, including Federal agencies, and advances the purpose of the section. Authorization of $125,000,000 is allocated to the Secretary for implementation. Amendments are made to the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994. The Secretary is authorized to establish and carry out the Health Food Financing Initiative under section 242."
