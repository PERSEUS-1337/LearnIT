    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Communications Commission Satellite Carrier Oversight Act.\" It includes findings related to satellite carriers. The Congress acknowledges the threat of signal theft to direct-to-home satellite television and the need for penalties for unauthorized decryption. They also recognize the importance of competition in the cable television industry and the lack of local competition for cable operators without alternative video programming distributors. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 addresses the issue of market power held by cable operators due to lack of local competition. The FCC reports annually to Congress on competition in the multichannel video programming market to promote diversity of views and information. Direct-to-home satellite TV is the fastest-growing service in this sector. Direct-to-home satellite television service is the fastest-growing multichannel video programming service, providing effective competition to cable television. Satellite carriers pay royalty fees to retransmit network and superstation signals to subscribers for private home viewing, with fees set to match those paid by cable operators. The royalty fees for satellite carriers were increased through compulsory arbitration to $0.06 per subscriber per month for network signals and $0.175 per subscriber per month for superstation signals. If the superstation signal programming is free from syndicated exclusivity protection, the fee is decreased to $0.14 per subscriber per month. These fees were higher than those paid by cable television operators. On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress approved raising the royalty fees for satellite carriers to $0.27 per subscriber per month for both superstation and network signals. The Librarian of Congress approved raising royalty fees for satellite carriers to $0.27 per subscriber per month for superstation and network signals, effective January 1, 1998. The fees are significantly higher than those paid by cable television operators, impacting the competitiveness of direct-to-home satellite television. Consumers in areas without over-the-air network signals rely on satellite carriers for important news and entertainment access. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel did not adequately consider the competitive impact of the fee differential between satellite and cable operators. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel's recommendation could disproportionately burden direct-to-home satellite subscribers with higher royalty fees compared to cable TV subscribers, impacting competition in the multichannel video programming marketplace. SEC. 3 amends the Communications Act to include direct-to-home satellite services in signal security regulations. SEC. 4 addresses retransmission of distant broadcast signals and the impact of increased royalty fees on satellite carriers in the multichannel video programming market. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to initiate a notice of inquiry within 180 days to facilitate the retransmission of distant broadcast signals and report to Congress on the impact of increased royalty fees on satellite carriers in the multichannel video programming market. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE OF INCREASED ROYALTY FEES. The Copyright Office is prohibited from enforcing copyright royalty fees until January 1, 1999, as per the decision of the Librarian of Congress on October 27, 1997."
