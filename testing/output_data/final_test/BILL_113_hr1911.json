    "content": "The Act titled \"Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013\" amends the interest rates section of the Higher Education Act of 1965. It includes changes to paragraphs related to interest rates before July 1, 2013. The Act \"Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013\" amends interest rates for Federal Direct Stafford Loans and Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans issued to undergraduate students after July 1, 2013. The interest rate for new loans is determined based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held prior to June 1 plus 2.05 percent, or 8.25 percent, whichever is lower. For graduate or professional students, the interest rate for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans is determined based on the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the final auction held prior to June 1 plus 3.6 percent, or 9.5 percent, whichever is lower. For Federal Direct PLUS Loans disbursed after July 1, 2013, the interest rate is determined based on the 10-year Treasury note yield plus 4.6% or 10.5%. Consolidation loans have an interest rate equal to the weighted average of the loan balance. The interest rate for Federal Direct Stafford Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and Federal Direct PLUS Loans will be determined based on the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated, rounded to the nearest higher one-eighth of one percent. The rate will be fixed for the period of the loan. The amendments made by this Act will take effect as if enacted on July 1, 2013. SEC. 3. BUDGETARY EFFECTS. This Act's budgetary effects will not be included in the PAYGO scorecards. SEC. 4. STUDY ON THE ACTUAL COST OF ADMINISTERING THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS. The Comptroller General of the United States must complete a study within 120 days to determine the actual cost of the Federal student loan programs. The Comptroller General of the United States must provide estimates on the appropriate index and mark-up rate for the Federal Government's cost of borrowing to cover the cost of Federal student programs. This information should separate out administrative costs, interest rates, and loan terms, with clear recommendations for future legislation. The study described in this section aims to inform future reauthorizations of the Higher Education Act of 1965 without generating additional revenue for the Federal Government. A report will be submitted to relevant committees outlining the conclusions and recommendations from the study. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
