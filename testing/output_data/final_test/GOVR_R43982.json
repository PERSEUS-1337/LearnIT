    "content": "The NLRA protects employees' right to collective bargaining through chosen representatives, aiming to facilitate commerce by addressing labor-related obstacles. It prohibits misconduct by employers and unions that hinders this right, labeling it as unfair labor practice. The NLRA protects employees' right to collective bargaining and prohibits unfair labor practices. When two businesses are involved in a contract where one supplies workers to the other, questions may arise about who is considered the \"employer\" under the NLRA. Joint employer status may be determined if both businesses share control over the terms and conditions of employment. The concept of joint employer recognizes that the businesses are separate but share or co-determine essential employment conditions. The Board considered whether Laerco and CTL were joint employers, citing the Third Circuit's standard. CTL made all employment decisions for drivers provided to Laerco, leading the Board to conclude Laerco did not have enough control to be a joint employer. In TLI, Inc., the Board found that Crown Zellerbach was not a joint employer of drivers leased from TLI because it had minimal impact on their employment terms and conditions. Crown did not hire, terminate, or discipline the drivers, and its supervision was limited and routine. The Board maintained that Crown should not be considered a joint employer due to its minimal control over the drivers. The Board is considering revising the joint employer standard following the Browning-Ferris Industries of California case where the regional director assessed if Browning-Ferris was a joint employer of workers provided by Leadpoint Business Services. The dispute arose when a union petitioned to represent these workers. The regional director concluded that Browning-Ferris may be a joint employer. The regional director concluded that Browning-Ferris and Leadpoint are not joint employers based on a labor services agreement. Leadpoint has sole authority over wage rates, counseling, discipline, and termination of employees. Browning-Ferris does not control the daily work of Leadpoint's employees. Quoting TLI, Inc., the regional director determined that Browning-Ferris does not co-determine essential employment terms with Leadpoint. The Board agreed to review this decision. The Board invited briefs to address the joint-employer status in Browning-Ferris Industries of California case. Parties were asked to consider whether Leadpoint Business Services is the sole employer of the employees, whether a new standard should be adopted, and what factors should be considered in determining joint-employer status. The Board's General Counsel recommended abandoning the current standard. The Board's General Counsel recommended abandoning the current joint-employer standard in an amicus brief, urging the adoption of a new standard that considers the totality of the circumstances to encourage stable and meaningful collective bargaining. The new standard would allow the Board to find joint employer status where industrial realities make an entity essential for bargaining, such as a company that controls wages paid by a \"supplier\" company. The General Counsel recommended a new joint employer standard for meaningful collective bargaining. Amicus briefs for Browning-Ferris Industries of California were due by June 26, 2014, with a decision pending from the Board. Over 310 unfair labor practice charges involving McDonald's USA and its franchisees have been filed, with 107 cases found to have merit. Regional directors in 17 regions have issued complaints against McDonald's USA and its franchisees as joint employers. The National Labor Relations Board has found McDonald's USA and its franchisees to be joint employers, sharing liability for violations of labor laws. Complaints against them follow a similar pattern, alleging control over franchisees' operations and labor relations policies, leading to termination based on union affiliation. The General Counsel argued that the current joint employer standard undermines collective bargaining in franchise relationships, where franchisors exert significant control over franchisees' operations and employment terms. The General Counsel argues that in franchise relationships, where franchisors have significant control over operations and employment terms, joint employer status may apply if McDonald's USA influences working conditions of franchisees' employees. McDonald's USA emphasizes maintaining brand quality in franchise agreements to protect the McDonald's brand. McDonald's USA provides optional resources for entrepreneurs in areas like food quality and customer service. This does not establish a joint employer relationship under the law. Further fact-finding is needed before a final resolution can be reached, with potential appeals expected in cases involving McDonald's USA and Browning-Ferris Industries of California."
