    "content": "Presidential claims of a right to preserve confidentiality of information and documents in response to legislative demands have been a recurring issue in executive-congressional relations since 1792. Disputes over access to information are usually resolved through political negotiation, with few cases reaching the courts. The existence of a presidential confidentiality privilege was established during the Watergate-related lawsuits in the 1970s. Litigation over executive privilege in relation to congressional oversight has been limited, with only four cases and two decisions on the merits. The Supreme Court has never addressed executive privilege in response to congressional demands for information. The presidential communications privilege allows the President to keep confidential documents reflecting decision-making. The privilege is qualified, not absolute. The presidential communications privilege is qualified, not absolute, and can be overcome by a showing of need. Courts may balance executive privilege claims against congressional demands if accommodation efforts fail. Recent cases like In re Sealed Case (Espy) and Judicial Watch v. Department of Justice have addressed unresolved questions on presidential privilege, impacting future legal disputes between Congress and the executive branch. Two recent disputes between Congress and the executive branch involved the application of executive privilege in congressional oversight. In 2007, President George W. Bush's privilege claims were challenged in a civil suit regarding the removal of U.S. Attorneys. In 2012, President Obama invoked executive privilege in response to a subpoena from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform related to Operation Fast and Furious. In a civil suit similar to the U.S. Attorneys controversy, the executive branch is being compelled to comply with a committee subpoena, currently pending before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The report will examine the judiciary's approach to executive privilege and how the executive has used judicial explanations to support its arguments. In Nixon v. Sirica, the Court of Appeals rejected President Nixon's claim of absolute immunity from compulsory process. The court rejected President Nixon's claim of absolute immunity from compulsory process when asserting executive privilege. Presidential conversations are considered privileged, but this can be overcome by a showing of public need. The Special Prosecutor successfully argued for access to tapes crucial for determining probable cause in the Watergate scandal. The Senate Watergate Committee also sought access to presidential tapes, following a similar decisional structure as in Nixon v. Sirica. The appeals court in Nixon v. Sirica required a strong showing of need to overcome the presumptive privilege for the submission of materials. The committee failed to demonstrate that the subpoenaed evidence was critical to its functions, as the impeachment committee already had the tapes sought by the Senate committee. The court found the immediate oversight need for the tapes to be merely cumulative and not critical to legislative functions. The court in Nixon v. Sirica found that the Senate Committee failed to show a strong need for the subpoenaed tapes, as the House Judiciary Committee's work had preempted their need for immediate access. The D.C. Circuit's view was that the Senate Committee's oversight need for the materials was \"merely cumulative\" in light of the ongoing impeachment inquiry. The Nixon v. Sirica court ruling emphasized the unique context of the case, highlighting the ongoing impeachment proceedings by the House Judiciary Committee as a key factor in limiting the Senate Committee's need for the subpoenaed tapes. The House committee's possession of the tapes makes the Senate committee's need for them cumulative, as Congress did not value dual scrutiny. The need for the tapes for legislative judgments has been undermined by subsequent events, such as the public release of transcripts and the transfer of tapes to the court. There is no indication that the House's findings will be inconclusive or delayed. The appeals court concluded that the Select Committee's need for immediate access to information is too attenuated and tangential to its functions to require the President's compliance with the subpoena. The executive's position overlooks Congress's broad investigatory powers established in the Constitution. Members of Congress have both legislative and inquisitorial powers, as recognized by George Mason at the Constitutional Convention. Woodrow Wilson emphasized the importance of oversight of administration by a body that keeps national concerns open to discussion. He argued that a self-governing people are those who discuss and interrogate their administration. The Supreme Court has supported Wilson's views on Congress's right to information for oversight functions. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's investigatory power to probe into the Federal Government for corruption, inefficiency, or waste. The Senate Select Committee's standard for overcoming a President's claim of privilege is not reflected in subsequent court rulings. The Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Nixon established the constitutional basis for executive privilege, allowing for confidentiality in high-level communications but not absolute immunity from judicial review. The Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Nixon established the constitutional basis for executive privilege, allowing for confidentiality in high-level communications but not absolute immunity from judicial review. The Court found that the claim of privilege was qualified, balancing the President's need for confidentiality with the judiciary's need for evidence in a criminal proceeding. The Supreme Court's decision in Nixon II balanced the judicial need for evidence in a criminal trial with the President's interest in confidentiality regarding White House records. The Court limited its decision to the specific case at hand and did not address the balance between presidential confidentiality and congressional demands for information. The Supreme Court's decision in Nixon II upheld the need for evidence in a criminal trial while also recognizing the President's interest in confidentiality for White House records. The Court emphasized that executive privilege is not absolute but qualified, limited to communications related to the President's responsibilities in shaping policies and making decisions. There was a substantial public interest in preserving these materials. The Court found a substantial public interest in preserving materials for Congress to examine events leading to President Nixon's resignation and consider the need for legislation. Post-Watergate cases show the judiciary's reluctance to intervene in political disputes but willingness to step in if the political process fails. In United States v. AT&T, the D.C. Circuit required good faith efforts from both branches before balancing executive privilege claims against congressional demands for information. The Department sought to enjoin AT&T's compliance with a House subcommittee's subpoena for FBI letters related to warrantless wiretaps on U.S. citizens. The Justice Department argued for executive control over the information for national security, while the House of Representatives claimed its right to investigate abuses of wiretapping power. The court rejected both claims to absolute authority, noting no absolute executive privilege in response to congressional requests. The court rejected the executive's claim of absolute privilege in response to congressional requests, stating that the Constitution grants powers to both the President and Congress in matters of national security. It also dismissed Congress' argument that investigatory actions are immune from judicial review, emphasizing that Congress' investigatory power is not absolute. The court emphasized that judicial intervention in executive privilege disputes is improper unless there has been a good faith effort at compromise between the executive and Congress. There is a constitutional duty for both branches to accommodate each other's needs, promoting resolution through dynamic compromise for efficient functioning of the government. The court emphasized the need for dynamic compromise between the executive and Congress in resolving conflicts of authority. It encouraged negotiations to avoid judicial intervention, leading to a compromise where subcommittee staff could review unedited memoranda on warrantless wiretaps. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a suit brought by the Justice Department regarding executive privilege in United States v. House of Representatives. The court did not reach a decision on the executive privilege claim, emphasizing the need for compromise between the executive and Congress to resolve conflicts of authority. The U.S. District Court in United States v. House of Representatives urged compromise and cooperation between the Legislative and Executive Branches to settle disputes before judicial intervention. The court would only intervene if the parties could not agree, emphasizing the importance of resolving conflicts without the need for judicial resolution. Ultimately, an agreement was reached without the court needing to balance executive and congressional interests. Existing precedent left gaps in the law of executive privilege, with unresolved issues such as whether the President needs to have seen the disputed matter, if the privilege covers documents from officers outside the Executive Office, and what can overcome the privilege. The U.S. Court of Appeals addressed these issues in cases like In re Sealed Case and Judicial Watch v. Department of Justice. The Espy case addressed unresolved issues regarding presidential executive privilege, including the extent of the privilege, how far down the chain of command it reaches, and what is needed to overcome a valid claim of privilege. President Clinton ordered an investigation into allegations against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, but the President never saw any of the documents involved. The Espy case, publicly released on October 11, 1994, involved President Clinton's investigation into former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. The President never saw the report's supporting documents. Espy announced his resignation on October 3, effective December 31. The Independent Counsel was appointed on September 9, and a subpoena for all report-related documents was issued on October 14. The President withheld 84 documents citing executive privilege, leading to a legal battle that ended with an appeals court overturning the district court's decision. The appeals court distinguished between the \"presidential communications privilege\" and the \"deliberative process privilege,\" both designed to protect executive branch decision making. The deliberative process privilege has a lower threshold to overcome and disappears in cases of government misconduct, while the presidential communications privilege applies only to direct decision-making by the President and requires a substantial showing to be overcome. The court held that the presidential communications privilege covers communications made or received by presidential advisers in preparing advice for the President, even if not directly to the President. This privilege applies to all documents, including pre- and post-decisional materials, containing important evidence not available elsewhere. The court restricted the presidential communications privilege to White House staff with \"operational proximity\" to direct presidential decision making, excluding executive agency staff to prevent a broad extension of the privilege. The presidential communications privilege should be narrowly construed to protect the confidentiality of the President's decision-making process. It should only apply to White House staff with significant responsibility for formulating advice to the President, excluding executive branch agency staff. The presidential communications privilege should be narrowly construed to protect the confidentiality of the President's decision-making process, applying only to White House staff close enough to the President to be revelatory of his deliberations. The privilege only applies to communications that advisers author or solicit in advising the President on official government matters. This restriction is important for officials subject to FOIA and other open government statutes. The presidential communications privilege should be limited to shielding information related to governmental operations directly involving the President's decision-making process. The burden is on the government to prove that communications from \"dual hat\" advisers were part of advising the President. The scope of the privilege should only cover functions central to presidential authority, as determined by the court. The appeals court limited the presidential communications privilege to Article II functions that are \"quintessential and non-delegable,\" such as appointment and removal powers, commander-in-chief power, and treaty negotiations. Decision-making delegated by statute may not be covered by the privilege. The President's role in supervising and coordinating executive branch decision-making remains unaffected. The presidential communications privilege in supervising and coordinating decision making in the executive branch remains unimpeded, but communications in furtherance of such activities may not be protected by the constitutional privilege. The District of Columbia Circuit's 2004 decision in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Department of Justice supports this interpretation. Judicial Watch involved requests for documents concerning pardon applications and grants reviewed by the Justice Department for consideration by President Clinton. Some 4,300 documents were withheld from a FOIA disclosure on grounds of presidential communications and deliberative process privileges. The district court held that materials produced for advising the President on a \"quintessential and non-delegable Presidential power\" may be protected. The presidential communications privilege extends to internal Justice Department documents not \"solicited and received\" by the President or his Office, as ruled by the appeals court. This requirement is necessary to prevent the privilege from being expanded too far, as emphasized in the Espy case. The presidential communications privilege applies to communications authored or solicited by the President or close advisers involved in advising him on decision making. The privilege does not extend to all departmental and agency communications related to pardon recommendations, as ruled by the appeals court. This ensures that the privilege is not expanded too far, as seen in the Espy case. The presidential communications privilege applies to internal documents related to pardon recommendations. Any documents submitted by the Deputy Attorney General to the President, as well as direct communications with White House Counsel, are protected. The privilege does not extend to documents not submitted to the President or received by the Office of the President. The Judicial Watch panel clarifies that Cabinet department heads are not considered part of the President's immediate personal staff. The presidential communications privilege, as explained in the Espy case, is limited to direct communications between the President and his immediate White House advisors. The court highlighted the risk of expanding this privilege to a large portion of the executive branch, beyond the President and his closest advisors. The presidential communications privilege, as outlined in the Espy case, extends to direct communications between the President and immediate White House advisors to ensure full and frank advice. However, the privilege does not cover communications from staff outside the White House in executive branch agencies that are not solicited and received by White House advisors. This distinction was tested in the Judicial Watch court case. The Judicial Watch court case tested the Espy principles regarding the presidential communications privilege. The court found that officials involved in the pardon decision were not protected by the privilege, leading to the disclosure of 4,300 withheld documents. In 2007, the House Judiciary Committee investigated the termination of US Attorneys, leading to subpoenas issued to White House officials for related documents. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to White House officials for documents related to the termination of US Attorneys. Ms. Miers was notified that her testimony was subject to Executive Privilege, and she ultimately did not appear before the committee, citing immunity from compelled testimony. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to White House officials for documents related to the termination of US Attorneys. Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolton did not comply with the subpoenas, claiming Executive Privilege. The committee rejected their privilege claims, stating that compelling their testimony would threaten separation of powers principles. The House Judiciary Committee filed a contempt violation report against Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolton for refusing to comply with subpoenas. The House passed two resolutions, one directing the Speaker to certify the contempt citation to the U.S. Attorney, and the other authorizing civil judicial proceedings to enforce the subpoena. The Speaker certified the report to the U.S. Attorney on February 28, 2008. On March 10, 2008, the House General Counsel filed a civil action seeking to compel Ms. Miers to appear before the committee and respond to questions. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the executive's claim of absolute immunity for senior advisers to the President on July 31, 2008. The court rejected the Executive's claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides, citing existing case law that suggests such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity. The Executive argued that close advisers to the President should be entitled to the same immunity as the President, but the court disagreed, referencing a previous Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court rejected the claim of absolute immunity for senior White House aides in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, emphasizing that qualified immunity is the norm for executive officials. The Court noted that even Cabinet members are not entitled to absolute immunity, except in cases where sensitive functions are involved. The court concluded that neither Ms. Miers nor Mr. Bolten were entitled to absolute or qualified immunity under Harlow, as their actions did not involve national security or foreign policy concerns. The court also noted that executive officials can assert executive privilege on a question-by-question basis, serving as a check against any chilling effect on providing advice to the chief executive. The court rejected the claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors, stating that Congress's power of inquiry is as broad as its power to legislate. Congress's power of inquiry is essential for its legislative function, as stated by the Supreme Court. The President may only have a presumptive privilege, not absolute immunity, in cases involving core functions of the government. Presidential autonomy does not mean total insulation from scrutiny. The Executive's actions cannot be completely shielded from Congress's scrutiny to maintain oversight functions. The Administration appealed a court decision regarding subpoenas, but the court denied an expedited schedule due to the subpoenas expiring before resolution. The court did not expedite the case involving subpoenas for documents and testimony from Ms. Miers. A settlement was reached in 2009, allowing some documents to be provided and Ms. Miers to testify in a closed hearing. The case was dismissed in October 2009, more than a year after it was filed. The committee eventually gained access to much of the information sought, with the court's opinion seen as a validation of congressional oversight powers and a limit on executive privilege in congressional investigations. The court's ruling in the case involving Ms. Miers and congressional subpoenas clarified limits on executive privilege. While affirming Congress's oversight role, the ruling also allowed Ms. Miers to assert executive privilege in response to specific questions. The decision's impact may be influenced by its rejection of absolute immunity for presidential advisers. In a case involving the Department of Defense, the D.C. Circuit reaffirmed the distinction between the deliberative process privilege and the presidential communications privilege. The court held that the presidential communications privilege only applies to documents directly involving the President or solicited by White House advisers. This ruling stemmed from a FOIA request by Army Private Dwight Loving seeking disclosure of documents related to his murder conviction. The court determined that the documents were protected under the presidential communications privilege as they directly involved the President. The court clarified that the presidential communications privilege applies to documents directly involving the President, even if not solicited by him. The case did not reference the discussion of \"non-delegable presidential duties\" from previous cases. The ongoing case of Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder may shed light on the balance between executive privilege and Congress's oversight authority. The controversy over Operation Fast and Furious began in 2011. The controversy surrounding Operation Fast and Furious erupted in early 2011 when firearms allowed to pass to criminals in Mexico by the ATF were found at the scene of a shootout where a U.S. Border Patrol agent was killed. DOJ initially denied knowledge of the operation but later admitted to providing inaccurate information about ATF's actions. The investigation then focused on why it took almost 10 months to correct the mistake and if there was an attempt to obstruct the committee's inquiry. The House committee narrowed its focus to documents created after February 4 related to DOJ's response to the investigation. The Attorney General refused to turn over certain documents, leading to a contempt of Congress vote. A civil lawsuit was filed to enforce the subpoena, and a district court issued its first opinion in the case in September 2013. In September 2013, the district court rejected DOJ's motion to dismiss a civil enforcement suit on jurisdictional and justiciability grounds. The court has since denied motions for summary judgment and ordered DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has yet to address the merits of the executive privilege question. The executive branch has taken advantage of the vague terrain regarding executive privilege in relation to congressional investigations. The executive branch has identified four areas presumptively covered by executive privilege: foreign relations, military affairs, law enforcement investigations, and confidential deliberative process in policymaking. Controversy surrounds the scope of the deliberative process category, which protects predecisional deliberative material from disclosure. The executive branch asserts executive privilege to protect predecisional deliberative material from disclosure, citing the need for candid advice and the separation of powers. This exemption is crucial during ongoing policymaking to maintain confidentiality in internal deliberations. The executive branch asserts executive privilege to protect predecisional deliberative material from disclosure, citing the need for candid advice and the separation of powers. The process exemption serves as a boundary for congressional oversight, with the executive arguing for protection of confidential communications beyond the White House. The privilege is crucial for maintaining candor in future Executive Branch deliberations. The executive branch has expanded the scope of executive privilege through various means such as signing statements, executive orders, and White House Counsel directives, using the notion of deliberative process. This privilege protects predecisional considerations and policy deliberations within the executive branch, including communications involving the President. The Obama Administration relied heavily on the deliberative process privilege to withhold documents from Congress during the Fast and Furious probe. Attorney General Eric Holder requested executive privilege, citing past presidents' use of it to protect confidential deliberative materials. The memorandum did not distinguish between deliberative process privilege and presidential communications privilege, nor reference specific court cases. The executive branch has acknowledged some limits to its use. The executive branch has acknowledged limits to its use of executive privilege, stating it will not block congressional inquiries into allegations of fraud, corruption, or illegal conduct. Past administrations, such as Clinton and Reagan, have refrained from asserting executive privilege in cases involving personal wrongdoing or unethical conduct by government officials. Reagan's policy emphasized that executive privilege should not be used to conceal evidence of wrongdoing or criminality by executive officers. The application of executive privilege in the Iran/Contra investigations saw President Reagan not asserting executive privilege and making relevant excerpts of his personal diaries available to congressional investigators. The executive branch ties its willingness to forgo assertions of executive privilege to the deliberative process exemption, stating that it would not seek to protect materials that do not implicate or hinder executive decision-making processes. Recent appellate court rulings may impact this approach. Recent appellate court rulings may have implications for the broad claims of privilege by the executive branch, particularly regarding the presidential communications privilege. Cases like Espy and Judicial Watch have placed qualifications on when the privilege can be invoked, requiring that communications be authored or solicited by a close White House adviser or the President. The privilege is limited to those in operational proximity to the President, within the boundaries of the Executive Office of the President and the White House. The presidential communications privilege is limited to communications related to core presidential powers, such as appointment and removal, pardon powers, Commander-in-Chief power, receiving ambassadors, and negotiating treaties. It remains a qualified privilege that can be overcome if the information sought is deemed important evidence. The presidential communications privilege can be overcome if the information sought is deemed important evidence, as shown in cases like Espy and Judicial Watch. However, applying these teachings to current disputes between Congress and the executive may be premature. In the congressional-executive conflict context, the Miers court rejected the executive's claim of absolute witness immunity. The Supreme Court's ruling in Nixon I established a qualified constitutional privilege that can be overcome by a proper showing of need. Post-Watergate case law reaffirms the qualified nature of the privilege, but there is limited post-Watergate case law on executive privilege in congressional-executive disputes. The President's ability to withhold information from Congress raises different constitutional considerations than withholding information in other contexts. The President's ability to withhold information from Congress raises different constitutional considerations than in judicial proceedings. The extent of the presidential communications privilege within the executive branch is limited to close presidential advisers' information in judicial proceedings. There is uncertainty on how executive privilege claims should be analyzed in response to congressional requests for information. Holder may address some questions on executive privilege in congressional oversight, but the district court has not yet ruled on that claim. During the Kennedy Administration, President Kennedy established the policy of invoking executive privilege personally. He used it twice, once to withhold names of speechwriters from a Senate subcommittee and another time to prevent General Maxwell Taylor from testifying about the Bay of Pigs affair. Johnson followed Kennedy's policy. President Johnson did not consistently follow the Kennedy policy of personal assertion of executive privilege. Nixon, on the other hand, asserted executive privilege six times, directing officials to withhold information from Congress on various occasions. President Nixon asserted executive privilege multiple times, including preventing a White House adviser from testifying on the ITT settlement and withholding White House tapes related to the Watergate affair. President Ford and Carter also used executive privilege to withhold documents during congressional investigations. Energy Secretary Charles Duncan claimed executive privilege when a committee demanded documents related to a policy on a petroleum import fee. President Reagan, President Bush, and other officials also asserted executive privilege in various instances before congressional committees. Dick Cheney refused to comply with a congressional subpoena for a document related to a Navy aircraft program investigation. President Clinton discontinued issuing written directives for executive privilege, leading to uncertainty in subordinate claims. Several formal invocations of privilege were documented, including during grand jury proceedings. Investigations in 1996 included various documents related to drug enforcement, political assassinations, and grand jury subpoenas. Executive privilege claims were made in different cases, but were overcome in some instances due to the relevance of the information. The September 9, 1998 Referral to the House of Representatives by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr detailed previously undisclosed presidential claims of executive privilege before grand juries during investigations of the Hubbell and Lewinski matters. Claims were made by individuals such as Thomas \"Mack\" McLarty, Nancy Hernreich, Sidney Blumenthal, Cheryl Mills, and Lanny Breuer, with some being withdrawn or denied by the court. President Bush asserted executive privilege six times, ordering subordinates not to comply with congressional subpoenas. One instance was on December 12, 2001, when Attorney General John Ashcroft was directed not to release documents related to an FBI corruption investigation. The documents were eventually released after oversight hearings. In 2007, President Bush invoked executive privilege to prevent former White House officials from complying with subpoenas related to the firing of U.S. Attorneys. The House passed contempt resolutions against the officials in 2008. On February 14, 2008, the Speaker transmitted a contempt citation to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The Attorney General directed the U.S. Attorney not to present the citation. On March 10, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee initiated a civil suit to enforce the subpoenas. The district court ruled on July 31, 2008, that senior White House aides were not immune from compelled congressional process and ordered them to testify and produce nonprivileged documents. The court required the executive to provide more detailed descriptions of withheld documents on the basis of executive privilege. An agreement was reached before the appeals court could rule on the case. The executive provided some requested documents and Ms. Miers testified in a closed hearing. The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to the EPA and Office of Management. The EPA and OIRA were subpoenaed for documents related to EPA's regulations on air quality standards and communications regarding California's petition on greenhouse gas emissions. Executive privilege was asserted on some documents, and no contempt action was pursued. On July 10, 2008, Karl Rove refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. The subcommittee rejected his claims of privilege, and the full Judiciary Committee recommended citing Mr. Rove for contempt. However, the full House never voted on the contempt citation. In 2008, the President directed the Attorney General to assert executive privilege regarding a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoena related to the investigation of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity leak. The documents withheld included FBI reports, handwritten notes, and other White House documents. The Attorney General requested the privilege after the committee planned to consider a resolution for contempt of Congress. The Oversight Committee delayed a vote on contempt for assessing executive privilege assertion. Obama invoked executive privilege once for Operation Fast and Furious investigation. DOJ and White House did not respond to privilege log request. The Attorney General argued that the withheld documents were internal executive branch communications related to responses to congressional oversight. Executive privilege was invoked to protect deliberative communications and maintain candor in Executive Branch discussions. The House voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for not disclosing the documents, leading to a civil lawsuit filed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In 2012, a civil lawsuit was filed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to enforce a subpoena and compel disclosure of documents withheld under executive privilege. The suit survived a motion to dismiss and is now pending before the district court."
