    "title": "AB 194",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of efficient transportation systems for the state's economic well-being. High-occupancy toll lanes and express lanes aim to improve passenger throughput and reduce delays for travelers. Highway tolling should focus on optimizing transportation performance rather than just generating revenue. Section 149.7 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended accordingly. Section 149.7 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended to allow regional transportation agencies or the department to apply for developing and operating high-occupancy toll lanes or other toll facilities, including value pricing programs and exclusive lanes for public transit or freight. The commission reviews and approves applications for toll facilities development. Public hearings are conducted before approval. Eligibility criteria are established for the application process. The commission reviews and approves applications for toll facilities development based on criteria such as improving corridor performance, being part of a regional transportation plan, demonstrating cooperation, meeting requirements, completing a project initiation document, and having a funding plan in place. A regional transportation agency applying to develop toll facilities must have a complete funding plan and reimburse the commission for processing costs. Toll facilities approved after January 1, 2016, must meet specific requirements including agreements with the California Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation for law enforcement and operational matters. The regional transportation agency sponsoring a toll facility is responsible for reimbursing the department and the California Highway Patrol for costs related to the toll facility. The agency is also responsible for establishing, collecting, and administering tolls, with revenue generated available for direct expenses related to debt and other obligations of the toll facility. The revenue generated by a toll facility is used for various purposes including development, maintenance, and operation of the facility. Any remaining revenue is to be used in the corridor where it was generated according to an expenditure plan developed by the sponsoring agency in consultation with relevant transportation authorities. The governing board of a regional transportation agency or the commission must review and approve the expenditure plan for a toll facility. Administrative expenses for operating the toll facility should not exceed 3% of toll revenues. Projects converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to high-occupancy toll lanes must show increased corridor efficiency. The sponsoring agency developing a toll facility must provide information to the commission and Legislative Analyst. The commission will prepare an annual report on the progress of toll facilities authorized under this section. Competing facilities can be constructed without compensation for adverse effects on toll revenue. A regional transportation agency can issue bonds to finance toll facility construction and related expenditures, payable from toll revenues. The agency can determine interest rates and terms for the bonds, which may be sold publicly or privately. The State of California does not guarantee payment for the bonds issued by a regional transportation agency for toll facility construction. Bonds, refunding bonds, and bond anticipation notes issued under this subdivision are legal investments for various entities. Interest earned on these bonds is exempt from state personal and corporate income tax. The California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank or the Treasurer may issue bonds to finance toll facility development, construction, and related expenditures, payable from toll revenue. This provides necessary state law authority for Section 63024.5 of the Government Code. Before submitting an application, a regional transportation agency must consult with local transportation authorities and congestion management agencies for toll facility development. The agency must offer agreements for project development, engineering, and environmental documentation to these entities. A regional transportation agency is defined as a transportation planning agency, county transportation commission, or other designated entity for regional transportation projects. This includes joint exercise of powers authorities and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Section 149.12 of the Streets and Highways Code allows regional transportation agencies to require vehicles using toll facilities to have electronic toll collection devices. It also specifies that existing lanes can be converted into tolled lanes, except for high-occupancy vehicle lanes. Additionally, it does not affect the authority of joint powers authorities to establish toll facilities. The Highway Toll Account is created in the State Transportation Fund to manage funds for toll facilities authorized by Section 149.7. Moneys designated for debt service are continuously appropriated to the department, while other funds from bond sales are available for expenditure upon legislative appropriation. The cost of bond issuance, as per Government Code, shall be paid from bond proceeds, including any premium. This act will only take effect if Assembly Bill 914 of the 2015\u201316 Regular Session is enacted by January 1, 2016."
