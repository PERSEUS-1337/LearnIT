Factors considered include the need for the project, economic significance to the fishing industry, community support, and the threat of property conversion.

The applicant must also provide information on alternative sites and the social and cultural value of the industries to the community and State. Additionally, cost sharing is required for the grant awarded under this section. Cost sharing for grants awarded under this section must not exceed 75% of the total project cost.

If the Governor of a Coastal State determines that a unit of local government or nonprofit organization is unable or unwilling to enforce easement terms, or if the easement has been modified inconsistently, the property's right, title, and interest may revert to the State after a hearing. The Coastal State can convey easements to another local government or nonprofit organization. The Secretary must review and approve grant applications promptly, providing reasons for disapproval if necessary. The Coastal State can use up to 10 percent of funds for administrative costs. 50 percent of gain from land sales is excluded from gross income for tax purposes.
