    "content": "A general framework is provided to analyze overfitting in model-free reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on observational overfitting where agents correlate rewards with spurious features in the observation space. Synthetic benchmarks are designed to study this phenomenon, revealing insights on implicit regularization and generalization in reinforcement learning. The zero-shot supervised framework is used to study RL generalization by treating it as a classical supervised learning problem. There is a lack of analysis in the middle of the theoretical and empirical spectrum, especially for complex MDPs. The work highlights challenges in RL generalization, including issues with complex MDPs and empirical benchmarks. Factors such as overfitting, hyperparameters, and choice of optimizer can impact policy performance. Observational overfitting in reinforcement learning can be influenced by factors like entropy, weight norms, and empirical benchmarks. To isolate this factor, researchers study how agents overfit due to irrelevant observation properties. By modifying observational outputs while keeping MDP dynamics constant, they aim to understand the impact on generalization. Observational overfitting in reinforcement learning is studied using linear quadratic regulators (LQR) and neural networks like multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutions. Implicit regularization is shown to occur in this setting. The experiments include full training curves, hyperparameters, and analysis of the convex one-step LQR case under the observational overfitting regime. The paper discusses observational overfitting in reinforcement learning, demonstrating implicit regularization in experiments using linear quadratic regulators and neural networks. The structure includes motivation, synthetic construction, experiments, and testing on CoinRun and ImageNet architectures. An example of observational overfitting is shown in Figure 1, highlighting issues with MDPs and vision-based policies. Observational overfitting in reinforcement learning is a significant issue for vision-based policies, where it may not be clear what part of the observation influences the agent's actions. Saliency maps highlight key elements like the timer and background objects that are correlated with progress. Most model-free RL architectures are simpler compared to ImageNet architectures, due to the complexity of RL environments. Observational overfitting in reinforcement learning is a significant issue for vision-based policies, where it may not be clear what part of the observation influences the agent's actions. In large scale RL environments like DOTA2 or Starcraft 2, agent observations are internal minimaps rather than human-rendered images. Several benchmarks have been proposed to depict overfitting, but our work explicitly requires the background to be correlated with progress, making a more explicit connection to causal inference. Our work is motivated by learning theoretic frameworks to capture the phenomena of spurious correlations between ungeneralizable features and progress in reinforcement learning. Previous works have focused on interpreting agent decision-making through saliency and network visualizations, while recent studies have analyzed the interactions between noise-injecting explicit regularizations and the information bottleneck. Our approach draws from a vast literature on understanding the generalization properties of supervised learning classifiers and neural networks. In reinforcement learning, overfitting in high-dimensional observation spaces can occur due to more theoretically principled reasons rather than just good inductive biases on game images. For example, in a linear least squares regression task, the presence of multiple global minima can lead to convergence issues during optimization. In reinforcement learning, overfitting in high-dimensional observation spaces can occur due to multiple global minima, leading to convergence issues during optimization. Implicit regularization helps avoid non-generalizable solutions in a high dimensional observation space with a low dimensional state space. The zero-shot framework for RL generalization assumes a distribution over MDP's with a fixed policy achieving maximal return. In reinforcement learning, the episodic reward for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined as R M (\u03c0). The distribution D is often made up of parametrized MDP's, where a parameter \u03b8 creates a mapping \u03b8 \u2192 M \u03b8. This simplifies notation by defining a distribution \u0398 that induces D, leading to a set of samples \u0398 train = {\u03b8 1 , . . . , \u03b8 n } and M train = {M 1 , . . . , M n }. The reward can be redefined as R M \u03b8 (\u03c0) = R \u03b8 (\u03c0). By introducing an observation function \u03c6 \u03b8 : S \u2192 O, the MDP can be modified without changing the base MDP M = (S, A, r, T). The agent receives input from a high-dimensional observation space O instead of the state space S. The goal is to generalize to the distribution \u0398 and define the generalization gap as J \u0398 (\u03c0) \u2212 J \u0398 (\u03c0). The effects can be modeled more generally, not specific to sidescroller games. The state has been projected to a high-dimensional observation space by \u03c6. In a high-dimensional observation space, functions f and g \u03b8 are used to extract generalizable and non-generalizable features in an MDP population \u0398. The combination function h merges the outputs of f and g to create a final observation, with f focusing on important features like avatar and monsters, while g \u03b8 captures less relevant details like background textures. This model is relevant in realistic settings where learning the function g \u03b8 is crucial. The (f, g)-scheme setup in meta-learning allows for fast adaptation by learning the separation and task-identification. The Rademacher Complexity term captures the invariance of policies in the set \u03a0 with respect to \u03b8, providing interpretable generalization bounds. In the context of meta-learning, the Rademacher Complexity term captures policy invariance with respect to environment parameters, leading to interpretable generalization bounds. The concatenation effect is simplified in this work, assuming static concatenation for demonstration of insightful properties. Implicit regularization in the context of analyzing architectural differences in image classifiers and SL focuses on the effects of overparametrization and residual connections. This approach does not have a p-regularization equivalent but instead conditions the training dynamics. Experimental measurements are conducted using fixed hyperparameters and varying only based on architecture. In this work, architectural implicit regularization techniques are analyzed, which do not have an explicit regularization equivalent. The LQR is used as a surrogate for understanding deep RL, similar to how linear/logistic regression is used to understand deep SL techniques. This approach has benefits such as deterministic cost function and exact gradient descent. The LQR method in deep RL serves as a surrogate for understanding gradient dynamics and optimization, showcasing the impact of overparametrization as an implicit regularizer. It allows the use of linear policies without the need for stochastic outputs, demonstrating how overparametrization affects gradient dynamics independently of additional non-linearities in the policy. Recent works have explored linear-layer stacking in supervised learning and theoretical problems like matrix factorization and completion. However, this study is the first to analyze this concept in the context of reinforcement learning generalization. The setup involves using semi-orthogonal matrices to prevent information loss in transforming states into observations for optimal action output. The observation is a product of two matrices, and the action is determined by a policy matrix. The matrix W\u03b8 is randomly sampled based on a \"level ID\" integer for dimensionality considerations. In reinforcement learning, the observation to the agent is of dimension d signal + d noise. The unique minimizer of the original cost function may not be the unique minimizer of the population due to overfitting caused by an extra bottom component. Gradient descent cannot remove this component in the 1-step LQR case, leading to overfitting. Increasing d noise results in a larger generalization gap in the LQR setting, empirically verified in Figure 3. The gap scales by O( \u221a d noise ) with overparametrization. In overparametrization, adding more linear layers and increasing widths reduces the generalization gap and norms of the final policy without changing its expressiveness. This implies that gradient descent biases the policy towards a simpler model. Predicting the generalization gap of the final policy based on the layers is crucial for deep RL with nonlinear activations like ReLU or Tanh. Adding more layers does not bias the policy towards a low rank solution in the nonconvex LQR case when using stochastic policy gradient with nonlinear activations like ReLU or Tanh. SL bounds have little predictive power in the RL domain case, and terms such as Frobenius product increase rapidly. In Section 3.1, observational overfitting exists and overparametrization potentially helps in the linear setting. Analyzing nonlinear dynamics, a classic Gym environment M is used to generate observations. Training/test sets of MDPs are produced by sampling \u03b8, and Proximal Policy Gradient is used for policy optimization. Smoothness term bounds affect generalization bounds, with no bias towards low rank solutions in the nonconvex LQR case. In the Mujoco case, theoretical guarantees on generalization bounds are lacking due to the complexity of analyzing smoothness terms for its physics simulator. Empirical observations show that state dynamics significantly impact generalization performance, with varying Rademacher complexity and smoothness across different environments. Increasing width and depth in basic MLPs can enhance generalization, with the choice of activation function playing a significant role. Switching between ReLU and Tanh activations yields different results, with Tanh consistently improving generalization. However, stacking Tanh layers can lead to vanishing gradients, affecting training performance. To address this, ReLU residual layers are used to allow for larger depths, improving generalization and stabilizing training. Previous work has shown that increasing width and depth in basic MLPs can enhance generalization, with the choice of activation function playing a significant role. ReLU residual layers are used to allow for larger depths, improving generalization and stabilizing training. Overparametrization has been found to have generalization benefits even in the nonlinear control case. The study also considers the generalization benefits of convolutional networks in vision-based RL tasks. In a study on reinforcement learning, different models like NatureCNN, IMPALA, and IMPALA-LARGE were compared based on their parameter numbers. A unique (f, g)-scheme was set up for convolutions by passing Gym 1D state through deconvolutions instead of using RGB images. The state was reshaped into a square and processed to produce 84x84 images using an orthogonally-initialized deconvolution architecture. The study compared different convolutional architectures in reinforcement learning, showing consistent rankings across datasets. The generalization quality of these architectures was found to be not limited to real-world data, suggesting a correlation in performance possibly due to implicit regularization. A memorization test supported the claim that the dataset became impossible to generalize when only using one output. The dataset becomes impossible to generalize when only showing the output to the policy. More parameters increase memorization ability, but implicit regularization plays a role. Different convolutional architectures show varied memorization performances in different environments. In a deconvolution memorization test using an LQR as the underlying MDP, specific hard limits to memorization were found. Overparametrization was tested on the CoinRun benchmark, showing improved generalization. The dynamics in CoinRun change per level, and relevant features shift in the input vector. Despite these challenges, overparametrization still enhances generalization in realistic RL benchmarks. Overparametrization improves generalization for CoinRun in realistic RL benchmarks by predicting the generalization gap from the training phase using margin distributions. Weight norm bounds used in supervised learning are found to be too dominant for this RL case. The weight norm bounds used in supervised learning are too dominant for RL cases, suggesting current norm bounds are too loose for RL even with overparametrization helping generalization. \"Observational overfitting\" is identified as a key component of overfitting in RL, motivating further study in this area. The analysis includes the LQR case, linear policies under exact gradient descent, and the Projected-Gym case for MLP and convolutional networks. The effects of neural network policies under nonlinear environments are demonstrated in convolutional networks. The large scale case for CoinRun shows that MLP overparametrization improves generalization by allowing relevant features to move across the input. Current network policy bounds from supervised learning are unable to explain overparametrization effects in reinforcement learning, indicating a need for further research in this area. Extending results to memory-based RNN cases could be highly beneficial. Recent works have explored the benefits of overparametrized neural networks in supervised learning, shedding light on their potential use in reinforcement learning. Explicit regularization has been shown to reduce generalization gaps, but may be influenced by the bias of synthetic tasks. This research marks an important step towards addressing future challenges in this area. In supervised learning, overparametrized neural networks have shown benefits. Explicit regularization reduces generalization gaps but may be biased by synthetic tasks. A deconvolution memorization test using LQR as the underlying MDP reveals hard limits to memorization for different models. NatureCNN can memorize 30 levels but not 50, IMPALA can memorize 2 levels but not 5, and IMPALA-LARGE struggles to memorize 2 levels. Large-parameter convolutional networks using ImageNet networks are also experimented with, showing verification in Table 1. Large ImageNet models perform differently in reinforcement learning (RL) compared to supervised learning (SL). The best performing network was IMPALA-LARGE-BN with a test score of \u2248 5.5. Attention mechanisms like Relational Memory Core (RMC) using pure attention on raw 32 \u00d7 32 pixels do not perform well in RL, indicating the importance of correct convolutional setups for generalization and transfer. Training/testing curves for ImageNet/large convolutional models are provided, with RMC32x32 projecting native images from CoinRun from 64 \u00d7 64 to 32 \u00d7 32. The curr_chunk discusses the use of all pixels as components for attention in a model with specific parameters. It also mentions the absence of Auxiliary Loss in training and compares VGG-A to VGG-16. The focus is on predicting generalization gap and using margin distributions for softmax categorical outputs. The curr_chunk discusses using margin distributions for softmax categorical outputs to predict generalization gap. Measures like Spectral-L1, Distance, and Spectral-Frobenius are used for norm-based Lipschitz measures on the policy network logits. State-action pairs found on-policy are used instead of the classical supervised learning pairs. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of proper normalization in predicting generalization using margin distributions for softmax categorical outputs. It highlights that measuring raw norms of the policy network is not effective, as it can increase even as training plateaus. The margin distribution, unlike SL, is not fully correlated with RL generalization on total reward, as overconfidence in some state-action pairs does not necessarily imply poor testing performance. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of Lipschitz assumptions on state-action transitions and different forms of modifications in policy gradient iterations. It notes that norm measures become too dominant in the fraction, leading to decreases in distribution means with increased parametrization. The distribution over the on-policy replay buffer serves as a rough measure of overall confidence. In the Gym-Retro benchmark using Sonic, the agent is trained on 47 levels with rewards tied to horizontal location increases. The policy is trained until reaching a 5k reward, and at test time, performance is measured on 11 unseen levels. The agent tends to overfit to the scoreboard, but performance improves when the scoreboard is blacked out. The text discusses the calculation of LQR cost using vectorization and the implementation in TensorFlow. It also mentions the use of batch matrix multiplication operations to simulate the effect of different network weights for each batch dimension. The text discusses the implementation of network weights collection using an index and batch matrix operations in TensorFlow. Nonlinear activations were not used for BMV architectures. IMAGENET MODELS and default parameters for CoinRun can be found in specific repositories. In this section, the text discusses the implementation of network weights collection using an index and batch matrix operations in TensorFlow. It focuses on varying nminibatches to fit memory onto GPU and excludes RNN additions to measure performance solely from the feedforward network. The notation used is consistent with previous work, with a low dimensional base policy denoted as P and state as st. The infinite horizon cost for an (A, B, Q, R)-LQR is defined, where C(P) is non-convex but possesses the property that when \u2207C(P*) = 0, P* is found.

The infinite horizon cost for an (A, B, Q, R)-LQR is defined, where C(P) is non-convex but possesses the property that when \u2207C(P*) = 0, P* is found. The cost function is restricted to P \u2208 P, where P = {P : P \u2264 \u03b1 and A \u2212 BP \u2264 1} for some constant \u03b1. The observation modified cost is defined as C(K; W \u03b8 ) = C K W c W \u03b8 T. Lemmas from (Fazel et al., 2018) provide bounds on the difference in cost for different policies P, P when LQR parameters are fixed. Lemma 17 provides bounds on the cost difference for fixed LQR parameters. It shows that linear components cannot be removed from the policy to improve generalization. The text also discusses the implementation of network weights collection using index and batch matrix operations in TensorFlow. In short, the text discusses the policy notation in the 1-step LQR, defining population cost, and the randomness of samples and initialization in the context of orthogonal matrices. The proof focuses on the rank of the Hessian as the sample size increases. The proof relies on the rank of the Hessian as sample size increases, rather than common concentration inequalities. The expression for E[C(K \u221e )] does not scale with poly(p) for convex 1-Step LQR, but increases for non-convex infinite LQR with higher noise dimension. This suggests an extra contribution from non-convexity, leading to worse optima in observation-modified gradient dynamics."
