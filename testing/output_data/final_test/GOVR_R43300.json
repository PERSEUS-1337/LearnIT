    "content": "Congressional interest in carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been renewed due to EPA's re-proposed standards for CO2 emissions from new fossil-fueled power plants. The standards aim to limit CO2 emissions to 1,100 pounds per megawatt-hour for new coal-fired plants and between 1,000-1,100 for new natural gas-fired plants. CCS technology would be required for new coal-fired plants to meet the standards, while new natural gas-fired plants are expected to comply without additional costs. EPA proposed these standards under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The proposed standard for new coal-fired plants under the carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology allows up to seven years for compliance, with a more stringent CO2 emissions limit of 1,000-1,050 pounds per megawatt-hour. The future use of coal in the U.S. energy portfolio may hinge on the deployment of CCS technology to reduce emissions. The September 20, 2013, proposed rule aims to limit CO2 emissions from new fossil-fueled power plants. President Obama directed the EPA to issue proposed guidelines for existing coal-fired power plants by June 1, 2014, with final guidelines due a year later. The viability of large-scale CCS technology for reducing CO2 emissions will face congressional scrutiny. CO2 capture technology is crucial for the success of CCS in reducing emissions from large sources in the United States. To deploy CO2 capture technology widely in the United States, the cost of capturing CO2 would be a key factor. Other factors like incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions would also play a role. The transportation and storage components of CCS are less technology-dependent. However, transportation and sequestration costs could be high, depending on regulatory frameworks and public acceptance. Several CRS reports address policy issues related to CO2 transportation and storage. This report is a summary of a longer study on Carbon Capture technology. It focuses on the CO2 capture process and aims to assess prospects for improved technologies. The study examines both emerging technologies and past experiences to shape energy policy. The assessment on carbon capture technologies was conducted by Carnegie Mellon University under the leadership of Edward S. Rubin. The work was part of a multiyear project to examine U.S. energy policy, funded by the Joyce Foundation. Several reports on CCS were produced by CRS to complement this assessment. Several reports on carbon capture and storage technologies were produced by CRS, including FutureGen, prospects for coal in electric power and industry, carbon dioxide pipelines for carbon sequestration, carbon control in the U.S. electricity sector, pipelines for carbon dioxide control, and legal issues associated with carbon dioxide sequestration technology. Global climate change is a major international concern, leading to proposed mitigation policy measures. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology has gained attention as a method to limit CO2 emissions from power plants, a significant source of greenhouse gases. Interest in CCS is driven by the need for substantial reductions in global CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change impacts. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is crucial for reducing CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial sources. It offers a way to achieve significant reductions in emissions while cleaner energy technologies are being developed. Adding CCS to other greenhouse gas reduction measures can lower the cost of mitigating climate change. By 2030, CCS is a key emission reduction strategy, with the main process involving capturing and storing CO2 underground. Currently, CCS is not widely used due to high costs, prompting research for more cost-effective methods. Research programs in the United States and elsewhere are focused on developing cost-effective methods of CO2 capture. Assessment of CCS capture technologies includes post-combustion capture using amine-based solvents, pre-combustion capture from synthesis gas in IGCC plants, and oxy-combustion capture using high-purity oxygen in PC plants. Post-combustion and pre-combustion capture technologies are currently commercial and widely used for gas stream purification in various industries. Small-scale installations also capture CO2 from power plant flue gases for sale. Carbon capture technologies include post-combustion capture using amine-based solvents, pre-combustion capture from synthesis gas in IGCC plants, and oxy-combustion capture using high-purity oxygen in PC plants. While all three approaches can achieve high CO2 capture efficiencies, the major drawbacks are high cost, large energy requirements, and lack of full-scale applications on coal-fired or gas-fired power plants. Large-scale demonstration projects for CO2 capture at power plants are planned or underway in the United States and other countries. These projects aim to develop lower-cost capture systems with smaller energy penalties. Five stages of development are defined to assess the commercial availability of capture technologies. The CRS report reviews current R&D activities for CO2 capture technologies at different stages of development, including conceptual designs, pilot plant scale, and full-scale demonstration plants. Research focuses on new solvents and breakthrough technologies like novel sorbents and membranes for lower-cost capture systems. However, most of these processes are still in early stages of development, lacking credible estimates of performance and cost. Current R&D activities for CO2 capture technologies are focused on cost reduction rather than efficiency gains. Advanced solvent formulations like ammonia and amines are being tested for commercial use in the near future. Pilot-scale oxy-combustion processes and pre-combustion capture options are also being evaluated for scale-up. The emphasis is on developing new or improved solvents to lower costs, with some projects aiming for full-scale testing to confirm benefits. CO2 capture research focuses on cost reduction for new and existing power plants. The potential retrofit market for existing plants may shrink as they age. The key questions revolve around the availability and cost-effectiveness of advanced CO2 capture systems. The Technology Assessment reviews various technology roadmaps predicting commercial availability of CO2 capture at power plants by 2020. Current technologies like post-combustion amine systems could be available sooner, with novel, lower-cost technologies projected for commercialization by 2020. However, aggressive and sustained efforts are needed to advance these concepts. Experience from past R&D programs for SO2 and NOx capture at coal-fired power plants suggests new concepts typically take two decades or more to develop. The development of advanced CO2 capture technologies typically takes two decades or more to reach commercial availability. However, the cost advantages initially foreseen for these novel systems often diminish over time, as the technologies become more expensive to develop. The lack of a significant market for these new technologies further hinders their success. Past experience shows that the costs of environmental technologies tend to decrease over time as they succeed in the marketplace. The cost of post-combustion SO2 and NOx capture systems declined by 50% or more after about two decades of deployment at coal-fired power plants, following a learning curve trend seen in many technologies. Future CO2 capture costs are expected to follow a similar trend once widely deployed, with factors like power plant design and efficiency influencing costs. Advanced CO2 capture systems' cost estimates are based on engineering-economic analysis, with recent studies by the U.S. Department of Energy foreseeing cost reductions for advanced PC and IGCC systems. Recent studies by the U.S. Department of Energy predict a 27% and 31% cost reduction for advanced PC and IGCC power plants with CO2 capture, respectively. However, there is uncertainty in cost estimates for technologies not yet commercially available, with more reliable estimates linked to expected commercial deployment. The market for power plant CO2 capture systems relies on government actions or policies to create demand. Future cost reductions are tied to commercial deployment, which is a key factor in lowering technology costs. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture systems are projected to decrease by as much as 30% after 100,000 MW of capture plant capacity is installed worldwide. This would bring the cost and efficiency of power plants with CO2 capture close to those without capture, similar to the technology deployment timeline for SO2 capture systems in coal-fired power plants. However, uncertainty exists regarding the actual extent of these cost reductions. Future cost reductions for CO2 capture systems are projected to decrease by as much as 30% after 100,000 MW of capture plant capacity is installed worldwide. Achieving significant cost reductions would require vigorous R&D and commercial deployment, but a significant market for CO2 capture technologies does not currently exist. Incentive programs can accelerate development, but substantial emissions reductions are ultimately needed for sustained cost reductions in CO2 capture."
