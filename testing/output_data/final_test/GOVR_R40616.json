    "content": "The ongoing debate on telecommunications reform focuses on net neutrality, ensuring equal access to the internet without discrimination. The FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order is a key regulatory framework under scrutiny. The FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order is being compared to the 2017 Order to determine the best approach for regulating broadband networks. The 2017 Order revokes the 2015 framework, adopts a less regulatory approach, and shifts oversight to the FTC and DOJ. Legal challenges to the 2017 Order are ongoing in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit. In 2005, major actions changed the regulatory landscape for broadband services, leading to the classification of broadband internet access services as Title I information services. This subjected them to a less rigorous regulatory framework than telecommunications services. Legal challenges to the 2017 Order are ongoing in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, and a suit challenging a California internet regulation law is pending in the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of California. The 116th Congress is debating the appropriate regulatory framework for broadband access. Congress may take broader action to amend existing law to provide guidance and stability to FCC authority over broadband access. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's ruling that cable modem and telephone company internet access services are interstate information services under Title I regulation, subject to a less stringent regulatory framework than telecommunications services. The FCC's classification of internet services under Title I or Title II does not exempt them from regulation. The FCC has regulatory authority over information services under Title I and can forbear from full regulation under Title II. In 2005, the FCC also adopted a policy statement to encourage broadband deployment and preserve the open nature of the internet. The FCC's 2005 policy statement outlined four principles for internet regulation, including consumer entitlement to access lawful content, run applications of choice, connect legal devices, and have competition among providers. These principles were not codified but were incorporated into FCC policymaking activities. For example, merger approvals included commitments to adhere to the Internet policy statement. AT&T agreed to adhere to net neutrality requirements for two years as part of its merger approval with BellSouth in 2006. FCC Chairman Genachowski proposed expanding the 2005 internet policy statement in 2009, leading to an NPR on preserving the open internet and broadband industry practices. The FCC ruled in 2008 that Comcast violated its policy by blocking peer-to-peer connections, leading to a requirement for Comcast to stop these practices by the end of 2008. Comcast complied and developed a new system to manage network congestion without targeting specific applications or online activities. Comcast developed a new system to manage network congestion by identifying users in congested neighborhoods using large bandwidth in real-time and slowing them down. This system complies with FCC internet principles and does not discriminate against applications. Despite compliance, Comcast filed an appeal claiming FCC did not have the authority to enforce its internet policy statement. The FCC argued that it had authority to regulate internet practices based on ancillary authority in the 1934 Communications Act. However, the court ruled that the FCC lacked the authority to regulate Comcast's network management practices, vacating the FCC's order. The court stated that ancillary authority must be linked to statutory authority, which the FCC failed to prove in its arguments. The court granted the petition for review and vacated the FCC's order regarding broadband regulation. The impact on the FCC's ability to regulate broadband services remains unclear, but then-FCC Chairman Genachowski emphasized that the court decision does not change the agency's broadband policy goals. In response, the FCC adopted the Open Internet Order on December 21, 2010, to establish rules for network neutrality. The Open Internet Order was established on December 21, 2010, to govern broadband internet access providers' network management practices. The order aimed to maintain network neutrality by setting rules on transparency, no blocking, and no unreasonable discrimination for both fixed and mobile broadband providers. Fixed providers were required to disclose information on network practices, while mobile providers were prohibited from blocking access to lawful websites. The Open Internet Order established rules for broadband providers, prohibiting blocking of lawful websites and applications competing with their services. Fixed providers had to disclose network practices, while mobile providers were subject to a \"no unreasonable discrimination rule.\" The order included ongoing monitoring of the mobile broadband sector and created an Open Internet Advisory Committee. Paid prioritization was not banned but was unlikely to satisfy the \"no unreasonable discrimination\" rule. The Open Internet Order established rules for broadband providers, prohibiting blocking of lawful websites and applications competing with their services. While not banning paid prioritization, it raised concerns about specialized services and called for a review of all rules in the order within two years. The order did not prohibit tiered or usage-based pricing, allowing providers to adjust pricing based on network usage to encourage efficient use. The Open Internet Order established rules for broadband providers, prohibiting blocking of lawful websites and applications. It treated broadband internet access service as an information service under Title I, relying on provisions in the 1934 Communications Act. The authority to implement these rules lies in Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Title II for protecting competition and consumers, and Title III for licensing authority. The Open Internet Order established rules for broadband providers, prohibiting blocking of lawful websites and applications. It relied on Title I, Title II, and Title III of the 1934 Communications Act for authority. The Order went into effect on November 20, 2011, with multiple appeals filed and consolidated for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit. Verizon Communications challenged the Order, claiming violations of free speech and FCC authority. The court remanded the decision to the FCC for consideration on January 14, 2014. On January 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's authority to regulate broadband internet access providers but struck down specific rules in the Open Internet Order. The court cited the FCC's classification of broadband providers as information service providers, not common carriers, as the reason for striking down certain rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's authority to regulate broadband internet providers under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The court struck down specific rules in the Open Internet Order related to common carrier regulations but upheld disclosure rules. The FCC was given the authority to establish rules regarding broadband deployment and internet traffic treatment, with the case remanded for further action. FCC Chairman Wheeler outlined steps to preserve innovation, economic growth, and free expression on the internet. FCC Chairman Wheeler proposed new rules under Section 706 authority to ensure transparency, no blocking, and nondiscrimination in internet access. The FCC also opened a new docket (GN Docket No. 14-28) for public input on addressing the remand of the Open Internet rules. The FCC initiated a proceeding to establish rules to address the court's remand of its 2010 open internet order, despite opposition from Commissioners O'Rielly and Pai. On May 15, 2014, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on how to protect and promote an open Internet. The NPRM (GN Docket No.14-28) sought comments on issues to maintain an open internet platform based on FCC's 2010 Open Internet Order principles. It considered using Section 706 or Title II of the Communications Act as legal authority, along with Title III for mobile services. The use of forbearance and other potential sources of authority were also discussed. The NPRM retained the definition and scope from the 2010 Open Internet Order, focusing on actions of broadband internet access service providers. It did seek comment on potential modifications to the scope of services. The question of broadband provider service to edge providers was also raised, along with revisiting standards for mobile services. The FCC tentatively concluded that the nonblocking rule should be upheld, with broadband providers required to provide edge providers with a minimum level of access. The NPRM proposed an additional screen for commercially reasonable practices and sought input on practices like \"paid prioritization.\" The NPRM proposed rules to ensure transparency and establish a dispute resolution process, including an ombudsperson. President Obama urged reclassification of consumer broadband service under Title II with regulations to prohibit blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and increase transparency. The FCC adopted new open internet rules in February 2015, applying to mobile and fixed broadband services. The rules rely on Title II and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, with exceptions for reasonable network management. The FCC has the sole responsibility to finalize the proposal, regardless of comments received. The FCC's order in 2015 reclassified broadband Internet access service as a Title II telecommunications service, banning blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. It also established a general conduct standard to protect consumers and edge providers, enhanced transparency rules, and created a \"safe harbor\" process for disclosure requirements. The FCC's order in 2015 reclassified broadband Internet access service as a Title II telecommunications service, banning blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. It established a general conduct standard to protect consumers and edge providers, enhanced transparency rules, and created a \"safe harbor\" process for disclosure requirements. The new rules permit internet service providers to engage in \"reasonable network management\" and do not apply to \"non-BIAS data services\" or interconnection activities, but give the FCC authority to address complaints on a case-by-case basis. The FCC's 2015 order reclassified broadband Internet access as a Title II service, prohibiting unjust practices and discrimination. It included provisions for consumer privacy, disability access, and fair access to infrastructure. Despite legal challenges, the rules went into effect on June 12, 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the legality of the 2015 FCC Order on June 14, 2016. A petition for en banc review was denied on May 1, 2017. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review on November 5, 2018. On May 18, 2017, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine the regulatory framework of the 2015 Open Internet Order. The FCC approved a draft order to reclassify broadband internet access service, eliminate certain regulations, and return authority to the FTC for privacy oversight. The NPR comment period closed, largely upholding the proposed changes. The FCC approved a new framework for broadband internet access services on December 14, 2017, overturning the 2015 Order. The 2017 Order removed BIAS from Title II classification, eliminated certain rules, and shifted oversight to the FTC and DOJ. The FCC approved a new framework for broadband internet access services on December 14, 2017, overturning the 2015 Order. WC Docket No. 17-108 includes a Declaratory Ruling, a Report and Order, and an Order. The Declaratory Ruling restores the classification of BIAS as an information service, reinstates the private mobile service classification of mobile BIAS, and restores broadband consumer protection authority to the FTC. It also emphasizes that Title II regulation reduced ISP investment and innovation, supporting the information service classification for encouraging broadband investment and innovation. The Report and Order enhances transparency requirements for internet services. The 2017 Report and Order enhances transparency requirements for internet service providers, requiring disclosure of practices like blocking and throttling. It eliminates the internet conduct standard and argues that transparency, market forces, and existing laws can achieve similar benefits as the 2015 rules at a lower cost. Reactions to the Order are mixed, with some supporting the less regulatory approach for stimulating broadband investment, while others fear a concentration of power that could harm content providers and consumers. The 2017 Order, Restoring Internet Freedom, released by the FCC on January 4, 2018, has faced legal challenges and Congressional Review Act consideration. The Senate passed a resolution to overturn the Order, but the House did not consider it. The Order went into effect on June 11, 2018. The 2017 Order, Restoring Internet Freedom, replaced the 2015 Order on June 11, 2018. The new framework includes the FTC taking action against anticompetitive acts, transparency requirements for internet service providers, and reclassification of broadband internet access services as information services. The debate over network quality and pricing has intensified as consumers use the internet for multimedia and voice services. Broadband service providers' pricing structure and the nondiscriminatory transmission of data bits are key issues. With the expansion of internet use to include video, online gaming, and voice services, the need for uninterrupted streams of data has become crucial. The debate over network quality and pricing has intensified as the internet expands to include video, online gaming, and voice services. There is a discussion about prioritizing network traffic to ensure service quality, with concerns raised about potential discrimination and limited competition if content providers have to pay for different service levels. The debate over network quality and pricing has intensified with concerns about potential discrimination and limited competition if content providers have to pay for different service levels. Some argue that prioritization will benefit consumers by ensuring faster delivery and quality of service, while others warn of decreased consumer choice and increased costs if fees for premium access are passed on. They believe that in a marketplace with multiple broadband providers, abuse is less likely as consumers and content providers can seek access from other providers if necessary. The use of deep packet inspection (DPI) in the net neutrality debate allows network operators to inspect packets in real time, identifying origin, destination, application, and content. This tool enables discrimination among packets, leading to concerns about potential abuses and decreased market share for offending network providers. Enforcement agencies at federal and state levels can address any abuses that may occur. Deep packet inspection (DPI) allows network operators to differentiate among packets, enabling them to treat packets differently for various network management functions. DPI is used in filters, firewalls, and for network capacity planning and diagnostics. While DPI has positive uses, concerns exist about its potential misuse and negative impact on consumers and suppliers, raising concerns among policymakers. Concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) by network operators, as it could lead to discrimination against competing services and compromise consumer privacy. The focus is on the behavior that DPI enables rather than the tool itself, prompting the need for policies to allow beneficial discrimination while preventing harmful or anticompetitive practices. The policy debate revolves around protecting against harmful discrimination by network broadband operators, particularly regarding the controversial shift towards metered or usage-based billing. This billing model involves users subscribing to a monthly bandwidth cap for a set fee, with additional charges or service denial for exceeding the limit. Supporters argue that usage-based pricing benefits the majority of subscribers, offering more choice and control over their service tiers. The move to usage-based pricing in network broadband services is a topic of debate. Supporters argue that it offers consumers more choice and control over their usage, while opponents believe it may stifle innovation in high bandwidth applications and unfairly disadvantage competing online video services. Opponents of usage-based pricing in network broadband services argue that it will unfairly disadvantage competing online video services and stifle innovation in high bandwidth applications. They question the accuracy of meters, usage limits, and overage fees, stating that they are arbitrary. They also argue that monthly data caps are not an effective measure of congestion causation, as network congestion is temporary and location-specific. Additionally, they challenge broadband operators' claims that increased revenue streams are necessary for infrastructure investment, citing falling costs of network equipment and stable profit margins. Plans by internet service providers allow subscribers to access specific content without using their data limits. Sponsored data involves a third party paying for the data charges. These plans are seen as improving consumer choice and competition among edge providers. Critics argue that they can be used for anticompetitive purposes. The FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order's general conduct rule is debated regarding whether certain activities violate it. Former Chairman Wheeler requested meetings with AT&T, T-Mobile, Comcast, and Verizon to understand their data offering plans. The FCC found AT&T and Verizon's approaches may harm competition, leading to a draft framework for evaluation. However, current Chairman Pai later retracted the FCC's order on February 3, 2017. The FCC, led by Chairman Pai, revoked a report and closed inquiries on broadband access regulations. Six bills have been introduced in Congress to address this issue, with H.R. 1644 passing the House. This bill aims to nullify the 2017 Order and reinstate the 2015 Order. The bills aim to nullify the 2017 Order, restore the 2015 Order, and classify broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service under Title II. H.R. 1644 was passed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with a manager's amendment clarifying forbearance provisions. The subcommittee passed bill includes an amendment providing a one-year exemption for small internet service providers from enhanced transparency requirements. H.R. 1644, with 12 additional amendments, passed the House on April 10, 2019. Three bills establish a regulatory framework by amending Title I of the Communications Act to address negative behaviors of BIAS providers. H.R. 1096, introduced on February 7, 2019, by Representative Rodgers, establishes transparency requirements and FCC enforcement authority, prohibits regulations on BIAS services under Title II, and protects emergency communications and national security. H.R. 1101, introduced on February 7, 2019, amends Title I of the Communications Act to establish obligations for BIAS providers, including no blocking or throttling, no paid prioritization, and transparency rules. The FCC is required to enforce these rules through complaint adjudication and establish formal complaint procedures within 60 days of enactment. The bill aims to protect emergency communications, national security, and consumer choice in service plans. Legislation in the 115th Congress addressed various issues related to broadband networks, including bills to regulate rates for BIAS, overturn previous orders, establish FCC authority over broadband services, and address privacy concerns. The 2017 FCC Order triggered timelines for CRA consideration, with resolutions introduced in both the House and Senate to overturn the rule. S.J.Res. 52 passed the Senate on May 16, 2018, and a discharge petition was filed in the House on May 17, 2018. On May 17, 2018, Representative Doyle filed a discharge petition for H.J.Res. 129, but it was not considered. Senator Lee introduced S. 993 on May 1, 2017, to nullify the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order. The FCC's 2017 Order reopened debate on amending existing laws for FCC authority. Multiple measures were introduced to provide regulatory guidance. Four measures (H.R. 4682, H.R. 6393, S. 2510, and S. 2853) were introduced to outline FCC authority over broadband internet access services. H.R. 4682 and S. 2510 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to address issues such as prohibiting BIAS providers from blocking or degrading lawful content, granting FCC enforcement authority, establishing formal complaint procedures, preserving the ability to offer specialized services, and preempting state and local authority. The introduced measures (H.R. 4682, H.R. 6393, S. 2510, and S. 2853) aimed to outline FCC authority over broadband internet access services. H.R. 4682 and S. 2510 established BIAS as an information service, preempted state and local authority over \"internet openness obligations,\" and allowed for Federal Universal Service Fund program support. S. 2853, introduced by Senator Thune, also addressed broadband internet access services under the Communications Act of 1934. S. 2853, introduced by Senator Thune, prohibited paid prioritization and included transparency obligations. H.R. 6393, introduced by Representative Coffman, established Title VIII in the 1934 Communications Act to regulate broadband internet access providers, banning blocking, throttling, and \"paid preferential treatment\" subject to reasonable network management. H.R. 6393 established regulations for broadband internet access providers, including transparency requirements, oversight over interconnection, and eligibility for Universal Service Fund funds. Congressional action in the 115th Congress focused on privacy and transparency aspects of the 2015 Open Internet Order rules. Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke FCC's customer privacy rules under the 2015 Open Internet Order. Joint resolutions S.J.Res. 34 and H.J.Res. 86 were introduced to overturn these rules, with S.J.Res. 34 passing the Senate and House and signed by the President as P.L. 115-22. This action prevents the rules from taking effect. The Congressional Review Act was used to revoke FCC's customer privacy rules under the 2015 Open Internet Order. Joint resolutions S.J.Res. 34 and H.J.Res. 86 were introduced to overturn these rules, with S.J.Res. 34 passing and signed into law as P.L. 115-22. This action prevents the rules from taking effect and invalidates any existing rules. Additional legislation addressing broadband user data privacy and transparency requirements was introduced but received no further action. H.R. 288, introduced in 2017, addresses transparency requirements for internet service providers. It expands exemptions to include providers with 250,000 or fewer subscribers and requires a report to Congress on the exemption's permanence. The bill H.R. 288, passed by the House in 2017, and S. 228, introduced by Senator Daines, both aimed to exempt small businesses with 250,000 or fewer subscribers from enhanced transparency rules in the 2015 Open Internet Order. The FCC was required to report to Congress on the exemption's permanence and potential modifications to the definition of \"small business.\" In the 114th Congress, several measures addressing broadband regulation were introduced, including S. 40, S. 2283, S. 2602, and others. Amended versions of H.R. 4596 and H.R. 2666 passed the House but no final action was taken on any of these measures. Legislation on online competition and consumer choice was also introduced but did not progress further. H.R. 196 and H.R. 279 were introduced in the 114th Congress to address broadband regulation. H.R. 196 aimed to prohibit broadband providers from giving preferential treatment to content providers, while H.R. 279 sought to prevent the FCC from regulating the provision of broadband services. Exceptions were made for emergency communications and national security needs. The bill introduced by Representative Latta on January 12, 2015, prohibited the FCC from regulating broadband internet access as a telecommunications service. It classified broadband as an \"information service\" and prevented FCC regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In response to the FCC's Open Internet Order, Representative Blackburn introduced H.R. 1212 on March 3, 2015, blocking its implementation. The bill introduced by Representative Latta on January 12, 2015, prohibited the FCC from regulating broadband internet access as a telecommunications service. It classified broadband as an \"information service\" and prevented FCC regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In response to the FCC's Open Internet Order, Representative Blackburn introduced H.R. 1212 on March 3, 2015, blocking its implementation. Additionally, S. 2602 and H.R. 1212 negated the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order, with exceptions for national security and law enforcement actions. H.R. 2666, introduced by Representative Kinzinger, prohibited the FCC from regulating rates for broadband internet access. H.R. 2666, approved by the House Communications Subcommittee and House Energy and Commerce Committee, passed the House without amendments on April 15, 2016. It prohibited the FCC from regulating rates for broadband internet access. Another approach using the Congressional Review Act was also considered. Doug Collins introduced a resolution disapproving of the FCC's rule on protecting the open Internet. Senator Rand Paul also introduced a similar measure. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to review and invalidate new regulations. Attempts were made to delay the FCC's implementation of the Open Internet Order. The House Financial Services FY2017 appropriation measure (H.R. 5485) included provisions preventing the FCC from enforcing the Open Internet Order and regulating broadband prices. The bill passed the House and a separate legislation (H.R. 4596, S. 2283) addressed transparency requirements in the Order. The 2015 Open Internet Order included transparency requirements for internet service providers, which were enhanced in the order. H.R. 4596 addressed these requirements and passed the House, defining small internet service providers as those with 250,000 customers. The bill addressed transparency requirements for internet service providers, defining small providers as those with 250,000 subscribers or less. It also required the FCC to report to Congress on whether the exemption should be permanent. The bill addressed transparency requirements for internet service providers, defining small providers as those with 250,000 subscribers or less. It also required the FCC to report to Congress within 180 days on whether the exemption should be made permanent and if the definition of \"small\" should be modified. The debate in the 114th Congress over broadband regulation became more nuanced, with some advocating for FCC action using current provisions in the 1934 Communications Act, while others believed that existing laws are outdated and limited. Senator Thune released a list of 11 principles for updating FCC authority before taking action. Senator Thune released 11 principles for developing legislation on broadband regulation, including prohibiting blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, requiring transparency, and classifying broadband as an information service. Draft legislation based on these principles was offered by House and Senate committees to amend the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC was directed to enforce provisions on lawful content, nonharmful devices, throttling data, and paid prioritization through a formal complaint procedure. Specialized services were allowed within guidelines, and broadband internet access was classified as an information service. Hearings on this draft legislation were held in January 2015. Several measures were introduced in response to a court decision striking down FCC rules on net neutrality. H.R. 3982 and S. 1981 aimed to restore these rules temporarily. Hearings were held by various committees on the net neutrality/broadband regulation debate. In response to a court decision striking down FCC rules on net neutrality, several measures were introduced in 2014 to restore the rules temporarily. H.R. 4880 and S. 2476 directed the FCC to establish regulations prohibiting paid prioritization agreements between internet service providers and content providers. H.R. 5429 restored the FCC's authority to adopt new rules in its Open Internet proceeding. The \"Internet Act of 2014\" restored FCC authority to adopt rules vacated by the U.S. D.C. Court of Appeals. H.R. 4070, the Internet Freedom Act, stated FCC's 2010 Open Internet rules shall have \"no force or effect\" unless specifically authorized by a new law. H.R. 4752 prohibited FCC from reclassifying broadband networks under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. The Internet Freedom Act of 2014 prohibited the FCC from reclassifying broadband networks under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Hearings were held to address issues related to an open internet, with mixed support for the FCC's Open Internet Order. Some Members of Congress supported the FCC's actions regarding internet regulation, while others believed the FCC had overstepped its authority. Legislation and hearings in the 112th Congress addressed the FCC's authority to implement regulations, with bills introduced to limit FCC regulation. H.R. 96, the Internet Freedom Act, aimed to prohibit the FCC from proposing regulations on the internet or IP-enabled services. The bill prohibits the FCC from regulating the internet or IP-enabled services, except for cases related to national security, public safety, or law enforcement. Another bill requires the FCC to prove a \"market failure\" before regulating information or internet access services. The bill prohibits FCC regulations on internet and IP-enabled services, except for national security, public safety, or law enforcement reasons. It also requires regulations to be the least restrictive, reviewed every two years, and enforced on a nondiscriminatory basis. H.R. 3630 prohibits FCC from imposing network access/management requirements on licensees. Legislation was introduced to strengthen the FCC's ability to regulate open access by amending Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. The bill aimed to codify FCC principles from 2005, require internet service providers to be nondiscriminatory and transparent in network management, and provide service to end users upon \"reasonable\" terms. The bill required internet service providers to offer stand-alone broadband access at reasonable rates and prohibited paid prioritization. The FCC was tasked with establishing rules, and injured parties could seek damages. Attempts were made to prevent the FCC from implementing the Open Internet Order through the appropriations process. The House passed an amendment to prevent the FCC from using funds to implement the Open Internet Order in FY2011 appropriations, but it was not included in the final bill. A similar provision was included in the FY2012 appropriations bill for the FCC. The Open Internet Order was adopted on December 21, 2010. A measure to overturn the order using the Congressional Review Act was considered but not included in the final FY2012 appropriations bill. Identical resolutions of disapproval were introduced in the House and Senate in February 2011. A hearing on the House resolution was held on March 9, 2011. On March 9, 2011, the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.J.Res. 37, which was later approved by the full House on April 8, 2011. However, a similar resolution (S.J.Res. 6) failed to pass the Senate on November 10, 2011. The Data Cap Integrity Act of 2012 (S. 3703) addressed data usage caps by ISPs, requiring FCC certification for accuracy of data cap measurement. The Data Cap Integrity Act of 2012 addressed data usage caps by ISPs, requiring FCC certification for accuracy of data cap measurement. The bill aimed to limit network congestion without discriminating based on data source or content. ISPs applying data caps were required to provide data tools for consumer monitoring. Civil penalties for violations would reimburse those affected, with excess funds transferred to the U.S. Department of the Treasury for deficit reduction. Despite significant activity in the 111th Congress on net neutrality, no final action was taken. H.R. 3458 was introduced as a comprehensive measure on the net neutrality debate. The Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 (H.R. 3458) introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to establish a national policy of nondiscrimination and openness for internet access. It required unbundled internet access service, transparency on speed and limitations, and public disclosure of network management practices. The FCC was tasked with enforcing the legislation. The Senate Commerce and House Energy and Commerce Committees held sessions with industry stakeholders to discuss broadband regulation and FCC authority. Two bills (S. 1836, H.R. 3924) were introduced in response to FCC's NPR on preserving the open internet. S. 1836, introduced by Senator McCain, prohibited FCC from further internet regulations, with exceptions for national security and public safety. The additional provisions reaffirmed existing regulations, stating that the internet and IP-enabled services are not subject to state jurisdiction. H.R. 3924 and S. 1836 were similar bills, with H.Con.Res. 311 calling on Congress to determine FCC's regulatory authority over broadband internet services. Another measure, H.R. 5257, addressed the reclassification of broadband service. The bill introduced by Representative Stearns required the FCC to prove market failure before regulating internet services, while Senator DeMint's bill required proof of harm to consumers before imposing new regulations. The FCC was given authority to hear complaints and award damages for violations. The bill required the FCC to prove market failure before regulating internet services and gave authority to hear complaints and award damages for violations. The ARRA mandated nondiscrimination and network interconnection obligations for grant participants in the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. The FCC's National Broadband Plan outlined minimum obligations to be imposed. The FCC's National Broadband Plan (NBP) discussed the open internet and information services classification. Legislation (H.R. 2902) aimed to oversee volume usage service plans by broadband providers serving 2 million+ subscribers. The Broadband Internet Fairness Act required providers to submit plans to the FTC for approval, with review by the FCC to ensure fairness. The FTC, in consultation with the FCC, reviews broadband providers' volume usage service plans to ensure fairness. Plans deemed unjust or discriminatory are declared unlawful, with violators facing fines up to $1 million and injunctive relief."
