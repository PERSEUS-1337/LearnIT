    "content": "The \"First Response Broadcasters Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. The findings section highlights key points related to the act. Congress acknowledges the valuable public service provided by local media organizations, including newspapers, broadcasters, and online publications, before, during, and after major disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Local broadcasters played a crucial role in transmitting evacuation instructions, warnings, response updates, and essential information to listeners and viewers during these disasters. The media's role in providing crucial disaster information was hindered during Hurricane Katrina, as many local broadcasters were unable to access disaster areas and broadcast essential updates. Congressional reports emphasized the importance of accurate information dissemination by news media to the public during such crises. During Hurricane Katrina, a significant number of television and radio stations in the affected area were unable to broadcast. Only 4 out of 41 radio stations in New Orleans remained on air immediately after the hurricane. The sole television station in New Orleans that continued broadcasting did so by taking steps to protect its transmitter and provide backup production facilities. During Hurricane Katrina, broadcasters in the region faced fuel shortages hindering their ability to provide essential public information. Federal authorities confiscated privately-purchased fuel supplies, compromising broadcasters' ability to stay on air. Practices implemented post-Hurricane Andrew to involve broadcasters in disaster response were affected. The involvement of broadcasters in disaster response and expedited access for broadcast engineers to repair critical infrastructure has improved broadcasters' ability to transmit essential information during major disasters. A report to the FCC recommends granting emergency responder status to infrastructure providers and workers to address access and fuel sharing issues. The partnership of competing radio broadcasters during Hurricane Katrina provided uninterrupted public information programming, serving as a vital source of disaster-related information. Similar regional broadcaster cooperation models nationwide, like the initiative in Maine, will enhance industry readiness for major disasters. Following Hurricane Katrina, Primary Entry Point stations played a crucial role in providing life-saving information to the public using battery-operated radios. As of April 18, 2007, there were 24 States with 1 Primary Entry Point station, 4 States with 2 stations, and 2 stations in US territories, with 2 more stations in development in Alabama and Mississippi to enhance disaster response capabilities. Additional 23 Primary Entry Point stations are needed in various states and territories, including Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and American Samoa. In larger states like Kansas and Florida, additional Primary Entry Point stations are needed to ensure full geographic coverage in the event of a disaster. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"disaster area,\" \"first response broadcaster,\" \"major disaster,\" and \"Secretary.\" SEC. 4 authorizes $6,500,000 for the construction of 25 Primary Entry Point stations in the US and territories. These stations are designated to provide public information during emergencies when there is no commercial power. SEC. 5 establishes a Broadcast Disaster Preparedness Grant Program. The Broadcast Disaster Preparedness Grant Program, established under this section, allows the Administrator to provide grants to first response broadcasters within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Priority may be given to applications from multiple broadcasters in an area, in cooperation with authorities, or with 50 employees or less. The Broadcast Disaster Preparedness Grant Program allows grants to first response broadcasters for disaster-related programming and infrastructure protection. The Broadcast Disaster Preparedness Grant Program provides funding for first responder broadcasters to improve their ability to produce and transmit disaster-related public information programming. The Federal share of the grant is limited to 50 percent, and the program will terminate after the third fiscal year. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2010. SEC. 6. FIRST RESPONSE BROADCASTER ACCESS FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER. Access to essential emergency services, health care, and utility restoration services is amended to include providing fuel, food, water, and supplies to first response broadcasters. The term \"first response broadcaster\" is defined in section 707 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Title VII of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include confiscation provisions. Title VII of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include confiscation provisions for first response broadcasters. Title VII of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to protect first response broadcasters from having fuel, water, or food confiscated during a major disaster, allowing them to continue broadcasting essential disaster-related public information programming. Title VII of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to protect first response broadcasters during a major disaster by allowing access for technical personnel and equipment needed to restore critical facilities. During a major disaster, first response broadcasters are protected under an amendment to the Robert T. Stafford Act, allowing access for technical personnel and equipment to restore critical facilities essential for broadcasting disaster-related public information programming. This excludes news gathering employees of first response broadcasters. Press guidelines include definitions such as \"credentialing authority\" for agencies issuing press credentials and coordinating access to designated areas. Access to disaster areas for news personnel is permitted based on possessing press credentials, which identify them as members of the press. News personnel include broadcast journalists, reporters, photojournalists, and professionals interested in gathering disaster-related information for wider publication or broadcast. State or local government agencies are responsible for coordinating access for news personnel to disaster areas. During a major disaster, the State or local government agency serving as the primary credentialing authority retains its role unless it voluntarily gives it up or assigns certain duties to the Federal Emergency Management Agency after consulting with relevant Federal disaster response agencies. During a catastrophic incident, if a State or local primary credentialing authority is unable to fulfill its duties, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relevant Federal disaster response agencies will coordinate news personnel access to the disaster area according to established guidelines. The Secretary can designate the Federal Emergency Management Agency or another Federal agency as the interim primary credentialing authority if a State or local authority is unable to fulfill its duties, until the authority notifies the Secretary of its intent to retain, relinquish, or assign its status."
