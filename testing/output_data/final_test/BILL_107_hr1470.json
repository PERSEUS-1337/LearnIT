    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Since 1975, the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) has provided funding for social services to support at-risk individuals and families, the elderly, and those with disabilities. In 1981, SSBG was converted into a block grant to give states flexibility in serving these populations. The focus is on cost-effective community-level support to prevent the need for more expensive institutional care covered by programs like Medicaid and Medicare. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) supports programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and disability benefits. It helps with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), child welfare services, and promotes adoption for stable family environments. The SSBG promotes independent living for elderly individuals through home care services, including meals and protective services. It also supports adult protective services to prevent abuse and neglect of older Americans, benefiting over 651,000 individuals in 31 States. Additionally, the SSBG provides community-based services and supports for more than 570,000 disabled individuals nationwide. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides resources for community-based services nationwide, filling funding gaps in developmental disabilities systems. It supports services like early intervention, crisis intervention, adult day care, respite care, transportation, employment training, and independent living in 38 States. The SSBG also aids in mental health services, offering counseling to adults and children, case management for families, and information and referral assistance. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) provides child protective services, adoption services, and prevention/intervention services to millions of children and families. However, the SSBG has faced over $1 billion in cuts over the last 6 years, impacting services in many states and communities. Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grants cannot compensate for these cuts as SSBG funds also support elderly, disabled, and other ineligible populations. The 104th Congress made a commitment to the SSBG. The 104th Congress committed to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) by authorizing funds of $2,380,000,000 through fiscal year 2002, increasing to $2,800,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 and beyond. The Social Services Block Grant funds were increased to $2,380,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and subsequent years, with the ability to transfer up to 10% of TANF funds to the grant. The amendments took effect on October 1, 2001. The Secretary is required to compile and submit annual reports on state activities to Congress under the Social Security Act. This amendment applies to information submitted by States for fiscal year 2000 and onwards."
