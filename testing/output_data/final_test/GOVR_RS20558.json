    "content": "IDEA provides federal funds to states for educating children with disabilities, with requirements on services and due process. The 1997 amendment was a significant update, especially regarding disciplinary procedures. The original 1975 enactment aimed to address the lack of appropriate education for children with disabilities, leading to legal cases like PARC v. State of Pennsylvania and Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia. The 1997 amendment to IDEA outlined specific requirements for states to receive federal funds for educating children with disabilities. It included a provision that children must \"stay put\" in their current educational placement during disputes. The Supreme Court addressed exceptions to this provision in the case of Honig v. Doe in 1988. In 1997, Congress made changes to IDEA in P.L. 105-17 to balance school safety and education for children with disabilities. The law allows schools to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative setting if they bring a firearm to school. This does not exempt a child with a disability from consequences. The current law allows for disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, including suspension, manifestation determination review, and placement changes. Educational services must continue even during long-term disciplinary actions. The current law allows for disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, including suspension, manifestation determination review, and placement changes. School officials may seek an interim alternative education setting for up to forty-five days for situations involving weapons or drugs, or if a child is substantially likely to injure themselves or others. Legislation addressing violence in schools was introduced in the 106th Congress. In 1999, amendments were proposed in the Senate and House to change discipline procedures under IDEA for children with disabilities in certain situations involving weapons. The Senate passed Amendment 355, while the House passed Amendment 35, but the legislation was not enacted. Proponents argued for more control over discipline due to recent school gun violence incidents, while opponents disagreed. The proposed amendments to IDEA aimed to give school officials more control over discipline for children with disabilities in specific situations involving weapons or drugs. One amendment focused on discipline for carrying weapons, while another addressed drug possession or assault at school. Opponents feared these changes could lead to more criminal behavior among children with disabilities. The amendment proposed by Rep. Norwood required states receiving funds under the Act to have policies allowing school personnel to discipline children with disabilities carrying weapons at school like those without disabilities. Expulsion or suspension could be imposed, with no entitlement to educational services unless provided for children without disabilities. Local educational agencies could offer educational or mental health services, with no specific service level requirement. The amendment allowed school personnel to modify disciplinary actions for children with disabilities carrying weapons at school. It provided a defense for unintentional possession of a weapon, but the implications were uncertain. The term \"weapon\" was defined as a dangerous object capable of causing harm. The amendment by Representatives Talent, McIntosh, and Tancredo required states receiving funds under the Act to implement a policy allowing school personnel to discipline children with disabilities for drug possession, selling controlled substances, or committing assault at school. The Norwood amendment proposed disciplinary actions for children with disabilities, allowing for expulsion or suspension without entitlement to educational services. However, the local educational agency could choose to provide educational or mental health services at their discretion. School personnel could modify disciplinary actions on a case-by-case basis. Children with disabilities could defend themselves against drug-related offenses under this amendment. The Norwood amendment proposed disciplinary actions for children with disabilities, allowing for expulsion or suspension without entitlement to educational services. However, the local educational agency could choose to provide educational or mental health services at their discretion. School personnel could modify disciplinary actions on a case-by-case basis. Children with disabilities could defend themselves against drug-related offenses under this amendment, which included a provision for unintentional or innocent possession or use of illegal drugs. The exact implications of this defense were uncertain as it was not specified to whom or when it could be asserted. The amendment did not provide a similar defense for aggravated assault or battery allegations. The definition of controlled substance in the amendment was consistent with the definition in section 4141 of H.R. 4141. The amendments proposed to include substances legally possessed or used under supervision of a licensed health-care professional or under other authorities, but were not enacted."
