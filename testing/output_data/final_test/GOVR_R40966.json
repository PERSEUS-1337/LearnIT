    "content": "Under the federal crop insurance program, farmers can purchase policies to manage financial risks associated with declines in crop yields and revenue. The program covers over 100 crops and is administered by the USDA's Risk Management Agency. A Standard Reinsurance Agreement between USDA and private companies determines program costs and subsidies. In 2009, the SRA was renegotiated. The USDA renegotiated the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) in 2010 for the 2011 reinsurance year and subsequent years. The process involved developing a draft agreement, meeting with insurance companies, and finalizing the agreement, which was signed by all 16 approved insurance companies. The report discusses federal crop insurance costs and issues related to the renegotiation of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) for the 2011 reinsurance year. Congress has oversight on the SRA negotiation, focusing on cost-effectiveness, farmer participation, and potential impacts on crop insurance expenditures. Federal crop insurance was initially authorized as an experiment during the Great Depression to address crop losses. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) was established to implement the program, which initially covered major crops in key producing areas. The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-365) expanded the program to include more crops and regions. Congress further improved the program in 1994 and 2000 to boost participation and involve the private sector in developing new risk management products for farmers. The federal government subsidizes crop insurance policies to reduce the need for ad hoc disaster assistance, with policies sold and serviced by 16 approved private insurance companies. Losses of insurance companies are reinsured by USDA, and their operational costs are covered. The USDA reinsures insurance company losses and reimburses their administrative and operating costs. These costs include payroll, rent, commissions, and expenses for adjusting claims. The SRA does not affect policy premiums paid by farmers, which are based on RMA's risk estimates and subsidies set in statute. Premiums depend on crop price levels, coverage levels, and policy type. Expense reimbursement is calculated as a share of policy premiums. Federal program costs for crop insurance include premium subsidies, administrative and operating expenses, program losses, and other categories. The SRA defines parameters for A&O expense reimbursement, program losses, and premium subsidies specified in the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980. Premium subsidies lower the cost of insurance policies for farmers, with the government covering nearly 60% of the premium. A&O expense reimbursement is the second-largest cost category, covering administrative and operating costs for insurance companies. Premiums increase with additional coverage, such as greater price or yield protection. The second-largest cost category for crop insurance is A&O expense reimbursement, which is directly related to the value of premiums. Program losses, other expenses like RMA salaries, and research costs make up the remaining cost categories. Government costs for crop insurance have increased substantially in recent years, reaching over $7 billion in FY2009. The Standard Reinsurance Agreement is a financial agreement between FCIC and approved crop insurance companies to deliver eligible crop insurance contracts. The 2010 reinsurance year SRA contains four sections, including definitions. The 2010 Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) establishes terms for reinsuring and subsidizing insurance contracts for all crops in any state. Insurance companies must offer all plans of insurance to prevent cherry-picking profitable policies. Rebates for purchasing policies are prohibited, and employees must be properly licensed. Net book premium is the total premium calculated for insurance policies. The 2010 Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) defines risk-sharing between the government and private insurance companies. Companies assign policies to reinsurance funds within 30 days of sales closing dates, deciding on premium retention proportions. Transfer of risk is facilitated through FCIC-managed funds, with profits/losses from policies retained by companies. The 2010 Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) outlines risk-sharing between private insurance companies and the government. Companies must retain at least 35% of their book of business, with the ceded portion going to the government. The assigned risk fund is used for high-risk policies to ensure all eligible farmers have access to federal crop insurance benefits. Companies may retain as little as 15% to 25% of their highest-risk business, with the federal government assuming liability for high-risk policies. Limits are set on the proportion of business that can be placed in the assigned risk fund, with excess policies allocated to the developmental fund. In 2008, companies allocated 20% to assigned risk, 10% to developmental, and 70% to commercial funds. Companies retain between 50% to 100% of premium and liability in the commercial fund. Actual gain/loss sharing is based on loss ratios, with higher ratios leading to lower company share of losses. The 2010 SRA includes provisions for risk-sharing among companies and the government based on loss ratios. Companies' shares of gains and losses vary by fund, with the commercial fund having the greatest exposure. Companies must cede a 5% share of cumulative underwriting gains/losses to the government through the \"net book quota share.\" The 2010 SRA requires companies to cede a 5% share of underwriting gains/losses to the government, offsetting part of the government costs. The reimbursement rate for A&O expenses ranged from 18.1% to 24.2% during 2006-2008. Beginning in 2009, crop insurance companies saw a reduction in reimbursement rates mandated by Congress, resulting in rates ranging from 15.8% to 21.9%. Companies are required to provide data on policyholders and face penalties for late or inaccurate submissions. The company must provide policyholders with a summary of coverage and billing statement displaying policy premium, FCIC-paid portion, and A&O reimbursement. They must follow FCIC regulations for activities like verifying yields. USDA hired a firm to calculate rates of return for crop insurers in preparation for renegotiating the SRA. Milliman, Inc. estimated historical rates of return on equity and \"reasonable\" rates to determine if insurers are over- or undercompensated. The reasonable rate of return was defined as the \"cost of capital\" or returns received by property and casualty insurers. The study analyzed historical returns on equity for crop insurers from 1989 to 2008, showing an average of 16.6% compared to the estimated \"reasonable\" rate of return of 12.8%. Despite a negative return in 1993 due to flooding, the industry remained profitable. The study was criticized for not considering reinsurance and actual A&O costs, prompting the crop insurance industry to conduct its own analysis based on profitability relative to premiums. The study by Grant Thorton LLP analyzed profitability in the crop insurance industry from 1992-2008, with a 14.2% average pre-tax net income compared to 17.5% in the property and casualty industry. The USDA criticized the study for not considering investment income. The SRA renegotiation addressed concerns about government costs, industry viability, insurance availability, and farmer participation. Any cost reductions from the new SRA would be in addition to those mandated by the 2008 farm bill, resulting in $3.9 billion in net budget savings. The 2008 farm bill mandated changes resulting in $3.9 billion in budget savings over five years. A significant portion of the savings came from adjustments in premium receipts and payments to insurance companies. A&O reimbursements have increased sharply in recent years, reaching $1.6 billion in FY2009. Observers have noted a doubling in A&O reimbursement per policy from 2004-2008. The reimbursement rate for crop insurance more than doubled from $750 during 2004-2006 to $1,748 in 2008. Critics argue that the rate should be based on a flat fee per policy sold to better reflect actual costs and reduce federal expenditures. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggested in April 2009 that the current structure of reimbursements could be adjusted to save government spending without compromising the safety net for farmers. The increase in crop insurance prices has led to higher commissions for insurance agencies and agents, funded by A&O reimbursements. Companies compete for business by offering higher commissions, rather than competing on product quality or price. Some argue that these increased agent commissions are excessive and directly linked to additional subsidies for crop insurance. The private crop insurance companies argue that reductions in A&O reimbursements could negatively impact the industry and jeopardize crop insurance delivery, especially in high-risk areas. Analysis by the National Crop Insurance Services found that A&O reimbursements have consistently been below actual expenses, with a shortfall of 1-2 percentage points in 2008. Additionally, with declining crop prices, A&O expense reimbursements decreased in FY2009 and are expected to decline further in FY2010. The analysis highlights the impact of inadequate A&O reimbursements on company profits and proposes \"smoothing\" commodity prices for reimbursement expenses. Company underwriting gains have increased due to favorable weather, leading to higher insured acreage and gross liability. Suggestions to reduce government costs include implementing the new SRA. The new SRA could potentially alter underwriting gains to reduce government costs. The insurance industry argues that the net book quota share provision is like a tax on underwriting income and wants it eliminated. They also seek revisions to underwriting gain and loss provisions to prevent large gains or losses, aiming to encourage insurers to offer insurance in high-loss states. Insurers cannot adjust rates in response to underwriting losses as rates are set by the RMA. The insurance industry is concerned about maintaining crop insurance availability and farmer participation in the program. Federal crop insurance policies covered 265 million acres in 2009, and the industry warns that changes to the structure of the SRA could impact this. Insurers cannot adjust rates in response to underwriting losses, which could affect the level of required reserves and retained underwriting gains. The crop insurance industry is concerned about maintaining availability and farmer participation in the program. Some suggest cuts can be made without risking declines in participation, as reimbursements are above past levels. In states with small agricultural sectors, few companies offer policies due to high overhead costs. To improve availability in these states, the industry recommends shifting A&O reimbursements towards underserved states. The crop insurance industry is concerned about uncertainties related to payment timing and general demand for crop insurance. Industry recommends shifting A&O reimbursements towards underserved states and promoting additional education programs for farmers. Declines in demand and prospects for uncertain demand recovery are causing concern for expense reimbursement. The crop insurance industry is worried about uncertain demand recovery and expense reimbursement reductions. RMA is reviewing premium rate determination methods, causing industry concern about profitability under the new SRA. USDA's Risk Management Agency released the first draft of the 2011 SRA on December 4, 2009. USDA released a new method for calculating administrative and operating expenses in the 2011 Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with crop insurance companies. The method uses 10-year average farm prices for seven major commodities to determine reimbursements, aiming to save federal money and stabilize reimbursement levels. All approved crop insurance companies signed the new SRA, effective for policies closing after July 1, 2010. The draft of the 2011 Standard Reinsurance Agreement proposed reimbursement levels similar to those in 2005 and 2006, with changes in underwriting provisions including a reduction in reinsurance funds and the creation of a nationwide residual fund for high-risk policies. The USDA proposed consolidating high-risk crop insurance policies into a national pool shared by all companies to stabilize loss performance. The draft agreement grouped states by risk levels to increase competition and opportunities for gains in high-risk states while decreasing them in low-risk states. These changes aim to enhance competition in historically less profitable states and those considered \"underserved.\" The USDA's proposed changes to the crop insurance program aim to stabilize loss performance by consolidating high-risk policies into a national pool. The draft agreement increases competition in historically less profitable states and underserved areas, with a new net book quota share of 10%. The proposal would save $4 billion over five years and $8 billion over 10 years, with the government assuming a greater share of extreme losses to protect insurance companies. The crop insurance industry expressed concerns about the USDA's initial proposal, stating that it would be financially burdensome and lead to staff reductions and service cuts for farmers. The National Crop Insurance Services, Inc. issued a response highlighting worries about funding reductions, changes to reimbursements, and underwriting provisions. They believe the proposed changes would significantly impact industry returns and hinder the ability to serve all producers, especially those in underserved states, potentially resulting in job losses. The crop insurance industry is concerned about the USDA's proposal, which could lead to job losses and service cuts for farmers. The proposed changes may impact industry returns and hinder the ability to serve all producers, particularly those in underserved states. The industry disagrees with the fixed formula for A&O reimbursements and does not want the government to take on additional risk for the most profitable states. The crop insurance industry is concerned about the USDA's proposal, which could reduce potential net underwriting gains and incentives to expand in underserved markets. The industry proposed two options for changing the underwriting provisions to address these concerns. Option A would eliminate quota share and alter company share provisions based on state groups. Option A would eliminate quota share and change company share of risk and gain for two groups. Option B would increase quota share to 10% and boost company share of gains, especially for group 2. Both proposals could reduce underwriting gains by $100 million annually and pose regulatory risks due to undefined procedures. The USDA announced the second draft of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement on February 17, 2010, with significant changes in A&O reimbursements and risk-sharing terms. The draft included a two-year phase-in period for using historical crop prices for reimbursement levels, with a 10% increase in the first year and 5% in the second year. Additionally, companies would receive an extra 5% in reimbursements for operations in lower-served and higher-risk states. The USDA proposed a \"soft cap\" on agent commissions at 80% of A&O reimbursements to control commissions and ensure financial stability in insurance companies. The risk-sharing provisions in the second draft reduced state groups to two and provided more profit/loss sharing for policies in the commercial fund. Additionally, the USDA shifted from a nationwide pool to individual company pools for the residual fund to limit liability exposure. The USDA's second draft of crop insurance policies includes changes such as a net book quota share set at 7.5%, with 2.5% allocated to underserved states. This would increase the expected rate of return for insurance companies to 14%, reducing federal crop insurance expenditures by $6.9 billion over 10 years. Initial industry feedback was mixed, with some concerns about cost savings and impacts. Some Members of Congress, including the Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, are concerned that cuts to crop insurance funding could impact overall spending for the next farm bill. USDA's first draft of the SRA includes cost savings that have been incorporated into the baseline spending estimate by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which will be used as the benchmark for scoring the budgetary impacts of the next farm bill. The Congressional Budget Office's baseline projections serve as the official benchmark for scoring the budgetary impacts of the next farm bill. The most recent baseline shows $77.2 billion in crop insurance spending from FY2011-FY2020, with $3.9 billion in savings from a new Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA). The SRA, effective from July 1, 2010, includes a cap on administrative and operating reimbursements at $1.3 billion. The 2011 SRA for crop insurance includes a cap on A&O reimbursements at $1.3 billion per year, adjusted for inflation to $1.37 billion in 2015. The reference price concept was removed, and A&O reimbursement is based on market prices. A minimum total reimbursement of $1 billion is set to protect against low market prices. Agent commissions are limited to 80% of A&O reimbursements in each state, with total agent compensation capped at 100% of A&O reimbursements. Average commissions under the previous SRA were 108% of A&O reimbursements, increasing financial risk according to USDA. The 2011 SRA for crop insurance aims to reduce financial risk for companies by capping agent commissions at 80% of A&O reimbursements. Changes include altering risk-sharing terms for higher-risk states to increase profit potential and reduce share of loss. USDA has shifted back to an assigned risk fund for major disasters in individual states. The net book quota share is set at 6.5%, compared to the previous level of 5%. The 2011 SRA for crop insurance aims to reduce financial risk for companies by capping agent commissions at 80% of A&O reimbursements. USDA estimates that the new SRA reduces federal crop insurance expenditures by $6 billion over 10 years. $4 billion of the savings would be used for deficit reduction and $2 billion for risk management and conservation programs. The agreement generally maintains the A&O subsidy structure but removes the possibility of \"windfall\" government payments based on commodity price spikes. The insurance industry remains concerned about the potential impact of reduced funding on overall delivery. The insurance industry is worried about the impact of reduced funding on program delivery and service quality to producers."
