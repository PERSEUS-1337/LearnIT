    "content": "American voters elect the President and Vice President of the United States through the electoral college system, which has resulted in the candidate with the most popular votes winning in 47 out of the past 51 elections. However, there have been instances where the electoral college awarded the presidency to candidates who received fewer popular votes. The electoral college system in the U.S. requires a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency, leading to criticism and reform plans. In 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency over Al Gore despite receiving fewer popular votes, with the outcome hinging on Florida's close and uncertain popular vote totals. Recounts and struggles ensued for over a month after election day. Following the 2000 presidential election, a bitter and protracted struggle ensued for over a month. A Supreme Court decision ended further recounts, leading to the certification of Bush-Cheney electors in Florida. The electoral college system and election administration procedures were criticized, leading to the enactment of the Help America Vote Act in 2002. This act established national standards for voting systems and election procedures, providing grants to assist state and local governments. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was passed in 2002 to address voting technology failures. Unlike proposed amendments to reform the electoral college system, HAVA's enactment was smoother due to the constitutional amendment process being more challenging. Efforts to eliminate the electoral college would face strong opposition in Congress and the public forum. The report examines alternative proposals for electoral college reform, including the National Popular Vote movement's multi-state compact. Various constitutional proposals have been introduced over time, falling into two categories. In recent decades, proposals for electoral college reform have focused on two categories: eliminating the electoral college system for direct popular election or repairing perceived defects while keeping the existing system. The direct election alternative would replace the electoral college with a nationwide popular vote, electing candidates with a plurality or majority of votes. Some proposals mandate joint presidential/vice presidential tickets, while others require a minimum threshold of votes for election. Some proposals for electoral college reform suggest a direct popular election to replace the current system. This would involve electing candidates based on a nationwide popular vote, with a majority or plurality of votes required. Proponents argue that this process would be simple, national, and democratic, allowing all voters to directly choose the President and Vice President. If no ticket reaches the required threshold, a subsequent runoff election or Congress electing the officials in a joint session could be options. Direct election proposals aim to replace the current electoral college system with a nationwide popular vote. Candidates winning the most popular votes would secure victory, with options for a runoff election or Congress electing officials if no ticket reaches the required threshold. This process ensures equal weight for every vote cast, eliminating potential complications in case of a candidate's death before electoral vote results are declared. Direct election proponents argue for a nationwide popular vote to replace the electoral college system, claiming it is more democratic. Critics question how plurality Presidents could align with the requirement for strict \"majority rule\" in direct election. Critics of direct election argue that without the electoral college, there could be political fragmentation and regionalism, leading to acrimonious post-election struggles. They point to the contested 2000 election as an example of the potential nationwide disputes that could arise under a direct election system. Reform measures for the electoral college include variants that eliminate the office of elector, award electoral votes directly to candidates, and require a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency. Popular proposals include the automatic plan. The most popular reform proposals for the electoral college include the automatic plan, the district plan, and the proportional plan. Defenders of the electoral college argue that it is not undemocratic as electors are chosen by voters in free elections. The electoral college system in the United States involves a federal election of the President where votes are tallied in each state. Defenders argue that it is a federal element in the constitutional system, providing equal representation for all states. Defenders of the electoral college system argue that it provides equal representation for all states, promoting political stability by requiring parties to campaign nationwide to assemble a majority of electoral votes. They reject the idea that less populous states are advantaged, pointing out that states like California hold significant voting power due to their large number of electoral votes. The electoral college system promotes national coalitions and stability in the two-party system. Critics argue it is outdated and potentially undemocratic, with proposals for direct election gaining support. The \"faithless elector\" phenomenon is rare and has not influenced election outcomes significantly. Most reform plans aim to eliminate the role of electors to prevent any potential mischief. The electoral college system is criticized as an outdated and undemocratic 18th-century anachronism. Critics argue that the 12th Amendment provisions for contingent elections are less democratic, and the fixed number of electoral votes per state does not accurately reflect population changes. Some states have a disproportionate advantage due to the two \"senatorial\" electors assigned regardless of population. Critics propose eliminating the role of electors to prevent potential mischief. Critics of the electoral college system argue that it disenfranchises voters by awarding all electoral votes in each state to the candidate who wins the most popular votes, leading to the phenomenon of \"faithless electors.\" They also highlight the potential for state legislatures to choose electors by means other than popular vote, undermining democratic principles. The electoral college system has the potential to elect candidates with fewer popular votes, as seen in 2000, 1888, and 1876. Critics argue that state legislatures could choose electors by undemocratic means, as discussed in Florida in 2000. This challenges the democratic nature of the system and raises concerns about its relevance in the 21st century. The Every Vote Counts Amendment, introduced in the 110th Congress, aimed to reform the electoral college system by focusing on the election process. Sections 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the proposed amendment addressed the election by \"the people of the several States and the district constituting the seat of government.\" The Every Vote Counts Amendment proposed changes to the electoral college system, including setting a plurality requirement for election and allowing Congress to address candidate deaths or tie votes. Congress would have broad authority in these situations, potentially including options like rescheduling elections or breaking ties with a second round election. The proposed Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to change the electoral college system by allowing Congress to intervene in cases of tie votes or candidate deaths. It also included voter qualification requirements for presidential elections, potentially giving Congress unprecedented authority in party candidate replacement processes. The proposed Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to change the electoral college system by allowing Congress to intervene in tie votes or candidate deaths. It included voter qualification requirements for presidential elections, potentially giving Congress unprecedented authority in party candidate replacement processes. Additionally, it sought to empower states to set less restrictive voting residence qualifications, and empower Congress to establish uniform residence and age requirements. This could be seen as redundant or as encouragement for shorter residency requirements for voters. The proposed Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to change the electoral college system by allowing Congress to intervene in tie votes or candidate deaths. It included voter qualification requirements for presidential elections, potentially giving Congress unprecedented authority in party candidate replacement processes. The amendment sought to empower states to set less restrictive voting residence qualifications and allow Congress to establish uniform residence and age requirements for presidential elections. Critics argue that national voting requirements are justified for federal elections. The amendment would come into force for the first presidential election occurring one year or longer after ratification.

Critics argue that national voting requirements are justified for federal elections. The amendment would come into force for the first presidential election occurring one year or longer after ratification. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. introduced a measure in 2007 proposing direct popular election of the President and Vice President by all U.S. citizens, regardless of state residency. No further action was taken on the proposal. The proposed Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to change the electoral college system by allowing Congress to intervene in tie votes or candidate deaths.

It might, however, also be considered to require state and local authorities to permit any citizen to vote in a presidential election, without regard to existing residence or voter registration arrangements. If so, this might have led to complications in vote counting and registry and increased costs for local authorities. They might have believed it necessary to institute one ballot for the presidential vote, and a separate one for \"down ballot\" elections in order to ensure that only voters who are registered in the jurisdiction cast votes for state and local office. Here again, however, the argument may be made that election of the President and Vice President is of such profound national importance, it must transcend the convenience of state and local governments. Section 2 of H.J.Res. 36 declared that \"the persons having the greatest number of votes ... shall be elected, so long as such persons have a majority of the votes cast.\" This provision of the proposed amendment.

Section 2 of H.J.Res. 36 declared that \"the persons having the greatest number of votes ... shall be elected, so long as such persons have a majority of the votes cast.\" This provision of the proposed amendment differed from most direct election proposals, which more commonly establish a 40% plurality or a simple plurality to elect. More problematic, however, was the fact that while it established a majority requirement, H.J.Res. 36 did not incorporate any procedures for elections in which no candidate wins a majority. Since popular vote plurality elections occur with some regularity, this omission could have been remedied in committee by such procedures as a runoff election or election by Congress under such circumstances. An additional option could have empowered Congress to provide by legislation for such events, leaving selection of the vehicle to the judgment of the legislature. This measure was introduced by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida on June 6, 2008. It was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary the same day, but no further action was taken on it. Section 1 of this proposed. Section 1 of the proposed Every Vote Counts Amendment aimed to establish direct election of the President and Vice President, extending participation to U.S. territories. This change did not require a majority or plurality threshold of popular votes to elect, but rather a level of plurality. The expansion to territories was justified by the citizenship of their inhabitants. The 23rd Amendment granted voting rights to residents of Washington, D.C., similar to the proposed Every Vote Counts Amendment which aimed to extend voting rights to U.S. territories. Critics argued that the territories, unlike D.C., were unlikely to become states and that granting them voting rights would undermine federalism and statehood. The territories and U.S. dependencies were acquired in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. American Samoa's inhabitants are American nationals, not U.S. citizens. The proposed amendment aimed to expand congressional authority over the presidential election process, including determining the time, place, and manner of holding the election and entitlement to inclusion on the ballot. The proposed amendment aimed to expand congressional authority over the presidential election process, including ballot access and vote counting to ensure fair elections. Congressional power would guarantee national standards for election administration. The proposed amendment aimed to expand congressional authority over the presidential election process to ensure fair elections by guaranteeing national standards for election administration. Opponents argue that such legislation would infringe on state authority and impose heavy costs on states to meet federal requirements. Congress has provided financial assistance to states for new voting systems standards mandated in the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). While opponents question the temporary nature of HAVA grants and the federal government's willingness to assume permanent responsibility, states have plenary power in choosing how to pick presidential electors. The founders intended for each state to appoint a number of electors equal to their Senators, giving states discretion in how they choose and allocate electors. States can experiment with different systems of elector selection and allocation, acting as \"laboratories\" for national policy initiatives. All states and DC currently use joint tickets for electors. The states and DC use joint tickets for electors, with popular election of presidential electors. Electors are chosen under the winner-take-all system, except in Maine and Nebraska. Efforts to change the system include the proportional plan for allocating electoral votes based on popular vote percentage. On November 2, 2004, Colorado voters considered a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have established a proportional system for allocating presidential electors based on popular vote percentage. If passed, it would have applied to the 2004 election and all future ones. Colorado voters in 2004 considered a constitutional amendment to allocate electoral votes based on popular vote percentage, applying to future elections as well. The proposal aimed to distribute electors proportionally to the statewide popular vote for each presidential ticket, rounding up or down to the nearest whole number of electors. Any ticket not receiving at least one electoral vote would be eliminated. The 2004 Colorado initiative proposed to allocate electoral votes based on popular vote percentage, rounding to the nearest whole number of electors. If the total electoral votes reached nine, they would be reduced for the ticket with the fewest popular votes. In case of a tie, the Colorado Secretary of State would determine the split by lot. There were concerns about the constitutionality of this change. The U.S. Constitution allows states to appoint electors based on the number of Senators and Representatives. Colorado's proposed Amendment 36 aimed to change the allocation of electoral votes by popular vote, which raised concerns about its constitutionality. The Colorado legislature's right to establish a proportional system was not in dispute. The question was whether the legislature could delegate its powers to the voters to change how electors are appointed. Proponents argued that the state constitution allowed for this change, while opponents questioned the constitutionality of such a move under the U.S. Constitution. Opponents argued that the U.S. Constitution only delegates the power to amend to state legislatures, not the voters. Despite gaining enough signatures, Amendment 36 in Colorado was defeated in the 2004 election, which would have changed the electoral vote distribution. The district system for awarding electoral votes is unique, with Maine and Nebraska currently using it. Popular votes are tallied by district and statewide, with the winning ticket in each district receiving one elector. California also considered a similar system in 2007. Equal Representation filed a legislative ballot measure with the California Attorney General for the Presidential Election Reform Act, which aimed to implement a district system for choosing presidential electors and awarding electoral votes. Supporters argued that the current winner-take-all system disenfranchised millions of California voters. In 2004, the Democratic ticket received all 55 electoral votes despite winning only 54.3% of the popular vote, while the Republican ticket received none with 44.4% of the popular vote. If the district system had been in place, the electoral votes would have been split between the two tickets. Opponents criticized the California Presidential Election Reform Act, claiming it was a Republican-dominated initiative aimed at obtaining Republican electors in a traditionally Democratic state. California Counts, the advocacy group supporting the measure, denied these allegations and released lists of Democratic and Independent contributors. Legal commentator Vik Amar argued that the Act would likely be found unconstitutional if challenged, similar to discussions on Colorado Amendment 36. The California Presidential Election Reform Act faced political and constitutional controversy due to the requirement for action by the state legislature to change the process. Proponents also had to collect a significant number of signatures from registered voters to meet the state initiative threshold. The California Presidential Reform Act faced challenges in collecting enough signatures to be placed on the ballot for the 2008 election. The National Popular Vote campaign aims to replace the electoral college with a direct popular vote system through an interstate compact. The National Popular Vote (NPV) plan aims to have states appoint presidential electors committed to the popular vote winner nationwide, bypassing the electoral college. Proposed by constitutional scholars in 2001, NPV seeks to achieve direct popular election without a constitutional amendment. The National Popular Vote (NPV) plan proposes a compact where states appoint electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner, ensuring a unanimous electoral college vote of 538 electors for the winning candidates for President and Vice President. The National Popular Vote (NPV) plan proposes a compact where states appoint electors pledged to the nationwide popular vote winner. The process would only take effect after approval by states with a total of 270 electoral votes. If the national popular vote is tied, states can choose electors based on the popular vote in their state. States can withdraw from the compact, but any withdrawal within six months of a presidential term's end would not take effect until after the next election. The winning national popular vote candidate can fill any electoral college vacancies. The National Popular Vote (NPV) plan allows the candidate who wins the national popular vote to appoint electors of their choice to fill any vacancies in the electoral college. NPV is managed by National Popular Vote, Inc., a non-profit corporation established in 2006. The organization has bipartisan support and claims the endorsement of over 1,200 state legislators. The National Popular Vote (NPV) plan, managed by National Popular Vote, Inc., has bipartisan support and the endorsement of over 1,200 state legislators. The NPV interstate compact has been introduced in 45 states, with four states adopting it by the end of 2008: Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey. Additionally, the compact was introduced in 21 states in 2008 legislative sessions, passing in seven states including California. In 2008, several states considered the National Popular Vote (NPV) plan, with California, Maine, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Washington potentially adding 88 electoral votes if approved. Washington approved NPV, adding 88 electoral votes for a total of 138, slightly more than 50% of the 270 needed for the compact. The proposal was approved in four states, with uncertainty if this trend would continue. Arguments for and against NPV mirror those for direct popular election. The central issue is the simplicity and democratic appeal of direct election versus the complexity of other factors cited by supporters. The National Popular Vote movement advocates for a national vote that guarantees the Presidency to the candidate with the most popular votes in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, eliminating the possibility of a President winning fewer votes than their opponent. This system aims to ensure fairness and respect for the voters' voices, bypassing the electoral college system. The National Popular Vote movement aims to eliminate the electoral college system and ensure the candidate with the most popular votes wins the presidency. Critics argue against the proposal, citing various philosophical and political criticisms. The benefits of the electoral college system outweigh the attractiveness of the National Popular Vote (NPV) system. It is seen as a fundamental component of federalism, giving voting power to residents of more populous states, promoting a two-party system, and preventing post-election strife. Critics also argue that any policy proposal in the US needs broad acceptance by a majority of citizens from different regions. The concept of concurrent majorities in approving constitutional amendments by states within a limited time frame has historical precedence. Critics question the lack of a similar time limit for the National Popular Vote proposal, raising concerns about its potential disruptive effects on the presidential nominating campaign and state legislatures' deliberations. NPV supporters argue that the current system disenfranchises voters in non-battleground states, as candidates focus their attention and resources on a small number of key states. This leads to a concentration of campaign visits and funding in just a few states, leaving voters in the majority of states effectively ignored during presidential elections. According to arguments, campaign resources are concentrated in battleground states, leaving non-battleground states ignored during presidential elections. Critics question the justification for changing the election process based on spreading resources, arguing that campaign spending was not meant to stimulate local economies. The economic stimulus package amounts are not sufficient to make a difference in any state, except possibly New Hampshire during its primary campaign. Critics argue that changing the election process based on spreading resources is unjustified, as campaign spending was not intended to stimulate local economies. Former Governor Pete duPont believes direct election of presidents would lead to geographically narrower campaigns, favoring urban areas over rural states like Maine. The National Popular Vote plan has raised questions about its constitutionality, with concerns about it being an interstate compact that would require approval from Congress. Derek T. Muller argues that certain types of interstate compacts do not need Congress's consent, but the NPV agreement would fall under the category that does. The National Popular Vote agreement is considered an interstate compact that would need congressional approval due to its binding nature on states, time limits on withdrawal, and meeting conditions of interstate compacts. Derek T. Muller argues that the NPV concept is unconstitutional without Congress's approval, as it could enhance the political power of participating states while reducing that of non-participating states. States have the exclusive authority to appoint their electors as per the Presidential Electors Clause of the Constitution. The National Popular Vote movement argues that the Interstate Compact would render non-compacting states' appointment of electors meaningless, as the outcome of the Electoral College would be determined by compacting states. This raises concerns about the political effectiveness and the need for congressional consent due to the binding nature of the agreement. The proposed interstate compact for appointing presidential electors is considered a state power and an appropriate subject for such an agreement. Every Vote Equal argues that the Constitution allows valid interstate agreements within states' constitutional authority without requiring congressional approval. The NPV compact, focusing on the appointment of electors, falls within states' exclusive power and is deemed suitable for an interstate compact. The Supreme Court has rejected claims that such compacts are unconstitutional for favoring member states over non-members. The National Popular Vote compact has raised concerns about potential violations of the Voting Rights Act, as argued by David Gringer in the Columbia Law Review. Gringer suggests that the shift from state-based to a national popular vote could diminish the voting power of minority populations in certain states. He also points out that the compact may conflict with provisions of the act that regulate voting qualifications and practices. The National Popular Vote compact has raised concerns about potential violations of the Voting Rights Act, as argued by David Gringer in the Columbia Law Review. Gringer suggests that the shift to a national popular vote could diminish the voting power of minority populations in certain states and may conflict with voting qualifications and practices regulated by the act. The compact could face legal challenges requiring preclearance before implementation. Despite a decline in congressional interest in electoral college reform, only two relevant amendments were introduced in the 110th Congress. Between 1950 and 1979, reform measures were regularly considered, but recent proposals show a decline in amendments to reform the electoral college. The interest in reforming the electoral college through direct popular election has significantly decreased. The complexity of proposed amendments is increasing, but there is uncertainty about the reasons for the decline in support for electoral college reform. If a direct election amendment gains broad congressional support, those in favor of the current system may defend the electoral college or propose reform measures to address its issues. Recent reform proposals for electoral college reform go beyond direct election, including provisions to enhance federal government power in various election-related areas. This trend reflects frustration over local election administration inconsistencies. The 2000 and 2004 presidential elections revealed uncertainties and inconsistencies in local election administration procedures. Proposed amendments could establish national election standards, potentially imposing additional costs on state and local governments. This could lead to calls for federal funding to cover the increased expenses. The state and local governments may seek federal funding to cover increased expenses due to federal requirements, similar to the grant program in the Help American Vote Act (HAVA). Concerns arise about potential constitutional issues if the federal government gradually takes over election administration. Questions include the costs, efficiency of a national system, and implications for federalism. The need for a national election administration structure for national elections is emphasized to ensure every citizen can vote and every vote is accurately counted. Despite calls for reform after the 2000 electoral college controversy, proposed amendments did not progress in Congress. Attention shifted to election administration reform, leading to the passage of the Help America Vote Act in 2002. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was passed in 2002 to expand federal government involvement in voting systems and election technology. The electoral college system endures due to the difficulty of amending the U.S. Constitution. The electoral college system's success in selecting the \"people's choice\" in presidential elections and the challenges of amending the U.S. Constitution make it unlikely for the system to be replaced or reformed unless there is overwhelming public support for change. The potential for a successful amendment to the electoral college system is influenced by public perceptions of its functionality. The system worked well in the 2008 presidential election, translating a popular vote majority for Senator Barack Obama into an overwhelming electoral vote margin. If the results had been closer or more contested, there may have been more congressional interest in considering an amendment. The 111th Congress outlook could have been different if the election outcome was contested. American tradition views states as \"laboratories of reform\" for policy experiments. Maine and Nebraska have implemented the district system for electoral college votes, with Nebraska splitting its vote in 2008. Recent developments in electoral college reform have emerged at the state level, with initiatives like Colorado Amendment 36 and \"California Counts\" in 2006-2007. The National Popular Vote campaign has bipartisan support and has been approved by four states by the end of 2008, totaling 50 electoral votes. The ultimate course of the NPV movement remains uncertain. The 2008 electoral college victory of Senator Obama may impact the momentum of the National Popular Vote scheme. State legislative sessions in 2009 will reveal NPV's status. John F. Kennedy defended the electoral college in 1956, citing Viscount Falkland's view on conservatism. The electoral college system may remain unchanged as long as it functions well enough to avoid a national crisis. The 12th Amendment was the only major constitutional overhaul in response to the presidential election turmoil of 1800. Proposed plans for reforming the electoral college system are discussed in more detail in this Appendix. The electoral college reform plans reviewed include proposals for direct allocation of electoral votes to winning candidates based on statewide votes, with contingent election in Congress if no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes. The automatic plan for electoral votes would mandate the winner-take-all system, eliminating faithless electors and preserving the two-party system. Supporters argue it maintains the balance of power between federal and state levels. Opponents argue that minority Presidents could still be elected under this system. The reform proposal for electoral votes would allocate one vote to the winning candidate in each congressional district and two votes to the statewide winner, similar to the system used in Maine and Nebraska. Supporters argue it would better reflect popular vote results for the presidential election. The district plan for electoral votes aims to reflect popular vote results by allocating votes based on congressional districts, potentially increasing voter involvement and party vitality. Critics argue it retains indirect election of the president and could lead to minority presidents. The district plan for electoral votes aims to allocate votes based on congressional districts, potentially increasing voter involvement and party vitality. Critics argue it could lead to minority presidents and encourage gerrymandering. Nebraska split its district votes in the 2008 election, while Maine has yet to do so. This reform proposal would award electoral votes in proportion to the popular vote gained by each ticket. Some electoral reform proposals aim to allocate votes based on congressional districts or popular vote percentages. Colorado voters rejected a rounded proportional system in 2004. Critics argue these plans could lead to minority presidents and encourage gerrymandering. The proportional plan for electing the President and Vice President aims to allocate electoral votes based on popular vote percentages within states, reducing the likelihood of minority presidents. Critics argue it retains indirect election and could still result in minority Presidents and Vice Presidents. The proportional plan for electing the President and Vice President aims to allocate electoral votes based on popular vote percentages within states, reducing the likelihood of minority presidents. Critics argue that eliminating the magnifier effect of automatic and district plans could lead to more frequent electoral college deadlocks."
