    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 803 of the Penal Code is amended to state that limitations of time for prosecution are not tolled or extended, except when the same person is being prosecuted for the same conduct in a court of this state. The limitation of time does not start until the discovery of certain offenses, such as fraud, theft, embezzlement, or misconduct by a public officer. The Penal Code lists various offenses that constitute grand theft, forgery, bribery, fraud, and other violations including those related to public officials, corporations, welfare fraud, insurance fraud, and health and safety violations. Violations of various sections of the Health and Safety Code, Section 529a, and Section 368 can lead to prosecution even if the defendant is out of state at the time of the offense. Time limits for prosecution may be extended up to three years if the defendant is not within the state. A time limitation for prosecution does not start until the offense is discovered for certain offenses under specific codes, including the Water Code, Health and Safety Code, and Business and Professions Code. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of a report to a California law enforcement agency by a person alleging they were a victim of specified crimes while under 18 years of age, if certain conditions are met. The crime must involve substantial sexual conduct, and the limitation period specified in certain sections must have expired. In criminal investigations involving crimes against a child, the limitations period is tolled during litigation challenging a grand jury subpoena until the final disclosure of evidence. Independent evidence must corroborate the victim's allegation, excluding mental health professionals' opinions. (g) (1) A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of the suspect's identity being conclusively established by DNA testing for certain crimes described in Section 290, with specific conditions for offenses committed before or after January 1, 2001. For crimes where evidence seized under a warrant is unavailable to the prosecuting authority due to evidentiary privilege or attorney work product, the time limitation for filing a criminal complaint is paused from the time of seizure until the evidence is disclosed. This does not affect the definition or applicability of any evidentiary privilege or attorney work product. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of discovering a hidden recording related to certain violations. In cases where a person flees the scene of a fatal accident, a complaint can be filed within six years of the offense or one year after the suspect is identified by law enforcement. (k) If a person flees the scene of an accident, a criminal complaint can be filed within one year of the suspect being identified by law enforcement, or within six years of the offense. (l) The time limit for filing a complaint involving bribery to a public official does not start until the offense is discovered. Notwithstanding time limitations, a criminal complaint may be filed within one year after a person actively conceals an accidental death. Section 803 of the Penal Code is amended to clarify that time limits are not extended for any reason, except when prosecution is pending. A limitation of time for prosecuting certain offenses does not start until the offense is discovered. This applies to offenses involving fraud, theft, embezzlement, or misconduct by public officials. Examples include grand theft, forgery, bribery, and violations of specific sections of the law. The curr_chunk lists various violations including fraud, theft, embezzlement, and misconduct by public officials under different sections of the law. The curr_chunk specifies violations under different sections of the law, including Section 529a and subdivision (d) or (e) of Section 368. If the defendant is out of state when the offense occurs, prosecution can still be initiated within the time limits specified in Section 804, with a maximum of three years allowed for the defendant being out of state not counting towards those limitations. The limitation of time for offenses specified in various sections of the law does not start until the offense is discovered or could have reasonably been discovered. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of a report to a California law enforcement agency by a person alleging they were a victim of certain crimes while under 18 years of age, if certain conditions are met. This applies if the limitation period specified in certain sections has expired and the crime involved substantial sexual conduct. In criminal investigations involving crimes against a child, the limitations period is tolled during litigation challenging a grand jury subpoena until the final disclosure of evidence. Independent evidence must corroborate the victim's allegation, especially if the victim is 21 years or older. Mental health professionals' opinions cannot be considered as independent evidence. (g) (1) A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of suspect identification through DNA testing for certain crimes described in subdivision (c) of Section 290. Biological evidence must be analyzed for DNA type within specific timeframes depending on the offense date. For crimes where evidence seized under a warrant is unavailable to the prosecuting authority due to evidentiary privilege or attorney work product, the time limitation for filing a criminal complaint is tolled from the time of seizure until final disclosure of the evidence. This does not affect the definition or applicability of any evidentiary privilege or attorney work product. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of discovering a hidden recording related to certain violations. If a person flees the scene of a fatal accident, a complaint can be filed within the time period described in the law or one year after the person is identified as a suspect, but not later than six years after the offense. (k) If a person flees the scene of an accident, a criminal complaint can be filed within one year of being identified as a suspect, but not later than six years after the offense. (l) The time limit for filing a complaint involving bribery to a public official starts upon discovery of the offense. If a person actively conceals an accidental death in violation of Section 152, a criminal complaint can be filed within one year after being identified as a suspect. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 803 of the Penal Code, contingent on certain conditions being met."
