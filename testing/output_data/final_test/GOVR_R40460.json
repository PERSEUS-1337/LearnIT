    "content": "President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, establishing a renewable fuel standard requiring gasoline to contain fuel from renewable biomass. The law directed EPA to create a credit trading system for flexibility, with extra credit for ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks. A small amount of cellulosic ethanol was required to be blended in gasoline annually starting in 2013. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the RFS to include diesel fuel, requiring the use of 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to include diesel fuel, with mandates increasing from 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The RFS requires a percentage of motor fuel consumption to be renewable fuel, with specific requirements for advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuels and biomass-based diesel substitutes. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented rules for credit trading and generating credits from biodiesel sales to meet the RFS requirements. The EPA finalized rules in February 2010 for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuels under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). New biorefineries must achieve a 20% reduction, advanced biofuels a 50% reduction, and cellulosic biofuels a 60% reduction compared to petroleum fuels. The classification of biofuels under the RFS is based on calculating their lifecycle emissions relative to gasoline or diesel fuel, with ongoing debate on how to address factors like direct and indirect land use. The EPA finalized rules in February 2010 for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuels under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The issues surrounding direct and indirect land use in biofuels lifecycle are controversial. The classification of biofuels under the RFS is based on achieving specific reductions in lifecycle emissions compared to petroleum fuels. For example, whether sugar-based ethanol from Brazil is classified as an advanced biofuel or a conventional biofuel will determine its eligibility under the RFS. The EPA finalized rules in February 2010 for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuels under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). In the EPA's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), some fuels like sugarcane ethanol and soy-based biodiesel did not meet EISA's requirements. However, after criticism from stakeholders, EPA adjusted its methodology. The final rule concluded that all assessed biofuels met the threshold requirements, with soy-based biodiesel and sugarcane ethanol meeting the 50% reduction requirement for their category. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of renewable fuels, with specific requirements for different types of biofuels. Sugarcane ethanol and corn ethanol from new natural gas-fired refineries met reduction requirements. The RFS aims to use over 11 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2009, increasing to 36 billion gallons by 2022, with a carve-out for advanced biofuels. Cellulosic materials and biomass-based diesel substitutes are included in the advanced biofuel mandate. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of renewable fuels, with specific requirements for different types of biofuels. The advanced biofuel mandate includes cellulosic materials and biomass-based diesel substitutes, with a focus on lower lifecycle emissions compared to petroleum products. EPA must consider all significant emissions, both direct and indirect, from a variety of fuels and feedstocks to determine compliance with the RFS. The EPA developed a methodology for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions in the final rule. Estimations require detailed analysis of fuel production processes, vehicle emissions, and changes in emissions not related to fuel production. \"Well-to-tank\" and \"tank-to-wheels\" emissions are key components of the life cycle. Various steps are involved in producing and delivering fuel to end-users, including crude oil extraction and transport. The steps for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions in fuel production include extraction of crude oil, refining, transport, and delivery. For corn ethanol, steps involve corn production, processing, distillation, and delivery, each requiring energy and producing emissions. Assumptions about inputs, efficiency, yields, and co-products can lead to varying energy requirements and emissions. The role of co-products and land use change are key factors in estimating emissions from fuel production. Quantifying emissions from the end use of fuel is easier, considering the carbon content and consumption rate. Greenhouse gas emissions from land use change, both direct and indirect, are challenging to measure but crucial in assessing fuel lifecycle emissions. The carbon debt from land use change for biofuel production is a significant concern, impacting emission reduction potential. Measurement techniques rely on robust land use data and models. Stakeholders are in a quandary due to the lack of guidance on analyzing land use components. EISA requires EPA to consider greenhouse gas emissions from direct and indirect land use change. Some researchers argue that biofuel production may lead to significant greenhouse gas emissions from land use change, impacting the type and quantity of biofuels produced. Indirect land use change (ILUC) involves estimating emissions from land cleared for crop production by entities other than the feedstock producer. Biofuels from agricultural waste may not contribute to additional greenhouse gas emissions from land use change. Some argue EPA's ruling on ILUC is premature due to incomplete data and questionable scientific methodology. Biofuels supporters urge EPA to consider barriers to biofuel generation and potential impact on second-generation advanced biofuels development. Lack of monetary support or fuel credits based on poor biofuel lifecycle analysis could deter innovators from further exploration in this area. Land use change is a new subject for researchers to simulate real-world conditions using models. The certainty of simulation models for land use change compared to real-world action is subject to various human and economic considerations. Quantification of greenhouse gas emissions associated with land cover and land use change relies on reliable measurements. Techniques to quantify emissions from land use change depend on robust prediction methods. Forecasting land use change, especially due to the RFS program, may be challenging. Computer models and satellite imagery can help identify suitable land areas for conversion. However, developing land use change estimates and determining the greenhouse gas impacts of indirect land use change are complex processes. The methodology for determining greenhouse gas impacts of indirect land use change is in early stages of development. It is difficult to directly link land use changes to biofuel production in another region. Sustainable biofuel supporters should consider potential negative impacts and take precautionary measures. Addressing indirect impacts requires global research, promoting biofuels with minimal negative impacts, mitigating negative impacts without increasing costs, and implementing social safeguards at the national level. The EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on May 26, 2009, to introduce new regulations for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The NPRM included a suggested methodology for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions in biofuel production, which could impact the marketability of biofuels. Critics are concerned that including indirect land use change in this analysis could hold biofuel producers responsible for decisions made by others. The EPA proposed a methodology for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuel production to meet specific reduction thresholds. Biofuels failing to meet these thresholds would not qualify for credits under the RFS. The methodology also addressed land use change in the lifecycle analysis. In the NPRM, EPA highlighted concerns about the impact of land use change on LCA methodology for biofuel production. Various stakeholders debated the inclusion of international land use change and its potential unfair penalties on agricultural producers and biofuel entities. EPA acknowledged the evolving nature of land use change analysis but emphasized the need to comply with the law. The EPA proposed using models and imagery data to estimate GHG emissions from land use change for the LCA due to limited resources for monitoring. Models like FASOM and FAPRI, along with imagery data from MODIS satellite, will provide information on land conversion, location, and associated GHG emissions. Winrock emission factor data was suggested for estimating international emissions. In the final Rule, EPA utilized models and data sources, including the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model, to assess GHG emissions from biofuel production. The analysis showed that the largest emissions occur in the first few years after land conversion, with lower emissions in subsequent years. EPA proposed a time horizon to indicate the length of time emissions from land use change are included in the LCA, and suggested discounting emissions to value near-term emissions more accurately. In the final rule, EPA chose a 30-year time frame with a 0% discount rate to assess GHG emissions impacts of biofuels. This decision was based on the full life of a typical biofuel plant and the focus on more near-term and certain emissions impacts. EPA believes there is a lack of consensus on applying an economic valuation to physical quantities. EPA acknowledged uncertainty in applying economic valuation to GHG emissions from land use change and sought peer review on various factors like satellite data, land conversion emissions, foreign crop production emissions, timing of emissions, and model integration for lifecycle GHG analysis. EPA made changes to its lifecycle methodology based on peer review and public comments, resulting in lower emissions estimates for most fuels, mainly due to reductions in international land use change emissions. Factors such as higher crop yields, efficiency of co-products, and improved satellite data contributed to the diminished effect of land use change on emissions. The EPA made changes to its lifecycle methodology for fuels, resulting in lower emissions estimates. Factors like higher crop yields and more efficient co-products reduced the impact of land use change on emissions. Improved satellite data allowed for a more precise assessment of land conversion during international land use changes, leading to lower modeled GHG impacts. The analysis for the final rule showed that domestic corn demand and exports are not as affected by increased biofuel production as previously assumed. Additionally, pasture expansion onto existing grasslands was found to reduce GHG emissions associated with land use change. EPA will periodically reevaluate its lifecycle methodology for fuels. The EPA will periodically reevaluate its LCA methodology for fuels, with potential changes only applying to biofuel plants constructed after new rules are finalized. The National Academy of Sciences will evaluate the approach and science of lifecycle assessment, including indirect land use change, over the next two years. California finalized regulations for a low carbon fuel standard on January 12, 2009, requiring increasing reductions in lifecycle emissions of transportation fuels. The California regulations for a low carbon fuel standard require reductions in lifecycle emissions of transportation fuels. The rule aims for a 10% decrease in emissions intensity compared to gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. California's analysis shows that some biofuels may have higher emissions than EPA's proposed levels, leading to ongoing debate over lifecycle analysis methods. The 111th Congress is expected to address biofuels lifecycle issues through oversight of EPA's implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard and integration of fuel lifecycle emissions into relevant legislation. Definitions for biofuels under the RFS could impact the supply of eligible fuels in the program. Congress may assess EPA regulations' impact on fuel supply and greenhouse gas emissions. Legislation addressing climate change and energy issues could affect the renewable fuel standard. Proposals like a carbon tax or low-carbon fuel standard aim to reduce emissions from transportation fuels. The integration of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) with potential climate or energy policies should be carefully considered to avoid conflicting requirements. New legislation on fuel carbon emissions could either align with or contradict the RFS requirements, impacting the overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels."
