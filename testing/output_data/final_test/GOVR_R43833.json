    "content": "The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in King v. Burwell, a case about the implementation of the ACA and the provision of premium tax credits. The issue at hand is whether the IRS can provide these credits to residents of states with federally facilitated exchanges. This is significant as millions of individuals rely on these credits to purchase health insurance. The report provides background on ACA provisions related to health insurance exchanges. ACA mandates states to establish exchanges for the sale of health insurance. If a state does not establish an exchange, the Secretary of HHS must step in. The Secretary must establish and operate an exchange within the state if a state does not have one. The ACA provides a refundable tax credit to help lower and moderate-income taxpayers pay for health insurance premiums. Taxpayers can claim the credit at the end of the year or receive advance payments towards the premium. Eligibility for the credit depends on income and coverage months during the taxable year. The ACA provides a refundable tax credit to help lower and moderate-income taxpayers pay for health insurance premiums. To qualify for the credit, at least one month in the year must be a coverage month for the taxpayer. The premium tax credit amount is based on the monthly premiums for each coverage month during the taxable year. The premium tax credit under the ACA is calculated based on monthly premiums for qualified health plans in the individual market. There was debate over whether tax credits were available for exchanges created by the federal government. The IRS issued regulations in May 2012 allowing premium tax credits for individuals in both state and federally facilitated exchanges. Lawsuits were filed against the Administration for this decision, claiming IRS overstepped its authority. The ACA's individual mandate requires certain individuals to have minimum essential health coverage or face a tax penalty. The premium tax credit is calculated based on the annual premium for the lowest cost plan available on an exchange, minus any allowable credit. If an individual is not eligible for the credit, coverage becomes more expensive, potentially qualifying them for an exemption from the mandate. The ACA's employer mandate imposes a tax on large employers who do not offer affordable health insurance to their employees. Liability for the tax is triggered when an employer's full-time employee receives a premium tax credit through a health insurance exchange. Challengers argue that the plain language of the ACA states that receipt of a premium tax credit depends on whether a taxpayer was enrolled through an exchange. The receipt of a premium tax credit under the ACA depends on whether a taxpayer was enrolled through an exchange established by the State. Challengers argue that the federal government is not a \"state,\" so the IRS cannot extend credits to individuals in federally facilitated exchanges. They claim that interpreting the phrase to include both state and federally facilitated exchanges renders the words \"established by the state\" meaningless, violating statutory interpretation principles. Additionally, challengers argue that the federal government's authority to establish exchanges comes from a different section of the ACA. Challengers argue that Congress intended to limit premium tax credits to state-run exchanges to incentivize states to create their own exchanges. The Administration contends that the challengers' interpretation of the phrase \"an exchange established by the State\" is flawed and that the text of the ACA as a whole supports extending credits to both state and federally facilitated exchanges. The government argues that the text of the ACA supports offering premium tax credits on all exchanges, whether state-run or federally facilitated. This is based on the definition of \"exchange\" in ACA and the provision in Section 1321 that requires the establishment of an exchange if a state does not do so. The government argues that the phrase \"exchange established by the State under section 1311 of ACA\" includes federally-facilitated exchanges, and limiting premium tax credits to state-run exchanges goes against the ACA's goal of expanding access to affordable health insurance. It is claimed that without tax credits in federally facilitated exchanges, core provisions of the ACA would not function properly. The Administration argues that without tax credits in federally facilitated exchanges, key provisions of the ACA would be compromised, leading to millions being unable to afford health insurance. This would have a detrimental impact on insurance markets, defeating the purpose of establishing exchanges and credits. Multiple lawsuits were filed challenging the IRS regulations allowing premium tax credits in federally facilitated exchanges. A group of individuals and employers in states without exchanges sued HHS and Treasury, claiming IRS regulations violate the ACA by only allowing credits in state-established exchanges. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled in July 2014 that the ACA restricts tax credits to state exchanges, not federally created ones. The court rejected the government's argument that this interpretation would be illogical. The D.C. Circuit Court rejected the government's argument that limiting tax credits to state exchanges under the ACA would lead to illogical results. The court also found no evidence in the legislative history of the ACA to suggest a different interpretation. The Halbig opinion was later put on hold pending a full appeals court review, while the Fourth Circuit upheld IRS regulations in King v. Burwell, stating they were a valid exercise of agency discretion. Residents in Virginia challenged the IRS rule, claiming it contradicted the ACA's statutory language. The Fourth Circuit in Halbig found the ACA's statutory language ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations. They performed a Chevron analysis and concluded that the IRS interpretation was a reasonable exercise of agency discretion. The plaintiffs in King appealed directly to the Supreme Court, which agreed to review the case in November 2014. In 2014, the High Court agreed to review the case along with two other pending cases. In Oklahoma ex rel. Pruitt v. Burwell, a district court concluded that premium tax credits are only available in state-established exchanges. The IRS rule was ordered to be vacated but stayed pending appeal. The Supreme Court denied Oklahoma's petition to review the case. In Indiana v. IRS, the state and school districts filed suit. In Indiana v. IRS, the state and school districts challenged the validity of IRS regulations. The district court found standing for the plaintiffs and denied the Administration's motion to dismiss. Standing is crucial in the \"case or controversy\" requirement of the Constitution. The judiciary's role is limited under the separation of powers principle. Standing requires a plaintiff to show a personal injury traceable to the defendant's conduct. Taxpayers usually lack standing to challenge IRS interpretations, but in a case involving tax credits, standing was found based on the relationship with individual and employer mandates. The courts in cases like King, Halbig, Pruitt, and Indiana found that plaintiffs and states had standing to challenge IRS regulations regarding the premium tax credit and individual/employer mandates. This was based on the economic injury faced by individuals and states due to the interpretation of the statute by the IRS. The government did not raise the issue of standing before the Supreme Court in King. Media reports suggested some plaintiffs may not have standing due to potential eligibility for veterans benefits as minimum essential coverage. Justice Ginsburg inquired about standing during oral arguments, with the plaintiffs' attorney asserting at least one individual meets the requirement. Taxpayers challenging federal tax laws typically do so through a tax refund suit, as taxes must be paid before challenging. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB v. Sebelius clarified that the individual mandate is a penalty, not a tax, for the purpose of the Anti-Injunction Act. This allowed plaintiffs in the premium tax credit litigation to challenge the IRS's Section 36B regulation without going through the tax refund process. The government did not raise the AIA issue in the premium tax credit litigation based on the individual mandate for plaintiffs' standing. However, they argued that the AIA prevented lawsuits based on the employer mandate. Three courts had different outcomes on this issue. The Pruitt court found that the employer mandate was not considered a tax for AIA purposes. The Indiana court ruled the AIA did not apply due to Seventh Circuit precedent. The Halbig district court considered the employer mandate a tax under the AIA and dismissed the employers' claims. The district court considered \"assessable payment\" and \"tax\" to have the same meaning. The government argued that a tax refund suit was an adequate remedy under the Administrative Procedure Act, but the courts rejected this argument. The court rejected the government's argument that a tax refund suit was sufficient under the APA, stating that it did not offer the same prospective relief. The Chevron test, used to determine if an agency acted within its authority, involves two parts: clear congressional intent must be followed, and if ambiguous, the agency's interpretation must be permissible. The federal appellate courts applied the Chevron test to determine the availability of tax credits in states with a federal exchange. Courts defer to agency interpretations if they are permissible readings of the statute, especially when the text is ambiguous. This was evident in cases involving premium tax credits, where courts determined the statutory text to be ambiguous. The ACA restricts the section 36B subsidy to insurance purchased on exchanges 'established by the State.' The D.C. Circuit vacated the IRS regulation as the text was clear. The Fourth Circuit found the text ambiguous and upheld the IRS rule under the Chevron test. The Supreme Court emphasized deference to agency interpretations in such cases. The Supreme Court emphasized using traditional tools of statutory construction to determine congressional intent on specific issues. This includes analyzing the structure of a statute, consulting dictionaries, and considering the purpose of the legislation. The use of legislative history for statutory interpretation has been a controversial topic, especially in debates over Chevron step one. Judges can be categorized as \"intentionalist\" or \"textualist\" based on their approach to interpreting statutes. Disagreements often arise on whether a statute is ambiguous, leading to split decisions even among Supreme Court Justices. Cases like Chemical Manufacturers Association v. Natural Resources Defense Council and FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. have resulted in 5-4 splits on whether Congress has clearly addressed specific issues. This highlights the challenge of determining congressional intent at step one of the Chevron test. When interpreting statutes, judges can be categorized as \"intentionalist\" or \"textualist.\" Disagreements often arise on whether a statute is ambiguous, leading to split decisions even among Supreme Court Justices. The Court may perform a Chevron analysis to determine the permissibility of the IRS's interpretation of the statute. Ultimately, the outcome of the decision could largely depend on the Court's analysis under step one of the Chevron test. The Supreme Court's decision in King v. Burwell could clarify the application of the first step of the Chevron test in states with a federal exchange. Justices Sotomayor and Kennedy raised federalism concerns regarding the availability of premium tax credits under the ACA, suggesting a potential influence of the Tenth Amendment. The case may involve issues of indirect coercion of states in implementing federal programs. Justices Sotomayor and Kennedy raised concerns about the availability of premium tax credits under the ACA in states with federally facilitated exchanges, suggesting potential coercion for states to establish their own exchanges. This could lead to Tenth Amendment issues and a need for a fair interpretation of the ACA to avoid constitutional problems. The Supreme Court is considering whether states can be constitutionally coerced to set up state exchanges to avoid negative economic impacts. This issue raises questions about cooperative federalism and the balance of regulatory authority between states and the federal government. The Supreme Court has used \"cooperative federalism\" in various regulatory areas, including environmental law. In New York v. United States, the Court rejected a Tenth Amendment challenge to a regime involving radioactive waste disposal, stating that affected states are not compelled by Congress to regulate. The King case involves states having the opportunity to establish their own regulatory regime to avoid federal regulation. Justices Sotomayor and Kennedy's questions suggest that burdens on individuals and businesses may be important in the analysis. The ACA's purposes and structure may differ enough from the statute in New York for the Court to consider adverse economic effects on private entities under the Tenth Amendment. In the context of the ACA, Justice Alito and Justice Scalia discussed potential Tenth Amendment issues related to adverse economic effects on private entities. Justice Alito suggested that states could establish their own exchanges to mitigate harm, while Justice Scalia proposed that Congress could act to prevent serious consequences for states. Scalia proposed that Congress could act to prevent serious consequences for states arising from the Court's decision on the King case regarding the availability of premium tax credits in exchanges. The discussion by some Justices at oral argument suggests federalism may play a role in the resolution of this statutory interpretation case, particularly in determining which exchanges fall into the category of not established by a state. In 2014, there was a discrepancy over the number of federal exchanges, with the D.C. Circuit mentioning 36 and the Fourth Circuit noting 34. The Supreme Court briefs in the King case agreed on 34 federally facilitated exchanges, including 27 federally facilitated exchanges and 7 federally supported state-based exchanges. The Supreme Court may address what states need to do to establish an exchange for premium tax credits under the ACA. If the IRS regulations in King are upheld, premium tax credits would likely remain available for individuals in state and federally run exchanges. However, the IRS could amend the regulations in the future. If the Supreme Court upholds the IRS regulations in King, premium tax credits would likely continue in state and federally run exchanges. The Court's decision could allow for future amendments to the regulations, potentially affecting the provision of tax credits. If the IRS regulation is deemed invalid, adjustments may be made by the IRS and HHS to address any issues with the Section 36B regulations. The Supreme Court's decision in King could lead to adjustments by the IRS and HHS to address issues with Section 36B regulations, including possible issues with the timing of the decision for taxpayers claiming the credit for tax years 2014 and 2015. The Supreme Court's decision in King may affect advanced payments for 2015 insurance contracts. Justice Alito suggested delaying the decision until the end of the year. Taxpayers losing eligibility for the premium tax credit could still claim other tax benefits. The availability of premium tax credits in federal health insurance exchanges could impact the implementation of the ACA. The ACA relies on premium tax credits to increase accessibility to health insurance by requiring insurers to accept all applicants, cover preexisting conditions, and limit premium increases based on health status. The individual mandate compels individuals to purchase insurance to prevent adverse selection, with ACA providing subsidies to make coverage affordable. Eliminating premium tax credits would harm the ACA's goals of expanding health insurance coverage and promoting a functioning individual insurance market. Without these credits, fewer individuals would be required to have health insurance under the individual mandate. The ACA provides exemptions for individuals whose contribution to health coverage exceeds 8% of household income, calculated based on the annual premium for the lowest cost plan available on an exchange minus any allowable premium tax credit. Eliminating premium tax credits could lead to coverage becoming more expensive, potentially exempting more individuals from the individual mandate. This could skew the population towards sicker, more expensive enrollees, causing a rise in premiums. If the Supreme Court invalidates the IRS rule, federally run exchanges may be negatively impacted as healthy individuals may not purchase coverage without the credits. The absence of premium tax credits in federally facilitated exchanges may lead to a rise in premiums and affect the application of the employer mandate. If credits are not available in states with federally run exchanges, large employers may not be subject to penalties for not offering affordable coverage to employees. The question arises about what states would need to do to establish their exchange for the purpose of the credit. The ACA specifies that states must establish an exchange meeting certain requirements to receive federal tax credits. Exchanges must be government agencies or non-profit entities, provide plan information, implement certification procedures, operate a hotline, assign ratings to health plans, and inform individuals of their eligibility for public programs. The ACA requires states to establish exchanges meeting specific criteria to receive federal tax credits. Exchanges must provide plan information, operate hotlines, assign ratings to health plans, and inform individuals of their eligibility for public programs like Medicaid. If a state fails to meet approval requirements for its exchange, HHS will step in to establish and operate it. Questions have arisen about what constitutes \"an exchange established by the state under 1311\" versus federal assistance in setting up an exchange within the state. The Supreme Court may address the criteria for states to establish exchanges to qualify for premium credits. Taxpayers can claim the credit when filing taxes or receive an estimated credit in advance. It is uncertain if taxpayers who claimed the credit would have to repay it if the regulation is struck down. Taxpayers who improperly claim tax credits must pay them back, including any excess of the estimated premium tax credit. The IRS can reclaim erroneously paid refunds from the previous three tax years, even if the agency was at fault. Courts have recognized that the IRS can make mistakes, but taxpayers are still responsible for complying with the law. If a regulation is struck down, taxpayers who relied on it may have to repay claimed credits, which could be seen as unfair. It may be unfair to require taxpayers to repay claimed credits if they were not involved in the litigation that led to the denial. Courts have not always been sympathetic to taxpayers who relied on incorrect IRS information, but there could be mitigating actions taken by the Court, Congress, or IRS to prevent repayment. For instance, if a regulation is overturned, it could be limited so that taxpayers who already received the credit would not be affected. The IRS may also have the authority to waive repayment for those who already claimed the credit. It is possible that Congress could address the issue by legislation, and there is no known example of taxpayers being required to pay back a credit. The situation presented in the case is uncommon, as the plaintiffs are challenging an IRS regulation that benefits them. Typically, taxpayers would not sue over a broadened statute that benefits them, and they would not have standing to do so. The plaintiffs' concerns and standing are based on the interaction between the premium tax credit and the individual mandate. The atypical facts present in King may not have broad implications for tax law generally. The cases might provide procedural issues of interest to Congress, such as the applicability of the AIA and the relationship between the APA and tax refund suits. The courts rejected the government's argument that taxpayers must use a tax refund suit. Congress may need to clarify statutes based on these decisions. The AIA generally prohibits suits restraining tax collection. Congress labeled the individual mandate as a penalty, not a tax. Congress may need to review these cases to ensure consistency with AIA's intent and potential impact on other excise taxes. The issue of whether a tax refund suit is an \"adequate remedy\" under the APA does not frequently arise, and it might be of interest to Congress to look at how the courts in these cases interpreted the interaction between the two acts."
