    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the impact of education on poverty levels, school participation, graduation rates, after school programs, access to books, and truancy causes. Participation in a summer youth job program increases high school graduation rates for low-income children. The Legislature aims to support school participation and high school attainment among low-income youth through legislation amendments in the Education Code. Section 8482.6 of the Education Code is amended to allow all pupils to participate in a program without family fees based on need or income. Fees cannot be charged to homeless youth or families receiving CalWORKs assistance. Section 8483 is also amended. Section 8483 of the Education Code is amended to require after school programs to operate a minimum of 15 hours per week, ending at 6 p.m. on regular schooldays. Programs must have a policy for early release of students, with exceptions allowed for unique community needs. Elementary school pupils must participate in the full day program daily, while middle school or junior high school students should attend a minimum of nine hours a week for three days. After school programs can have a flexible attendance schedule for middle school students. Administrators can choose to operate during summer, intersession, or vacation periods for at least three hours per day. Enrollment priority is given to pupils in after school programs. Enrollment priority for after school programs is given to homeless youth, CalWORKs assistance unit members, and middle/junior high school pupils who attend daily. Before school programs must operate for at least one and a half hours per regular schoolday and establish a policy for late pupil arrivals. Elementary school pupils are expected to participate in the full day program daily, while middle school or junior high school students should attend a minimum of six hours a week or three days a week. Pupils who attend less than half of the daily program hours will not be counted for attendance purposes. Flexible attendance schedules may be implemented for middle school or junior high school students in before school programs. Before school programs can operate during summer, intersession, or vacation periods for a minimum of two hours per day. They must offer a breakfast meal to all participants. Enrollment priority is given to homeless youth, CalWORKs assistance unit members, and daily attending middle and junior high school pupils. Section 39800.1 of the Education Code states that pupils eligible for free or reduced-price meals or attending a school in the Community Eligibility Option are entitled to free transportation to and from school if they live more than half a mile away or if the route to school is unsafe. A designated liaison at the local educational agency is responsible for ensuring timely transportation for eligible pupils. The designated liaison at the local educational agency is trained to accommodate homeless youth and pupils in a CalWORKs assistance unit. The plan development involves consultation with various stakeholders, including teachers, parents, and local transit authorities. It addresses the ability of pupils to visit the public library regularly. If free transportation is not available, the agency must provide it using existing funds. The department, in coordination with the State Department of Education, will track high school completion rates of children in an assistance unit and report to the Legislature by July 1, 2016. An aggregate report of these rates will be made publicly available. To incentivize high school completion for aid recipients 19 years and under, a $200 supplement will be given upon verification of diploma or equivalent. The supplement is not counted as income for assistance unit or CalFresh household. Cal-Learn participants eligible for a similar incentive are excluded. To support educational outcomes and physical fitness of children in an assistance unit, a transportation service supplement is provided in advance for participation in an After School Education and Safety Program. The department coordinates with county agencies and the State Department of Health Care Services to inform assistance units about the importance of regular vision exams for children receiving Medi-Cal benefits. The department, in consultation with various agencies, shall design a youth subsidized employment program for eligible youth aged 15 to 19, providing paid employment, skills training, and other services. \"Needy youth\" are defined as individuals aged 18 to 24 with family income below 200% of the federal poverty level. The program requires employers and caseworkers to be trained in trauma-informed care and restorative justice practices. Income earned through the program will not affect eligibility for aid. The State Department of Social Services can implement the program through all-county letters until January 1, 2018, after which regulations must be adopted. No appropriation under Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code shall be used for this program. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
