The Act titled the \"Darfur Genocide Accountability Act of 2005\" defines key terms such as \"appropriate congressional committees,\" \"Government of Sudan,\" and \"member states.\" The term \"Government of Sudan\" refers to the National Congress Party-led government in Khartoum or the successor Government of National Unity formed under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Measures against the Government of Sudan do not apply to the Government of South Sudan or areas formerly controlled by opposition groups. The term \"member states\" refers to the member states of the United Nations. The term \"Sudan North-South Peace Agreement\" pertains to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army on January 9, 2005. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan, were declared genocide by the House of Representatives and the Senate in 2004. Secretary of State Colin Powell confirmed the genocide in Darfur before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1556 calling for action against the Janjaweed militias in Sudan. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 passed on September 18, 2004, demanded the arrest of Janjaweed leaders for human rights violations in Darfur and threatened sanctions if Sudan did not comply with previous resolutions. The International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur submitted a report detailing atrocities committed by the Government of Sudan and its Janjaweed militia allies, stating that they are responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Officials and other individuals have been accused of committing genocidal acts, and a document with 51 suspects has been submitted for prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The sense of Congress is stated in Section 4. The sense of Congress is that atrocities in Darfur are genocide, the peace agreement must be fully implemented, the African Union mission should focus on protecting civilians, and the UN or NATO should deploy troops to Darfur. The US condemns attacks on humanitarian workers. The President should appoint a Special Envoy to seek peace in Sudan, support peace agreements, bring stability to Darfur, address Sudan's instability, and the crisis in Northern Uganda. The US should support accountability through the UN Security Council. The United Nations Security Council should take action to prosecute individuals responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The US President should demand the extension of the military embargo on Sudan and freezing of assets of government officials and Janjaweed leaders. The United Nations Security Council should prosecute individuals responsible for atrocities in Darfur by reducing staff at Sudanese diplomatic missions, restricting movement of government officials, and discouraging their entry into other countries. To discourage international and regional organizations from holding conferences in Sudan, steps should be taken. SEC. 5. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS. Beginning 30 days after the enactment of this Act, the President will block assets of Sudanese officials, military personnel, individuals involved in atrocities in Darfur, and businesses controlled by them. Visa restrictions will be imposed on Sudanese officials implicated in the Darfur atrocities. The Act imposes asset blocking and visa restrictions on Sudanese officials, military personnel, and individuals involved in atrocities in Darfur. It also includes measures to reduce staff at the Sudanese diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C., restrict their movement in the U.S., oppose conferences in Sudan, and requires reporting within 30 days. The President must report to congressional committees within 30 days after freezing assets or denying visas to individuals involved in atrocities in Darfur and Sudan. Authorization to use force to stop genocide in Darfur, Sudan. The President is authorized to use all necessary means, including the armed forces, to stop genocide in Darfur, Sudan, in accordance with international conventions and resolutions. Additionally, the President is encouraged to consider using unmanned armed planes and military assets to neutralize perpetrators of violence targeting civilians. The President is authorized to enforce a no-fly zone over Darfur using American military assets and NATO forces, intercept communications, and deny port entry to cargo ships engaged in business with Sudan. SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON TRADING IN UNITED STATES CAPITAL MARKETS. The President can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to prohibit entities in Sudan from raising capital or trading securities in the US. Penalties for violations will apply, but the President can waive sanctions if it's in the national interest. The President can waive sanctions on Sudan if it is in the national interest of the United States. Before doing so, a report must be submitted to congressional committees describing the waiver and reasons for it. SEC. 8. REPORTS TO CONGRESS. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit an annual report to Congress detailing entities engaged in commercial activity in Sudan, the nature and extent of that activity, agencies of the Sudanese Government involved, and any connection to violations of religious freedom and human rights. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish each report submitted under subsection (a) to the public. A conforming amendment to the Sudan Peace Act requires the best estimates of aerial bombardment and militia activity against civilian centers in Sudan to be disclosed."
