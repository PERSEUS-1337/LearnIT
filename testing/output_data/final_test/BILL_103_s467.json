    "content": "The \"Natural Disaster Tax Relief Act of 1993\" allows distributions from certain plans to be used without penalty to replace homes. The \"Natural Disaster Tax Relief Act of 1993\" permits penalty-free distributions from specific plans for qualified acquisition costs related to a principal residence within 60 days. Eligible individuals can use distributions from individual retirement plans or employer contributions for this purpose. Qualified individuals eligible for penalty-free distributions under the \"Natural Disaster Tax Relief Act of 1993\" are those whose principal residence was destroyed or substantially damaged by specific hurricanes or typhoons. Qualified acquisition costs include expenses for acquiring, constructing, or reconstructing a residence, along with settlement, financing, or closing costs. Qualified individuals affected by specific hurricanes or typhoons can make penalty-free distributions for qualified acquisition costs. These costs must be paid within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, and distributions after July 31, 1992, are subject to this section. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RULE FOR INCLUSION OF CROP PROCEEDS OF CERTAIN DISASTER VICTIMS. Taxpayers with income from selling crops in a designated disaster area can defer including that income for a year. The area must be designated for federal assistance due to specific disasters. This option is available only to farmers as their main business. For taxable years ending after December 31, 1991, self-employed taxpayers may increase their contribution base if they include amounts in gross income that would have been included in the previous year. The increase is based on the lesser of the previous year's contribution base minus self-employment income or the amounts included in gross income for the current year. SEC. 4. Modification of involuntary conversion rules for certain disaster-related conversions. Section 1033 is amended to include special rules for principal residences damaged by Presidential declared disasters. No gain shall be recognized for unscheduled personal property insurance proceeds received for contents of the residence involuntarily converted due to a disaster. Insurance proceeds for a residence or its contents are treated as received for the conversion of a single property item. Similar or related properties to the converted residence or contents are also treated as such for tax purposes. The text discusses the extension of the replacement period for property converted due to a Presidentially declared disaster. The term 'Presidentially declared disaster' is defined, and the term 'principal residence' is clarified. The amendment applies to property converted due to disasters with a determination made on or after September 1, 1991, and for taxable years ending on or after that date. SEC. 5. APPLICATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDITS AND MORTGAGE REVENUE BONDS TO NATURAL DISASTER AREAS. In natural disaster areas, low-income housing credits may have completion requirements waived and income verification requirements relaxed for occupants in qualified buildings. In disaster areas, the Secretary can waive income verification requirements for occupants in qualified buildings until information is obtainable. If an occupant's income exceeds the limit, the unit can still be considered low-income if no new resident with higher income moves in. In disaster areas, the Secretary may waive tenant income limitations and the 6-month residence requirement for occupants in qualified low-income housing projects. The Secretary may waive certain requirements for low-income housing projects in disaster areas, including the 10-year rule for existing buildings, national pool allocation formula modifications, and an effective date of July 1, 1992. The subsection effective date is July 1, 1992. The $15,000 limitation for home improvement loans in qualified disaster areas is waived for loans made between June 30, 1992, and January 1, 1994. A qualified disaster area is designated by the President for assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act due to specific disasters."
