    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination in tests and examinations for individuals with disabilities, requiring accommodations to be provided. However, individuals must meet the ADA's definition of \"disability\" to qualify for accommodations. The ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA) was enacted in 2008 to broaden the definition of disability under the ADA, shifting the focus in cases to defendant compliance with the ADA. This change is expected to increase testing accommodations for individuals with various health impairments. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability under the ADA, leading to increased testing accommodations for individuals with health impairments. Section 309 of the ADA sets standards for testing accommodations, requiring exams to be accessible to persons with disabilities or provide alternative arrangements. The DOJ regulations mandate that private testing entities must offer accommodations that ensure accurate assessment of individuals' abilities. Federal courts have upheld this interpretation in recent decisions. The recent federal court cases have determined who is entitled to testing accommodations under the ADA and whether a specific accommodation is ADA-compliant. The report highlights the impact of the ADAAA on the analysis and outcome of cases, as well as raises questions about the liability of entities requiring discriminatory tests for disabled examinees. The ADA does not mandate accommodations that would cause undue hardship, and the report does not cover the \"undue burden\" defense or testing accommodations under the IDEA. The ADA defines \"disability\" as a \"physical or mental impairment\" that \"substantially limits\" one or more \"major life activities.\" Courts previously had strict interpretations, making it difficult for people with disabilities to prove discrimination under the ADA. This was especially challenging for individuals with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders in cases involving tests and examinations. Courts dismissed ADA claims for failure to prove impairments substantially limited major life activities. Academic achievement and coping methods were used as evidence against substantial limitation. Examples include Gonzales v. National Board of Medical Examiners where a medical student's learning disabilities did not limit major life activities, and Price v. National Board of Medical Examiners where testing accommodations were denied due to good grades despite disabilities. In a case against the National Board of Medical Examiners, the court ruled that medical students with learning disabilities were not considered disabled under the ADA due to their history of academic achievement. Another case, Gonzalez v. Supreme Court of Texas, also highlighted the difficulty in proving that ADHD substantially limited major life activities. In Bartlett v. New York State Board of Bar Examiners, a law student with dyslexia was protected under the ADA for seeking testing accommodations on the Bar Examination. The court found that her dyslexia substantially limited her in reading, despite her academic achievements. This case addressed concerns about narrow interpretations of \"disability\" hindering necessary accommodations under the ADA. The ADAAA was enacted in 2008 to broaden the definition of \"disability\" under the ADA, ensuring more inclusive protection. It preserved the ADA's three-part definition but redefined \"major life activities\" and \"substantially limits.\" Courts now consider impairments without mitigating measures to determine disability status. The ADAAA broadened the definition of \"disability\" under the ADA, emphasizing inclusive protection. It redefined \"major life activities\" and \"substantially limits\" without considering mitigating measures. Representative Pete Stark highlighted that individuals with specific learning disabilities, like dyslexia, are covered by the ADA. Representative George Miller supported this, emphasizing the importance of not considering the use of mitigating measures in determining disability. The ADAAA, effective from January 1, 2009, expanded the ADA's protection for individuals with disabilities. Few federal cases have interpreted the ADAAA's amendments, but one court ruled that it can apply retroactively for injunctive relief claims. In Jenkins v. National Board of Medical Examiners, the Sixth Circuit found that seeking accommodations for future exams constituted prospective relief, allowing retroactive application of the ADAAA. The Sixth Circuit remanded a case to determine if a medical student with a reading disorder qualified as a person with a disability under the ADA as amended by the ADAAA. The ADAAA is expected to shift the focus in ADA cases from plaintiff entitlement to defendant compliance, potentially delaying case resolution. People with various disabilities may be more likely to qualify for testing accommodations under the ADAAA, although few federal courts have addressed this issue. The ADAAA may have increased the role of district courts in determining necessary testing accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as required by Section 309 of the ADA. This section mandates that examinations be accessible to people with disabilities, including offering alternative arrangements if needed. The Department of Justice regulations implement Section 309 of the ADA, requiring private entities offering examinations to ensure that exams accurately reflect the individual's aptitude or achievement level, not their impaired skills. This is to provide equal educational and professional opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The DOJ regulations require private entities administering exams to make necessary modifications to ensure that the test accurately measures skills and knowledge, including providing auxiliary aids for individuals with disabilities such as taped exams, interpreters, Brailled or large print materials, and qualified readers. Private testing entities must request documentation for test-takers' disabilities in a reasonable and limited manner. Consideration should be given to accommodations provided under an IEP or Section 504 Plan. Accommodations must be provided in a timely manner to ensure equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities. In 2011, a petition was filed with the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of National Conference of Bar Examiners v. Enyart, seeking review of a Ninth Circuit decision upholding an injunction for accommodations for a legally blind law student. The National Conference of Bar Examiners refused to permit technology accommodations, offering alternatives like a human reader or Braille test instead. The National Conference of Bar Examiners offered accommodations like a Braille test and CCTV with large font for a legally blind law student. However, the student argued that the proposed accommodations would not be effective due to her progressive blindness and the rigorous nature of the bar exam. The NCBE appealed, arguing that the DOJ regulation implementing the ADA was invalid. The Ninth Circuit found that the DOJ's interpretation of Section 309 of the ADA, which required \"accessible\" accommodations, was valid and entitled to judicial deference. This interpretation imposed a higher burden on test administrators compared to a \"reasonable\" accommodations standard. The court affirmed that the accommodations offered by NCBE were insufficient for the legally blind law student. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that NCBE's accommodations for the legally blind law student were insufficient, emphasizing the need for individualized testing accommodations that ensure results are based on aptitude rather than disability. The court highlighted the importance of advancing assistive technology to keep pace with evolving testing needs. Technology advances, testing accommodations should advance as well. Federal district courts have followed the Ninth Circuit's approach in cases like Jones v. National Conference of Bar Examiners and Bonnette v. D.C. Court of Appeals, emphasizing the need for individualized testing accommodations rather than relying on outdated benchmarks or blanket approvals. The plaintiff in Binno v. American Bar Association alleges that the ABA conditions law school accreditation on adherence to a policy that may discriminate against students with disabilities by requiring completion of the LSAT. This could lead to remedial action, sanctions, or probation for schools that waive LSAT requirements for disabled students. The plaintiff in Binno v. American Bar Association alleges that the ABA's policy on LSAT completion may discriminate against students with disabilities, risking remedial action, sanctions, or probation for law schools. The case could clarify the applicability of Section 309 and the legal accessibility of tests for individuals with disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the definition of disabilities for testing accommodations under Section 309 of the ADA. This change is expected to increase the likelihood of students with learning disabilities receiving accommodations. Federal district courts will now have a more significant role in evaluating the adequacy of testing accommodations under the ADA. Recent court cases suggest accommodations should ensure accurate assessment of an individual's aptitude. The analysis considers factors like helping individuals overcome disability limitations, utility for specific exams, and current technology. A pending court case questions the role of entities in offering exams under the ADA. The case may also address the accessibility of exams for individuals with disabilities despite accommodations."
