The Congress finds that electronic data exchanges are crucial for federal agencies and small manufacturers, and must be made Year 2000 compliant to avoid malfunctions and inaccuracies in computer systems. Coordination with exchange partners is essential for effective testing and implementation of new data exchanges. Small manufacturers play a significant role in the country's manufacturing sector, but many have not addressed Year 2000 compliance. It is crucial for their computer systems to be updated to prevent disruptions. Global cooperation is necessary to prevent economic disruptions in the United States due to the Year 2000 computer problem. Consumer awareness of the Year 2000 computer problem is low, leading to a lack of guidance for purchasing compliant goods. The text chunk discusses definitions related to the Year 2000 computer problem. The text chunk defines \"end-to-end testing\" as testing data exchange software, \"small and medium-sized businesses\" as those with less than 500 employees, and \"Year 2000 compliant\" as accurately processing date and time data for the transition between the 20th and 21st centuries. The term \"Year 2000 computer problem\" refers to potential issues in computer hardware and software related to correctly interpreting date data represented in 2-digit-year format. SEC. 4. FEDERAL AGENCY ACTIONS. To ensure uninterrupted computer operations by Federal agencies after December 31, 1999, each agency head must ensure Year 2000 compliance of all systems and hardware, establish testing schedules, and notify data exchange partners. The agency must notify data exchange partners about the implications of not making timely date conversion corrections for Year 2000 compliance. They should prioritize installing filters to prevent system corruption and develop contingency plans for potential data exchange failures. The agency must convene quarterly meetings with data exchange partners to assess implementation progress and report to Congress on key data exchange corrections, including inventory, formats, schedules, and completion status. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, will develop a Year 2000 compliance outreach program to assist small and medium-sized businesses. This program will include a self-assessment checklist, an explanation of the Year 2000 computer problem, a list of Federal Government resources, and a list of Year 2000 compliant products. Within 6 months of this Act's enactment, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology, with other Federal agencies, must submit a report to Congress on the international implications of the Year 2000 computer problem. The report will assess Year 2000 compliance of major trading partners, efforts to share best practices, economic impacts on world trade and the US economy, and Federal agencies' participation in international forums addressing the issue. The Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology will develop a Year 2000 consumer awareness program to help the public understand the implications of the Year 2000 computer problem. The program will include a self-assessment checklist, a list of government resources, information on compliant products, and public awareness announcements on the impact of the issue on consumer products and services. The Year 2000 computer problem could impact Federal Government services to the public, progress is being made by Federal agencies to resolve the issue."
