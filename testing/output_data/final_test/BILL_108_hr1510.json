TITLE II--REMOVING OTHER BARRIERS TO VOTING. SEC. 201. ELECTION DAY TREATED LIKE VETERANS DAY FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT. It is the sense of Congress that many Americans do not vote on Election Day due to work conflicts. Governments should work together to increase voter turnout by making Election Day a legal public holiday with full paid leave for State employees. Treating Election Day like Veterans Day for Federal employment purposes will boost voter turnout and improve access to polling places. For Federal employment purposes, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November of even-numbered years will be treated like November 11. SEC. 202. VOTING LEAVE. Employees are allowed up to 2 hours of leave (or up to 3 hours if the polling place is over 25 miles away) to vote in federal elections. The leave can be unpaid or paid, and employees must make an effort to schedule it without disrupting work operations. Taking this leave will not result in the loss of any employment benefits. Employees are entitled to leave to vote in federal elections without losing any employment benefits. Employers are prohibited from interfering with or discriminating against employees who take this leave. Employees are entitled to leave for voting in federal elections without losing benefits. The Secretary of Labor has investigative authority and enforcement powers similar to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 for employers under this subsection. In this section, the term \"employer\" is defined as any person engaged in commerce or industry with 25 or more employees, including successors in interest. Implementation and enforcement must comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Effective date applies to this section. Effective Date: This section applies to elections after January 2004. Congress encourages states and jurisdictions to distribute sample ballots and voter education materials to registered voters before elections to prevent errors and reduce spoiled ballots."
