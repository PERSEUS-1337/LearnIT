    "content": "Tajikistan, a country in Central Asia, gained independence in 1991 after the break-up of the Soviet Union. It faced a civil conflict in 1992, with nationalist, Islamic, and democratic groups trying to take over. Regional elites, supported by Uzbekistan and Russia, launched a successful counteroffensive resulting in casualties and refugees. In 1993, the Commonwealth of Independent States authorized \"peacekeeping\" in Tajikistan. After a civil conflict in Tajikistan in 1992, a peace agreement was signed in 1997 between President Emomali Rahmon and rebel leader Sayed Abdullo Nuri. The U.N. Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) was established in 1994 but pulled out in 2000. Russian troops have remained in the country, and despite economic setbacks, GDP expanded in the late 2000s. Poverty is still widespread, and infrastructure development is needed. Tajikistan faces developmental needs in transportation, energy, and political integration. President Emomali Rahmon has increased authoritarian rule since the civil war ended in 1997, marginalizing the opposition and increasing territorial control. Legislative changes have been made, including the establishment of the Assembly of Representatives and the National Assembly. Tajikistan has an upper legislative chamber, the National Assembly, with 34 members representing regional interests. A referendum in 2003 allowed President Rahmon to claim two more terms in office. There are eight registered parties, with the ruling People's Democratic Party led by Rahmon. Opposition parties include the Islamic Renaissance Party, Social Democratic Party, and Communist Party. In May 2012, the Justice Ministry rejected the registration of the reformist National Movement of Tajikistan as a new political party. Businessman Zaid Saidov planned to form the New Tajikistan Party in April 2013 but was arrested on corruption charges in May 2013. Opposition groups formed the Coalition for Democracy and Civil Society to advocate for political reforms and for Saidov's release. Many human rights observers believe the charges against Saidov are politically motivated. Following a problematic 2005 legislative election, proposed changes to electoral laws included placing opposition representatives on electoral commissions, banning officials from serving on commissions, and reducing election deposit requirements. These reforms were introduced but blocked by the legislature. In Tajikistan, electoral reforms were blocked by the ruling People's Democratic Party, making it difficult for opposition parties to campaign. The 2006 presidential election saw incumbent President Rahmon win with 79.3% of the vote, amid criticism of lack of genuine choice and meaningful pluralism. The 2010 Assembly of Representatives elections were dominated by the People's Democratic Party. The 2010 Assembly of Representatives elections in Tajikistan saw the People's Democratic Party dominate, with a turnout of 3.29 million (90.3%). The party won 54 seats, while other parties and an independent candidate secured the remaining seats. An OSCE monitoring mission criticized the election for not meeting key commitments. The 2010 Assembly of Representatives elections in Tajikistan were criticized by OSCE monitors for serious irregularities, including proxy voting, voting without identification documents, multiple voting, and ballot-box stuffing. These irregularities undermined the integrity of the elections. Observers from the U.S. Embassy and OSCE monitors criticized the 2010 Assembly of Representatives elections in Tajikistan for irregularities such as pre-marked ballots and vote-counting issues. President Rahmon's use of Hanafi Sunni Islam and Tajik nationalism rhetoric has alienated ethnic and religious minorities. The Islamic Renaissance Party's deputies have proposed amending election laws, but the legislature has rejected these changes. A presidential election is scheduled for November 6, 2013 in Tajikistan. Only registered parties, two unions, and local legislative councils can nominate candidates, with no self-nominations allowed. The OSCE plans to observe the election, and candidate nominations will take place between September 17 and October 7, 2013. The Central Electoral Commission ruled that those working outside the country are ineligible to sign candidate petitions. The Union of Reformist Forces of Tajikistan opposition group agreed to support civil rights activist Oynihol Bobonazarova in the presidential race. The People's Democratic Party of Tajikistan is expected to nominate President Rahmon for reelection in the upcoming presidential race. In 2010, several individuals sentenced as terrorists escaped from prison in Dushanbe and carried out attacks in different regions of the country. An obscure terrorist group, Jamaat Ansarullah, claimed responsibility for deaths and injuries among police in Khujand. Escapees and their allies, including IMU terrorists, attacked a military convoy in the Rasht Valley, resulting in government forces casualties. The government alleged Abdullo Rakhimov, a former Tajik opposition leader with links to al Qaeda and the Taliban, was among the attackers. This incident raised concerns about Tajikistan's stability, but the government claimed to have stabilized the situation in the valley by early 2011. In early 2011, the Tajik government claimed to have stabilized the situation in the valley. They reported killing former opposition fighters and members of the IMU involved in terrorist activities. Some defendants alleged torture to confess to false charges. Observers suggest that government exclusivity and failure to share power and economic benefits may be underlying causes of the violence. The Tajik government cracked down on the Islamic Renaissance Party in 2010, suspecting it harbored extremists. They banned Friday prayers at the party's headquarters, raided the compound, and faced a mysterious fire. The government also targeted Islamic religious institutions, bearded men, hijab-wearing shopkeepers, and unregistered mosques. In early 2012, President Rahmon allegedly directed security services to target former UTO fighters and opponents, including the Islamic Renaissance Party. In 2013, he ordered security services to prevent Tajiks from studying at Islamic schools abroad and denied visas to foreign guests invited by the party. A party official was sentenced to 14 years in prison for alleged involvement in organizing violence. In July 2012, General Abdullo Nazarov was killed near Khorog, Tajikistan. The government launched security operations against a local \"criminal group\" led by Tolib Ayembekov, a former UTO fighter. The group was accused of having ties to organized crime and the IMU. Ayembekov denied involvement in Nazarov's death. The government launched security operations in Khorog, Tajikistan in July 2012, resulting in casualties among security personnel and alleged \"criminals.\" Despite the government acknowledging only one civilian casualty, observers reported civilian deaths and injuries. Border guards sealed the Tajik-Afghan border to prevent the \"criminals\" from escaping. Internet and cell phone connections were cut off, but information about the fighting leaked out. The U.S. Embassy raised concerns about the situation. The U.S. Embassy raised concerns about civilian casualties and media suppression in Khorog, Tajikistan in July 2012. Ayembekov pledged loyalty to the government, but a ceasefire was broken when security forces killed Imomnazar Imomnazarov, leading to protests and a memorial service. A ceasefire agreement was later reached between the government and local officials. Some observers questioned the Tajik government's explanations of events in Khorog, suggesting General Nazarov's involvement in seizing control of smuggling operations. The government deployed security forces after Ayembekov threatened to enlist terrorists from Afghanistan. Residents of Khorog took up arms in opposition, despite the town hosting a Border Guard Training Center. The International Organization for Migration has conducted training for Tajik and Afghan border guards with State Department funding. Assistant Secretary Blake mentioned US support for Tajik efforts to combat corruption among border guards. Government actions in Mountainous Badakhshan may be linked to securing loyalty before the 2013 presidential elections. During security force deployment, the head of the regional Islamic Renaissance Party was detained and found dead, leading to speculation about evolving situations. Tajik authorities reported launching criminal cases against 72 suspected IMU members in Sughd Region in 2012. Interior Minister Rahimov stated that 27 members of various extremist groups were detained in the first half of 2013, with some belonging to Jamaat Ansarullah and Jundallah. Two Tajiks were sentenced for being Jundallah members, one having received terrorist training in Pakistan. In September 2013, Tajik authorities apprehended 10 terrorists in Dushanbe, including two Tajiks, other Central Asians, and two Turkish citizens linked to the IMU. The group had received training in an al Qaeda camp in Pakistan and confessed to planning a bombing campaign before the presidential election. Human Rights Watch criticized Tajikistan's poor human rights record in 2012. The human rights situation in Tajikistan in 2012 was poor, with the government enforcing repressive laws on religion and restricting media freedom. Human rights concerns included domestic violence, torture, and abuse by security forces. The State Department's report highlighted torture, restrictions on freedom of expression, and trafficking in persons as significant issues. The Ombudsman's Office for Human Rights rarely intervened in complaints about violations. In Tajikistan in 2012, human rights violations were prevalent with little response from authorities. The government amended the Criminal Code to address torture but security officials still used coercion. Arbitrary detention and corruption were common, with criminal gangs having ties to officials. Investigations were hindered, and trials lacked transparency and jury system. In 2012, trials in Tajikistan lacked transparency, with some held behind closed doors. Opposition parties claimed selective prosecution of political opponents and presence of political prisoners. The government restricted freedom of speech through detentions and heavy fines, controlling broadcasting facilities and printing presses. Despite these constraints, some independent media outlets criticized the government. International media operated freely, and in July 2013, libel and defamation were decriminalized. In Tajikistan, media faced restrictions with libel and defamation downgraded to civil offenses in 2013. Insulting the president remained punishable by fine or jail time. Independent news and social media sites were blocked, leading to fear of government reprisal and pressure on human rights NGOs. The closure of a human rights organization in Tajikistan was deemed politically motivated. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported ongoing violations of freedom of religion in the country. Recommendations were made for the U.S. government to engage with Tajikistan on religious freedom issues. Tajikistan was not designated as a Country of Particular Concern by the State Department in 2012 or 2013. The State Department did not designate Tajikistan as a CPC in 2012 or 2013. The government's respect for religious freedom declined in 2012, with restrictive laws controlling all religious activities, including age and gender restrictions. All religious groups must register with the government to operate legally, with unregistered groups facing closure. Religious literature must be approved, and unapproved texts are seized. In 2012, Tajikistan tightened control over religious activities, including surveillance at mosques, seizing unapproved texts, and expanding punishments for unauthorized religious activities. Authorities in Khatlon region seized over 100 mosques for lacking permits, aiming to convert them into public facilities. In 2010, Tajikistan was returned to \"Tier 2\" status in combating human trafficking, making significant efforts to comply with minimum standards. The government continued to make progress in implementing a 2011-2013 action plan to combat trafficking, but lacked procedures to identify victims among vulnerable populations. The State Department reported no convictions of trafficking offenders in Tajikistan in 2012 under Article 130 of the criminal code. Fines were imposed on farms and schools for forced child labor, but no government employees were prosecuted. NGOs and the International Organization for Migration were allowed to monitor the annual cotton harvest. Tajikistan was urged to vigorously investigate and prosecute suspected traffickers, provide victim identification training, and support shelters for trafficking victims. Tajikistan, the poorest country in Central Asia, faces economic challenges such as obsolescent infrastructure, corruption, and power shortages. The country's post-Soviet economic decline reversed in 1997 after the civil war ended. The government's National Development Strategy aims to improve transport, communications, energy, and food security. The global economic downturn in 2008-2009 affected Tajik commodity exports and worker remittances from Russia and Kazakhstan. The Tajik economy faced challenges due to reduced worker remittances from Russia and Kazakhstan, impacting the value of the somoni currency and increasing import costs. However, by 2010, the economy began to improve with growth in GDP and worker remittances. In 2012, GDP grew by 8% driven by increased agricultural production, construction, and remittances from Tajik migrant workers. Trade partners like Russia, China, and Turkey, along with drug trafficking, may impact Tajikistan's GDP growth. U.S.-Tajik trade is minimal, with the U.S. providing support for Tajikistan's WTO membership. Concerns have been raised by the IMF regarding Tajikistan's low international reserves and high external debt. Tajikistan faces challenges with low international reserves, high external debt, weak banking system, and unprofitable state-owned enterprises, hindering investment and job creation. The IMF recommends reforms in property rights, agricultural infrastructure, energy audits, business costs reduction, bank regulation, tax administration, and securities market development. Recent government actions have raised concerns about the investment climate. Tajikistan heavily relies on foreign loans and aid. Tajikistan heavily relies on foreign loans and aid to cover budget and trade deficits. The country's foreign debt was $3.4 billion in 2012, with a significant portion owed to China's Exim Bank. Privatization of small enterprises occurred by 2000, but land and major enterprises remain state-owned. The aluminum smelter in Tursunzade is a major export contributor, along with cotton. Tajikistan's main trade partners include Turkey, China, Iran, and Afghanistan. The agricultural sector employs half of the labor force, despite only 7% of the land being arable. Food imports are crucial due to limited arable land and cotton production. Tajikistan heavily relies on foreign loans and aid to cover budget and trade deficits.

Food imports are crucial due to limited arable land and cotton production. Tajikistan faces challenges such as high poverty rates, heavy reliance on remittances, and environmental degradation due to deforestation and gas cutoffs. Oil and gas reserves have been discovered, leading to potential economic development opportunities through partnerships with international companies like Tethys Petroleum Ltd., Total, and Gazprom. Gazprom announced finding gas reserves in Tajikistan, with plans for the country to meet its domestic gas needs. The construction of the Roghun dam aims to boost Tajikistan's electricity production and economic development. However, Uzbekistan opposes the dam due to concerns about its impact on agriculture and the environment. The World Bank conducted an analysis of the dam's economic and environmental effects in response to Tajikistan's request. In September 2013, the World Bank released technical reports on the dam project in Tajikistan. President Rahmon deferred construction, leading to concerns about electricity shortages in winter and discontent with his rule. Negotiations between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan for a water-for-gas trade deal have been suggested. Uzbekistan restricted transport to pressure Tajikistan against building the dam. Uzbekistan imposed transportation restrictions on Tajikistan to hinder the construction of the Roghun dam. This caused delays for various shipments, including materials for infrastructure projects and support for ISAF in Afghanistan. Uzbekistan also increased tariffs and restricted gas and electricity supplies to Tajikistan. Tajikistan accused Uzbekistan of political motives, while Uzbekistan claimed the delays were due to increased ISAF rail traffic. Shipping delays to Tajikistan were caused by increased ISAF rail traffic, a backup of railcars to Turkmenistan, and track repairs. A damaged railway spur from Termez, Uzbekistan, to southern Tajikistan led to a humanitarian crisis in Tajikistan. Uzbekistan also raised tariffs on rail transport to Tajikistan, causing transit problems. Talks between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan on gas deliveries have not been successful. Tajikistan has sought help from various organizations to address the delays in rail transit. President Rahmon of Tajikistan warned about increased dangers from various threats such as terrorism, extremism, and drug trafficking. Tajikistan would continue its open-door policy to address these challenges. President Rahmon of Tajikistan emphasized the importance of developing friendly and mutually beneficial relationships with all countries, prioritizing close ties with neighboring and regional states based on friendship, good-neighborliness, and non-interference. He highlighted the need for peaceful dispute resolution, particularly with Uzbekistan, and pledged support for Afghanistan's peaceful development. Rahmon also emphasized the continuation and expansion of cultural ties with Iran, historical relations with Russia, and the importance of strengthening relations in various spheres on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. President Rahmon of Tajikistan emphasized the importance of expanding trade, economic, and investment ties with China, the U.S., the EU, and the Islamic world. He expressed gratitude for U.S. economic assistance and pledged to maintain partnerships with various countries. However, Tajikistan's open foreign policy has faced constraints due to Russia's efforts to consolidate influence in the region through inducements and threats towards Tajik migrant workers. Tajikistan is concerned about threats to introduce an entry visa regime for its citizens and is heavily dependent on remittances from guest workers in Russia. President Rahmon considers Russia as Tajikistan's most significant \"strategic partner\" and has strained relations with Uzbekistan over various issues. Tajikistan has hosted refugees from Afghanistan, mainly ethnic Tajiks, but is wary of exacerbating Islamic fundamentalism. Relations between Russia and Tajikistan were strained over a Russian pilot sentenced in Tajikistan and subsequent retaliatory actions by Russia. Tensions escalated in 2013 with Russia imposing restrictions on trains to and from Tajikistan due to sanitary violations and suspected drug smuggling. Tajikistan agreed to enhance inspections of trains in response. Some in Tajikistan saw this as pressure to move forward with an extension of a basing agreement. Tajikistan's economic ties with China and Iran have strengthened, with China being the largest foreign investor in the country. President Rahmon and Chairman Xi Jinping signed various cooperation agreements during a visit to China in 2013, with China pledging $300 million for development projects in Tajikistan. The Tajik armed forces consist of around 8,800 troops, with additional forces in the Interior Ministry, National Guard, Emergencies Ministry, and border guards. The Tajik armed forces consist of around 8,800 troops, with additional forces in the Interior Ministry, National Guard, and Emergencies Ministry. The ground forces possess tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and air defense weapons. The air force has helicopters and transport aircraft. The armed forces are underfunded and fractured by regional clan loyalties. A mobile force was recently created for rapid reaction. Tajikistan is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Tajikistan is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). It also joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 2002. A 10-year basing agreement with Russia was signed in 2004, allowing Russia's troops to be stationed in Tajikistan. Russia has a significant military presence in Tajikistan, with ethnic Tajik noncommissioned officers and soldiers making up the second-largest military presence abroad. In addition to troops, Russia has positioned tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers, missile launchers, and aircraft in the country. Tajikistan took over border guarding responsibilities from Russia in 2005, but Russian border guard advisors remained. Joint military training operations were agreed upon in 2006, and in 2011, an agreement was reached to extend the basing agreement for another 49 years. In negotiations to extend the basing agreement, Tajikistan initially requested up to $300 million in annual rent payments, which Russia rejected. The number of Russian border advisors was planned to be reduced from 350 to 200. President Rahmon and President Putin agreed to continue discussions on the agreement. Tajikistan later reduced its rent request to $25 million but demanded the agreement only be extended to 2016. During negotiations, Tajikistan reduced its rent request to $25 million and demanded the basing agreement be extended only to 2016. President Putin and President Rahmon agreed to extend the basing lease until 2042, with Russia pledging oil, military assistance, and support for Tajik migrant workers. The basing extension accord was ratified by the Russian legislature in April 2013 and submitted to the Tajik legislature for ratification in September 2013. India also reportedly has a small forward operations airbase at Farkhar. In May 2013, CSTO Secretary General Nikolai Bordyuzha stated that Tajikistan's border guards were capable of securing the border with Afghanistan. However, in July 2013, the Director of the Russian Federal Drug Control Service, Viktor Ivanov, mentioned that Russian border guards would return to the Tajik-Afghan border if invited by Tajikistan. In August 2013, Bordyuzha visited Tajikistan and reported deteriorating Tajik-Afghan border security to President Putin. At the CSTO summit in September 2013, President Rahmon called for equipment to bolster Tajikistan's border defense capabilities. President Putin pledged to develop a special program of \"preventative\" assistance to enhance Tajikistan's border security against terrorism and drug trafficking, with the CSTO committing more resources than anticipated from the United States. Russia, however, did not plan to send its own border guards to Tajikistan. The United States supported U.N. military observers in Tajikistan during the 1992-1997 civil war and served as observers at U.N.-sponsored intra-Tajikistan peace talks, pledging rebuilding aid to ease ethnic and civil tensions in the region. The Obama Administration views stability and economic growth in Tajikistan as crucial for regional stability. The country faces challenges such as a porous border with Afghanistan, corruption, and inadequate health and education systems. U.S. aid aims to help Tajikistan counter extremism, terrorism, and drug trafficking while boosting trade. Tajikistan is considered a key U.S. partner in operations in Afghanistan. Annual bilateral consultations between the United States and Tajikistan were launched in 2010 to enhance cooperation on economic and security issues. The third round of consultations in 2012 focused on security, border strengthening, economic cooperation, and attracting investments. The United States pledged support for Tajikistan's accession to the WTO and discussed cooperation in education, cultural exchange, human rights, water resources, and environmental protection during a visit in February 2013. Secretary Clinton praised Tajikistan's role in bringing security to Afghanistan and progress in responding to human trafficking during her visit in October 2011. Discussions with Tajik officials included security concerns. During discussions with Tajik officials, the U.S. emphasized Tajik security concerns along the Tajik-Afghan border and cooperation in combating drug trafficking. The U.S. also promoted the \"New Silk Road Vision\" to develop Afghanistan as a regional hub connected to Central Asia. Assistant Secretary Blake highlighted U.S. support for Tajikistan's WTO accession, agricultural improvement, foreign investment climate, and human rights. The U.S. urged Tajikistan to cooperate with the World Bank's assessment. The United States urges Tajikistan to cooperate with the World Bank's assessment of the Roghun Dam project before construction. Assistant Secretary Blake discussed strengthening cooperation in counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and border security during his visit to Tajikistan. The U.S. also emphasized support for a free and fair presidential election in 2013 and humanitarian aid for the peace accord implementation. The United States provided $988.57 million in aid for Tajikistan, mainly for food and humanitarian needs. Assistance for FY2011-FY2014 included programs like Food for Peace, Foreign Military Financing, Global Health, and Nonproliferation. The Administration's priorities for FY2014 include peace and security assistance programs. The FY2014 request for assistance for Tajikistan includes programs for peace and security, food security, health, education, and support for NGOs and media. Tajikistan showed willingness to cooperate with the United States after 9/11 but hesitated without Moscow's permission. Tajikistan had long supported the Afghan Northern Alliance against the Taliban. After 9/11, Tajikistan offered the use of its airspace to U.S. forces, allowing coalition forces to transit through Tajik airfields. U.S., French, and British personnel used Dushanbe airport for refueling. In 2009, an agreement was reached for land transit of goods to support ISAF operations in Afghanistan. The Northern Distribution Network mainly traverses Uzbekistan for transport to final destinations. In March 2012, the first U.S. military cargoes were trucked across the \"Friendship Bridge\" to Tajikistan as an alternative route for supplies to Afghanistan. Transit costs via the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) were higher than expected, resulting in only a few containers being shipped through Tajikistan. General James Mattis visited Dushanbe to thank the president for supporting the NDN and providing economic assistance. In February and May 2012, U.S. officials visited Tajikistan to assess the status of the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) transit. In late February 2013, a military delegation led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense David Sedney discussed Tajikistan's security needs and its role in the NDN. In July 2013, USCENTCOM Commander Lloyd Austin visited Dushanbe to discuss possible U.S. security support for Tajikistan. The United States has provided significant security assistance to Tajikistan, including aid for border security and counter-terrorism efforts. Despite receiving various forms of assistance, Tajikistan's border guards and police still lack the necessary capabilities to effectively police the border with Afghanistan. Tajikistan struggles with border security and counter-terrorism due to lack of capabilities and corruption. Concerns raised about targeting non-extremist groups and misusing counter-terrorism laws. U.S. calls for strengthening money laundering laws and monitoring banking links with Iran. U.S. Special Forces have an agreement to pursue terrorists crossing from Afghanistan. In 2010, they provided tactical support to Tajik security forces combating militants in the Rasht valley. The State Department reports that drug trafficking in Tajikistan contributes significantly to the country's GDP, with most heroin smuggled through Central Asia. The illicit drug trade fuels corruption in the government and provides revenue for militants in Afghanistan. Despite efforts to combat drug trafficking, the National Border Management Strategy has seen limited success, with law enforcement agencies seizing a significant amount of narcotics in recent years. In 2012, law enforcement agencies seized nearly six metric tons of narcotics, a 41% increase from 2011, with cannabis seizures driving most of the rise. Drug-related criminal cases were sometimes dismissed for connected individuals or used by corrupt officials against internal opponents. Several officials were arrested for drug trafficking and corruption. The US has provided $11.3 million since 2003 to support the DCA, including salary supplements for personnel. The US and DCA operate a Drug Liaison Office in Taloqan, Afghanistan, to prevent drug smuggling to Tajikistan. Training for Customs officials at the Tajik-Afghan border remains underused. The Nizhny-Panj border crossing on the Tajik-Afghan border has underused scanners with negligible drug seizures. High-level corruption and lack of commitment to implement the NBMS hinder counter-narcotics programs. The US may use Tajikistan's willingness to combat militants to encourage cooperation on border security and counter-narcotics. USCENTCOM temporarily banned dealing with a private airline suspected of smuggling drugs to Tajikistan. Tajikistan has occasionally hosted annual Regional Cooperation \"tabletop\" meetings. Tajikistan occasionally hosts annual Regional Cooperation exercises sponsored by USCENTCOM to strengthen security cooperation among Central and South Asian countries. The most recent exercise in mid-2012 was followed by one in Germany in July 2013."
