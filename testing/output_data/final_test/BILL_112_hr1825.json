Violation of guidelines results in termination of eligibility for the cash allowance. The amendments made by this section apply to parking provided during calendar years beginning after December 31, 2011. SEC. 5. VANPOOL INVESTMENT CREDIT. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 adds a new section for a Qualifying Vanpool Investment Credit. The Qualifying Vanpool Investment Credit allows a 10 percent credit for the basis of a qualified commuter van placed in service by the taxpayer. A qualified commuter van must have a seating capacity of 7-15 adults, a 3-year class life, at least 80 percent mileage for transportation, allowable depreciation, and be placed in service before January 1, 2019. The leasing exception allows employers who lease transportation for vanpools to claim a 10 percent investment credit based on amounts paid for the lease. Related persons under certain tax provisions are considered related for this credit. The subsection regarding the vanpool investment credit terminates after December 31, 2014. The basis of property eligible for the credit will be reduced by the amount of the credit. The credit is considered part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the tax code. The vanpool investment credit expires after December 31, 2014 and is part of the general business credit. A new paragraph is added regarding credits allowed under section 45S. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The vanpool investment credit under Sec. 45S applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2011. Employees can receive transit passes and bike commuting expense reimbursement as fringe benefits in the same month. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to redefine qualified bicycling month and limit exclusions. The constructive receipt treatment of bicycle commuting reimbursements is repealed. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
