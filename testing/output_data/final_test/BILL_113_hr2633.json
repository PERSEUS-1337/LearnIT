The economic contributions of enslaved African Americans to the American economy between 1691 and 1860 were immeasurable, building the foundations of America. Colonial economies in the Americas were dependent on enslaved African labor, including the North American mercantile and shipping sectors. Enslaved Africans were also crucial in the political and economic capital of the United States. During 246 years, enslaved Africans provided 605 billion hours of forced labor, fueling the American economy, financing key sectors, and aiding in funding both world wars. President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War added a new dimension to the nation's war aims. The Civil War evolved from a conflict to preserve the Union to a crusade to end slavery and uphold the Declaration of Independence. In 1864, the 13th Amendment, prohibiting slavery and granting Congress enforcement power, was passed by the Senate after debates on the moral issue of slavery. The 13th Amendment was promoted by President Lincoln to end slavery, with members of the Republican Party like Charles Sumner rejecting slavery as incompatible with moral law. Lincoln ensured the party's 1864 platform included support for the amendment, which ultimately succeeded in Congress. Illinois was the first state to ratify the proposed 13th Amendment on February 1, 1865, followed by 17 other states by the end of the month. Georgia became the 27th state to approve the Amendment on December 6, 1865. The 13th Amendment was declared part of the Constitution by Secretary of State William Seward on December 18. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture was established by an Act of Congress in 2003. The NMAAHC would receive surcharges from the sale of coins issued under Public Law 108-184 to raise funding for its endowment and educational outreach programs.
