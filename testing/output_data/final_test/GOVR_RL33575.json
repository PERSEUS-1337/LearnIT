    "content": "Congress has been presented with legislative proposals to address pollution from abandoned hardrock mines, particularly in the West. In the 109th Congress, four bills were introduced to encourage cleanup by \"Good Samaritan\" entities. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported an amended version of one of the bills in September 2006, but no further action was taken. Mining has been conducted throughout the country for nearly 150 years, with many historic operations abandoned without proper reclamation, leading to potential environmental damage. There are over 550,000 sites on public and private lands in the US, with some discharging harmful substances like sulfate, copper, lead, arsenic, and mercury. The EPA estimates that 40% of headwaters in rivers and streams in the West are affected. Approximately 40% of headwaters in rivers and streams in the West have been impacted by discharges from abandoned hardrock mines, threatening water supplies and increasing treatment costs. The number of mines causing water pollution is believed to be a small percentage of total sites, but still represents a significant concern. Bills aim to address pollution from these sites by encouraging cleanup by voluntary entities. The bills propose incentives for voluntary cleanup of pollution from abandoned mines, reducing liability and environmental standards for cleanup activities. Proponents argue that any cleanup is better than inaction, while opponents, including environmental advocates, acknowledge the benefits but raise concerns about liability exposure and regulatory standards. The bills propose incentives for voluntary cleanup of pollution from abandoned mines, reducing liability and environmental standards for cleanup activities. Stakeholders, including conservation advocates, express concerns about exemptions potentially dismantling environmental legislation. The bills aim to establish a permitting process for Good Samaritans, allowing them to improve water quality without full compliance with standards. EPA would have permitting authority, which could be delegated to states and tribes. The bills propose incentives for voluntary cleanup of pollution from abandoned mines, reducing liability and environmental standards for cleanup activities. The bills aim to establish a permitting process for Good Samaritans, allowing them to improve water quality without full compliance with standards. The bills focus on hardrock mines like gold, copper, silver, and iron ore, with some stakeholders advocating for similar authority for abandoned coal mines. H.R. 1266 specifically amends the Clean Water Act for this purpose. The Clean Water Act (CWA) prohibits pollutant discharge into waters without a permit. H.R. 1266 proposed amending the CWA's permit provision, while S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 aimed to provide Good Samaritan relief from CWA and CERCLA requirements. S. 1848 suggested permitting authorities could grant Good Samaritans relief from the Clean Water Act and CERCLA, among other federal laws. Good Samaritan legislation has been discussed for nearly a decade, with limited consideration from congressional committees. In the 106th Congress, a Good Samaritan bill was introduced by Senator Baucus, and in the 108th Congress, another bill was introduced by Senator Campbell but no action was taken. In the 109th Congress, three House and Senate committees held hearings on Good Samaritan issues, with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approving a modified version of a bill in September 2006. In September 2006, hearings were held on Good Samaritan legislation with witnesses from EPA, states, mining industry, and environmental groups. No witness fully endorsed any legislative approach, with criticism on proposals being either too narrow or too broad. Issues discussed include the definition of remediating parties and regulatory disincentives. This report discusses key issues related to Good Samaritan permits for cleanup of inactive and abandoned hardrock mine sites. It covers eligibility, liability protection, revenue treatment, enforcement, state and tribal roles, funding, permit termination, and program sunsetting. The discussion does not address all aspects of the bills or general background on the problem. The issue of permit eligibility involves determining who can undertake cleanup under a Good Samaritan permit, including government entities, the mining industry, and private sector parties. The legislation specifies that individuals with prior responsibility for environmental pollution at a site are restricted from eligibility for liability and regulatory relief exemptions provided by a Good Samaritan permit. Some argue that only government entities should be involved in remediation to ensure focus on cleanup rather than profit generation. Industry groups argue that mining companies have the resources, knowledge, and technology to assess and remediate abandoned sites, and should be allowed to participate as Good Samaritans. They believe that limiting eligibility for liability and regulatory relief exemptions could hinder cleanup efforts. The bills offered different approaches to the issue of Good Samaritan eligibility. H.R. 1266 proposed limiting eligible parties to the U.S. government, states, municipalities, or Indian tribes, excluding the federal government. This limitation was based on the belief that federal agencies should be responsible for cleaning up sites on lands they own or manage. The bills proposed different approaches to Good Samaritan eligibility for cleanup of abandoned mine sites. Critics argued that restrictions on federal agencies were excessive, hindering cleanup efforts. Some bills allowed states to be Good Samaritans on state-owned land, with an expansive list of eligible parties including individuals, corporations, and governments. The legislative proposals on Good Samaritan eligibility for cleanup of abandoned mine sites aimed to prevent parties with legal responsibility from receiving permits. They emphasized that financially capable owners or operators should not be eligible for relief under a Good Samaritan permit. The proposed legislation aimed to prevent owners or operators with legal responsibility from receiving permits for cleanup of abandoned mines. It would bar individuals or entities with ownership interests in the site or involvement in creating pollution from being eligible for liability protection as Good Samaritans. Innocent landowners and bona fide prospective purchasers would still be eligible for cleanup assistance. H.R. 1266 aimed to prevent owners or operators with legal responsibility from receiving permits for cleanup of abandoned mines. It would bar individuals or entities with ownership interests in the site or involvement in creating pollution from being eligible for liability protection as Good Samaritans. Efforts to search for responsible parties and the burden of identifying them have been questioned by stakeholders. Some argue that the burden of searching for responsible parties for cleanup should be on the government due to their resources and tools. Requiring industry or Good Samaritans to conduct searches reduces resources for cleanup. There is debate on whether lands listed on the National Priorities List should be eligible for Good Samaritan permits under CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act established a trust fund to support federal response actions for potentially contaminated sites. The law required EPA to assemble the National Priorities List (NPL) from the larger database of contaminated sites. As of July 2006, there were 1,244 NPL sites, including abandoned hardrock mines and mineral processing sites. Being on the NPL does not automatically trigger cleanup actions or assign responsibility to specific parties. Some stakeholders debate whether certain NPL sites should be eligible for voluntary cleanups under the Good Samaritan legislation, as it may lead to less stringent cleanup standards compared to Superfund cleanups. The expiration of the Superfund taxing authority in 1995 has led to Superfund cleanup funding relying heavily on general revenue appropriations. Different bills proposed various approaches to this issue, excluding certain lands from eligibility for cleanup under CERCLA and the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act. The Good Samaritan proposals aim to provide incentives for voluntary cleanup of contaminated sites by exempting activities from strict environmental standards. This would allow for exceptions to be made on a case-by-case basis to accelerate environmental improvements without interfering with planned remediation efforts. The Good Samaritan proposals aim to incentivize voluntary cleanup of contaminated sites by exempting activities from strict environmental standards. Stakeholders are discussing adjusted standards for cleanup goals, time frames, and success criteria, including the intention of cleanup and appropriate cleanup benchmarks. The Center of the American West suggests questions to consider in recalibrating standards. Among stakeholder groups, there is a widely held view that a remediation project should achieve significant environmental improvement without specific numeric effluent limitations. However, defining standards that are clear yet flexible poses a challenge for permit issuers, applicants, and the public. The bills aimed to strike a balance between defining a cleanup standard and allowing flexibility. They generally included a goal of improving water quality to the maximum extent practicable, considering resources available to the Good Samaritan. For example, H.R. 1266 stated that a permit could be issued if the remediation plan demonstrated meeting applicable water quality standards to the maximum extent practicable. The bills aimed to improve water quality by reducing pollution from historic mine residue. Permits could be issued if the project would significantly enhance the environment and meet water quality standards to the maximum extent reasonable and practicable. The goal was to mitigate the effects of mine residue and minimize short-term environmental impacts during remediation. Stakeholders have concerns about defining \"significant improvement\" in legislation addressing environmental impacts from mine residue remediation. Environmental groups and states worry about meeting water quality standards, suggesting including \"maximum extent practicable\" language. Industry groups argue this language is too restrictive and could delay cleanup efforts. The bills discussed lack clear definitions for terms like \"maximum extent practicable,\" leading to concerns about permitting authority discretion. Questions arise about what constitutes an \"improvement to the environment\" in permit issuance. The National Research Council suggests focusing on achieving characteristics of a healthy aquatic ecosystem in mine site cleanup. The National Research Council recommends focusing on achieving characteristics of a healthy aquatic ecosystem in mine site cleanup, rather than specific contaminant concentrations. Good Samaritan legislation proponents argue that liability under existing environmental laws hinders voluntary cleanup efforts, citing CERCLA and the CWA. A Good Samaritan involved in an IAM cleanup may be considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) under CERCLA, facing strict and joint liability for the entire cleanup, regardless of causing the release. They cannot selectively address pollution and must comply with all aspects of cleanup. CERCLA requires full cleanup of pollution at IAMs to meet federal and state standards, following a \"polluter pays\" approach. Good Samaritans cleaning up IAMs face strict liability under CERCLA, hindering cleanup efforts and potentially increasing government costs. Mining companies advocate for liability exemptions from CWA and CERCLA for Good Samaritans. Mining companies advocate for liability exemptions from CWA and CERCLA for Good Samaritans due to concerns about the strict liability under CERCLA hindering cleanup efforts. The Clean Water Act also plays a role as it requires permits for point-source discharges into US waters, potentially subjecting Good Samaritans to liability. The Clean Water Act imposes liability on permit holders for noncompliance with effluent limitations and water quality standards, with potential civil and criminal penalties. The Act also grants EPA emergency powers to address endangerment situations. Unlike CERCLA, the CWA only allows EPA to order potentially responsible parties to clean up, not conduct the cleanup themselves. Some argue that including CERCLA in legislation is unnecessary if Good Samaritans' activities are covered by a CWA permit, providing immunity from CERCLA liability. Sections 107(j) and 101(10) of CERCLA and CWA permits bar recovery of response costs or damages for authorized releases. CERCLA exempts those providing care or advice under the National Contingency Plan. Good Samaritans may benefit from this exemption if not liable or negligent. Critics argue that including an exemption from CERCLA raises other questions. Critics question the inclusion of an exemption from CERCLA, raising concerns about post-remediation liability and potential environmental risks. Environmental groups caution against granting Good Samaritans exemptions, fearing it may weaken environmental laws. They argue that stringent liability is necessary to drive cleanup efforts at most sites. Proponents argue that liability relief is crucial for voluntary cleanups of difficult mining sites, while opponents fear exemptions may weaken environmental laws. Good Samaritan legislation is debated as some believe EPA's enforcement discretion can authorize cleanup projects without additional permits. Trout Unlimited is working on a project to clean up an abandoned mine in Utah's American Fork. Trout Unlimited is partnering with a private landowner to clean up an abandoned mine in Utah's American Fork canyon, aiming to improve water quality and restore habitat for a rare cutthroat trout population. They support legislation for environmental quality improvement at inactive mines, including liability limitations to encourage remediation efforts. H.R. 1266 aims to ensure compliance with CWA Sections 301, 302, and 402, without conferring immunity from Section 504. It does not provide liability protection for CWA sections like 311 or 404. The bill addresses dredging/filling activities under Section 404 and waives Section 401 requirements for state certification. H.R. 1266 waives Section 401 for a Good Samaritan permit but requires state concurrence. States and tribes must ensure water quality standards are met. S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 provide broader liability exemptions than H.R. 1266, including categorical exemptions from CWA requirements and liabilities. S. 1848 offers broad liability protections, including exemptions from certain environmental laws and compliance requirements. The bill also provides liability protection for IAM remediation under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The permittee receives liability protection under various environmental laws such as TSCA, RCRA, CWA, CERCLA, and state, local, and tribal laws. The bill allows exemptions from certain laws at the discretion of the permit issuer, but the permittee must still comply with TSCA and RCRA when treating or disposing of materials off-site. The bill's liability exemption provisions have faced criticism for being overly broad, leading to dropped exemptions like the Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. Concerns have been raised about potential controversy in federal-state/local relations due to waiving state, local, and tribal requirements. However, supporters argue that a Good Samaritan permit cannot be issued without the consent of the relevant authorities. The bill also includes exemptions from NEPA and liability protection for IAM remediation under SMCRA. The legislation addresses the disposition of revenues from Good Samaritan remediation projects at historic mine sites. It allows incidental reprocessing of waste for cleanup but not re-mining for mineral reserves. This issue is controversial in proposals like S. 1848, S. 2780, and H.R. 5404. Industry stakeholders believe that Good Samaritan remediation and re-mining should be addressed separately due to policy complexities. They argue that processing waste material on abandoned mine sites can help extract valuable materials, reduce cleanup costs, and benefit the company economically. Some groups advocate for using minerals in waste material to clean up abandoned mines efficiently and profitably, while others oppose the idea of commercializing cleanup efforts. Critics fear potential abuse of liability exemptions by mining companies. Critics are concerned that mining companies could exploit liability exemptions and reduced cleanup requirements under the Good Samaritan permit to avoid responsibility for their own operations. Industry argues that transparency in the permitting process will prevent misuse, and new mining activities would still require proper permits. Environmental critics warn of potential environmental issues with processing mine waste, such as cyanide heap leaching. Language in H.R. 1266 aims to prevent any degradation of baseline water quality. H.R. 1266 is more restrictive than other bills, requiring proceeds from recovered materials to be used for remediation costs at the same or other IAM sites. The Good Samaritan permit would end when the site transitions from remediation to development, including mining activities. The bills S. 1848, S. 2780, and H.R. 5404 did not directly address revenue or profit issues related to Good Samaritan permits for mining sites. They allowed for revenue-generating activities under applicable laws, with the hope of attracting potential Good Samaritans. The legislation S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 focused on authorizing activities for the remediation of historic mine residue, prohibiting new mining activity under a Good Samaritan permit. Stakeholders are concerned about potential restrictions on reprocessing mine residue by Good Samaritans. Many stakeholders argue that Good Samaritans should not face citizen suits or financial penalties for their cleanup activities. The debate surrounds whether alternative enforcement procedures are needed for voluntary cleanup activities under the Clean Water Act. EPA's enforcement authority under CWA Section 309 is being reviewed in this context. EPA has broad enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act, including issuing administrative orders, imposing penalties, filing civil and criminal actions, and authorizing citizen suits. Citizen suits can be brought against violators of effluent standards or EPA for failing to perform duties. EPA can intervene in these suits and remedies include injunctions and civil penalties. Section 504 allows EPA to address imminent endangerments to public health and welfare. Section 504 of the Clean Water Act allows EPA to address imminent endangerments to public health and welfare by seeking court orders against polluters. Good Samaritan bills proposed different enforcement approaches, with free-standing bills offering fewer tools for enforcement compared to CWA permit violators. EPA has broad enforcement authority under the Clean Water Act, including administrative orders, penalties, civil and criminal actions, and citizen suits. The free-standing bills S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 did not address administrative penalties or citizen suits for Good Samaritan permit violations. These bills offered limited enforcement options, such as an \"order to comply\" or civil actions, with lower daily civil penalties compared to the Clean Water Act. Unlike the CWA, the bills did not authorize criminal penalties. Effective enforcement is crucial for compliance. The bills did not authorize criminal penalties. Enforcement requires access to information. S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 allowed entry to inspect and collect information. S. 1848 lacked similar provisions but could achieve the same through permit conditions. Enforcement could be carried out by EPA or a state under an EPA-approved program. H.R. 1266 used the CWA enforcement approach, not giving special treatment to Good Samaritans. H.R. 1266 introduced enforcement measures under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for permit violators, including administrative penalties, criminal penalties, and citizen suits. This bill was in contrast to free-standing bills that did not include these enforcement tools. Many states and environmental groups support the use of citizen suits as an incentive for compliance with environmental laws, while proponents of the free-standing bills argue against including citizen suits for Good Samaritan permittees. H.R. 1266 proposed amendments to the Clean Water Act (CWA) for enforcement measures against permit violators, including administrative and criminal penalties. The bill also allowed government enforcement by the EPA and states, with provisions for delegation of the permitting program. Additionally, it clarified that Good Samaritan permits do not limit emergency authorities. The bill differentiated from free-standing bills with targeted judicial review provisions. The judicial review provisions in S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 allow for review of EPA permit issuance or denial within 120 days. The Administrative Procedure Act likely governs aspects of permit review not addressed in these bills. S. 1848 grants original jurisdiction in federal district courts for EPA-issued permits. The review of EPA-issued permits in S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 vests original jurisdiction in the circuit courts, while S. 1848 grants jurisdiction in federal district courts. Filing for judicial review must occur within 120 days of permit issuance or denial, following the provisions of CWA Section 509(b). The bills authorized EPA to delegate permit-issuing authority to states or tribes, with judicial review vested in state court or tribal bodies. H.R. 1266 did not have separate judicial review provisions but would likely follow CWA Section 509(b) for permit review within 120 days. The bills differentiated into S. 1848 on one side and S. 2780, H.R. 5404, and H.R. 1266 on the other. S. 2780, H.R. 5404, and H.R. 1266 shared the use of the APA standard of review and original jurisdiction in circuit courts for EPA permit reviews. In contrast, S. 1848 used a more deferential standard of review and allowed legal challenges to be filed in district courts. Supporters of S. 1848 believed it would minimize litigation delays by encouraging early public input in the permitting process. The role of states and tribes in the Good Samaritan permit process was a key issue. The bills focused on the role of states and tribes in the Good Samaritan permit process, with provisions requiring their consent before permits could be issued. S. 1848 had additional requirements for state or tribal involvement in EPA-issued permits, including local environmental waivers and projects on federal land. Public involvement procedures were included, but there were differences in how adjacent states were involved in IAM remediation projects. The bills focused on the role of states and tribes in the Good Samaritan permit process, with provisions requiring their consent before permits could be issued. None of the free-standing bills explicitly gave adjacent affected states a role in the IAM remediation project process. This contrasts with the regular process for issuance of NPDES permits under the CWA, which allows other states to comment on permit applications. EPA could delegate Good Samaritan permitting to qualified states and tribes under all four bills. The bills focused on the role of states and tribes in the Good Samaritan permit process, with provisions requiring their consent before permits could be issued. EPA could delegate Good Samaritan permitting to qualified states and tribes under all four bills, detailing the process for approval, transfer of authority, oversight, and termination of delegated programs. EPA's view was that national consistency in environmental approaches required its decision-making role. Some argue that EPA should establish criteria for Good Samaritan permits, while others believe in delegating permitting to states and tribes. States generally support delegation, citing their proximity to the situation for better decision-making. Stakeholders also emphasize the need for relief from environmental liability for Good Samaritans. Funding for voluntary cleanups of hardrock mines is a major concern, with estimated costs ranging from $20 to $54 billion. Current funding levels are insufficient, with only 8%-20% of cleanup work expected to be completed in 30 years. Unlike other resource extraction sectors, hardrock mining lacks a dedicated fee-based fund for site reclamation and remediation. Abandoned mines have been cleaned up with assistance from various sources, but a sustainable funding mechanism is needed. The need for a dedicated funding source for cleanup of abandoned hardrock mines has been highlighted by stakeholders and the NRC. Past legislation proposing a reclamation fee on hardrock mineral producers has been controversial and not enacted, with industry concerns about the impact on commodity pricing. Despite current high commodity prices, the issue of funding for cleanup remains unresolved. Some observers believe that the argument for a dedicated funding source for abandoned mine cleanup has weakened due to high commodity prices. Good Samaritan bills lack a comprehensive funding mechanism but address funding through grants under CWA Section 319 for water pollution management. Section 319 funds can be used for abandoned mine land reclamation projects to restore water quality, except for specific NPDES permit requirements. The bills aim to clarify that projects for implementing Inactive Mine (IAM) remediation are eligible for Section 319 grants, with H.R. 1266 also allowing EPA to grant funds for activities covered by a Good Samaritan permit. There is a debate on whether the proposed legislation should outline conditions for terminating a Good Samaritan permit under the Clean Water Act. Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits are authorized for up to five years and must be renewed. A Good Samaritan permit issued under the NPDES program, as in H.R. 1266, would expire in no more than five years. H.R. 1266 addressed permit termination factors such as completion of remediation, maintaining water quality conditions, unforeseen events, or a shift from remediation to development activities. This would subject discharges to non-Good Samaritan requirements of the CWA and other environmental laws. Under the Clean Water Act, NPDES permits are authorized for up to five years and must be renewed. Free-standing bills like S. 2780 and H.R. 5404 outlined permit termination conditions, including commencement and completion of work, misrepresentation, or violations. S. 1848 specified a timeline for project completion and permit termination if work did not commence within 18 months. The question of terminating Good Samaritan permits and the permit program itself has been raised by stakeholders. Some stakeholders suggest sunsetting the permit program after a specific period, like 10 years, to allow for congressional review and potential extension. H.R. 1266 included a 10-year sunset requirement, while S. 1848 proposed terminating the program in 2016. The Administration's proposal did not include a sunset provision. The Administration proposal to Congress in 2016 did not include provisions for sunsetting the permit program or a report to Congress. Witnesses expressed frustration over the ongoing debate on Good Samaritan issues, with some calling for action to clean up abandoned mine sites. There is disagreement on the need for legislative solutions, with differing opinions on liability relief and other key aspects of proposed bills. Before consensus emerges, there are still key details to discuss and debate regarding liability protection, revenue, profit questions, and applicable standards."
