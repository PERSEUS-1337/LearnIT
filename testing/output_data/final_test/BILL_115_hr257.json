    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Recognition of Jerusalem as the Capital of the State of Israel Act\". Congress finds that the Jewish people have a historical connection to Israel and Jerusalem, which has been their capital for over 3,000 years. The State of Israel was established in 1948 as a homeland for Jews, and Jerusalem was reunified in 1967 during the Six Day War, becoming a unified city under Israeli administration. In 1995, Congress approved the Jerusalem Embassy Act, requiring the establishment of the US Embassy in Jerusalem by May 31, 1999. In 1999, the United States maintains its embassy in every country except Israel. Israel has exceeded international law regulations and ensured public order and safety in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is safer under Israel's administration with all government institutions present. Recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The policy of the United States is to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, both de jure and de facto. Congress believes that the US should acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the embassy there from Tel Aviv to show commitment. The President and Secretary of State should affirm that Jerusalem must remain Israel's undivided capital, and the President should implement the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995. The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 mandates the relocation of the US Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem by January 1, 2019. US officials are required to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on official government documents and refrain from actions that contradict this law. The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is amended to repeal section 7 and redesignate section 8 as section 7. The repeal will take effect on January 1, 2018. Additionally, there is a requirement for an implementation report. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of the Act's enactment detailing the plan to establish the US Embassy in Jerusalem, including estimated completion dates and funding requirements."
