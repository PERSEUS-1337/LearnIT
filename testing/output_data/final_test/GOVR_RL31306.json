It provided funding for Interior and related agencies, as well as 10 other regular appropriations bills not enacted for FY2003. The final FY2003 appropriation included $19.08 billion for the Interior and related agencies, along with $825.0 million to repay transferred amounts for fire fighting in FY2002. Additionally, a 0.65% across-the-board cut was implemented. The omnibus appropriations resolution for FY2003 (H.J.Res. 2) provided funding for Interior and related agencies, as well as other departments like Agriculture, Energy, and Health and Human Services. It included agencies managing land, natural resources, and regulatory programs, as well as the Indian Health Service. President Bush submitted his FY2003 budget to Congress, requesting $18.94 billion for Interior and related agencies, a decrease from the previous year. The requested funding includes allocations for the National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Departmental Offices. The FY2003 budget requested funding for various agencies including the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Minerals Management Service, Forest Service, Indian Health Service, Energy programs, Smithsonian Institution, National Endowment for the Humanities, and National Endowment for the Arts. The total funds available in appropriations do not include President Bush's proposal to shift federal employee pensions and health benefits costs to agencies. The FY2003 budget proposed increases for agencies like the Indian Health Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Minerals Management Service, Smithsonian Institution, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, while decreases were suggested for agencies such as Forest Service, Department of Energy, U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and National Park Service. The House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee began hearings on the FY2003 budget for Interior and related agencies. Interior Secretary Norton testified on various topics including conservation initiatives, Indian education, National Park Service maintenance backlog, Everglades restoration, wildlife refuge funds, endangered species conservation, energy programs, wildland fire management, homeland security, and workforce restructuring. Members questioned proposed cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey and privatizing jobs. The House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee held hearings on the FY2003 budget for Interior and related agencies, addressing topics such as conservation initiatives, Indian education, National Park Service maintenance backlog, Everglades restoration, wildlife refuge funds, and energy programs. Discussions also included proposed cuts to the U.S. Geological Survey and privatizing jobs. Subcommittee hearings continued from February through April 2002, leading to the passing of H.R. 5093 in the House on July 17, 2002. The Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee held a hearing on June 13, 2002, where Interior Secretary Norton testified about the Administration's request for funds for enhanced security measures. The Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up and ordered reported its FY2003 funding recommendations on June 27, 2002. The bill was reported on June 28, 2002, and placed on the Senate calendar. The Senate began consideration of the House funding bill on September 4, 2002, but discontinued debate on September 25, 2002. The Senate discontinued debate on an Interior funding bill in the 107th Congress due to controversies surrounding funding for wildfires. Attempts to pass amendments for firefighting costs and forest thinning were unsuccessful. The Senate also debated farm disaster relief assistance, adopting a second degree amendment for $6 billion. During House and Senate consideration, various issues were discussed, including stewardship contracting in the Tongass National Forest, development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Missouri River flows, Everglades restoration, funding for land acquisition and conservation, oil and gas leases off the California coast, and management of Indian tribes' trust funds and assets. Controversies also arose over federal recognition of Indian tribes and funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and energy conservation programs. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 2, the Omnibus Appropriations bill for FY2003 on January 23rd, 2003. It included funding for Interior and related agencies, totaling $19.80 billion for FY2003. This amount included $825 million for FY2002 to replace wildfire fighting expenses. The bill also included an across-the-board rescission of 1.6% and required an increase to offset $5 billion in additional funding. The Senate omnibus bill for FY2003 included more funding for DOI and related agencies than the Administration. The House-passed bill had the highest total amount of $20.41 billion, with higher funding for Conservation Spending Category and wildland fire fighting compared to the Senate and Administration. Both the House and Senate proposed increases for U.S. Geological Survey over FY2002. The House and Senate proposed increases for the U.S. Geological Survey over FY2002, while the Administration suggested a decrease. The House-passed bill included higher funding levels for various agencies compared to the Administration and Senate. Conferees were appointed for H.J.Res. 2, leading to the agreement on the Consolidated Appropriations resolution for FY2003, signed into law as P.L. 108-7 by President George Bush on February 20, 2003. President George Bush signed the measure into law as P.L. 108-7 on February 20, 2003, providing $19.08 billion for the Interior and related agencies in FY2003. A 0.65% cut was applied proportionately to each account and program. The figures in the report exclude across-the-board cuts and reflect appropriations from FY1999 to FY2003. During FY1994 to FY2003, Interior and related agencies appropriations increased by 42% in current dollars, from $13.4 billion to $19.1 billion. Most growth occurred in the latter years, with a 33% increase from FY1999 to FY2003. The biggest increase was from FY2000 to FY2001, rising 27% to $18.9 billion, mainly for land conservation and wildland fire management. During FY2002-FY2003, Interior Appropriations included funding for combating terrorism, such as $3.0 million for the Bureau of Land Management to assess oil and gas resources after the 9/11 attacks. Congress also passed a $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation for FY2001 in response to the attacks. The $40 billion Emergency Supplemental Appropriation for FY2001, P.L.107-38, was in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The package was distributed in three phases, with $20 billion allocated immediately and $3.1 million going to programs under the Department of Interior and Related agencies appropriations. The Department of Interior and Related agencies appropriations received $3.1 million, with $1.7 million for the National Park Service and $1.4 million for the U.S. Park Police for emergency response costs in New York City and Washington, D.C. OMB submitted a $20 billion proposal to Congress, leading to the enactment of P.L. 107-117 providing emergency supplemental funds for FY2002, including $88.1 million for anti-terrorism activities. President Bush signed into law the FY2002 Supplemental Funding (P.L. 107-206) on August 2, 2002. President Bush signed into law the FY2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 107-206) on August 2, 2002, which allocated $30 billion for anti-terrorism, defense, homeland security, and economic revitalization. The law also included $5.1 billion for contingent emergency spending, which the President rejected on August 13, 2002. President Bush rejected $5.1 billion in contingent emergency spending, stating it was not related to a national emergency. He later requested $1 billion for selected programs in a separate supplemental request for FY2003. The request did not include funds for DOI and related agencies. Additionally, for FY2003, the Administration sought $37.7 billion for homeland security, with $25.2 billion for non-Department of Defense operations. The FY2003 budget included $88.8 million in additional funding for combating terrorism, allocated to the National Park Service, Office of the Secretary of the Interior, and Bureau of Reclamation. $56.5 million was designated for the National Park Service for heightened security and terrorist prevention in park operations. The FY2003 budget allocated $88.8 million for combating terrorism in the National Park System, U.S. Park Police, Office of the Secretary of the Interior, and Bureau of Reclamation. The Department of Homeland Security was created to coordinate federal anti-terrorism efforts, but there was no specific mention of transferring programs from the Interior and related agencies bill. The Interior and related agencies bill included a reference to the Secretary of the Interior's identification of Indian tribes performing law enforcement functions. The Secretary of Homeland Security received authority to transfer appropriations for department establishment. The Bureau of Land Management manages 264 million acres of public land for various uses. For more information on the Department of the Interior, visit http://www.doi.gov. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages conflicting land uses such as minerals development, energy development, livestock grazing, recreation, and preservation. They oversee federal subsurface mineral resources on 700 million acres nationwide and supervise mineral operations on 56 million acres of Indian Trust lands. BLM also manages wildland fire on 370 million acres of DOI and other federal lands. Congress allocated $1.88 billion for BLM in FY2003, slightly higher than the previous year. In FY2003, Congress allocated $825.7 million for Management of Lands and Resources, a $50.1 million increase from FY2002. For the energy and minerals program, including Alaska minerals, Congress allocated $109.1 million, a $9.6 million increase from FY2002, supporting the President's National Energy Plan. The FY2003 law allocated funds for Alaska North Slope oil and gas development, including expediting permitting processes and increasing environmental inspections. It retained Senate language for the renewal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline right of way but dropped language regarding another controversial right of way. The FY2003 law addressed funding for Alaska North Slope oil and gas development, including expediting permitting processes and increasing environmental inspections. It also included provisions related to the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year Supply Program and energy leasing activities within national monuments. The FY2003 funding bill did not include funds for potential energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act prohibits oil and gas production on ANWR lands without congressional authorization. The House Committee on Appropriations' report language suggested no funds for preleasing studies or preliminary work on oil and gas drilling in ANWR, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations did not have this prohibition. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill did not include funds for energy development in ANWR. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not have a prohibition on this, but conferees included language suggesting funds may be available for preliminary work. The prohibition in ANILCA still stands, making the use of funds unclear for pre-leasing activities. The bill also allows for automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases issued by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill did not include funds for energy development in ANWR. The bill allows for automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases issued by the Secretary of Agriculture until the renewal process is completed. Land use planning received a substantial increase in funding for FY2003. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill allocated additional funds for land use planning, with a focus on addressing issues such as energy development, wildfire protection, and resource conflicts. The budget for wildland fire management was reduced to $654.4 million from the previous year's $678.4 million. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill allocated funds for wildland fire management to BLM and Forest Service. The National Fire Plan focuses on reducing hazardous fuels. The law also includes $189.0 million for DOI's wildland fire management to repay amounts transferred for firefighting in FY2002. The conferees disagreed with using 70% of hazardous fuels funds in the wildland urban interface. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill allocated funds for wildland fire management to BLM and Forest Service, with $220.0 million for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT) and $33.5 million for Land Acquisition, a 33% reduction from FY2002. The program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions and aims to emphasize alternatives to fee title land purchases. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill allocated funds for wildland fire management to BLM and Forest Service, with $220.0 million for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT) and $33.5 million for Land Acquisition, emphasizing alternatives to fee title land purchases such as land exchanges and conservation easements. For more information, visit the Bureau of Land Management's website. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $1.25 billion in annual appropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), with the Senate passing $1.21 billion and the House-passed version at $1.40 billion. The Administration had requested $1.28 billion for FWS, a slight increase over FY2002. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $917.4 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service, with the Senate proposing $902.7 million and the House approving $918.4 million. Funding for the Endangered Species program saw an increase to $132.6 million, with the Senate and House differing slightly in their proposed amounts. The President's request includes a decrease in funding for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund from $96.2 million to $91.0 million. The Landowner Incentive Program would increase to $50 million, while Stewardship Grants would remain at $10 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations was critical of these programs, providing only sufficient funds for evaluation and distribution of previously appropriated funds. Overall, FY2003 enacted funding for the Endangered Species program and related programs would decrease by $58.4 million (21.5%) from FY2002. The Senate, President, and House had varying approved funding changes. The FY2003 law addresses a dispute over the management of the Missouri River and urges parties to reach an agreement on a flow schedule in 2003. The controversy surrounding two proposals by the Corps of Engineers is not addressed in the language. The FWS stated that two proposals by the Corps of Engineers to modify the flow regime of the Missouri River would harm listed species. One proposal involves moving chicks and nests to a captive rearing facility, while the other would flood suitable habitat continuously during the nesting season. Environmental groups have indicated their intention to sue the Corps under the Endangered Species Act for past harm to listed species. The nation will celebrate the centennial of the first National Wildlife Refuge on Pelican Island in Florida in 2003. Proposed increases for the National Wildlife Refuge System in FY2003 were 17.7% by the Administration, House, and Senate, with a 15.9% increase enacted. Funding for operations and maintenance saw a 25.8% increase, while infrastructure improvements were recommended at $52.0 million, though not specified in the appropriations law. Interest in energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is high, with proposed increases in funding for its management. The House Committee on Appropriations suggested an increase from $2.19 million to $2.38 million, although specific earmarks for refuge management are not typical in appropriations bills. The Senate Committee report did not provide any earmarks for ANWR or other refuges. The conference committee maintained the House allocation but removed a restriction within the BLM budget. The conference agreement removed a restriction within the BLM budget regarding potential development in ANWR. The FY2003 Budget Justification addresses the impact of terrorist attacks on FWS law enforcement, leading to increased security at refuge facilities. Refuge officers are being sent on temporary assignments to support national security efforts. The Department of the Interior's national security efforts focus on protecting employees, visitors, and facilities, including wildlife refuges along U.S. coasts. The President proposed $49.9 million for Law Enforcement and $2.0 million for infrastructure improvement in FY2003. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands within the NWRS, supported by receipts from various activities but not fully funded. The Administration requested $14.4 million for FY2003, approved in the appropriations law, covering 55% of authorized full payment. Land Acquisition proposed $70.4 million for FY2003, a decrease from FY2002, with $73.4 million provided in the appropriations law. 76.1% allocated to specified refuges. Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) generates constituent interest despite its small size, benefiting Asian species. The President's budget proposed moving funding for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund into the Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) for FY2003. Congress rejected the proposal and appropriated $3.0 million for the Migratory Bird program, increasing funding for all subprograms. Older portions of the MSCF received level funding while the NMBCF portion was reduced by 67%. The FY2003 request of $1 million for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund was proposed to be transferred to the Multinational Species Conservation Fund in the President's budget, but Congress rejected the proposal. For more information on the Fish and Wildlife Service, visit http://www.fws.gov/. The National Park Service (NPS) manages a park system with 388 units covering 84 million acres, including various designations. They protect natural and historic areas, provide funding to national heritage areas, and had 276 million visitors in 2002. The FY2003 budget for NPS is $2.25 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2003 budget for the National Park Service is $2.36 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The President aims to eliminate the maintenance backlog, enhance security, and involve more non-government groups in park support. The Senate approved $2.29 billion, while the House approved $2.40 billion. The park operations budget covers resource protection, visitor services, facility maintenance, and park support programs, with $1.57 billion allocated for FY2003. The environmental coalition and park support groups sought a $280 million increase in the NPS budget for science, resource protection, and education programs, as well as park infrastructure repair. The Senate agreed to continue efforts to increase NPS funding and eliminate deferred maintenance backlog by FY2007, but the bill was not enacted into law. The President's request included funds for a Cooperative Conservation Initiative (CCI) which was rejected by the Senate. The Senate rejected the proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative (CCI) due to existing unmet needs. Congress did not fund the Initiative, but $5 million was retained for the NPS Challenge Cost Share Program in FY2003. Construction and Maintenance funds were decreased to $322.4 million in FY2003 from $387.7 million in FY2002. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $327.8 million for construction, $5.4 million above the President's request but $59.8 million below FY2002. The Administration requested $529.4 million for facility operation and maintenance, but the law only provided $522.8 million. The total requested for construction and maintenance was $851.8 million, a decrease from FY2002. The FY2003 law allocated $850.7 million, $16.2 million below FY2002. The FY2003 budget allocated $78.4 million for the United States Park Police, meeting the Administration's request. President Bush aimed to eliminate NPS deferred maintenance within five years through new appropriations and recreation fees, but critics found the funding insufficient. The estimated deferred maintenance range for the NPS is $4.1 billion to $6.8 billion. The FY2003 budget allocated $78.4 million for the United States Park Police, meeting the Administration's request. This is an increase of $13.1 million from the initial FY2002 appropriation but a decrease of $12.1 million from the total FY2002 appropriation. Additionally, $25.3 million was received in emergency appropriations for increased security after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The budget emphasized anti-terrorism protection at national icon sites. The National Recreation and Preservation line item funds park recreation and resource protection programs, with a request of $46.8 million, a decrease from the previous year. In FY2003, there were reductions in funding for the heritage partnerships program and statutory and contractual aid. The Administration did not request funds for the UPARR program, except for $300,000 for grant administration. Congress provided $300,000 for program administrative expenses in the FY2003 law. In FY2003, Congress provided $300,000 for program administrative expenses but no funding for new grants. For NPS Land Acquisition and State Assistance, $172.5 million was allocated, with $74.5 million for federal land acquisition and $98.0 million for state land acquisition assistance, a reduction from previous years. The federal program acquires lands for the National Park System, while the state assistance program aids in park land acquisition for states. The Administration requested $86.1 million for federal land acquisition and $200 million for LWCF state assistance. The request for Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state assistance in FY2003 was $200 million, with $50 million for grants under the Cooperative Conservation Initiative and $150 million for traditional LWCF state grants. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program allows federal land management agencies to retain and spend entrance and user fees, with at least half of the receipts used for deferred maintenance. The program started in FY1996 and was extended through FY2004. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, which started in FY1996 and was extended through FY2004, aimed to make the program permanent and remove it from the appropriations process. Several bills in the 107th Congress proposed fee program permanence, but none were enacted. Citizens have objected to paying fees for previously free or low-cost recreation in national forests. The Everglades Restoration initiative, including the controversial Modified Water Delivery Project, seeks to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park and restore natural hydrological conditions. The controversy arises from the acquisition of land within the 8.5 Square Mile Area for flood protection as part of the Everglades Restoration initiative. The U.S Army Corps of Engineers has the authority to acquire land from unwilling sellers through condemnation. The FY2003 law authorizes the Corps to implement a flood protection plan with conditions for land acquisition. The U.S Army Corps of Engineers has three conditions for acquiring necessary lands for Alternative 6D in the 8.5 Square Mile Area. Owners must be offered comparable property with flood protection, land can be acquired from willing sellers with financial assistance, and funds from the Everglades National Park Protection Act and DOI can be used. Failure to acquire the land would impact the Modified Water Delivery Project and parts of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The implementation of the Modified Water Delivery Project and parts of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, including Alternative 6D, is facing challenges in Congress. Authorization for Alternative 6D was removed from the House version of the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill, but the Senate passed an omnibus bill allowing the Corps to implement flood protection under Alternative 6D for the 8.5 Square Mile Area. For more details, refer to CRS Report RS21331(pdf), Everglades. The Historic Preservation fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act, including protection and restoration of cultural resources. For more information on funding for Everglades restoration and the Modified Water Delivery Project, refer to CRS Report RS21331(pdf) and \"Everglades Restoration\" under cross-cutting issues. Visit the National Park Service website for further information. The Historic Preservation Fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. Funding is typically on a 60% federal- 40% state matching share basis, with additional funding for cultural heritage projects for Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The FY2003 budget allocated $69.0 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, with grants-in-aid to states and territories at $34.0 million. This was an increase from the FY2002 appropriation but a decrease from previous levels. The FY2003 budget allocated $69.0 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, a decrease of $5.5 million from FY2002. Save America's Treasures grants are given to preserve significant artifacts and structures. The appropriation has been used for various restoration projects across the U.S. The FY2003 budget allocated $69.0 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, a decrease of $5.5 million from FY2002. Save America's Treasures grants fund the repair and restoration of significant historical sites, including the Sewall-Belmont House, National Women's Party headquarters, and the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution at the National Archives. Projects require a 50% cost share and no single project can receive more than one grant. The FY2001 Interior appropriations law required project recommendations to be approved by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations before funds are distributed. Funds from P.L. 104-333 were earmarked for preservation projects at HBCU campuses, with grants awarded for repairs on buildings listed in the National Register of Historic Places. However, funding for HBCUs under HPF was eliminated in FY2003 due to expended authorized funding. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, previously funded through HPF, no longer receives permanent federal funding. The National Trust, a private non-profit corporation chartered by Congress in 1949, aims to protect and preserve historic American sites. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a private non-profit corporation, has not received regular federal funding since FY1998. However, a one-time appropriation was provided in FY2002 for the endangered properties endowment. The Trust offers financial assistance programs including the Preservation Services Fund and the National Preservation Loan Fund to support preservation projects. In FY2002, $2.5 million was allocated to the National Trust Historic Sites Fund. The FY2003 budget recommended eliminating a one-time grant for the National Trust Historic Sites Fund, but the final appropriation provided $2.0 million for the endowment. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is mentioned in the text. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is the nation's primary science agency providing information on natural hazards, the environment, energy, minerals, water, and biological sciences. The budget for FY2003 is $925.3 million, with activities including National Mapping, Geologic Hazards, Water Resources, Biological Research, Science Support, and Facilities. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $134.1 million for the National Mapping Program, exceeding the Administration's request by $4.8 million. This funding included allocations for Cooperative Topographic Mapping, land remote sensing activities, and geographic analysis and monitoring. The committee showed interest in the development of the National Map for urban areas. The National Map is a compilation of digital and topographic maps covering the entire country, providing up-to-date information for emergency responses. The House approved $135.1 million for the National Mapping Program in FY2003, emphasizing the importance of completing and implementing the map. The Senate passed $131.1 million for the program. For Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes, FY2003 funding is $234.7 million, exceeding the Administration's request and FY2002 levels. In FY2003, funding for Hazard Assessments, Landscape and Coastal Assessments, and Resource Assessments increased slightly compared to FY2002 levels. Specific programs received funding increases, such as volcanic equipment in Shemya, Alaska and a coastal erosion study in North Carolina. Additionally, there was an increase in funding for the coastal program, with a focus on research efforts in the Gulf of Mexico. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a transfer of $4.0 million from the NPS to the USGS for a Critical Ecosystems Initiative in the Everglades, but it was not enacted. The House approved $234.7 million for FY2003 appropriations, with increases for various programs including the National Coastal Program and research on global dust events. The Senate approved $234.9 million, restoring some program reductions assumed in the budget request. (For more details, see Congressional Record, January 15, 2003, S574). The FY2003 enacted level for Water Resources and Investigations was $208.5 million, exceeding the Administration's request. Funding for the Toxic Substances Hydrology Program and National Water Quality Assessment Program was increased above the President's request. The request also aimed to discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes, but funding was maintained at the FY2002 level of $6.0 million. The FY2003 Appropriations for Water Resources Research Institutes remained at $6.0 million. The National Stream Flow Information program kept its funding at $14.3 million, while Hydrologic Research and Development increased to $15.5 million. Additional funding included $1 million for the Long-term Estuary Assistance Program and $0.5 million for the Interstate Commission for the Potomac River Basin. The Rathdrum Prairie/Spokane Valley aquifer study was not funded, with potential consideration for the following year. The House approved $209.7 million for Water Resources and Investigations in FY2003. In FY2003, the Senate allocated $206.6 million for water resources investigations, exceeding the request by $28.8 million. Funding was restored for various programs including the National Water Quality Assessment Program. Biological Research received $170.9 million, $10.4 million more than requested, with $133.0 million allocated for Biological Research and Monitoring. In FY2003, $22.9 million was appropriated for biological information management and delivery. Concerns were raised about the National Biological Information Infrastructure program (NBII) for lack of direction and budget accountability. The USGS was directed to create a plan prioritizing a vision for the NBII, listing accomplishments for each \"node,\" and explaining how they support USGS Science Centers and DOI land management agencies. The plan is expected by April 30, 2003. The conference managers expect pertinent committees to receive the plan by April 30, 2003. For FY2003, the House approved $170.4 million for Biological Research, $9.9 million more than the request and $4.0 million over FY2002. The Senate approved $166.9 million, $6.4 million above the request and $0.5 million over FY2002. Science Support Funding for FY2003 was $85.7 million, $0.4 million below the Administration's request and $0.5 million below the FY2002 level. For Science Support in FY2003, $87.4 million was allocated, exceeding the request by $1.3 million and FY2002 by $1.1 million. Facilities funding totaled $91.4 million, surpassing the request by $2.4 million and FY2002 by $1.9 million. The House approved $91.2 million for Facilities, while the Senate passed $89.4 million. Conference managers emphasized support for USGS partnerships. The Minerals Management Service oversees leasing and production of offshore minerals, collecting billions in revenues from federal leases. Revenues are distributed to states where they were collected. Collaboration and partnerships are emphasized in USGS funding. The Minerals Management Service oversees leasing and production of offshore minerals, collecting billions in revenues from federal leases. Revenues are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $171.4 million for MMS, including funds for oil spill research and Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. The Administration's proposed budget for MMS for FY2003 was $270.6 million, including allocations for various programs. The FY2003 budget for the Minerals Management Service (MMS) includes $170.3 million from appropriations and $100.2 million from offsetting collections. The total budget is 4% higher than FY2002, with a decrease in offsetting collections. The Senate and House approved budgets slightly higher than $270 million for MMS, with revised mineral leasing revenue estimates down by 40% from FY2002. The FY2002 budget request estimated mineral leasing revenues at $7.9 billion for FY2002 and $7.3 billion for FY2003, but current revenue estimates are $5.1 billion and $4.2 billion respectively. Price fluctuations, especially in oil and natural gas, significantly impact revenue swings. Royalties from natural gas production have accounted for 40%-45% of MMS receipts over the past decade. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit a 5-year leasing program specifying time, location, and details. The Secretary of the Interior implemented a 5-year leasing program (2002-2007) for oil and natural gas lease sales, with 20 sales planned in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. Controversy surrounds sales in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico due to differing opinions on resource potential and environmental risks. A moratorium continues in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico outside Lease Sale 181. Congressional interest was drawn to a breach-of-contract lawsuit involving nine oil companies in offshore California. The MMS faced congressional scrutiny due to a breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for undeveloped leases. The companies alleged that MMS did not conduct required consistency determinations under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. In 1999, MMS extended 36 out of 40 leases by granting suspensions, but the Ninth Circuit Court later overturned these suspensions for lack of consistency with California's coastal zone management plan. The Bush Administration appealed this decision in 2002, proposing a more limited lease development plan involving 20 leases using existing platforms. The Bush Administration appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which upheld the earlier decision. The Department of the Interior has 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court. Leases are in effect pending the appeal, with a provision in the FY2003 appropriations law barring funding for exploration and development of the contested leases. The House approved legislative language to prohibit funding for new drilling in the area, and the Senate agreed to a Sense of the Senate amendment to bar funding as well. The Senate approved a Sense of the Senate amendment to bar funding for exploration and development of contested leases, including a bill that sought to compensate companies for surrendering undeveloped leases off California's coast. The Administration also announced plans to buy back oil and gas leases in various areas, including off Pensacola, Florida. The announcement included oil and gas lease buybacks in national parks, requiring approval by Congress. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ensures coal-mined land is restored. Abandoned Mine Lands fund reclaims hazardous sites. States and tribes develop regulatory programs based on minimum standards. OSM is mandated to oversee this process. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement oversees state regulatory programs and directs reclamation in states without approved programs. Funding for OSM decreased in FY2003, with the Senate-passed total of $297.1 million enacted. The budget includes Regulation and Technology programs and Abandoned Mine Lands funding. The Administration requested $105.4 million for Regulation and Technology, an increase of $2.3 million from FY2002. In FY2003, the Administration requested $10 million for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative (ACSI) and $1.5 million for the Small Operators Assistance Program (SOAP). For the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Fund, the Administration sought $174.0 million, a reduction of $29.4 million from the previous year. Congress enacted $105.4 million for Regulation and Technology and $191.7 million for AML in FY2003. The House approved $184.7 million for AML, $10.7 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate Committee recommended $191.7 million for Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) in FY2003, restoring the $17 million cut by the Administration for State and Tribal AML grants. The Committee also approved $17.5 million for grants and $210,000 for federal high priority reclamation projects. The omnibus appropriations legislation enacted these levels for FY2003. The AML program funding for minimum program states has been a point of contention, with Congress appropriating $1.5 million since FY1996 despite states' objections. Several states have been advocating for increased AML appropriations, with an unappropriated balance of roughly $1.65 billion expected by the end of FY2003.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, social programs, education, and economic development. BIA's FY2002 direct appropriations were $2.22 billion, with a proposed increase to $2.25 billion for FY2003. Congress ultimately enacted approximately $2.27 billion for FY2003, representing a 1.2% increase over the request and 2.7% over FY2002. The enacted amount for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) for FY2003 was $2.27 billion, which was a 1.2% increase over the FY2003 request and a 2.7% increase over the FY2002 appropriation. The Administration requested a total BIA-wide increase of $34.8 million for trust management improvement, but the FY2003 appropriations law reduced it to $31.9 million. Additionally, the Administration proposed an additional $0.05 million for the BIA office handling petitions for federal recognition of tribes. The Administration proposed a $0.05 million increase for the BIA office handling tribal recognition petitions. The House approved a $0.55 million increase, while the Senate agreed with the Administration's request. Congress enacted a $1.6 million budget for FY2003. Additionally, a provision for a study commission on Native American policy was dropped by the House, and a Senate floor amendment for a moratorium on BAR tribal recognition approvals was tabled. The Senate added a new title for an Indian land claim settlement in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill. Key issues for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in FY2002-FY2003 include proposed reorganization of trust asset management functions, greater tribal influence on programs and expenditures, and problems in the BIA school system. Reorganization proposals stem from trust funds and assets management issues. BIA historically managed trust funds and assets, including lands and economic resources. Trust asset management involves real estate services, transactions processing, surveys, appraisals, probate functions, and land title records activities. The Bureau of Indian Affairs historically mismanaged Indian trust funds and assets, leading to legislative reform in 1994 and a court case in 1996. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians was created to oversee trust management reform. Trust fund management was transferred to the OST in 1996, while the BIA still manages trust assets. The Secretary of the Interior Norton created offices to improve trust management, including historical accounting, reducing backlogs, and maintaining trust asset systems. The current project aims to improve the trust asset management system following criticism from tribal, congressional, and court sources. A consultant recommended a single executive to oversee trust reform, leading to the proposal to create a new Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management (BITAM) in 2001. The Appropriations Committees did not approve the reprogramming request for the BITAM reorganization in FY2002. Instead, they directed the Secretary to consult with Indian tribes, leading to opposition from many tribes and tribal organizations. The proposed FY2003 budget did not include the BITAM reorganization proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee forbade the implementation of the BITAM proposal in June 2002. Tribal members of the Trust Reform Task Force could not agree with the Department on trust standards and oversight in the fall of 2002. In December 2002, the BIA announced a proposed reorganization of trust management structures, splitting off trust operations at regional and agency levels. The OST will have trust officers overseeing trust management and providing information to Indian trust beneficiaries. Despite tribal criticism, the reorganization will proceed. Tribal control over federal Indian programs has been a goal since the 1970s, with policies including tribal contracting under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act. In FY2002, Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) accounted for 42% of BIA's operation of Indian programs, giving tribes more influence in budget planning. Contract support costs fund non-operational and overhead expenses under the Indian Self-determination Act. The BIA funds non-operational and overhead costs for tribes administering programs under self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. Contract support costs are calculated using a negotiated tribal cost rate. The BIA estimates that appropriations for contract support costs will meet 92% of tribal need in FY2003. Additionally, the BIA funds 185 elementary and secondary schools educating about 48,000 students in 23 states. The BIA funds 185 elementary and secondary schools educating about 48,000 students in 23 states. BIA schools face challenges with low student achievement and inadequate facilities. The Administration proposes a \"School Privatization Initiative\" to improve academic performance by transitioning BIA-operated schools to tribal or private operation by FY2007. Some tribes are concerned about funding and resource issues under this proposal. The Senate and House Committees opposed the proposed privatization initiative for BIA schools due to inadequate resources and safety concerns. The BIA estimated a $942 million backlog in education facility repairs in 2001. Funding for the initiative was not included in the FY2003 appropriations law. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established in 1988 to oversee tribal gaming operations. Its budget primarily comes from fees assessed on tribes' Class II operations. In the 1990s, as Indian gaming expanded, Congress increased the NIGC's budget through the FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act. The FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act increased NIGC fees to $8 million, expanded oversight to Class III operations, and raised NIGC's appropriations to $2 million due to increased demand from California Indian gaming expansion. Funding for NIGC activities from FY1999-FY2002 came solely from fees, but in FY2003, the Administration proposed $2 million in appropriations in addition to $8 million in fee receipts. The House approved the proposal, but the Senate did not make any appropriations for FY2003. The Senate did not make any FY2003 appropriations for the NIGC, but the appropriations law increased the NIGC's fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and funds. In 1996, trust fund management was transferred from the BIA to the OST due to inadequate management. The FY2002 funding for the Office of Special Trustee was $110.2 million, including funds for trust systems improvements and the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The Administration proposed a FY2003 budget of $159.0 million for the OST. The Administration proposed a FY2003 budget of $159.0 million for the OST, an increase of 44% over FY2002. The Senate approved an increase to $162.0 million, including funds for federal trust programs and the Indian land consolidation project. The House approved $149.3 million for FY2003, with cuts to trust programs but approval for land consolidation. Congress enacted the House figures for FY2003. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds owned by about 290 tribes. The trust funds controversy involves tribal funds owned by about 290 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The total asset value is approximately $3.1 billion for tribal funds and $400 million for IIM accounts. The controversy includes a class action lawsuit filed in 1996 by IIM account holders against the federal government for historical accounting of funds owed to plaintiffs. The FY2001 Interior appropriations conference report and FY2002 House and conference reports directed DOI to develop a sampling methodology for IIM accounting. DOI was required to submit a plan with a cost-benefit analysis to Congress before implementing historical accounting. Plaintiffs in a lawsuit estimated they are owed about $137 billion using a different methodology based on federal and state leasing returns. Recently, the district court held the Secretary of the Interior and Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs in contempt for ongoing trust management reform issues. The court did not appoint a receiver for IIM accounts management reform but directed both parties to submit plans by January 6, 2003. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to the FY2003 Interior appropriations act related to historical accounting and trust reform implementation. The 1994 act authorized the Interior Secretary to assist employees with legal costs for the IIM suit. The House approved all provisions except for the time limit on historical accounting. The Senate did not agree to any provisions, but the FY2003 appropriations law included those approved by the House. The Office of Insular Affairs provides financial assistance to territories and former insular areas, manages relations with the federal government, and builds local government capacity. Funding for the OIA includes permanent appropriations and discretionary funding. For more information, visit http://www.ost.doi.gov/. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) budget for FY2003 was $349.6 million, with permanent appropriations historically making up 70-80% of the budget. This includes $146.4 million for three freely associated states and $106.0 million for other purposes. The FY2003 OIA budget was $349.6 million, with $106.0 million allocated to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam for tax collections. The discretionary portion was initially proposed to be reduced to $91.0 million but ended up at $97.2 million, with $76.2 million for Assistance to Territories and $21.0 million for Compact of Free Association assistance. Congress has not debated much on funding for territories and the OIA in recent years. In recent years, Congress has monitored economic development and fiscal management in insular areas. The Forest Service budget for FY2003 is $3.98 billion, $153.7 million less than FY2002. The appropriations are slightly higher than the request and Senate provided. For more information, visit the Department of Agriculture's website at http://www.usda.gov/. Fire funding and protection programs were a major point of contention during the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill discussions. The Senate did not pass the bill due to disputes over funding levels and locations for fire protection treatments, such as thinning and prescribed burning. Questions also arose about the effectiveness of logging and access roads in fire control. Environmental analysis and public involvement were also key issues. The FY2003 funding debate focused on wildfires and the National Fire Plan, which aimed to address fire control and protection. The severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002 led to debates on fuel reduction activities and funding for wildfire operations. Congress largely supported the National Fire Plan, allocating additional funds for wildfire operations, fuel reduction, and burned areas. The FY2001 National Fire Plan received $2.89 billion in appropriations, with increases for wildfire operations, fuel reduction, and restoration. In FY2002, funding decreased due to a less severe fire season. The FY2003 enacted appropriation was $2.03 billion, $204 million less than FY2002. The Bush Administration proposed $2.02 billion, but Congress allocated slightly more. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for wildland fire management was $2.03 billion, slightly more than the Senate's $2.01 billion but less than the House's $2.17 billion. The funding included $160.4 million for BLM fire suppression and $420.7 million for FS fire suppression, with decreases from previous years. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for wildland fire management was $2.03 billion, slightly more than the Senate's $2.01 billion but less than the House's $2.17 billion. The funding included $160.4 million for BLM fire suppression and $420.7 million for FS fire suppression, with decreases from previous years. For BLM fire preparedness, the appropriation matched the President's request of $277.2 million, a slight reduction from the FY2002 level. For FS fire preparedness, the appropriation was $616.0 million, down from the FY2002 level. Other BLM fire operations received an appropriation of about $216 million, while other FS fire operations received $343.2 million. The 2002 fire season was severe, with wildfires burning 7,112,733 acres. Congress debated providing supplemental funds for FY2002 firefighting, ultimately enacting $825 million in the FY2003 appropriations law to repay borrowed funds. During the FY2003 appropriations bill debate, the House added $700 million for fire suppression in FY2002, while the Administration requested $825 million to supplement firefighting efforts. Senate considered adding the Administration's request to the bill, with a draft substitute seeking $1.25 billion, but it was not offered. Sen. Craig proposed an amendment for hazardous wildfire fuel reduction projects with less environmental and public review. The Senate debated amendments for hazardous wildfire fuel reduction projects with less environmental and public review, but no resolution was reached. Due to disagreements on wildland fire funding, the Senate discontinued debate on the Interior appropriations bill in the 107th Congress. Stewardship contracting authorization was extended through 2013 for BLM and an unlimited number of FS contracts. The authority for stewardship contracts allows agencies to trade timber for services like fuel reduction. Supporters claim it efficiently achieves non-commercial benefits, while opponents argue it may lead to more trees being cut. Congress also examined funding for other Forest Service programs, including the Economic Action Program and Pacific Northwest economic assistance. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $26.4 million for EAP. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $31.4 million for the Economic Action Program (EAP), which includes $5.0 million for EAP in the Wildfire Management account. This amount is $26.2 million (45%) lower than the FY2002 appropriations. The Administration proposed a $19.2 million (13%) cut in land acquisition, reducing it to $130.5 million. Additionally, Infrastructure Improvement funding was reduced by $10.1 million (17%) to $45.9 million in FY2003. The FY2003 appropriations law reduced funding for the Forest Stewardship Program by $16.4 million (49%) compared to FY2002. Additionally, a new Emerging Pest and Pathogens Fund was proposed for $12.0 million, but no funds were enacted for FY2003. Another proposed program, Expedited Consultations, did not receive funding in the FY2003 appropriations law. The FY2003 appropriations law reduced funding for the Forest Stewardship Program by $16.4 million (49%) compared to FY2002. The Administration proposed a $4.8 million (7%) increase in the Forest Legacy Program, but the appropriations law provided $1.0 million (1%) less than requested. The law also included legislative language on the Tongass National Forest, prohibiting administrative appeals and judicial review. Congress has approved the agency's decision to recommend no additional wilderness in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, prohibiting administrative appeals and judicial review. Some groups had advocated for more wilderness designations and restrictions on road building and timber harvesting in the Tongass.

For information on the Government Performance and Results Act for the U.S. Forest Service, see http://www.usda.gov/ocfo/strat/index.htm. The CRS reports and Department of Energy information provide details on wildfire protection legislation, forest ecosystem health, forest fire protection, roadless areas initiative, and stewardship contracting. The Department of Energy's website offers information on Fossil Energy R&D funding in FY2003. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $624.9 million for Fossil Energy R&D, a 7% increase from FY2002 and a 28% increase from the President's FY2003 request. The funding differences were mainly in fuel cells, transportation fuels, natural gas, and petroleum production technologies. The Senate approved $625.7 million, and the House approved $664.2 million for fossil energy programs. $150.0 million was provided for the Clean Coal Power Initiative, with $87 million in deferrals for the Clean Coal Technology Program in FY2003. Up to $15.0 million in prior year funds may be used for CCTP administration in FY2003. The CCPI is a cost-shared industry/government program for funding advanced research and development of new technologies for coal-fired power generators. The Administration requested $150.0 million for CCPI in FY2003 as part of a $2 billion ten-year commitment. The CCTP, a similar program, has been subject to rescissions and deferrals since the mid-1990s. The Administration sought to consolidate CCTP with coal R&D programs under Fossil Energy Research and Development, with no additional appropriations but $40.0 million in funding. The CCTP received $40.0 million in FY2003 from previously deferred budget authority to continue active projects, but it will eventually be phased out. The Senate and House agreed to $150.0 million for CCPI, with deferrals for CCTP funding. The Administration's request included cuts to R&D on natural gas and petroleum. The Senate and House approved varying amounts for natural gas and petroleum programs in FY2003, with the Administration requesting cuts to R&D funding. The Fuels program faced potential phase-out, but ultimately received funding in the FY2003 law. The Energy Technology Center received $68.9 million in appropriations, slightly higher than the Administration's request. The FY2003 law allocated $40.2 million for sequestration R&D, an increase from FY2002 but a decrease from the Administration's request. The Fossil Energy Infrastructure program received $9.1 million, with a proposed transfer to the Department of Transportation rejected. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to store over 570 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use. The Clinton Administration authorized exchanges and swaps of oil from the SPR in response to sharp oil price increases in 1999. In 2001, President Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be filled to capacity using royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil, with deliveries starting in 2002. The fill rate was expected to average 55,000 barrels per day until the end of FY2003. The FY2003 appropriation law allocated $180.9 million for the SPR, including funds for facilities, operation, and management, as well as transportation of RIK oil. The FY2003 budget request for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was $187.7 million, with allocations for storage facilities development, operations management, transportation of RIK oil, and the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR). The NHOR, established by the Clinton Administration, houses 2 million barrels of home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut and New Jersey. The Senate and House approved funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) in FY2003. The Senate allocated $185.9 million, while the House approved $190.9 million, with additional funds for management. The Senate also granted permanent authorization to the SPR. The Senate approved $185.9 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY2003, granting permanent authorization to fill it to capacity. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the oil field at Elk Hills, CA. The Naval Petroleum Reserves program transferred most of two Naval Oil Shale Reserves to the Department of the Interior, with a 9% royalty interest retained by the U.S. The program now includes two small oil fields in California and Wyoming, expected to generate $7.2 million in revenue in FY2003. The FY2003 budget request for the Naval Petroleum Reserves was $20.8 million, with a final appropriation of $17.8 million. The FY2003 appropriations bill provided $17.8 million, with a $3 million reduction from approved levels. California's dispute over Elk Hills was settled, with the Teachers' Retirement Fund receiving 9% of sale proceeds. An advance appropriation of $36.0 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund was included in the FY2003 budget request. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/reserves/npr. The FY2003 budget request for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program emphasizes the benefits of energy conservation programs for the nation. The budget proposes changes based on findings from the National Energy Policy Report and the President's Management Agenda, including terminating projects with insufficient public benefit, redirecting activities for better public benefits, and expanding programs for increased benefits. DOE plans to decrease conservation funding under DOE's Energy Efficiency Office. DOE proposed to decrease conservation funding under DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) from $912.8 million in FY2002 to $901.6 million in FY2003. The House-approved level for the DOE Energy Conservation Program in the 107th Congress would have increased funding by $71.9 million, or 8%, compared to FY2002. In the 108th Congress, the Senate-passed bill allocated $687.6 million for R&D and included a $3.0 million general reduction. The final FY2003 bill included $897.6 million for the DOE Energy Conservation Program, cutting $4.0 million compared to the Administration's request. This represented a 2% decrease from FY2002, with reductions in weatherization grants and R&D funding. In the 108th Congress, the Senate-passed bill allocated $687.6 million for R&D with a $3.0 million general reduction. The final FY2003 bill included $897.6 million for the DOE Energy Conservation Program, cutting $4.0 million compared to the Administration's request. This represented a 2% decrease from FY2002, with reductions in weatherization grants and R&D funding. Cuts include $5.0 million for weatherization grants, $18.2 million for R&D, and $4.7 million for Transportation R&D. Industry R&D falls by $10.6 million, while Power Technologies increases by $6.8 million. Buildings Research and Standards falls by $2.6 million, and Energy Star increases by $1.2 million. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.0 million in new funding for DOE program reviews by the National Academy of Sciences in the 107th Congress. The FY2003 law allocates $500,000 for decision-making on program expansion or scaling back. The House report directs EERE to allow full and open competition in procurement practices. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed EERE to revise budget request documents for FY2004. The conference report does not add any further provisions.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical and environmental health services to 1.5-1.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban programs. IHS operates 36 hospitals, 58 health centers, 4 school health centers, and 44 health stations, with additional facilities operated by tribes under contracts. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates numerous healthcare facilities under contracts, including hospitals, health centers, and youth substance abuse treatment centers. Funding for IHS is divided into services and facilities categories, with appropriations for FY2003 totaling $2.868 billion, slightly higher than the President's request and the FY2002 appropriation. The Indian Health Service (IHS) appropriations for FY2003 are $2.868 billion, with 87% allocated for health services and 13% for health facilities. IHS services are funded through congressional appropriations and reimbursements from private health insurance and federal programs. Clinical services, preventive health services, and other services are included in the service budget. The House provided $1.996 billion for FY2003, exceeding the Administration's request and the FY2002 level. The Indian Health Service (IHS) appropriations for FY2003 are $2.868 billion, with 87% allocated for health services and 13% for health facilities. Within clinical services, the enacted appropriations will support programs for hospitals, clinics, dental health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. Contract health services are also included, with Congress enacting $478.1 million for FY2003. The FY2003 appropriations law provided the requested amount for preventive health services, public health nursing, health education, and immunizations. Funding also supports the community health representatives' program. Congress allocated $402.1 million for other health-related activities, including off-reservation urban health projects. In FY2003, Congress allocated $31.5 million for off-reservation urban health projects and $2.4 million for tribal management grants. Differences between the House and Senate on scholarships for Indian health professionals were resolved with the Senate's recommendation of $31.3 million. Bonus payments for health professionals were also implemented. For IHS direct operations, Congress enacted $60.6 million, and for self-governance funding, the amount was unspecified. In FY2003, Congress allocated $31.5 million for off-reservation urban health projects, $2.4 million for tribal management grants, and $60.6 million for IHS direct operations. For self-governance funding, the Senate recommended $10.1 million while the House provided only $1.1 million, with Congress enacting $5.6 million. Contract support costs of $270.7 million were proposed by both the Senate and the House, and this amount was enacted. The Senate disagreed with the President's proposed reductions in staffing levels, travel, training, and copying costs for IHS direct operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about the Administration's proposal to transfer and consolidate IHS's Office of Legislative Affairs into the DHHS office. The Committee emphasized the need for expertise in handling Native American and Alaskan Indian health service issues and did not agree to the consolidation. DHHS consolidations or realignments of IHS programs must be approved by both Appropriations Committees. The House and Senate disagreed with the President's budget changes for IHS facilities funding in FY2003, leading to a total appropriation of $376.2 million, which was 3.8% over the President's request. They prohibited IHS funds from being used for sanitation facilities in new HUD-funded houses. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301 due to a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land. The 1974 relocation legislation resulted in lands being partitioned between the two tribes, with most relocatees being Navajo families. Many Navajo families have already relocated under the Act. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is involved in housing and land acquisition for families relocating under the 1974 legislation. Approximately 233 families, mostly Navajo, still need to complete relocation, with some refusing to move. ONHIR received $15.1 million in FY2002 and $14.5 million in FY2003 for its activities. Negotiations and litigation continue among the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, Navajo families on Hopi land, and the federal government. In 1995, the United States and the Hopi Tribe reached a proposed settlement agreement on Hopi claims, including 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved the agreement, but some Navajo families oppose the leases. 70 out of 73 Navajo families on Hopi land faced a deadline to sign the leases by March 31, 1997. According to ONHIR, 70 out of 73 Navajo families on Hopi-partitioned land signed accommodation agreements by September 1999. The Hopi Tribe is pushing for relocation enforcement against Navajo families without leases. The FY2003 appropriations law prevents ONHIR from evicting Navajo families without providing replacement homes. This provision aims to protect relocatees awaiting replacement homes. The settlement agreement allows the Hopi Tribe to take action against the United States if \"quiet possession\" of Hopi-partitioned lands is not granted after February 1, 2000. The Hopi Tribe is waiting for \"quiet possession\" of Hopi-partitioned lands from the United States, with the possibility of taking legal action if not granted. Congress debates the federal government's role in supporting arts and culture programs. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum, education, and research complex with 16 museums, the National Zoo, and research facilities. It receives 70% federal funding and also has trust funds. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $548.5 million in funding. The FY2003 appropriations law provides $548.5 million for the Smithsonian, including $449.1 million for Salaries and Expenses. The National Museum of the American Indian receives $16.0 million for construction. Initially controversial, opponents argued against building a new museum. Opponents of constructing a new museum argued against it, stating that the current Smithsonian museums needed renovation and maintenance. Proponents emphasized the need for a museum in Washington to house the Indian collection. Private donations totaling $36.7 million, including $15 million from the Indian community, covered one-third of the estimated cost. The Smithsonian indicated that $20 million in trust funds would cover opening costs for the Indian museum, with additional fundraising needed. The groundbreaking ceremony for the National Museum of the American Indian took place in September. The National Museum of the American Indian required fundraising for construction. The projected opening was in 2004, with an enacted appropriation of $83.4 million for facility repairs. The Smithsonian is responsible for over 400 buildings with 8 million square feet of space. Work had begun on the National Museum of Natural History and the Patent Office Building. Total cost estimate for renovations was $151 million. The Smithsonian Institution's buildings, including the National Museum of Natural History, American Art and Portrait Gallery, Castle building, and Arts and Industries building, make up one-third of its public space. A study by the National Academy of Public Administration found that funding for repair and renewal of facilities has not kept pace with the need, requiring over $1.5 billion for repairs and renovations over the next decade. In addition to federal appropriations, the Smithsonian also receives trust funds for program expansion. The Smithsonian receives trust funds from private sources, government grants, and contracts for program expansion. These funds include investment income and revenues from business ventures like the Smithsonian magazine, retail shops, and entertainment programs. Private donor designated funds specify the purpose of contributions, with $178.8 million received in FY2001 and a projected $80 million for FY2002. The Smithsonian received a total of $80 million in funding in FY2002. A significant contribution of $60 million was pledged by private donor Steven F. Udvar-Hazy for the National Air and Space Museum's Dulles Center. Government grants and contracts, separate from the regular appropriation, were also provided for specific projects. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a plan for tracking trust fund expenditures in FY2003. The Smithsonian has developed a plan to track trust fund budget proposals and expenditures. The Inspector General found a discrepancy in approved budgets and actual expenditures. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about controversies with benefactors' control over properties and exhibits, including the renaming of the Air and Space Theater. The Committee recommended reopening negotiations and reviewing benefactor agreements. Additionally, they requested a review of compensation practices for Smithsonian leadership. The Smithsonian faced controversies regarding the proposed closure of research centers in Virginia, but reversed its decision after objections. An independent Science Commission was established to review the situation. Concerns about the institution's research priorities remain. The FY2002 appropriations law included funding for anti-terrorism measures. For more information, visit the Smithsonian's website. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including the NEA and NEH, operate under temporary authority since 1993. The Institute of Museum and Library Services was established by the 104th Congress with a $116.5 million appropriation for NEA in FY2003. For more information, visit the Smithsonian's website. The FY2003 appropriation for NEA is $116.5 million, including $17 million for the Challenge America Arts Fund. The House approved $126.5 million for NEA, with a floor amendment to increase funding by $10 million. NEA's direct grant program supports approximately 1,600 grants, with over 40% going to state arts agencies. The NEA administers the Challenge America Arts Fund, providing matching grants for arts education and community arts activities in rural areas. The NEH received a $125.8 million appropriation in FY2003, supporting grants for humanities education, research, and preservation, as well as regional humanities centers and state humanities councils. The NEH also offers a Challenge Grant program to encourage private donations for humanities projects. The Office of Museum Services (OMS) supports a Challenge Grant program to stimulate private donations for humanities institutions. In FY2003, the appropriation for OMS moved to the Labor-HHS-Ed appropriations bill to streamline funding and reduce duplicative review. The FY2003 appropriation for IMLS is $245.5 million for libraries and museums, including earmarks for museums and libraries, and $10.0 million for educating librarians for the 21st century initiative. The Office of Museum Services (OMS) receives approximately $30 million for grants to museums, including leadership grants, museum conservation, and General Operating Support (GOS). Congress debates the federal role in funding arts and humanities, with some arguing for abolishing NEA and NEH, while others believe culture can thrive with private support. Proponents highlight the federal government's historical support for culture since 1817. The federal government has a long tradition of supporting culture since 1817, with debates on funding for arts and humanities. Some argue that private sector cannot fill the gap left by federal funds, while others believe in the national significance of programs like national touring theater and museum exhibitions. Former President Clinton recommended increased funding for NEA and NEH, while controversies over past NEA grants continue to resurface. The debate over congressional support for the NEA revolves around past questionable grants for potentially obscene artwork. Despite attempts to address these issues through statutory provisions, no NEA projects have been deemed obscene by the courts. In 1996, a federal appeals court ruled that applying \"general standards of decency\" to NEA grants was unconstitutional. However, in response to congressional concerns, NEA stopped giving grants to individuals by arts discipline. In 1998, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court decision, allowing the NEA to consider decency standards when evaluating grant applications. Congress enacted NEA reform measures in past appropriations laws, increasing funding allocations to states and under served populations. A 15% cap was placed on NEA funds allocated to each state, with exemptions for grants with a national impact. Members of the House and Senate were added to the National Council on the Arts, giving NEA and NEH specific authority to solicit and invest funds. Funding priorities and restrictions on grants were retained in the FY2003 final appropriation. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) implemented reforms in past appropriations laws, increasing funding to states and underserved populations. Funding priorities and restrictions on grants were maintained in the FY2003 final appropriation, including limitations on grants for seasonal support and individuals, except for specific fellowships. NEA grants and administration totals include the Challenge America program. The Office of Museum Services is now part of the IMLS appropriations bill. For more information on NEA, NEH, and IMLS, visit their respective websites. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is utilized by the four main land management agencies to acquire lands. It also funds state and local government projects through a grant program. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually, but actual funding is through annual appropriations. Federal acquisitions are earmarked to specific units, while state grants are rarely earmarked. Total funding available through FY2002 could have been higher. The LWCF program has seen increasing appropriations for land acquisition until FY2003, with a total of $12.5 billion appropriated out of a possible $25.4 billion. However, the FY2003 appropriation was lower than previous years. Table 15 shows LWCF funding from FY2000 to FY2003, with varying levels of appropriations each year. In recent years, Congress has appropriated LWCF funds for purposes other than land acquisition and stateside grants, with varying amounts allocated each year. This includes funding for a Cooperative Conservation Initiative and the Shivaist Indian Water Settlement Act of 1999. Congress may continue to decrease LWCF appropriations, as seen in the early and mid-1990s. In the early and mid-1990s, Congress may continue to lower LWCF appropriations to address the federal budget deficit. The FY2003 appropriation request of $532 million was significantly less than previous years, with the enacted amount of $414 million being the lowest in recent years. The FY2003 enacted total for the Land and Water Conservation Fund is significantly less than previous years, with reductions in funding for various accounts. One example is a $15 million earmark for land acquisition in Florida, lower than the $20 million initially requested. Additionally, funds from the LWCF are allocated to programs such as the FWS's Landowner Incentive Program, Stewardship Grants Program, and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. In FY2003, the Bush Administration requested $200 million for the state grant program portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative aimed to promote conservation through partnerships with BLM, NPS, and FWS funds. Congress did not fund the Initiative, but expressed interest in leveraging federal funds for conservation opportunities. The Conservation Spending Category (CSC) was created in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law to combine funding for various resource protection programs, including the LWCF. The FY2001 law allocated $1.21 billion for FY2001, a significant increase from the previous year. This was in response to the Clinton Administration's request for more funding for conservation programs and congressional interest in increasing conservation spending. The FY2001 law authorized total spending under the Conservation Spending Category to increase annually from $1.6 billion in FY2001 to $2.4 billion in FY2006. The Bush Administration requested $1.26 billion for these programs in FY2002, and Congress appropriated $1.30 billion. In FY2003, the House estimated a request of $1.32 billion, with the House-passed bill providing $1.44 billion. The CSC was not used due to the expiration of the Budget Act. The Conservation Spending Category (CSC) is not being used due to the expiration of the Budget Act. Total funding for FY2003 meets the projected aggregate total for the CSC. Programs previously funded under the CSC are continued in FY2003. No funds in the act are derived from the CSC. The Everglades Restoration plan was authorized by Congress in 1996 to address environmental deterioration caused by human alterations to the natural flow of water in South Florida. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The federal government, in collaboration with state, local, and tribal entities, is working on restoring the South Florida ecosystem through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). CERP aims to redirect excess freshwater to restore the natural hydrological functions without affecting water needs of agricultural and urban areas. The federal government covers half of the $7.8 billion cost of implementing CERP, with the State of Florida and other stakeholders sharing the remaining cost. The federal government has allocated approximately $3.9 billion for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem under CERP and other laws. From FY1993 to FY2003, federal appropriations for projects related to the restoration have exceeded $1.9 billion, with state funding surpassing $3.6 billion. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in Southern Florida over the next 10 years is expected to be significant. The federal government is expected to spend approximately $286 million per year for restoration activities in Southern Florida over the next 10 years. In FY2003, the administration requested $260 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, with $46 million allocated for the implementation of CERP. Over $180 million has been appropriated for restoration activities in the Everglades. Appropriations for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem have been included in various annual appropriations laws, with funds provided to DOI agencies for projects conducted in Southern Florida. In FY2003, the DOI requested $96.1 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, with allocations for NPS, FWS, USGS, and BIA. NPS requested $70.4 million for land acquisition and research, FWS requested $13.2 million for refuges and ecological services, USGS requested $12.1 million for research, and BIA requested $0.4 million for water projects on tribal lands. Other restoration projects in the region have received appropriations from various agencies. In FY2003, the DOI requested $96.1 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, with allocations for NPS, FWS, USGS, and BIA. NPS requested $70.4 million for land acquisition and research, FWS requested $13.2 million for refuges and ecological services, USGS requested $12.1 million for research, and BIA requested $0.4 million for water projects on tribal lands. Other restoration projects in the region have received appropriations from various agencies. Appropriations for Everglades Restoration in the DOI Budget (FY2002-FY2003) are detailed in Table 16. In FY2003, the DOI received $30 million less for restoration activities in the Everglades compared to FY2002. Reductions in funding were seen for the Modified Waters Delivery Project and land acquisitions by the FWS. The FY2003 law provided $1.8 million for land purchase near the Pelican Island NWR and $0.8 million for land purchase near the Key Deer. In FY2003, funding for Everglades restoration activities was reduced by $30 million compared to FY2002. The appropriations law allocated $1.8 million for land purchase near Pelican Island NWR and $0.8 million for land purchase near Key Deer NWS. Other programs related to Everglades restoration were funded at requested levels, including the Critical Ecosystem Initiative, ecological services, and surveys by USGS. The appropriations law also authorized the implementation of a flood control plan as part of the Modified Water Delivery Project. The House and Senate provided similar funding levels for restoration activities in Southern Florida, with some exceptions. The Senate allocated $3.3 million less than the House for FWS land acquisitions. Specifically, the Senate passed $1 million for J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Reserve and $1.5 million for National Key Deer Refuge, while the House passed $3 million and $1.5 million respectively. The FWS aims to acquire these lands for restoration activities in CERP. The House provided $0.3 million for water quality studies on Seminole Indian Reservation for BIA. There is limited information on appropriations for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem in both bills. The FWS, USGS, and BIA are involved in restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, funded through appropriations bills. USGS is collecting data and conducting studies to benefit restoration activities, including water resources investigations and biological research. More information can be found on the websites of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program and the Corps of Engineers. The Everglades restoration efforts are detailed in various CRS reports, including those on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Conservation and Reinvestment Act, Endangered Species, and Federal Indian Law. These reports provide background information and legislative issues related to these topics. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various environmental and conservation issues, including compensation to local governments, historic preservation, land and water conservation, legal issues related to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, mining on federal lands, multinational species conservation fund, national monument issues, national park management, and PILT payments. The curr_chunk lists various CRS reports on environmental and conservation issues, including PILT payments, federal land management, and resource management. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on environmental and conservation issues, including federal land ownership, public lands, clean coal technology, energy efficiency, forest ecosystem health, and forest fire protection. The curr_chunk lists CRS reports on various topics such as forest service performance measures, national forest roadless areas, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It also provides links to information on budget, departments, agencies, and programs related to appropriations. The curr_chunk provides links to various government offices and departments such as the General Accounting Office, Office of Management and Budget, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Geological Survey. The curr_chunk lists various government departments and agencies with links, including the Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Department of Energy, Fossil Energy, Indian Health Service, and John F.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and other cultural institutions. It also includes appropriations data for the Department of the Interior and related agencies. The curr_chunk provides appropriations details for various government agencies, including the Office of Museum Services and the Challenge America Arts Fund. It mentions adjustments for retirement accruals and across-the-board reductions in funding for firefighting efforts. The figures do not reflect certain cuts and adjustments in the appropriations law. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations for Interior and related agencies, including funds for wildland fire emergencies. It also outlines the conservation spending category established by previous laws. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of conservation funds, including programs that have not received separate funding in recent years. Funding for the Conservation Spending Category was not calculated in FY2003 according to appropriations law P.L. 108-7. The joint explanatory statement of the conference report on the enacted measure clarified that no funds in the law are from the CSC, but most programs previously funded under that category continue in FY2003. The Administration is requesting $3.0 million under the DOI Departmental Management line item for the Shivaist Indian Water Settlement Act of 1999, which authorizes LWCF funds for the Paiute Tribe in Utah. $50 million is allocated for a new Cooperative Conservation Initiative, with the remaining $150 million distributed to states for traditional land acquisition and site development activities. Additionally, $50 million was appropriated for formula grants in FY2001, and there was a $25.0 million rescission in FY2002. In FY2003, additional programs are proposed to be funded from LWCF, including FWSCooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, FWS North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, FS Forest Legacy, and FS Forest Stewardship. Funds for FS Forest Stewardship were not part of the CSC in FY2001 and FY2002, so funds in those years are not counted in the column totals. Historical Appropriations Data from FY1998 to FY2003 show appropriations for territories and insular areas consolidated within Departmental Offices account. In FY2003, the Departmental Offices account includes Insular Affairs and Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians. The Office of Museum Services is now part of the IMLS appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor-HHS-Education. Funding for Challenge America Arts Fund is included in the National Endowment for the Arts total. Figures do not reflect a 0.65% cut in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations law. $825.0 million is allocated for wildland fire emergencies, with $189.0 million for BLM and $636.0 million for the Forest Service."
