    "title": "SB 33",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California acknowledges federal laws requiring Medicaid programs to seek reimbursement from the estates of deceased beneficiaries for services received after 55 years of age. States have the option to collect for various health care services, including long-term care for individuals 55 and older. Collection from the surviving spouse of a Medi-Cal beneficiary is permitted but not required. Estate recovery under Medicaid allows states to include all assets in an individual's estate for reimbursement, with exemptions for modest-value homesteads. This practice is criticized for being unfair to low-income individuals reliant on Medi-Cal for healthcare coverage and acts as a deterrent to enrollment efforts. California's estate recovery program for Medi-Cal goes beyond federal requirements, forcing low-income individuals aged 55 and older to choose between basic health care services and passing on their limited assets to their children. This program essentially turns Medi-Cal coverage into a loan program, collecting from the estates of deceased beneficiaries with limited assets, which is seen as inequitable compared to other health care programs like Covered California and Medicare that do not have estate recovery. California aims to reform its estate recovery program for Medi-Cal by limiting collection to federal requirements, defining \"estate\" narrowly, allowing waivers for modest homesteads, and exempting surviving spouses from recovery. The California reform of its estate recovery program for Medi-Cal includes prohibiting recovery from the surviving spouse of a deceased beneficiary and ensuring beneficiaries can easily receive information about estate obligations. The department will claim against the estate of the decedent for healthcare services received or property distributed, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The California estate recovery program for Medi-Cal includes exemptions for certain circumstances, such as when the decedent was 55 years or older, or when there is a surviving spouse or child under 21 years old. The department may waive its claim if enforcing it would cause substantial hardship to other dependents or if the estate subject to recovery is a modest homestead. The department notifies individuals of waiver provision and hearing opportunity. If voluntary postdeath lien is accepted, it accrues interest at a rate based on Surplus Money Investment Fund. Department provides beneficiary with total recoverable Medi-Cal expenses upon request. A current or former beneficiary, or their authorized representative, can request a copy of their information once a year for a fee not exceeding $5. This applies to individuals aged 55 or older when they received healthcare services, or permanently institutionalized individuals. The department allows requests for information through various methods including the Internet, telephone, mail, or other electronic means. The department must provide requested information within 90 days of receiving a request. \"Decedent\" refers to a beneficiary who received healthcare and left property through distribution or survival. The definition of \"Estate\" includes all assets subject to recovery under specific laws. \"Health care services\" refer to services required for recovery. \"Homestead of modest value\" is a home with a fair market value of 50% or less of the county's average home price at the time of the decedent's death. The amendments to this section apply to individuals who die on or after January 1, 2016."
