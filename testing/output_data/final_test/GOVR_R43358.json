    "content": "Food fraud has been a longstanding issue in the food industry, involving products like olive oil, wine, spices, and tea. Various foods commonly associated with fraud include olive oil, fish, honey, dairy products, meat, grains, fruit juices, wine, organic foods, spices, coffee, and tea. The extent of food fraud globally is not fully known due to perpetrators avoiding detection. Food fraud incidents often go undetected as they do not always pose a food safety risk. The motivation for fraud is monetary gain, making any type of food susceptible to adulteration. While most incidents do not harm public health, cases like the addition of melamine to feed and milk products have caused health risks. In 2007, adulterated pet food ingredients from China led to the deaths of many pets. Reports indicate that pet food ingredients from China caused deaths in the US, followed by melamine-contaminated baby formula sickening Chinese children. Safety risks with melamine-tainted feed date back to 2003, with melamine added to increase protein content since 1982. Fish and seafood fraud is prevalent, involving mislabeling or substitution of species, potentially leading to food poisoning. Substitution of olive oil with other oils could have unintended consequences for those with food allergies. Charges of fraud were part of the federal criminal indictment against former officials of the Peanut Corporation of America for selling contaminated products during the 2009 Salmonella outbreak. This led to one of the largest product recalls in U.S. history, affecting over 3,900 products containing peanut butter and paste. Risks from other fraudulent foods may not be well-documented or immediate. Reports indicate that fraud in the food industry, such as the presence of unapproved chemicals in honey and fruit juices made from rotten fruit, may only be uncovered through independent tests or investigations following public health events. Concerns have been raised about the addition of \"clouding agents\" in highly processed foods, with potential public health risks. Food fraud cases can have serious consequences, such as the adulteration of pet food with melamine leading to deaths of animals. Some cases go undetected, causing long-term health issues. Fraud often involves substituting high-value products with cheaper alternatives, like mislabeling olive oil or salmon. In Europe, beef products were found to contain horsemeat, not reported to authorities. The horsemeat incident did not have public health consequences but raised concerns about potential risks like phenylbutazone. Food fraud costs the industry billions annually, affecting 10% of products. The true scale of food fraud is likely unknown, as adulteration for economic gain aims to go undetected. Food fraud is a significant concern for the food industry, with potential financial and public relations consequences. The prevalence of food fraud is low compared to global food spending, but fraud can result in lost sales and bankruptcies. Addressing food fraud is complicated by increased globalization of food supplies. The report discusses the challenges of tracing the source of contamination and intentional product fraud in food supply chains, especially in processed foods with ingredients from multiple suppliers. It also provides an overview of food fraud and economically motivated adulteration (EMA), highlighting the difficulties in detecting and tracing such incidents. The report discusses food fraud, including types of fraud and how it relates to food safety, defense, and quality. It also mentions databases with reported fraud cases and federal actions to address the issue. The FDA has a working definition for economically motivated adulteration. The FDA defines economically motivated adulteration as the fraudulent substitution or addition of a substance in a product for economic gain, including dilution that poses health risks. Other countries lack legal definitions of food fraud, as highlighted in a recent EU report. The EU laws lack a clear definition of food fraud, with varying requirements among member states. Food fraud in Europe is largely undetected, similar to the United States. The UK's Food Standards Agency defines food fraud as deliberate deception for financial gain, including selling unfit or misdescribed food. Researchers and industry groups have different definitions of food fraud and EMA. Food fraud is the deliberate substitution, addition, tampering, or misrepresentation of food for economic gain. It involves the fraudulent addition of non-authentic substances or removal of authentic substances without the purchaser's knowledge. Adulterants are defined as undesirable or fraudulently added materials. In food fraud, adulterants are undesirable substances added to food for economic gain. These adulterants are unconventional to avoid detection. Economically motivated adulteration includes substituting authentic ingredients with cheaper ones, dilution, flavor or color enhancement with illicit substances, and species substitution. The Grocery Manufacturers Association defines economic adulteration in consumer products as part of its report on fraud in the industry. Economic adulteration involves intentional fraudulent modification of products for economic gain through methods like unapproved enhancements, dilution, concealment of damage, mislabeling, and substitution of ingredients. This type of fraud broadly includes three categories: ingredient replacement with cheaper substitutes, addition of non-authentic substances to mask inferior quality, and intentional omission of information. Food fraud involves intentional deception in food products for economic gain, such as ingredient substitution, false claims, and non-declarations. This can include misleading information on geographic origin, species, or production processes to substitute lower-priced or lower-quality ingredients. Fraud may also occur due to shortages, tax evasion, smuggling, tampering, or stolen goods. Food fraud and food defense are intentional acts in the realm of food protection. Food fraud is economically motivated and typically involves actors within the food chain, while food defense, such as agro-terrorism, is perpetrated by outsiders like terrorists. Most incidents of food fraud are committed by those with regular access to the food product, while food defense issues are usually caused by individuals who do not have normal access to the food product. Food fraud incidents do not always harm public health, but can have unintended consequences. Problems with food safety and quality are unintentional and can lead to economic impacts, product recalls, and public health threats. Adulteration can erode consumer trust in the food supply chain and among regulators. Efforts are ongoing to compile data on food fraud and EMA incidents through databases and repositories created by the University of Minnesota and the United States Pharmacopeial Convention. This information, while not comprehensive, helps understand the scope of food fraud and aids in detection and prevention efforts. The USP databases, created in 2012 and 2013, are a valuable resource for studying food fraud incidents. While not comprehensive, they have been used by researchers and industry leaders, although their coverage of all food fraud incidents is unknown. The information in these databases is widely cited by various stakeholders. The USP Food Fraud Database, funded by the U.S. Government and private sector, is widely used by academic researchers, government officials, and the media to identify fraudulent foods. The database is self-funded and supports public health. The available databases for food fraud are the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Food Fraud Database and the National Center for Food Protection and Defense (NCFPD) EMA Incident Database. USP's database is publicly accessible, while NCFPD's is accessible upon request. These databases contain information from scholarly articles, industry analyses, lab tests, and media reports on foods vulnerable to fraudulent manipulation, with a global scope. However, they may not capture all cases of food fraud or incidents in small-scale markets or non-commercial settings. The databases for food fraud, such as the USP Food Fraud Database and NCFPD EMA Incident Database, may not capture all cases due to active fraudster evasion. Differences in compilation and focus may lead to varying rankings of food susceptibility to fraud. Dietary supplements are not covered in these databases. Fraud involving dietary supplements, like food fraud, poses public health risks and is a type of product fraud. Research is ongoing to develop a database of reported cases of dietary supplement fraud, similar to the USP Food Fraud Database for problematic food ingredients. The USP Food Fraud Database catalogs reports on detection methods and analyses of food fraud incidents, organized by food ingredient categories. It identifies the type of adulterant reported for each record and broadly classifies fraud types. The database was first published in 2012 and does not provide details on the product's origin. The USP Food Fraud Database, supported by researchers at MSU's Food Fraud Initiative, was updated in 2013 to cover records from 1980 to 2012, containing nearly 2,100 entries. The NCFPD EMA Incident Database, managed by the University of Minnesota, catalogs isolated EMA incidents and is accessible to authorized users. An \"incident\" in the database is defined as a documented occurrence of EMA in a single food product or group within a specific timeframe. The EMA Incident Database tracks food fraud incidents since 1980, with 1,054 records covering 302 incidents by mid-2012. Each incident is defined as EMA in a specific food product or group within a defined time frame and with distinct perpetrators. The database categorizes incidents by adulterant and time period. The EMA Incidents Database identifies types of adulterants in documented incidents, classifies them by type of adulteration, and provides information on the product's origin. It aims to understand the incentive behind adulteration, detect and deter future incidents, and protect the U.S. food supply from contamination. NCFPD is also developing an EMA Susceptibility database. NCFPD is developing an EMA Susceptibility Database that evaluates monographs in the USP Food Chemicals Codex for susceptibility to EMA. They are also collaborating with DHS on projects to assess critical food and agriculture infrastructure at the state level. The databases provide information on foods and ingredients associated with food fraud, but rankings may vary depending on the database and source of records. The initial version of the USP Food Fraud database, published in 2012, included \"scholarly\" and \"media\" records from 1980 through 2010. It contained 1,305 records covering 361 food ingredients based on 660 references. Leading reported types of fraud by specific ingredient were olive oil, milk, honey, saffron, orange juice, and coffee. The USP Food Fraud Database from 1980-2010 highlighted olive oil, milk, honey, saffron, orange juice, coffee, and apple juice as top reported ingredients. Oils, milk, and spices accounted for 50% of cases. The database also showed fish, honey, olive oil, chili powder, milk, black pepper, and caviar as common fraud types. Natural flavoring complexes and spices were major categories. Updates in 2013 added 792 records, bringing the total to 2,097 records. The 2013 updates to the USP Food Fraud Database added 792 records, bringing the total to 2,097. The top reported fraudulent foods included olive oil, milk, saffron, honey, coffee, tea, fish, clouding agents, and black pepper. Some products like shrimp, lemon juice, maple syrup, and clouding agents were not among the top fraudulent products. Continuing and emerging issues were highlighted in the database updates. The updated 2013 USP database reports various types of food fraud globally, including watered-down and adulterated milk in India, spice dilution, seafood fraud, and mislabeling of fish like escolar. These fraudulent practices pose public health risks and are a growing concern. The updated USP database highlights concerns about food fraud involving banned fish species like white tuna and puffer fish, as well as the fraudulent addition of plasticizers like DEHP in food products, posing public health risks. The scope of food fraud involving clouding agents covers 877 products from 315 companies, with 206 products exported to 22 countries. USP compares it to the melamine scandal and notes 300 incidents since 1980 in the NCFPD EMA Incident Database. The CRS analysis is based on 302 incidents, showing the widespread impact of the fraud. Figure 5 breaks down EMA incidents by major food ingredient category, with fish and seafood leading at 31%, followed by oils and fats at 11%, and alcoholic beverages at 8%. Figure 6 shows EMA incidents by type of adulteration, with 65% due to substitution or dilution, 13% due to unapproved additives, and other incidents including counterfeit goods and misbranding. The EMA Incident Database documents incidents of food fraud, including adulteration of products. The database provides information on where fraudulent products were produced, but it may not represent global market conditions accurately due to language limitations. Differences in fraud detection capabilities among countries and regions are also noted. The EMA Incidents Database shows that 30% of documented incidents involved products from the United States, mainly mislabeled fish. China and India accounted for 14% and 13% of incidents, respectively, while other Asian countries accounted for 5% of the total incidents. Detection of food fraud varies among countries and regions. The EMA Incidents Database shows that 30% of incidents involved products from the United States, with China and India accounting for 14% and 13% of incidents, respectively. Other Asian countries accounted for 5% of incidents. European Union countries and non-EU European countries combined accounted for 18% of incidents, while the Middle East and Africa accounted for 7%. Rankings of fraudulent foods differ between databases and time periods. The European Parliament identified the top ten products at risk of food fraud as olive oil, fish, organic foods, milk, grains, honey, maple syrup, coffee, tea, spices, wine, and certain fruit juices. Differences in rankings between reports are due to how products are categorized and ranked across all records. In the United States, food fraud and intentional adulteration of food are addressed by FDA and USDA as the main federal agencies working to protect the food supply. This is done in conjunction with enforcement of FDA and USDA laws by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as part of border inspections. FDA and USDA are the leading food safety regulatory authorities. The FDA and USDA are the main food safety regulatory authorities in the US, with complex boundaries between their jurisdictions. Other federal agencies also regulate food labeling and quality standards. The FDA and USDA are the main food safety regulatory authorities in the US, with complex boundaries between their jurisdictions. Other federal agencies, such as the AMS, NMFS, CBP, and DOJ, also play a role in food safety and fraud prevention. The DOJ has pursued food fraud cases resulting in criminal convictions, including the high-profile Peanut Corporation of America case in 2013. The USDA's National Organic Program has taken enforcement actions against companies for false labeling claims on organic foods. Advocacy groups have filed lawsuits over concerns about organic claims. NOAA has also conducted investigations and enforcement actions on seafood labeling. The federal government has funded ongoing research efforts with support from DHS, FDA, and USDA. FDA is developing tools and guidance for the food industry to address intentional adulteration as part of its food defense strategy. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted investigations into food fraud cases, issuing recommendations for improved communication, coordination, and oversight. A 2013 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) highlighted unenforced standards for extra virgin olive oil, leading to potential adulteration issues. The study found that mislabeling of \"extra virgin\" olive oil could weaken U.S. competitiveness in the domestic market. In Europe, there are debates on tougher laws to prevent food fraud, with the European Parliament calling for increased enforcement and oversight. The FDA has authority over both unintentional and intentional adulteration of domestic and imported food, ensuring food safety for about 80%-90% of all U.S. foods. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of most U.S. domestic and imported foods, except for meats and poultry. They oversee produce, dairy products, processed foods, seafood, shellfish, and some fish products. FDA also has jurisdiction over establishments that sell or serve eggs. The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of most U.S. domestic and imported foods, except for meats and poultry. They oversee produce, dairy products, processed foods, seafood, shellfish, and some fish products. FDA also inspects establishments that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods, as well as vehicles and conveyances used in interstate commerce. Their food safety authorities are primarily governed by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which mandates that foods be safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), adulterating or misbranding food in commerce is prohibited. Foods can be deemed adulterated for various reasons, such as containing harmful substances or being prepared under unsanitary conditions. Violators of the FFDCA face criminal and civil penalties. Food can be deemed adulterated under the FFDCA if it contains harmful substances, is unfit for consumption, or poses a risk to consumer health. Adulteration also includes the absence, substitution, or addition of constituents in food products. Food may be deemed adulterated under the FFDCA if it is missing valuable constituents, has substances added to increase bulk or weight, or if damage or inferiority is concealed. Misbranding food in commerce is also prohibited under FFDCA Section 403. Misbranding food in commerce is prohibited under the FFDCA, which includes false labeling, imitations, and misleading containers. Violating these provisions may result in criminal penalties or product seizures. The FFDCA also grants regulatory authority under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act for package labels of consumer goods. The FFDCA imposes penalties for prohibited acts, including imprisonment and fines. FDA can order the detention of suspected adulterated or misbranded foods. Enforcement may be limited due to resource constraints and insufficient evidence. The FFDCA Section 415 requires FDA oversight of food facility registration, including domestic and foreign facilities under the Bioterrorism Act. Facilities must register with FDA if they manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for human or animal consumption in the United States. Registration and prior notification requirements may deter food fraud. The number of registered food facilities, both domestic and foreign, doubled from 2004 to 2012. In 2012, there were nearly 450,000 registered facilities with the FDA, including 171,552 domestic facilities and 278,307 foreign facilities. The FFDCA allows FDA to establish voluntary food quality and grading standards to promote honesty and fair dealing for consumers. The FDA is authorized to establish regulations for food standards of identity, quality, and fill of containers. They have set roughly 300 identity standards for various food categories. The FDA has taken actions to address intentional adulteration, including economically motivated adulteration. The FDA established an internal workgroup in September 2011 to improve communication and information sharing among FDA product centers, ORA, and the Office of the Commissioner. The workgroup aims to address recommendations from the U.S. Government Accountability Office for enhanced transparency with stakeholders. FDA is also considering creating an information clearinghouse for stakeholders to share information on products susceptible to economic adulteration. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) aims to prevent intentional and unintentional contamination of foods by requiring food companies to implement preventive controls. These controls help ensure that adulterated products are not sold and companies must share their plans with the FDA to comply with good manufacturing practices. FSMA provisions are expected to enhance food risk protection and address issues such as the \"absence, substitution, or addition of constituents.\" Some speculate that FSMA provisions will increase detection and prevention of adulterated foods by food companies. Industry controls will help combat future adulteration before reaching the marketplace. FSMA does not directly address EMA but some provisions may apply, such as Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls. The FDA's proposed regulations under FSMA require written plans to identify and prevent hazards in food production, including intentional hazards like EMA. Separate agency action may be needed for intentional hazards, as they may require different controls not covered by traditional food safety systems. Public comments are being sought on how to address intentional hazards effectively. The FDA is seeking comments on regulations to protect against intentional adulteration of food under FSMA Section 106. This is the first time FDA has proposed rules for preventing intentional adulteration. FSMA Section 108 requires the development of a National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture are developing a National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy, implementation plan, and research agenda. FSMA Title 3 focuses on improving the safety of imported food, with tightened import requirements to limit fraud. FSMA also includes employee protections under Section 402. FDA's proposed rules were published in July 2013. FSMA Section 402 expands protections for whistleblowers providing information on FFDCA violations. FSMA Section 201(b) requires FDA to submit an annual report to Congress on food safety efforts and coordination with other federal agencies. FDA has been collaborating with agencies like the Department of Defense on information-sharing networks for facility audits, recalls, and inspections. FDA officials have indicated that enhanced public and private partnerships are needed for obtaining additional data and information on import security measures. Importers of foreign food are responsible for ensuring compliance with U.S. laws. FDA's surveillance of imported foods includes reviews of prior notice data, customs entry forms, sample collections for analysis, and detention without physical examination. FDA must receive a notice for imported food articles prior to importation as required by the Bioterrorism Act. The FDA requires prior notice for imported food into the United States to enable inspection at ports of entry. The agency screens electronic shipping records and may refuse entry if the food appears adulterated, misbranded, or violates U.S. law. FDA also has the authority to detain food imported by debarred individuals or from unregistered foreign facilities. The FDA can refuse admission of food into the US if it appears adulterated, misbranded, or violates US law. FDA's Import Alerts can be issued for products from specific manufacturers, shippers, or countries, signaling border inspectors to inspect closely. The FDA can detain and refuse admission of products from specific producers, shippers, or countries if they have a history of violations. Import alerts allow authorities to detain products that may violate regulations without physical examination. The FDA physically examined 2.3% of all food and feed import lines in FY2011, using electronic screening and the PREDICT system to target high-risk products. Previous estimates show that FDA inspections of foreign facilities were even lower in 2000. Changes under FSMA are expected to improve FDA's import regime. Changes to FDA's import regime under FSMA are expected to address concerns regarding the safety of imported foods. The USDA, through laws like the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act, also has authority to prevent fraud in meat and poultry products. FSIS is responsible for overseeing the safety of 10%-20% of foods in the U.S. food safety system, including meat, poultry, and some egg products. This jurisdiction is outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding between FDA and FSIS. The Federal Meat Inspection Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act, and Egg Products Inspection Act give FSIS authority to inspect meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS places inspectors in slaughterhouses, processing plants, and other locations where these products are handled. The Federal Meat Inspection Act requires USDA to inspect various animals processed for human consumption, while the Poultry Products Inspection Act mandates poultry meat inspection. The PPIA mandates USDA inspection of domesticated birds for human food use, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and others. The Egg Products Inspection Act allows inspection of liquid, frozen, and dried egg products. USDA's FSIS can provide voluntary inspection for additional species like buffalo and rabbits under the Agricultural Marketing Act. FDA retains jurisdiction over meat products from these species in interstate commerce. The FDA has jurisdiction over meat products from certain species in interstate commerce, including shell eggs. The 2008 farm bill requires FSIS to inspect and grade farmed catfish products. Meat and poultry animals undergo continuous inspection to detect disease and contamination before and after slaughter. Processing plants visited daily by an FSIS inspector are considered under continuous inspection. Inspectors monitor operations and ensure sanitary conditions. FSIS conducts inspections to ensure food safety, including monitoring operations, checking sanitary conditions, and testing products for pathogens. They certify foreign meat and poultry plants before allowing exports to the US, conducting evaluations to determine safety equivalence. No foreign plant can export to the US without FSIS approval. The FSIS inspects establishments in the United States to ensure food safety and certifies foreign meat and poultry plants for export. FSIS also regulates labeling and packaging to prevent false information. FSIS is responsible for developing labeling policy to ensure meat and poultry products are wholesome and properly labeled. Misbranded foods are defined as bearing false labels or being offered under another name. Adulterated foods contain harmful substances. The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) define adulteration in food fraud cases as including omission of valuable constituents, substitution of substances, concealment of damage or inferiority, addition of substances to increase bulk or weight, or to enhance perceived quality. This is similar to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) which also considers a food adulterated if valuable constituents are missing or if substances have been substituted or added to deceive consumers. FSIS enforces strict inspection, testing, and labeling requirements for all meat and poultry products to prevent food fraud cases like the horsemeat scandal in the EU. The regulations define meat and poultry products and conduct species testing to ensure accurate labeling and prevent substitution of species. FSIS enforces strict inspection, testing, and labeling requirements for meat and poultry products to prevent food fraud. They conduct species tests capable of detecting various species in domestically produced and imported products. FMIA and PPIA allow FSIS to establish voluntary standards for meat and poultry products, including definitions and standards of identity. These standards provide a benchmark for food quality and grading, covering a wide range of products and ingredients. CBP enforces FDA and USDA regulations at ports of entry for imported food products to ensure compliance with U.S. laws and address concerns about contaminated imports. They conduct various import security measures and border inspections to monitor goods and materials in cargo shipments coming into the United States. These inspections are not specifically designed to address intentional contamination of food. CBP enforces FDA and USDA regulations at ports of entry for imported food products to ensure compliance with U.S. laws. They prevent harmful pests and diseases, address emerging threats in agro- and bioterrorism, and detain products when necessary. Imported goods must meet the same standards as domestic products and have truthful labeling in English. Existing U.S. trade laws require imported articles to be marked with the English name of the country of origin. FDA and USDA have labeling requirements for food products, with country of origin information needing to be conspicuous. Meat and poultry products must also meet labeling requirements under laws administered by FSIS. Only plants in countries with equivalent inspection systems certified by USDA can export to the U.S. The United States has regulations mandating that the country of origin be in English on containers of meat and poultry products. Various federal agencies oversee food quality and safety programs, which may indirectly address food fraud concerns through inspections. Some programs, like USDA's organic certification, focus on combating fraudulent documentation. Increased inspection and oversight in quality and marketing standards could help deter or detect fraudulent activities. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is responsible for product quality and marketing standards for various foods. They administer an egg surveillance program to ensure compliance with regulations. AMS also certifies quality programs and conducts grading services. These programs are voluntary and do not directly address food adulteration. AMS develops quality grade standards as needed under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) develops quality grade standards for various commodities needed by the agriculture and food industry. Grading is voluntary unless regulated under a marketing order, subject to export requirements, or purchased by USDA or another federal agency for distribution. AMS-licensed state employees work in various locations to ensure quality standards are met. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) oversees grading for imported commodities under marketing orders, enforces the USDA organic certification program, and ensures products labeled as \"organic\" meet certification requirements. The National Organic Program (NOP) under AMS regulates labeling and certification to prevent fraud through mislabeling. NOP, established in 2002, sets standards for production and handling certification. The National Organic Program (NOP) ensures the integrity of USDA-certified organic products by setting standards for production and certification to prevent fraud through mislabeling. Certification relies on proper paperwork showing that processes were followed, and using fraudulent documents to market non-organic products as organic is a violation of U.S. law, punishable by fines. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service administers a number of regulations. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) administers seafood and fisheries safety programs, offering inspections exceeding FDA requirements. The program includes onsite inspections, certification of sanitation requirements, quality inspections, and lab testing. NMFS works with FDA to identify seafood fraud, such as adding water or ice to products. Under the program, NMFS inspects seafood for fraud, including the addition of water or ice to increase weight, use of masking agents for color enhancement, and seafood substitution. Industry contracts with NMFS for inspections to ensure sanitary practices meet FDA standards. Participants receive official grading and labeling marks to enhance product appeal, especially for exporters meeting foreign buyer requirements. NMFS also evaluates products at processing facilities periodically for quality control. NMFS evaluates products at processing facilities for quality, wholesomeness, grading, and labeling. They also sample products for contamination and species identification. NOAA collaborates with FDA and other agencies under the National Shellfish Sanitation Program to improve shellfish sanitation and promote uniformity in state programs. This cooperative effort involves agencies from states, FDA, EPA, NOAA, and the shellfish industry. Congress has introduced bills to address concerns about food fraud, focusing on specific foods like fish and seafood. Previous legislation aimed to improve inter-agency cooperation and inspections of foreign seafood facilities. Other bills targeted fraudulent maple syrup. H.R. 2400 (Capps) in the 113th Congress aims to enhance recordkeeping and enforcement for organic product standards. The 2013 farm bill includes a provision for USDA to report on a federal honey identity standard to combat honey adulteration. Additionally, there were efforts to tighten import controls on olive oil imports. The 2013 farm bill included a provision for USDA to report on a federal honey identity standard to combat honey adulteration. A provision to establish tighter import controls on olive oil imports was removed by amendment during floor debate."
