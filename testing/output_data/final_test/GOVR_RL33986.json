    "content": "The FDA approves drugs for adult use, but many are prescribed off-label for children due to lack of testing. Research shows that drugs may not always be safe or effective for children as they are for adults. The BPCA and PREA were passed to encourage drug manufacturers to develop and label drugs for pediatric use. The BPCA and PREA were established to incentivize drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric-specific research and include pediatric use information in product labeling. The FDAAA reauthorized and strengthened these programs, with their authority set to end in 2012 unless Congress reauthorizes them. These initiatives aim to address the lack of testing and labeling of drugs for pediatric use, as many drugs approved for adults are prescribed off-label for children. The BPCA and PREA were established to incentivize drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric-specific research and include pediatric use information in product labeling. FDA approval for marketing in the United States requires demonstrating a drug's safety and effectiveness for the intended indication and population specified in the application. Off-label use is common in pediatric prescriptions as FDA-approved labeling often lacks information for children. This practice is considered accepted medical practice. Faced with an ill child, clinicians must decide on the effectiveness, dosage, and frequency of a drug, considering the differences in how children metabolize drugs compared to adults. FDA scientists have highlighted the variations in drug actions in children due to factors like age, organ maturation, and body surface area. FDA scientists emphasize the importance of pediatric-specific information in drug prescribing for children, highlighting the risks of ineffective dosing, overdosing, and unique adverse events. Research has shown different responses to drugs in children compared to adults, underscoring the need for studies on pediatric pharmacokinetics to determine appropriate dosing for different age groups. Manufacturers face obstacles in conducting pediatric drug testing due to economic, mechanical, ethical, and legal challenges. The market for pediatric drugs is small, leading to a lack of incentive for manufacturers to invest in testing for children. Young children's inability to swallow tablets presents a mechanical hurdle for drug formulation. Manufacturers encounter challenges in developing pediatric drug formulations due to legal and ethical hurdles in recruiting child participants for clinical trials. Regulations from the Department of Health and Human Services and FDA emphasize the protection of vulnerable subjects like children. Liability concerns for drug manufacturers include difficulty in calculating compensation for potential lifetime earnings of children. Congress provides incentives for pediatric research to address these obstacles. Congress has offered incentives to manufacturers for pediatric research to address challenges in developing drug formulations for children. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act focus specifically on pediatric drug research, aiming to promote the health of the entire population, including children. These laws were enacted in 2002 and 2003, with authorization for continuation in 2007. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) offer incentives for pediatric drug research. BPCA provides market exclusivity for specific pediatric studies, while PREA requires safety and effectiveness studies for children. BPCA addresses on-patent drugs for marketing exclusivity, while PREA covers off-patent drugs or those not seeking exclusivity. FDA has the authority to offer manufacturers additional incentives under FFDCA Section 505A. FFDCA Section 505A grants FDA the authority to provide a six-month marketing exclusivity period in exchange for pediatric use studies. This exclusivity delays approval of generic versions of the drug. The provision applies to new and existing drugs, with certain exceptions. Before requesting pediatric studies, an internal review committee must assess the request. The committee, along with the Secretary, monitors pediatric studies and labeling changes. A dispute resolution process is in place, including referral to the Pediatric Advisory Committee. Exclusivity is only granted after meeting specific criteria. The law grants exclusivity to manufacturers who complete requested pediatric studies with appropriate formulations for each age group, approved labeling changes, and timely submission of postmarket adverse event reports. Public notice requirements include exclusivity decisions and written requests. Extended marketing exclusivity may be an incentive for manufacturers with products under patent protection, but it is not relevant when products are no longer covered by patents or exclusivity agreements. BPCA 2002 established a fund at NIH for off-patent research studies and authorized appropriations of $200 million for FY2002. Congress repeated the authorization in 2007 legislation. The BPCA 2002 legislation established a fund at NIH for off-patent research studies and authorized appropriations of $200 million for FY2002. The 2007 reauthorization changed the specifications for pediatric studies, requiring a list of priority study needs in pediatric therapeutics to be revised every three years. The Secretary, in consultation with an internal committee, determines the need for pediatric studies and issues grants through the Foundation for the NIH for drugs without pediatric information. The law requires the Secretary to issue a grant for pediatric studies or refer the drug for inclusion on a list. For on-patent drugs, FDA can refer them to FNIH for pediatric studies if manufacturers decline requests. If FNIH has sufficient funds, they must fund the study; if not, the manufacturer may be required to conduct the study. If the study is not required, the Secretary must notify the public of the decision. BPCA 2002 and BPCA 2007 established FDA requirements for pediatric studies, including notifying the public of decisions and granting priority status to pediatric applications. The Secretary must take action within specific timeframes, such as publishing determinations on market exclusivity and identifying drugs with safe pediatric formulations not introduced to the market. The Comptroller General, in consultation with the HHS Secretary, issued reports on the effectiveness of the pediatric exclusivity program in testing and labeling medicines for children. The reports covered testing extent, exclusivity determinations, labeling changes, and economic impact. GAO released reports in 2007 and 2011, while IOM provided recommendations on research practices involving children in 2004. Additional reports were required by BPCA 2007. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) added a new section to the FFDCA, requiring manufacturers to submit pediatric assessments for new drug applications. This was in response to Congress passing the BPCA in 2007, which aimed to provide pediatric-appropriate labeling for all FDA-approved drug products. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 requires manufacturers to submit pediatric assessments for new drug applications, supporting dosing and administration for safe and effective use in pediatric subpopulations. The HHS Secretary can allow extrapolation from adult study data for pediatric effectiveness if disease course and drug effects are similar. Deferrals or waivers of pediatric assessment requirements are possible under specified circumstances, with annual reviews and public disclosure of study progress. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 requires manufacturers to submit pediatric assessments for new drug applications. The HHS Secretary can allow waivers in certain situations, with public disclosure of study progress. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 requires pediatric assessments for drugs used in pediatric patients, with the Secretary able to request assessments for drugs that could benefit pediatric patients. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 requires pediatric assessments for drugs used in pediatric patients. Manufacturers must comply with the Secretary's request for assessments, or the product may be considered misbranded. The law limits FDA's enforcement options to protect adult access to the product. Under PREA, the Secretary must establish an internal committee to review pediatric plans, track assessments and labeling changes, and establish a dispute resolution procedure. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 requires manufacturers to provide pediatric assessments for drugs and make information publicly accessible. It also establishes a dispute resolution procedure for labeling changes. Congress linked PREA to BPCA in 2003 and 2007, authorizing PREA to continue only as long as BPCA is in effect. Issues may arise during the 2012 reauthorization discussions. The 2007 reauthorization discussions on the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) were contentious. Both laws are usually discussed together and were paired in committee hearings. BPCA offers extended market exclusivity for pediatric drug studies, while PREA mandates pediatric studies. Legal analysts and Congress are likely to consider their reauthorizations together in 2012. The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires pediatric studies, while the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) offers extended market exclusivity for pediatric drug studies. Legal analysts and Congress have debated the \"carrot and stick\" approach of rewarding the drug industry for something already required. Congress provided an incentive for testing, which some viewed as redundant. Senator Clinton and others disagreed on the issue during the 2003 debate on PREA. The Pediatric Rule was designed to work in conjunction with pediatric exclusivity provisions, but there is an unclear relationship between voluntary studies for marketing exclusivity in BPCA and mandatory studies in PREA. Congress may need to resolve this paradox. Congress may need to resolve the paradox between voluntary studies for marketing exclusivity in BPCA and mandatory studies in PREA, as highlighted in a recent FDA committee report. The provisions may need realignment to cover all uses of the active drug component for pediatric market exclusivity. Congress provides an 'action-forcing' mechanism by setting an end date for both BPCA and PREA programs, with BPCA's exclusivity incentive not yet sparking debate. Some Members had objected to linking PREA's assessments to BPCA's sunset in 2003, while in 2007, there were discussions on making mandatory pediatric assessments permanent. In 2007, there were discussions on making mandatory pediatric assessments permanent. The House-passed bill for PREA 2007 would have eliminated PREA's link to the BPCA sunset provision; the Senate-passed bill continued it. Congress may wish to evaluate the usefulness and effect of that link before deciding whether to continue it in the 2012 reauthorization. When FDA grants a manufacturer a six-month exclusivity, the manufacturer holding pediatric exclusivity benefits by incurring research and development expenses for FDA-requested pediatric studies. This leads to six months of sales without competition and a head start on future sales. Some studies have analyzed the financial costs and benefits for manufacturers receiving pediatric exclusivity. The median net economic benefit of six-month pediatric exclusivity for manufacturers was $134.3 million, with a range from a net loss of $9 million to a net benefit of over half a billion dollars. Nonfinancial benefits to the government include progress in protecting children's health, while financial costs include administrative and regulatory expenses. The government pays higher prices for drugs due to exclusivity, deferring the availability of lower-priced generics for six months. The improved pediatric information from six-month exclusivity incentives may lead to future financial savings by avoiding ineffective and unsafe drug uses for children. Private insurers and payers also face similar financial costs and benefits without regulatory expenses. Pediatric studies provide valuable information on safety, effectiveness, dosing, and side effects of medications for children, benefiting both study subjects and others through more appropriate drug use. Labeling provisions in BPCA 2002, PREA 2003, and their 2007 reauthorizations aim to ensure this information reaches clinicians and caregivers. The labeling provisions in BPCA 2002, PREA 2003, and their 2007 reauthorizations aim to make pediatric usage information available to clinicians. FDA requires pediatric usage information labeling in specific circumstances, such as when a manufacturer applies for approval for a pediatric indication or receives pediatric exclusivity. Congressional consideration is needed to determine if FDA has adequate tools to enforce the dissemination of this information for better treatment decisions. The FDA requires pediatric-specific labeling in certain circumstances, including when there is a specific pediatric indication supported by studies, specific statements on pediatric use based on studies in the pediatric population, and when a drug is approved for pediatric use with additional information supporting it. If the requirements for substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication have not been met, pediatric-specific labeling is also required. The FDA mandates pediatric-specific labeling in various situations, including when there is a specific pediatric indication supported by studies or specific statements on pediatric use. If the requirements for substantial evidence are not met, alternative statements may be permitted. Additionally, if a drug contains inactive ingredients posing risks to pediatric subgroups, labeling is required. The PREA and BPCA reauthorizations in 2007 added further requirements for pediatric labeling based on safety and efficacy assessments. The FDA mandates pediatric-specific labeling based on safety and efficacy assessments. The labeling must include information on study results, even if inconclusive, and detail variations in safety, effectiveness, or dosage by age, condition, or patient circumstances. BPCA 2007 strengthened labeling requirements and mandated dissemination of safety and effectiveness information to healthcare providers and the public. FDAAA 2007 also required clear, conspicuous, and neutral presentation of side effects and contraindications in direct-to-consumer drug advertisements. The BPCA 2007 strengthened labeling requirements by mandating the inclusion of a toll-free telephone number for reporting adverse events on all drug labels. It also emphasized the importance of clear and applicable statements on labels for prescribing clinicians. The BPCA 2007 mandated a toll-free number for reporting adverse events on all drug labels and emphasized clear statements for prescribing clinicians. Congress may need to assess if the dissemination provisions have been effective and if FDA has enforced necessary labeling changes based on pediatric studies. Consideration may be needed to strengthen enforcement provisions in the reauthorization bill. The BPCA 2007 mandated a toll-free number for reporting adverse events on all drug labels and emphasized clear statements for prescribing clinicians. Congress may need to assess if the dissemination provisions have been effective and if FDA has enforced necessary labeling changes based on pediatric studies. Consideration may be needed to strengthen enforcement provisions in the reauthorization bill. Additionally, BPCA and PREA have led to measurable changes in pediatric-specific information on drug labels, with 394 pediatric labeling changes noted since 1998 out of over 1,000 new drug approvals by the FDA from 2003 to 2009. Since 1998, FDA has granted pediatric exclusivity for studies on 178 drugs, making up 45% of those requested. BPCA 2007 shifted NIH's pediatric research priorities to a condition-specific list of 34 \"priority needs in pediatric therapeutics.\" Some drugs were still under patent, and non-drug interventions were also listed. The shift in pediatric research priorities from drugs to conditions has led to a focus on non-drug interventions like drug delivery systems, health literacy, and devices for dialysis. Reports have assessed FDA's implementation of BPCA and PREA requirements, offering recommendations for improvement. Congress may consider amendments based on these findings. GAO reported to Congress in 2011 on the effects of BPCA and PREA since their reauthorization in 2007. The GAO reported to Congress in 2011 on the effects of BPCA and PREA since their 2007 reauthorization. FDA needs to improve data resources to manage the programs effectively. Stakeholders express concerns about compliance with PREA and BPCA due to a lack of guidance from FDA. FDA created the Pediatric Review Committee (PeRC) to review assessments, waivers, and deferrals under PREA. The Pediatric Review Committee (PeRC) conducted a retrospective review of assessments, waivers, and deferrals under PREA through September 2007. The PeRC report found that pediatric assessments were generally of good quality but could be more consistent with detailed FDA guidance. Inconsistencies in decisions about waivers and deferrals were noted in earlier years of PREA, but with the 2007-required PeRC, higher pediatric drug development expertise was available to support all review divisions. PeRC recommended early planning and conduct of pediatric studies in the NDA development process. PeRC recommended early planning and conduct of pediatric studies in the NDA development process to address inconsistencies in pediatric assessments and improve the quality of research designs. FDA review divisions should discuss detailed plans to assess the scope of studies needed for dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric populations. Additionally, FDA should provide more extensive descriptions of postmarketing study requirements in approval letters and request labeling supplements when assessments are conducted after approval. PeRC recommended consistency in incorporating pediatric assessments into drug labeling and suggested FDA issue a pediatric labeling guidance. Congress has limited FDA's postmarket authority regarding pediatric drug labeling, raising questions about the agency's ability to ensure safety. The Senate committee noted limitations on misbranding authority for pediatric drug labeling, aiming to avoid criminal proceedings or drug withdrawal. The FDAAA introduced civil monetary penalties to incentivize manufacturer compliance with postmarket safety activities, including labeling. The FDAAA introduced civil monetary penalties for violations related to postmarket safety, studies, clinical trials, or labeling, with penalties ranging from $250,000 to $10 million for ongoing violations. The FDA considers manufacturer efforts to correct violations when determining penalties. Congress can address manufacturers' actions at various points in the regulatory process, such as when a manufacturer refuses or delays making labeling changes after receiving pediatric exclusivity. FDA should make study results available to the public promptly. Strengthening FDA's enforcement authority in pediatric research and labeling can address issues like manufacturers' reluctance to conduct studies or release results. Congress and FDA have taken steps to encourage pediatric research on FDA-regulated drugs, including financial incentives and enforcement measures to ensure drug labeling reflects pediatric study findings. The goal is to balance the need for drug development for children, incentivizing manufacturers to conduct studies despite costs and risks, protecting children in clinical research, and providing the public with unbiased drug safety information. The FDA has made efforts to promote pediatric drug research through various administrative and statutory measures. In 1979, a rule on drug labeling required the inclusion of a \"Pediatric use\" subsection. These initiatives aim to address concerns about drug safety and effectiveness, with potential issues to be revisited during reauthorizations in 2012. The FDA established a \"Pediatric use\" subsection in 1979, requiring pediatric dosage information for drugs with specific pediatric indications. Despite this rule, many prescription drug labels lacked adequate pediatric use information. In 1994, a revised rule clarified that manufacturers did not need to conduct clinical trials in children for pediatric labeling. The 1994 FDA rule clarified that manufacturers did not need to conduct clinical trials in children for pediatric labeling. FDA would determine if trials were needed based on the drug's intended use in children compared to adults. Labels must include information on specific hazards from ingredients. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, also known as FDAMA, created a provision for pediatric studies of drugs, incentivizing manufacturers to conduct studies on their patented products for pediatric use. Manufacturers completing these studies as per FDA's request would receive a six-month extension of market exclusivity. FDAMA also required the Secretary to publish an annual list of drugs needing additional pediatric information for potential health benefits. The Pediatric Rule, proposed in 1997 and finalized in 1998, mandated manufacturers to submit pediatric testing data with new drug applications to the FDA. In 2002, a federal court declared the rule invalid due to FDA's lack of statutory authority in promulgating it. The Pediatric Rule, proposed in 1997 and finalized in 1998, mandated manufacturers to submit pediatric testing data with new drug applications to the FDA. A federal court declared the rule invalid in 2002 due to FDA's lack of statutory authority in promulgating it, despite its potential as a better policy tool for pediatric use testing."
