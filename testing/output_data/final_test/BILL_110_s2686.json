    "content": "The \"Complete Streets Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title. It aims to promote safe and complete streets. Section 133 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a Complete Streets Policy. States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations must adopt a policy that prioritizes the safety and convenience of all transportation system users in project development. The Complete Streets Policy requires states and Metropolitan Planning Organizations to prioritize the safety and convenience of all transportation system users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, children, older individuals, and individuals with disabilities. The policy statement must include assurances that all users will be able to travel safely and conveniently on streets and highways within the public right of way. The policy statement for Complete Streets must include assurances for the safety and convenience of all transportation system users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, children, older individuals, and individuals with disabilities. It should also outline procedures for exceptions and direct the use of current design standards for new construction and reconstruction projects. The policy statement for Complete Streets should include directives for using current design standards, developing flexible solutions that fit the community context, and establishing performance standards with measurable outcomes. Accommodations must be made for all users in construction projects, except where non-motorized users are prohibited by law. In such cases, efforts should be made to accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians elsewhere. The policy statement for Complete Streets may be achieved through a State or local law, ordinance, or agency policy directive. A Metropolitan Planning Organization or State department of transportation adopting complete streets policies may consult existing Federal guidance. The Metropolitan Planning Organization and State department of transportation must certify that road projects in the plan comply with policy statements, enhance safety and accessibility, and address public input. Implementation of complete streets policy is a factor in certification. The United States Access Board must establish accessibility standards within 12 months of enactment. The United States Access Board will issue final standards for accessibility of pedestrian facilities in the public right-of-way. Until then, Department of Transportation standards will serve as the minimum standard. Metropolitan planning organizations and State departments of transportation should promote inclusive transportation planning for all users. The Secretary of Transportation will require the Federal Highway Administration to conduct complete streets research to assist States and Metropolitan Planning Organizations in developing plans that comply with the applicable policy statement. Research will involve key transportation organizations. The American Public Transit Association, American Planning Association, National Association of Regional Councils, Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, and various community representatives are involved in conducting research on complete streets needs. The research aims to establish benchmarks and provide practical guidance for transportation planning. The establishment of benchmarks and practical guidance for implementing street procedures and designs to accommodate all types of users, including vehicles, pedestrians, bicycles, and transit. Focus is on integrating individual modes into facilities that meet the needs of each in a balanced way, with expected operational and safety performance indicated in a best practices report to be published by the Federal Highway Administration within 2 years. The Administration will publish a best practices report on designing safe multi-modal facilities, considering user needs, facility types, barriers to implementation, and costs. Data collection for the report will also be conducted. The Federal Highway Administration will collaborate with other agencies on data collection for a non-motorized and transit use survey, as well as developing a survey tool for State transportation departments to assess multi-modal capacity."
