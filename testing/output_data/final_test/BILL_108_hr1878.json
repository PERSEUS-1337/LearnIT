Candidates qualify for funding by obtaining signatures of 3% of registered voters or being the candidate of a party that received over 25% of the vote in the previous election. Contributions to qualifying candidates are limited. The \"Public Campaign Financing Act of 2003\" sets limits on contributions for qualifying House of Representatives candidates, including a $100 limit per individual per election cycle and a requirement that at least 80% of contributions come from the candidate's state. A qualifying House of Representatives candidate can use public funds for buying advertising space, producing advertisements, campaign software, voter lists, campaign literature, telephone expenses, and legal/accounting costs. A qualifying House of Representatives candidate can use public funds for various campaign expenses such as legal and accounting costs, campaign employees' salaries, office equipment, supplies, travel, and food. However, public funds cannot be used for the candidate's salary or personal mortgages. The candidate will receive public funds based on the cost of 2.5 hours of television commercial time in the district's media markets. The Commission determines funds for candidates based on media market costs and a multiplier of media points. Funds can be used for any purpose specified. Disbursements are made upon evidence of eligible expenses, not exceeding 4 months before the election. The maximum public funding for qualifying House of Representatives candidates is $750,000, indexed for inflation every even-numbered year.
