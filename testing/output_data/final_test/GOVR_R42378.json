    "content": "Children in foster care are at higher risk of medical, social, or behavioral disabilities due to abuse or neglect before placement. The Social Security Act addresses their healthcare needs through Titles IV-B, IV-E, and XIX. States are required to maintain health records and provide Medicaid coverage for eligible children in foster care. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act created a mandatory Medicaid pathway for young adults up to age 26 who were in foster care at age 18 and receiving Medicaid. This coverage category is distinct from the ACA Medicaid expansion requirements for non-elderly adults with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court's decision in NFIB v. Sebelius made state participation in ACA Medicaid expansion voluntary but left enforcement of other ACA provisions intact, including the new coverage group for youth aging out of foster care. The ACA created a mandatory Medicaid pathway for young adults up to age 26 who were in foster care at age 18. States were expected to comply with this new coverage category for youth aging out of foster care as of January 1, 2014. The ACA also made changes to assist adults in obtaining private health insurance, benefiting young adults who age out of foster care and families served by child welfare agencies. The report discusses major findings, the foster care population, federal programs addressing health care needs, and selected research on the health care needs of children in foster care. Selected research on the health care needs of children in foster care and those who leave foster care due to age or placement in a permanent adoptive family shows that a significant percentage of these children have chronic or acute physical health conditions and behavioral or social competency problems that may require treatment. Studies indicate that these health and mental health issues persist over time. Federal child welfare policy includes provisions for addressing the health care needs of children in foster care, including regular review of health records, health screenings, oversight of prescription medicines, and providing health information to young people aging out of care. Federal child welfare law requires cooperation between state child welfare and Medicaid agencies to ensure the health needs of children in foster care are properly identified and treated. Federal guidance focuses on monitoring psychotropic medication use and improving access to mental health services for children in foster care. State child welfare and state Medicaid agencies have different definitions of children in foster care. Child welfare agencies include all children under their care, while Medicaid agencies focus on those eligible for Title IV-E assistance. This difference makes it challenging for policymakers and researchers to understand the Medicaid services provided to children in foster care versus those who have left for permanent homes. Analysis of state-reported Medicaid claims shows that fee-for-service remains the most common payment arrangement for Medicaid services for children in foster care, but there has been a significant increase in the use of managed care arrangements. The share of Medicaid services spending provided through managed care for foster care children has risen from 5% in FY2001 to nearly 18% in FY2010. Among fee-for-service Medicaid services, spending on prescribed drugs is highlighted. In FY2010, Medicaid spending on prescribed drugs for foster care children has leveled off since FY2008. Other important fee-for-service categories include clinic services, inpatient mental health facilities, inpatient hospital services, and rehabilitative services. The modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) rule is now used to determine eligibility for most non-elderly and non-disabled populations in Medicaid as of January 1, 2014. The ACA established income eligibility thresholds for children, ensuring they do not lose access to Medicaid. A new mandatory Medicaid pathway was created for young adults up to age 26 who were in foster care at age 18. Former foster youth who aged out of care are eligible for Medicaid without regard to income and assets. States cannot require mandatory enrollment in Medicaid alternative benefit plans for these individuals. The ACA established income eligibility thresholds for children to maintain Medicaid access. Former foster care youth are eligible for Medicaid without income restrictions, but may face premiums. States are not required to cover foster youth who aged out in another state. ACA mandates Medicaid coverage for non-elderly adults with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Final regulations on these issues are pending. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in NFIB vs. Sebelius that states can choose whether to expand their Medicaid program to include the ACA Medicaid expansion group. As of August 2014, 27 states and the District of Columbia have chosen to do so. This expansion may allow more family members with children in foster care to qualify for Medicaid. The ACA also made changes outside of Medicaid to assist childless adults and children and their families. The ACA includes reforms to assist childless adults, children, and families in obtaining and maintaining Medicaid eligibility and private health insurance. It prohibits insurance practices like denying coverage based on health factors and excluding preexisting conditions. Health insurance exchanges have been established in every state to provide access to qualified individuals and small businesses. Health insurance exchanges in every state, including the District of Columbia, offer comprehensive coverage and meet ACA market reforms. Eligible individuals can receive financial assistance through premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. These provisions benefit young adults aging out of foster care and families served by child welfare agencies. Foster care involves children removed from their homes and placed in settings providing round-the-clock care. In foster care, a judge determines the child's removal from a harmful home, giving care responsibility to the state. Most children enter foster care due to neglect or abuse. In FY2013, 641,000 children spent time in foster care, with 238,000 leaving the system. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade, with 122,000 fewer children in care on the last day of the fiscal year. On the last day of FY2013, there were 122,000 fewer children in foster care compared to FY2002. The goal of child welfare agencies is to find a permanent family for children in foster care. If reunification is not possible, children may stay in care until a new permanent family is found. Children who age out of foster care typically leave when they reach the state's age of majority, usually at 18. During FY2013, approximately 238,000 children left foster care custody, with 59% returning to their biological parents or living with relatives, 29% finding new permanent homes through adoption or legal guardianship, and 10% aging out of foster care without reunification or placement. The number of youth aging out of foster care has stabilized in recent years, with a decrease in the number of children in foster care ages 10 through 17. Between 31% and 49% of children investigated for abuse and neglect have chronic health conditions, exceeding the general population. Common conditions include growth failure, asthma, obesity, and behavioral problems. Children investigated for abuse and neglect often have social competency and behavioral problems, especially if placed in non-relative foster care or group/residential settings. Children leaving foster care have significant health and mental health needs, with 54% having special health care needs. Young adults who age out of foster care at 18 or soon after also face challenges. Young adults who aged out of foster care at 18 or soon thereafter were more likely to have health conditions limiting daily activities, participate in counseling, and lack health insurance. Federal child welfare policy and funding primarily come from Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, providing grants for child welfare services. Child welfare services aim to support and strengthen families for children's safety and well-being. States have discretion in providing services to children and families in need, often following investigations of child abuse or neglect. In FY2012, state agencies conducted 2.1 million child abuse investigations involving 3.8 million children. Services are mandated during investigations, with approximately 1.2 million children receiving assistance. The Title IV-E program includes foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. States must provide foster care maintenance payments and adoption assistance to eligible children. Kinship guardianship assistance is optional but can be offered to eligible children leaving foster care for placement with a legal guardian. In the state's Title IV-E plan, children in foster care and those leaving care for guardianship or adoption may be eligible for federal assistance. Funding for the program is an open-ended entitlement, with states entitled to federal reimbursement for eligible costs incurred on behalf of eligible children. In FY2013, close to 608,000 children received Title IV-E assistance, with the majority having exited foster care for adoption. Additionally, state child welfare agencies receive funds under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program to provide independent living. State child welfare agencies receive funds to provide independent living services to youth aging out of foster care, with the goal of improving their transition to adulthood. Funding is provided by both the state and federal government, with program details determined at the state level. The Children's Bureau administers these programs under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Administration for Children, Youth, and Families (ACYF) oversees federal child welfare programs, while state agencies handle day-to-day operations. States must meet federal requirements to receive funding for child welfare services and provide protections for children in foster care. Federal law prohibits using funds for medical expenses but mandates health-related planning for children in foster care. States must develop and provide health records for children in foster care, including immunizations, medication, and other relevant health information. These records must be updated and given to foster care parents at each placement, with a copy provided to the youth upon leaving care. States must also submit a plan for overseeing and coordinating health care services, including mental and dental health, for children in foster care to comply with federal requirements. The requirement for states to develop a coordinated strategy and health care oversight plan for children in foster care involves collaboration between state agencies, pediatric and health care experts, and child welfare services. This requirement, added to the law in 2008 and revised twice since then, includes protocols for youth aging out of foster care, use of psychotropic medication, and screening for emotional trauma. Federal guidance allows states flexibility in administering ongoing oversight while emphasizing regular health screenings and standards of care. In 2014, state child welfare agencies were directed to provide a new health care oversight plan to HHS for children in foster care, focusing on mental health needs and psychotropic medication use. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed for mental, emotional, or behavioral issues in children, despite lacking evidence of clinical safety and effectiveness. Between 16% and 23% of children in foster care receive psychotropic medication, compared to 5% to 6% of all children in Medicaid. Studies show that children in foster care are prescribed these medications at much higher rates than other Medicaid-enrolled children. HHS proposes using evidence-based psychosocial interventions to address children's mental and behavioral needs and reduce over-prescription. The Administration seeks legislative authority and funding to make competitive grants for psychosocial interventions for children in foster care and to provide incentive payments to states showing improvements. States are directed to ensure young people aging out of foster care receive information on designating individuals to make health care decisions through a power of attorney document. The power of attorney form allows an individual to designate an agent to make health care decisions on their behalf. The form can be customized to fit the individual's needs, and states have generic forms available. The health care oversight provision on health care power of attorney references the transition planning requirement for youth aging out of foster care. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, support services, and employment. It should also address designating someone to make health care decisions if needed, and offer the option to execute a health care power of attorney. States must meet related requirements. States must certify that they meet requirements pertaining to health care power of attorney under the Title IV-E Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. A health care power of attorney is crucial for young people aging out of care without reliable relatives to make decisions if they become incapacitated. Relationships with kin may be tenuous for former foster youth. Former foster youth may not have strong relationships with relatives after leaving care. Medicaid finances medical services for millions of people and is jointly funded by states and the federal government. States must provide mandatory services as described in federal law. Medicaid provides mandatory and optional services as required by federal law. Mandatory services include inpatient hospital services, EPSDT services, physician services, and pregnancy-related services. Optional services, if chosen by the state, include prescribed drugs, routine dental care, case management services, and inpatient psychiatric care for certain demographics. States have the flexibility to define the specific features of each covered benefit within federal guidelines. States have varying limits on inpatient hospital services for Medicaid beneficiaries, leading to great variability in coverage. Alternative Benefit plans (ABPs) offer flexibility by allowing states to define populations served and benefit packages, potentially offering less coverage than traditional Medicaid. ABPs allow states to offer less coverage than traditional Medicaid, but must cover EPSDT services, family planning, and transportation. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal and state law, with income and resources being key factors. With the enactment of the ACA, Congress expanded Medicaid eligibility to include low-income individuals under 65 years old with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. This new eligibility group, known as the ACA expansion group, was to be implemented in all states by January 1, 2014. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot cut Medicaid funds for states that refuse to expand their Medicaid program to include the ACA Medicaid expansion group. This makes state participation in the expansion voluntary and limits the Secretary of HHS's ability to enforce coverage through fund withholding. As of early fall 2014, 27 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion. States can impose premiums or cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and must follow coverage rules for the new eligibility group. The Medicaid program allows states to impose premiums or cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and enroll others in Medicaid alternative benefit plans (ABPs). However, children in foster care and those who leave for adoption or legal guardianship must remain free of any cost-sharing requirements. Former foster youth who aged out of care may be subject to alternative premiums and cost-sharing. The EPSDT program is a required benefit for nearly all children under age 21. The EPSDT program is a mandatory benefit for children under 21 in Medicaid, including former foster youth until their 21st birthday. It covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services. States must provide all federally allowed treatments, even if not covered under their Medicaid plan. Tracking covered services is challenging due to the variety of licensed providers. Receipt of EPSDT covered services is complex due to the diverse range of providers and locations offering the services. Data on EPSDT service utilization is separate from overall Medicaid claims data, leading to incomplete information on service receipt by Medicaid children, including those in foster care. Investigations have found inconsistent receipt of basic health care services for children in foster care. The HHS OIG reported in 2010 that many Medicaid-eligible children did not receive all required EPSDT services. In 2013, a follow-up study found that CMS had taken steps to encourage greater participation in EPSDT screenings and treatments, but the national participation rate was only 63% in FY2013. Despite concerns about underutilization of medical screenings, research shows that Medicaid expenditures for children in foster care exceed those for other non-disabled children. Medicaid data shows higher costs for foster care children, possibly due to a small number with high service needs. Research indicates discrepancies in coding foster care children, affecting Medicaid spending data accuracy. Limitations in MSIS data impact understanding of spending for children in foster care. MSIS data can indicate differences in counting children in foster care for Medicaid and child welfare data, leading to variations in reported Medicaid spending. State child welfare agencies report data on foster care children through AFCARS. Children in foster care are defined by the state child welfare agency as those under their 24-hour care and placement responsibility. Once the court relieves the agency of this responsibility, either through adoption, legal guardianship, or emancipation, the child is no longer considered in foster care. Medicaid counts children as \"foster care\" based on eligibility for Title IV-E assistance. Children in foster care are categorized based on eligibility for Title IV-E assistance, including those in foster care eligible for federal payments, children who have been adopted, and some under legal guardianship. Medicaid previously classified certain youth aging out of foster care as \"foster care\" children, but now distinguishes them in a revised reporting system. Children leaving foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship are still included in the count. Children leaving foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship are still included in the Medicaid \"foster care\" children population. The definition mismatch makes it difficult for researchers and policymakers to determine the type and level of Medicaid services these children receive. Medicaid data for \"foster care\" children may not clearly include those eligible through pathways other than Title IV-E, such as low-income or SSI children. Title IV-E eligible adoptees, who are counted as \"foster care\" children for Medicaid purposes, must have \"special needs.\" IV-E eligible adoptees must have \"special needs\" and may have greater health care needs than children in foster care. The mismatched definitions could impact state Medicaid agencies' ability to meet the unique needs of children in care. Medicaid data reporting does not accurately identify children in foster care, hindering the determination of spending on foster care children under the EPSDT benefit. (T-MSIS will allow for more detailed analysis of EPSDT service use in the future.) The largest category of Medicaid services spending for foster care children is \"other services,\" which includes various items like eyeglasses and prosthetic devices. However, this category also encompasses home and community-based waiver services not captured in other fee-for-service categories, limiting the information available on services provided. Medicaid data on specific services are only available for fee-for-service arrangements, where providers are directly paid for each covered service received by the beneficiary. Medicaid benefits for foster care children are often paid through fee-for-service arrangements, but an increasing number are now paid under managed care. State Medicaid agencies pay a monthly fee to managed care plans, which then pay providers for covered services. Despite limitations, analysis of Medicaid data provides insight into spending for children in or previously in foster care. In FY2010, state Medicaid agencies spent $5.754 billion on services for children in foster care, representing 10% of total expenditures for non-disabled children. Per capita Medicaid service spending for a foster care child was $6,188, compared to $1,999 for a nondisabled child and $14,690 for a disabled child. Medicaid agencies spent $5.754 billion on services for children in foster care in FY2010. Of this amount, $1.033 billion (18%) was spent under managed care arrangements, while $4.721 billion (82%) was spent on fee-for-service benefits. The use of managed care for foster care children increased from 9% in FY2001 to close to 18% in FY2010. However, managed care for foster care children remains less common compared to non-disabled children served by Medicaid. Medicaid agencies spent $5.754 billion on services for children in foster care in FY2010, with $1.033 billion (18%) under managed care and $4.721 billion (82%) on fee-for-service benefits. Managed care for foster care children increased from 9% in FY2001 to close to 18% in FY2010. Spending on six Medicaid fee-for-service categories accounted for over $6 of every $10 in Medicaid service spending for foster care children, including services like clinic services, prescribed drugs, and inpatient hospital services. Before 1997, managed care service delivery for Medicaid beneficiaries who were foster care children was not allowed. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 relaxed Medicaid managed care requirements, but children under age 19 with special needs, including those in foster care, were exempt from these changes. In FY2010, 35 states enrolled some Medicaid foster care populations in managed care programs, with the largest growth in HMO-capitation spending for foster care children. HMOs receive a fixed fee to provide services under a contract with the state Medicaid agency. Spending in this category increased from 5.3% in FY2001 to 17.9% in FY2010. In the PHP-capitation model of managed care, state Medicaid agencies contract with providers for a fixed fee to offer limited services. Spending under this model increased from 4.2% in FY2001 to 5.7% in FY2010 for foster care children. Some states also use primary care case management (PCCM) where providers receive a monthly fee to coordinate care. Managed care for Medicaid foster care children is generally paid by the state Medicaid agency through the fee-for-service delivery system. Spending on this model was $2 million in FY2001 and $8 million in FY2010. Concerns exist about restricted services under managed care, but some argue it can improve access and coordination of health care for foster care children. In FY2001-FY2010, Medicaid paid providers directly for covered services for beneficiaries, with top fee-for-service categories including \"other\" services ($903 million), prescribed drugs ($743 million), clinic services ($517 million), and mental health facility services ($513 million) for children in foster care. Medicaid fee-for-services spending for \"foster care\" children from FY2001-FY2010 showed stability or decline in most categories, except for prescribed drugs which saw an increase in spending. Prescribed drugs became the second largest Medicaid services spending category for \"foster care\" children by FY2008. Medicaid spending on prescribed drugs for \"foster care\" children has stabilized. Spending on \"other services\" showed an initial spike before declining. Noticeable decreases in aggregate spending were seen in \"rehabilitative services\" and \"targeted case management\" (TCM). TCM is used to help individuals access needed services, while rehabilitative services aim to reduce disability and restore individuals to their best possible state. Remedial services and targeted case management (TCM) are optional Medicaid benefits that have been used to meet the needs of children in foster care. Recent data suggests a decline in Medicaid spending on these services for foster care children. Child welfare agencies are spending less on the non-federal share of Medicaid for these services, possibly due to changes in responsibility for providing these benefits. The focus is on Medicaid eligibility pathways for children and youth in foster care, including mandatory and optional pathways for those in the Title IV-E program, adopted children, and young adults who aged out of foster care. The Medicaid eligibility pathways for children and youth in foster care include options for young adults who aged out of foster care and former foster children. These individuals may qualify for Medicaid through various pathways based on disability or income, with eligibility groups consolidated in 2014 due to the ACA income counting rule. The Medicaid eligibility pathways for children and youth in foster care, including those consolidated in 2014, are based on income counting rules. The ACA established the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) rule to determine Medicaid eligibility, which considers household income. The ACA required states to transition to the MAGI income counting rule by January 1, 2014, for Medicaid eligibility. States had to establish income eligibility thresholds based on pre-ACA levels. Maintenance of effort provisions required states to maintain Medicaid programs until certain dates to avoid losing federal funding. The ACA required states to transition to the MAGI income counting rule by January 1, 2014, for Medicaid eligibility. States had to establish income eligibility thresholds based on pre-ACA levels to maintain Medicaid programs and federal funding. Additionally, states were no longer allowed to expand eligibility standards to higher income levels through income disregards starting January 1, 2014. These policies ensured child welfare-involved children and their families, including those in foster care, maintained Medicaid coverage. The rules have special significance for children in foster care, adoption, legal guardianship, or aging out. They include exceptions to how household income is defined, ensuring foster parent or legal guardian income is not counted. Certain eligibility groups are exempt from MAGI counting rules, such as those receiving Title IV-E assistance or SSI. States can establish categories for Medicaid eligibility, like children in foster care receiving state support only. Medicaid eligibility rules for children in foster care under pre-ACA law allowed states to disregard their income. When transitioning to MAGI counting rules, states had to maintain existing income eligibility standards. If a state had previously disregarded all income for children in state-funded foster care, they would apply no income test under the MAGI rule. If not, a different income standard would be used. The Medicaid MAGI counting rule determines a child's income level based on the household income of the tax filer claiming them as a dependent. Exceptions exist for children living with non-parental guardians and individuals not required to file taxes. For individuals not needing to file taxes or be claimed as a dependent, \"household income\" for Medicaid eligibility is based on the child's income alone. Exceptions apply for children living with siblings under age 19 or full-time students under 21. Certain groups are exempt from the MAGI income counting rule under the ACA, reverting to pre-ACA Medicaid income determination rules. Certain groups exempt from MAGI income counting rule under ACA for Medicaid eligibility include children receiving foster care, guardianship, or adoption assistance under Title IV-E program, disabled individuals receiving SSI payments, and children in state-funded foster care without income test. No income eligibility criteria for certain youth aging out of foster care. Primary mandatory Medicaid eligibility pathway for foster care children applies to those under Title IV-E program. Children who qualify for Title IV-E foster care assistance must meet specific criteria including income/assets tests, judicial determinations for removal from their home, living in a licensed setting with eligible providers, and being under the age of 18 or up to age 21 with certain requirements met. This group is automatically eligible for Medicaid without an income test and is exempt from MAGI income counting rules. Children in foster care who do not qualify for Medicaid under Title IV-E must meet income eligibility criteria using the MAGI rule. The \"consolidated group for children\" pathway allows those under 19 with income at 133% of the federal poverty level to be eligible. For young adults aged 19-20 in foster care, the same income counting rules apply as for children. For young adults ages 19-20 in foster care not receiving Title IV-E assistance, Medicaid eligibility pathways are available, including pregnant women with income at or below 133% federal poverty level. Children in care, including those age 18, may also qualify under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) pathway for individuals with severe disabilities. Children not eligible for mandatory pathways may be covered under optional Medicaid groups, such as the Ribicoff pathway for those under 21. The state can extend Medicaid eligibility to children under 21 based on income criteria linked to the former AFDC program. States can choose to cover all eligible children or specific categories like those in foster care or institutions. Eligibility must now be determined by MAGI income counting rules. States that provided eligibility before 2010 must continue coverage up to a certain income standard. As of December 31, 2013, 20 states used Medicaid eligibility pathways to cover non-Title IV-E foster care children. 10 states covered these children with no income test, while 10 states covered them with an income test. States may also use other optional pathways to provide Medicaid coverage to children in foster care, including pathways available to infants and pregnant women in families. Optional pathways for Medicaid coverage include options for infants and pregnant women in families with certain income levels, Medicaid expansions under CHIP for children up to age 18, and a \"medically needy\" pathway for children with high medical expenses. States can choose to extend coverage to children under 18, pregnant women, newborns, and other specified individuals. States can seek approval from CMS for Section 1115 waivers to provide coverage to adult groups beyond what the law allows, including former foster care youth ages 18-20. These waivers may offer a more limited set of benefits than Medicaid state plan services. A national study found that over 99% of children in foster care were eligible for Medicaid, with 76% eligible under a mandatory pathway and 23% under optional pathways chosen by the state. The survey respondents estimated that most children in foster care were eligible for Medicaid, with 76% eligible under a mandatory pathway and 23% under optional pathways chosen by the state. Mechanisms were in place to ensure immediate health care coverage for children entering foster care, including presumptive eligibility and streamlined Medicaid enrollment processes. Officials reported that applications for Medicaid were made immediately for 36% of children entering foster care, with 33% within seven days and the remaining 31% after seven days. Recertification for Medicaid eligibility happens annually for 64% of respondents, with some reporting every six months. Former foster youth became eligible for certain benefits as of January 1, 2014. Certain former foster youth are eligible for Medicaid under a specific pathway created in the ACA. Eligibility criteria include being under 26 years old, not previously enrolled in Medicaid, being in foster care at 18 years old, and having been enrolled in Medicaid while in foster care. Income and assets are not considered for eligibility. Former foster care youth have a new eligibility group for Medicaid, exempt from MAGI income counting rules. Federal reimbursement is available at the state's FMAP rate. Those aged 18 and older not qualifying under the former foster youth pathway may be eligible through other mandatory pathways. In states using the \"Chafee option,\" youth meeting certain criteria may qualify for Medicaid. Under the \"Chafee option,\" youth meeting specific criteria may be eligible for Medicaid, exempt from income counting rules. Most states that offer Medicaid under this option do not require an income test. States must maintain an income standard no lower than pre-ACA levels. The ACA enacted on March 23, 2010, allows states to choose the Chafee eligibility pathway for former foster youth until December 31, 2013. States can apply no income test for Medicaid eligibility under this pathway. The new mandatory Medicaid pathway for former foster youth does not replace the optional Chafee pathway entirely. States may still use the Chafee pathway for youth who turned 18 in foster care and were not enrolled in Medicaid at that time. The ACA expansion group's Medicaid eligibility pathway is different from the mandatory pathway for former foster youth who aged out of foster care. States have the option to provide coverage for the ACA expansion group, but all states must comply with the mandatory coverage for former foster youth. CMS had not issued a final rule for this new eligibility group as of early fall 2014, but proposed rules in January 2013 and provided guidance in December 2013. The guidance clarifies that former foster youth who were in foster care as defined by federal regulations may qualify for Medicaid. States have flexibility in verifying this eligibility, allowing youth to self-attest. The guidance clarifies that former foster youth may qualify for Medicaid and states have flexibility in verifying eligibility, allowing youth to self-attest. States can choose to cover former foster youth who aged out in a different state, with 12 states already extending this coverage. CMS sought comment on interpretation of law regarding former foster youth losing Medicaid coverage if they move across state lines between ages 18-26. Members of Congress advocate for access to quality health coverage regardless of residency, citing negative outcomes for former foster youth. Stakeholders believe providing coverage can reduce future costs. Legislation introduced in Congress aims to ensure Medicaid coverage for former foster youth. The legislation aims to ensure Medicaid coverage for former foster youth, regardless of their residency. However, youth who age out of foster care before turning 18 are not eligible for this coverage pathway. States may need to inform these youth about their ineligibility for Medicaid under these pathways. Former foster youth may be ineligible for Medicaid coverage if they age out before 18. States need to inform them about their options. Transition planning includes informing youth about Medicaid eligibility. Idaho is using independent living coordinators to reach out to former foster youth. A 2012 study on state implementation of the Chafee optional pathway for former foster youth suggests that Medicaid administrators, child welfare staff, and the youth themselves may need education about the new eligibility pathway. Concerns have been raised about tracking, identifying, and confirming eligibility for this population as they age out of foster care. Some stakeholders propose federal assistance in facilitating data sharing among states to ensure coverage for former foster youth. State policies vary for providing Medicaid coverage to youth who aged out of foster care. In 2012, 30 states extended the Chafee option to eligible youth, requiring them to have been in foster care on their 18th birthday. Some states have specific definitions of being in care at age 18, such as certain placement requirements. Few states impose income and resource requirements. All states mandate residency and most require foster care in that state at age 18. In 2012, 30 states extended the Chafee option to eligible youth, requiring them to have been in foster care on their 18th birthday. Nearly all states automatically enrolled youth, sometimes with their involvement. Just over half of the states do not require annual recertification of eligibility. Children who leave foster care for adoption or legal guardianship with a relative are eligible for Medicaid under the Title IV-E pathway. Children who leave foster care for adoption or legal guardianship with a relative are eligible for Medicaid under the Title IV-E pathway without the need for income or resources tests. They do not need to reapply for Medicaid when transitioning from foster care to adoption or guardianship, and their Medicaid eligibility remains as long as the Title IV-E agreement is in effect or they receive kinship guardianship assistance payments. The state child welfare agency must maintain the Title IV-E adoption assistance agreement until the child's 18th birthday. States operating a Title IV-E program must enter into an adoption assistance agreement with adoptive parents of children with special needs, ensuring support until the child's 18th birthday or up to age 19, 20, or 21. Kinship guardianship payments also follow the same age provisions, requiring legal responsibility and support from the guardian. Eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance is determined by the state, with additional rules related to the household's income and resources. The income and resource rules for Title IV-E eligibility are being phased out based on the child's age at adoption. Special needs determination by the state agency considers factors like the child's inability to return to parents and specific conditions that make adoption assistance necessary. States operating a Title IV-E program are not mandated to provide kinship guardianship assistance but can choose to do so. Eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance requires the child to have been eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments while in foster care and living with the prospective relative guardian for at least six consecutive months. The child must meet an income and asset test tied to their biological home before entering foster care. The state child welfare agency must determine that neither returning home nor adoption are suitable permanency plans for the child, who has a strong attachment to the relative guardian. This group is exempt from MAGI income counting rules. Federal policy requires states to provide health insurance coverage to children under adoption assistance agreements. Adopted children meeting the state's \"special needs\" definition but not Title IV-E criteria may qualify for assistance. States have optional pathways for this assistance. States may use optional pathways similar to those for children in foster care to provide Medicaid or CHIP coverage to adopted children. Adoptive parents' income and resources are generally considered for eligibility, except for children under adoption assistance agreements with pre-existing medical needs. Children receiving state-funded adoption assistance are eligible for Medicaid. Children who receive state-funded adoption assistance are Medicaid eligible without income or resource tests. Only New Mexico has not taken this Medicaid optional pathway for state-funded adoptions, which may be replaced by the Title IV-E pathway by FY2018. New eligibility criteria under the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 will provide Title IV-E assistance to any adopted child. The new eligibility criteria under the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 state that Title IV-E assistance is available to adopted children with \"special needs.\" The Title IV-E adoption assistance or kinship guardianship agreement remains in effect even if the family moves out of state, with the original state agency responsible for providing assistance. Medicaid coverage is based on the child's residence state, with out-of-state placements covered by the facility's state. The Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medicaid Assistance governs procedures for transferring Medicaid coverage of adopted children between states. While federal law requires continued Medicaid coverage for Title IV-E eligible children who move across state lines, Medicaid coverage is not automatically assured for children with state-funded adoption assistance agreements if they move to another state. Some states do offer this coverage for children with state-funded adoption assistance agreements who move out of state. The ACA's focus on health insurance coverage and enrollment could impact other populations served by the child welfare agency. The ACA's focus on health insurance coverage and enrollment could impact other populations served by the child welfare agency. States will vary in implementing changes to Medicaid law, affecting health insurance coverage for children in contact with child welfare services. Child welfare agencies interact with many children beyond those in foster care, with a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions compared to the general public. Children who come into contact with the child welfare agency often live in low-income homes, with close to 60% below the poverty level. Parents or caregivers of these children have significant health and mental health needs, with caregivers less likely to report excellent health compared to adults in general. Despite similar mental health outcomes, they are more likely to have. Children in families who come into contact with child welfare services but are not placed in foster care have higher rates of major depression compared to the general population. These children are also less likely to be enrolled in Medicaid than those placed in foster care. Research shows that most children who remain in their own homes after abuse or neglect investigations are covered by Medicaid, while less than 1% of children in foster care are ineligible for Medicaid. The focus on healthcare reform may offer new opportunities for child welfare agencies to address the needs of low-income families who do not qualify for Medicaid or CHIP. The ACA may offer child welfare agencies new opportunities to ensure access to health insurance coverage for more children and adults they serve, including counseling through Medicaid. The MAGI counting rule applies for Medicaid coverage based on income, and the ACA may allow agencies to provide mental health services to parents of children in foster care. Prior to the ACA, parents of children in out-of-home placement were at risk of losing Medicaid eligibility. Children in foster care may lose Medicaid eligibility if they are placed out-of-home, which could impact their parents' access to services needed for reunification. The ACA allows states to cover childless adults under certain waivers, ensuring eligibility for low-income adults regardless of their children's living arrangements. The MAGI counting rule applies to low-income adults seeking Medicaid coverage, regardless of their child's living situation. A national survey showed that 63% of children in contact with the child welfare system had Medicaid, 26% had private insurance, and 10% were uninsured. After three years, Medicaid coverage increased to 67%, private insurance remained at 26%, and uninsured children declined to 6%. Private insurance is also important for adopted children from foster care, with 94% continuously insured, 37% through private insurance. Nearly six out of 10 former foster youth had health insurance by age 26, with 20% having private insurance. Individuals with a child welfare history may struggle to maintain health insurance due to chronic conditions. 67% of youth lost health insurance within three months of leaving foster care, with only one-fourth regaining coverage. Prior to the ACA, individuals with a child welfare history faced challenges in gaining and maintaining private health insurance due to preexisting conditions. After leaving foster care, 67% of youth lost health insurance, with only one-fourth regaining coverage within three months. The ACA establishes federal requirements for private health insurance, including reforms that affect coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. These reforms provide a federal floor for access to coverage, premiums, benefits, and consumer protections, particularly relevant for young adults formerly in foster care and parents of children with a child welfare history. The ACA extends private insurance coverage opportunities to young adults formerly in foster care, including those who are adopted, up to age 26. Health plans cannot deny coverage based on financial dependency, residency, student status, employment, or marital status. However, some young adults leaving foster care may still not be eligible for coverage under this reform measure. The ACA extends private insurance coverage opportunities to young adults formerly in foster care, including those who are adopted, up to age 26. Health insurance exchanges operate in every state and DC, selling comprehensive coverage plans to individuals interested in obtaining private health insurance. Parents of children returning home from foster care, children adopted from care, and individuals who have aged out may access coverage through exchanges if they meet eligibility criteria. The ACA established federal tax credits to make exchange coverage more affordable for low-to-middle income individuals and families. Some recipients of these tax credits will also receive subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses, which is especially relevant for youth aging out of foster care or parents of children returning home from care. The ACA's insurance reforms aim to protect vulnerable groups with preexisting conditions, such as youth previously in foster care, by requiring certain types of coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue basis. The ACA requires certain types of coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue basis, accepting all applicants regardless of health status. Plans cannot exclude coverage for preexisting health conditions. The ACA imposes adjusted community rating rules on health insurance premiums, prohibiting pricing based on health factors but allowing it for age. Premium variation is limited to factors like coverage type, geography, age, and tobacco use. Despite most ACA reforms being in effect, individuals with a history of foster care may still struggle to obtain private health insurance. The ACA prohibits health insurance pricing based on health factors but allows it for age. Despite most reforms being in effect, individuals with a history of foster care may still face barriers to obtaining private health insurance. The cost of private insurance may be high, even with premium tax credits and subsidies. Former foster youth no longer eligible for Medicaid may access financial assistance through exchanges for subsidized coverage, but may struggle to assess all available options due to market complexity. The ACA requires exchanges to provide consumer assistance for individuals and small businesses to make informed decisions about insurance options. Navigators, including various organizations, help with public education, information on insurance options, and eligibility for federal or state health care programs. It is important for staff in child welfare, Medicaid agencies, and exchanges to be trained on the ACA and its implementation. Staff in child welfare, Medicaid agencies, and exchanges must be trained to understand the ACA and its implementation to assist applicants in obtaining insurance. Research on the health needs of children in foster care, including those who age out or leave for adoption, is crucial for understanding Medicaid use by former foster care youth. States are now required to submit Medicaid program data via a revised reporting system. Former foster youth who aged out of care are counted separately from children in foster care in the new T-MSIS system. Research shows that physical and mental health problems persist into adulthood for those who age out of foster care. Studies have tracked outcomes for youth in care and young adults who were previously in care, comparing their outcomes to the general population. The Northwest Foster Care Alumni Study found that over 54% of foster care alumni had at least one mental health problem, with about one-quarter experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recovery rates for major depression, panic syndrome, and alcohol dependency were similar to the general population, but lower for other disorders like generalized anxiety. The Midwest Evaluation study tracks former foster youth in three states and shows they have more negative health outcomes compared to their peers. They also participate in counseling and substance abuse treatment more often, have less employer health coverage, and are more likely to have public health insurance. Children adopted from foster care are typically removed from their biological parents due to abuse or neglect. Around 50,000 to 55,000 children are adopted from foster care each year, with the majority having \"special needs\" that require adoption subsidies and medical assistance. Children adopted from foster care often have greater health and mental health needs compared to the general population. In 2007, 39% of adopted children and 54% of children adopted from foster care had special health care needs. Additionally, 10% of children in the general population were diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, while 1 in 25 adopted children had the same diagnosis. In 2007, a survey found that a significant number of adopted children, especially those from foster care, had been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. Additionally, a small percentage of adopted children had spent time in residential psychiatric facilities or hospitals after adoption. Children adopted from foster care are more likely to have had continuous health insurance coverage compared to children in general. 94% of children adopted from foster care had continuous coverage, with Medicaid being the most common form of insurance for them. Children adopted from foster care are commonly covered by public health insurance, with nearly 6 in 10 reported to be covered by Medicaid or CHIP. Additionally, 37% have private insurance, with some also enrolled in Medicaid. Parents reported that 65% of these children have received a Medicaid benefit, with 55% using it for dental care and 32% for mental health services. In cases where a child has both Medicaid and private insurance, Medicaid is the payer of last resort. Medicaid coverage can supplement private insurance benefits for adopted children, funding services not covered by private insurers. Medicaid spending for \"foster care\" children includes those eligible for federal Title IV-E assistance, state-funded adoption assistance, and those who have aged out of foster care.

Medicaid spending for \"foster care\" children includes those eligible for federal Title IV-E assistance, state-funded adoption assistance, and those who have aged out of foster care. Children in foster care not eligible for Title IV-E assistance may not be included in this category."
