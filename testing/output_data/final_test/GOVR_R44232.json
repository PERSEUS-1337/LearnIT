    "content": "Federal advisory committees are utilized by Congress, the President, and executive branch agencies to obtain expertise and policy advice from individuals both within and outside the federal government. These committees bring together experts with diverse opinions to examine issues and make recommendations for policy actions. They serve as a formal mechanism for private-sector citizens to participate in the federal policymaking process, although they are strictly advisory and cannot create policy or issue regulations. Advisory committees can be established by Congress, the President, or agency heads. Congress has the power to establish federal advisory committees in two ways: by specifically mandating their creation by law or authorizing their establishment and leaving the decision to a designated agency. These committees serve various purposes such as gathering experts on technical topics, allowing stakeholders to voice their opinions, and reducing workloads for Congress and the executive branch. When Congress establishes an advisory committee, it can decide whether the committee should comply with the transparency requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). FACA mandates that advisory committees file a charter with details such as objectives, affiliated agency, duties, operating costs, meeting frequency, and termination date. Meetings subject to FACA are typically open to the public, with notice published in the Federal Register. Records and minutes are protected under the Freedom of Information Act. The report provides analysis of federal advisory committee design, including structure and operations. It examines reasons for establishing advisory committees and how FACA provisions can impact their operations. The report utilizes FACA provisions and the FACA Database to analyze federal advisory committee creation. The database, managed by the General Services Administration, contains aggregated information on committee membership, operations, and costs. Around 1,000 advisory committees are documented each year, with over half created by statute for various purposes. Advisory committees provide public access to deliberations and recommendations, especially in policy areas where public participation is crucial. Presidential advisory commissions can deflect blame, buy time, and create the appearance of action on politically charged issues. They also help garner public support for policies already committed to by the President. Presidential advisory commissions serve to garner public support for policies, show symbolic concern at the highest level of government, establish a fact base, respond to crises, deflect political heat, gather information, forge consensus, and change minds. Commissions are categorized as agenda, information, and political constellation commissions. Advisory committees are created to foster consensus, acquire new ideas, and manage the workload of legislators. Scholars debate their impact on public interaction and effectiveness in government. In 2011, scholars found that advisory committees can be useful to federal agencies, especially those with a technical or scientific focus like the FDA. The information and expertise from these committees can influence decisions on drug approvals. Another study in 2011 showed that national security commissions are more likely to influence policy during a crisis or with a narrow mandate. Congress's fragmented decision-making makes it challenging for advisory committees to have an impact. According to the author, Congress's fragmented decision-making makes it difficult for Congress to act quickly. The slow legislative process delays the establishment of commissions, with months or even years passing before members are appointed. The Government Accountability Office identified four practices that can impact the effectiveness of advisory bodies: securing agency commitment, balancing responsiveness and independence, collaborating with similar groups, and evaluating usefulness for future improvements. The FDA is less likely to require warning labels or withdraw drugs approved by advisory committees, suggesting their decisions are more reliable. A review found that FACA committees report lower implementation rates compared to agency-established committees. The analysis found that advisory committees established by agency authority had a higher rate of full recommendation implementation compared to committees required to be established by statute. This suggests that agencies are more likely to implement recommendations from advisory bodies they established rather than those established by Congress. Additionally, scientific technical program advisory board committees and national policy issue advisory board committees reported higher rates of full implementation of their recommendations. The analysis showed that scientific technical program advisory boards had a higher rate of full recommendation implementation compared to national policy issue advisory boards and grant review committees. On average, 60.2% of recommendations from scientific advisory boards were fully implemented, while national policy advisory boards had 52.0% and grant review committees had 41.9%. Overall, federal advisory committees have been shown to influence agency decision-making processes. The influence of federal advisory committees on agency decision-making processes is significant. Research shows that advisory committees focusing on scientific technical programs or national policy issues have higher rates of full recommendation implementation compared to those focusing on non-scientific programs or grantmaking issues. The scope of scholarly research on federal advisory committees is limited, making it challenging to understand their overall utility governmentwide. Data from the FACA Database is used to explore the creation of advisory committees. In FY2015, Congress established 539 out of 1,009 active federal advisory committees, with an additional 183 authorized by statute. 42 new committees were created, with 20 being required by statute. Table 1 lists the statutory authority for these new committees. In FY2015, Congress established 20 new statutorily required committees, with the Department of the Interior housing the most at 5. Some committees faced operational delays due to department policies, while others were merged for efficiency. Congress plays a significant role in the establishment of FACA committees.

Considerations for establishing an advisory committee include defining mandate, transparency, membership, duties, mission, funding, staff, reporting requirements, and sunset date. When establishing an advisory committee by statute, the legislative language provides the necessary details for the agency to include in the committee's charter. The statutory language can outline the name, purpose, authorities, and membership of the committee, while additional operational details may need to be included in the charter. Federal advisory committee charters must be distinct from the statutory language that establishes the committee. Federal advisory committee charters must contain specific elements such as the committee's name, establishment authority, objectives, and duties. Statutes establishing committees do not have the same requirements. Charters also outline the committee's duties, objectives, and scope to guide members in carrying out their responsibilities. Autonomy is necessary to ensure the advisory body functions effectively under FACA guidelines. Federal advisory committee charters should provide enough autonomy to ensure independent advice, free from influence. Congress can choose to require transparency and reporting under FACA or exempt committees. FACA sets requirements for federal advisory committees, such as open meetings. Federal advisory committees established under FACA must hold open meetings, provide advance notice to the public, and make records available unless protected by law. Congress ensures committees are balanced and autonomous to prevent undue influence. Reporting requirements, funding, and staffing must be clearly stipulated. FACA aims to enhance government transparency and accessibility but may impose additional administrative burdens. Some agencies find FACA requirements burdensome, hindering committees from focusing on substantive issues. Scholars argue openness requirements may stifle candid discussion. Congress may exempt advisory committees from FACA to operate more efficiently. For example, posting meeting notices in the Federal Register can delay committee operations. Exempting an advisory committee from FACA's requirements could hinder congressional and public oversight. Congress may choose to apply certain provisions of FACA to advisory committees created in statute, such as requiring open meetings and annual reporting. The North American Wetlands Conservation Council is exempt from FACA but must still be open to the public. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is exempt from FACA but must be open to the public. Exempting a committee from FACA can hinder congressional and public oversight. FACA's reporting requirements help track committee operations and costs. Membership of advisory committees has few restrictions. Federal advisory committees must have diverse membership as per FACA guidelines. Congress can provide guidelines for membership appointments to ensure balanced representation. Membership structure is crucial and may be addressed in committee charters. The size and structure of an advisory committee can impact its mission, with membership requirements often reflecting statutory language. Committees may vary in size to allow for expertise sharing while ensuring stakeholder representation and quorum maintenance. Size and appointment of members depend on the committee's functions and mission. Advisory committee members' compensation and pay levels are determined by the authority establishing the committee, with a limit set by FACA at Executive Level IV pay. Members may also receive compensation for travel expenses. Committee members and staff may receive compensation for travel expenses and a per diem. Congress can choose to maintain pay caps set by FACA or establish unique rates. Members may be prohibited from receiving a salary but can still get payment for travel expenses. Committees consist of members, staff, and consultants. Agencies must assign a committee management officer and a designated federal officer to oversee FACA compliance and manage committee operations. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires committees to generate reports or recommendations for the President, Congress, or agency heads. Statutory language outlines reporting requirements, which must be included in the committee's charter. For example, the Founding Fathers Advisory Committee at the National Archives must report on project progress to the Archivist. FACA does not dictate report dissemination, but committees must comply with statutory reporting obligations. The Archivist must review progress reports from various projects. Statutory language establishes reporting requirements for advisory committees, such as the Nanotechnology Advisory Panel reporting assessments and recommendations to the President every two years. Additional provisions may require executive branch action in response to recommendations. The Board requires the Secretary of Agriculture to seek opinions and recommendations from the Advisory Board and respond in writing regarding the implementation of those recommendations. The effort put into the response may depend on the Administration's interest. Recommendations from federal advisory committees are advisory only and cannot enforce policy actions. Presidential advisory committees require the President to submit proposals or reasons for inaction to Congress within a year of receiving a public report. Agency-established advisory committees do not have the same reporting requirements to Congress. Heads of advisory committees may require explicit authority for special duties, such as holding hearings and hiring staff. Without statutory authority, delays in committee operations may occur. Subpoena power is selectively granted based on the committee's mission. Congress vested the National Gambling Impact Study Commission with subpoena power in the late 1990s. The National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a FACA committee, was granted subpoena authority by Congress, while another advisory committee was explicitly denied this power. Currently, no FACA committees have subpoena authority. Committee procedures, such as quorum qualifications and election procedures, are typically outlined in charters or legislation. Statutory procedures give Congress more control over committee operations and outcomes. The DFO from the sponsoring agency is responsible for approving meetings, agendas, adjourning meetings, and certifying minutes for FACA committees. FACA does not address funding provisions for federal advisory committees, which can be funded through congressional appropriations, agency instructions, or private donations as authorized by statute. Committee charters may determine if private financial gifts can be accepted. An entity may accept private financial gifts, with detailed recordkeeping required for transparency. FACA committees automatically terminate after two years unless extended. Some committees terminate based on specific dates or years after establishment. Considerations for administrative actions include assigning staff and finding office space. The committee will need additional time to create a final report, file records, and vacate office space. Table 3 lists proposed advisory committees in the 114th Congress covering various subjects. These bills can provide ideas for establishing advisory bodies."
