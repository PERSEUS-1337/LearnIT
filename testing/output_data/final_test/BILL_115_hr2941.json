During a 1-year period, the Secretary will convey Federal land to Collins Camp Properties in Louisiana by quitclaim deed, including the Collins Campsites and another parcel. The Secretary has the authority to configure the land to maximize marketability or achieve management objectives. The Secretary will convey Federal land to Collins Camp Properties in Louisiana by quitclaim deed, with the authority to configure the land for marketability or management objectives. Consideration for the conveyance shall be in cash equal to the market value determined by an appraisal approved by the Secretary. In any conveyance of Federal land under this Act, the Secretary must disclose hazardous substances but is not required to remediate them. The conveyances are still subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The Secretary must deposit proceeds from the sale of Federal land into a specific fund. The administration of the fund is governed by Public Law 90-171. Collins Camp Properties must cover appraisal and analysis costs when acquiring Federal land. They also need written consent from Forest Service special use authorization holders to relinquish their rights upon conveyance. If a party fails to provide a written authorization for special use according to the terms, Collins Camp Properties will administer it until expiration. The House of Representatives passed the document on October 31, 2017, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
