    "content": "The 9/11 Commission highlighted information sharing breakdowns and the failure to connect intelligence as key factors in preventing the attacks. A bipartisan task force emphasized the need for effective information usage in national security. The 2004 IRTPA mandated the creation of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) to enhance coordination and distribution of information. The Information Sharing Environment (ISE) was established by Congress to improve coordination and distribution of terrorism information among federal, state, local, tribal entities, and the private sector. A Program Manager for the ISE was placed within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The Obama Administration made information sharing a top priority and created the position of Senior Director for Information Sharing Policy. States and major urban areas also enhanced their information sharing efforts after 9/11. After 9/11, states and major urban areas established intelligence fusion centers to coordinate the gathering, analysis, and dissemination of law enforcement, homeland security, public safety, and terrorism intelligence. Fusion centers are collaborative efforts of multiple government agencies aimed at maximizing their ability to detect, prevent, investigate, apprehend, and respond to criminal or terrorist activity. As of December 2011, 72 fusion centers are operational in the United States and its territories, supported by grant funding from the Department of Homeland Security. The imperative for intelligence sharing among law enforcement and security officials is based on the need for timely access to information to make informed decisions. Terrorist attacks in the homeland will likely occur within communities, requiring a response from state, local, and tribal authorities. The preparation for attacks, including surveillance and recruitment, also takes place within communities. The gathering, processing, and sharing of suspicious activity information by law enforcement agencies is crucial for preventing crimes, including terrorism. Combining information from different sources can provide unique insights, even if initially unrelated. Relevant information comes from a wide range of sources, making it challenging to predict what will be useful to analysts or users. The importance of creating a more cooperative and fluid process for intelligence collection, sharing, and analysis is highlighted. A survey found numerous information-sharing systems in place, raising concerns about overlapping coverage. Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) contain crucial information for preventing crimes, including terrorism. Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) are vital for uncovering criminal and terrorist activities, collected by over 800,000 police officers daily. Sharing SARs among all levels of government and integrating them with other intelligence can help prevent terrorist plots in the United States. Police officers are trained to identify suspicious behavior, leading to successful arrests like Eric Robert Rudolph's case in North Carolina. State and local law enforcement officers have successfully uncovered or disrupted various terrorist plots, including the arrests of Eric Robert Rudolph in North Carolina and Timothy McVeigh in Oklahoma. A former U.S. Attorney highlights the importance of incidental contact with police officers in identifying potential threats, citing examples like the arrest of Japanese Red Army terrorist Y\u016b Kikumura by a state trooper in New Jersey. In New Jersey, a man was stopped at a rest stop on the Turnpike by a state trooper and found with pipe bombs. He planned to bomb a military recruitment office in NYC. In California, two men were arrested for robbing a gas station and were members of a terrorist group planning to bomb synagogues. In South Carolina, two Egyptians studying in Florida were stopped for a traffic violation and found with explosives in their vehicle. One student made a video on how to conceal an explosive device in a doll, leading to a guilty plea for supporting terrorism. Police officers are now seen as \"first preventers\" of terrorism post-9/11, requiring crucial intelligence support. A national information-sharing system is needed to integrate police records for enhanced national security. The integration of police records with sensitive federal data for national security is crucial. Examples of missed opportunities to prevent 9/11 attacks due to lack of information sharing are highlighted. The National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (NSI) aims to support reporting of suspicious activities. The National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (NSI) is a framework that supports reporting suspicious activity related to terrorism while protecting privacy and civil liberties. It aligns with the 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing, emphasizing the importance of information sharing in counterterrorism efforts. The National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative (NSI) is a coordinated effort that integrates SAR-related activities nationwide, defining data standards and policies for sharing terrorism-related SARs. It involves a partnership among various law enforcement agencies to gather, process, and share SAR information while protecting privacy and civil liberties. 29 fusion centers have implemented the NSI process, with 30 more in progress as of March 2011. The NSI is not a data mining program. The NSI program, different from data mining, requires a criminal or law enforcement predicate before searching documented events for indicators of criminal activity. A concept of operations for the NSI program was published in December 2008, outlining the roles and responsibilities of participating agencies. This distinction from data mining programs may impact public acceptance of the NSI program. The NSI program requires a criminal predicate before searching for indicators of criminal activity. A concept of operations outlines the roles and responsibilities of participating agencies. The operational steps of the nationwide SAR cycle involve planning, gathering and processing, analysis and production, dissemination, and reevaluation. Suspicious activity is documented in a SAR by a police officer, reviewed within the chain of command, vetted, and submitted to a fusion center for analysis. If it meets criteria, it is entered into the information-sharing environment for analysis and fusion with other intelligence. A Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) program involves behaviors linked to terrorist activities, shifting focus from racial or ethnic characteristics to potential criminal links. Concerns arise over innocent behaviors being misconstrued as precursors to terrorism, such as using binoculars or cameras, taking measurements, and capturing photos or videos. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) express concerns about the SAR program, fearing overbroad reporting authority and the potential misuse of collected information. The ACLU and CDT raise concerns about the SAR program, citing a case where Maryland State Police infiltrated peace groups and entered innocent people's names into a law enforcement database without evidence of criminal activity. The challenge is balancing law enforcement objectives with privacy and civil liberties. The NSI aims to balance law enforcement and intelligence goals with privacy and civil liberties protections for American citizens. Agencies involved must have comprehensive privacy policies and implement SAR provisions. Efforts have been made to address civil liberties concerns, including the publication of the ISE SAR Functional Standard. The ISE published a SAR Functional Standard to guide agencies in processing and retrieving SARs, aiming to reduce inappropriate data gathering and support law enforcement training. It establishes criteria for suspicious activity related to terrorism and reinforces constitutional standards, including First Amendment rights protection. The SAR Functional Standard includes protections for First Amendment rights and limits on factors like race and religion in information gathering. Privacy advocates influenced the standard to include reliability indicators and allow agencies to choose which personal information fields to include. In 2008, a report assessed the impact on privacy and legal rights, operational evaluation, and measures for privacy protection. The Office of the PM-ISE engaged with stakeholders, including privacy advocates. In 2009, the Office of the PM-ISE collaborated with stakeholders like the ACLU and CDT to refine SAR-related processes. The revised ISE SAR Functional Standard (Version 1.5) emphasized a behavior-focused approach to identifying suspicious activity and prohibited factors like race and religion from creating suspicion. The revised The NSI PMO developed \"Vetting ISE-SAR Data: A Pathway to Ensure Best Practices\" to guide fusion center analysts in vetting SAR information. Reported activity must align with criteria in the ISE-SAR Functional Standard for inclusion in a SAR. Community outreach projects aim to involve private citizens in the SAR process, emphasizing the importance of partnerships with local communities through initiatives like the Building Communities of Trust Initiative (BCOT) developed by DOJ and DHS. The development of trust among fusion centers, law enforcement, and communities is crucial for the production of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). Recommendations include training fusion center analysts in cultural sensitivity, promoting community policing, and encouraging information sharing for crime prevention and counterterrorism. DHS launched the \"If You See Something, Say Something\u2122\" campaign in July 2010 to raise public awareness of terrorism indicators and the importance of reporting suspicious activity. DHS ties the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the NSI campaign, allowing participants to share SARs through an NSI-provided server or eGuardian account. This shared space architecture enables law enforcement agencies to share information while maintaining control over their data. Participants can access existing SARs via the NSI Federated Search. Participants can access the NSI Federated Search through RISSNET or LEO, with future access planned through the Homeland Security Information Network portal. The FBI's eGuardian system is part of the ISE Shared Spaces environment within NSI, serving as a specific technology for terrorism-related information sharing. The NSI shared spaces architecture allows state, local, and tribal agencies to maintain control of their own data, with eGuardian serving as a technology for data access. Law enforcement agencies may choose to maintain their own data repository and control data sharing based on statutory criteria. The NSI training regimen includes briefings on executive leadership, policy development, privacy, and civil liberties protections. The NSI training program includes leadership, policy development, privacy and civil liberties protections, agency training, and community outreach. The SAR Analytic Role Training focuses on analyzing SAR information to ensure integrity and protect privacy and civil liberties. The Line Officer Training is for frontline law enforcement personnel to recognize behavior indicating criminal activity associated with terrorism. As of October 2011, over 160,000 law enforcement officers received SAR training for recognizing behavior indicating criminal activity associated with terrorism. Additional training is needed for public safety/justice professionals, emergency services, and private-sector critical infrastructure protectors. The ISE-SAR Evaluation Environment pilot project evaluated the feasibility of sharing terrorism-related SARs under the Nationwide SAR Initiative. The ISE-SAR Evaluation Environment (EE) aimed to establish national policies and best practices for sharing suspicious activity reports (SARs) among federal, state, local, and tribal partners. Evaluations and training were conducted at pilot sites, focusing on the \"shared spaces\" concept and developing a training program for law enforcement officers. The final report in January 2010 provided key recommendations for improving SAR sharing and analysis. The final report of the ISE-SAR EE recommended securing executive leadership support, forming unique policies for SARs, maintaining privacy frameworks, deploying technology effectively, offering training, and conducting outreach. A Program Management Office (PMO) was established in March 2010 within the BJA to facilitate NSI implementation and assist agencies in adopting compatible processes and standards for broader SAR sharing while ensuring privacy and civil rights. The PMO advocates for the NSI, guiding agencies and coordinating efforts to increase information sharing while protecting privacy and civil liberties. Concerns have been raised about potential 'pipe clogging' due to the large volume of data being gathered. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified challenges with integrating redundant information collected by multiple agencies, leading to difficulties in discerning relevance. This could result in an overwhelming amount of duplicative data for end users, potentially diverting law enforcement from more productive activities. For example, before the ISE-SAR EE pilot program, the FBI documented around 108,000 potential terrorism-related incidents in a 40-month period. The ISE-SAR EE pilot program documented approximately 108,000 potential terrorism-related threats, reports of suspicious incidents, and terrorist watchlist encounters. Congress is interested in how a future SAR Program Management Office will address quality control of SARs to prevent system overload and ensure adherence to privacy standards. Government agencies need to establish electronic trust for effective information sharing. The sharing framework emphasizes the need for government-wide policy guidelines and oversight to protect privacy and civil liberties. Analysts must provide a mission- or threat-based reason to access information. Fusion centers require a federated capability for identity and privilege management to ensure network security and privacy protections. Identification/authentication and privilege management are key elements in this process. The success of the NSI is dependent on an IT infrastructure that enables state and local fusion centers to access each other's information and federal databases. Fusion centers replicate data to an external server under their control, creating a secure portal for simultaneous searching. This shared space architecture allows fusion centers to aggregate relevant information throughout the network. The NSI program relies on an IT infrastructure for fusion centers to access and share information. Funding for this infrastructure may exceed state and city allocations from SHSP or UASI. Congress should consider providing funding for this purpose and ask about metrics to measure the program's success. The NSI program relies on an IT infrastructure for fusion centers to access and share information. Funding for this infrastructure may exceed state and city allocations from SHSP or UASI. Congress should consider providing funding for this purpose and ask about metrics to measure the program's success. The NSI PMO can provide information on metrics for the NSI program. LEO and RISS are significant information-sharing systems established before 9/11, providing secure communication portals for law enforcement, first responders, and intelligence agencies. RISS is a national network of six multistate centers funded by DOJ's BJA to combat various crimes and promote officer safety. It operates RISSNET\u2122 for law enforcement communication. HSIN is a secure platform for information sharing post-9/11, involving federal, state, local, tribal, private sector, and international entities. The HSIN platform facilitates sharing and collaboration among various partners to prevent, protect from, respond to, and recover from threats under DHS jurisdiction. It includes five community portals and provides real-time connectivity with the National Operations Center. The HSIN-Intelligence portal offers access to unclassified intelligence products for state, local, and tribal officials. Fusion centers with security infrastructure access Secret-level terrorism information through HSDN. LEISP fosters information sharing post-9/11 to prevent terrorism and improve criminal investigations. OneDOJ System shares investigative data among DOJ law enforcement components. The FBI's OneDOJ system is hosted at the CJIS data center and allows external sharing through partnerships with regional, state, or federal initiatives. N-DEx facilitates information sharing across jurisdictions to enhance crime and terrorism fighting capabilities. The FBI's Terrorist Threat Information is also accessed through security infrastructure. After 9/11, the FBI established Guardian and eGuardian programs for tracking and analyzing terrorism threats. Guardian is a classified system for collecting and reviewing reports of suspicious activity, while eGuardian is an unclassified system for analyzing threat information. These systems allow for the reporting, tracking, and management of threats to determine if further investigation is needed. eGuardian is an unclassified system designed for sharing and tracking terrorist information in real-time with various law enforcement agencies. It allows for the electronic transmission of leads to Joint Terrorism Task Forces and is accessible to over 18,000 agencies through the FBI's secure LEO Internet portal."
