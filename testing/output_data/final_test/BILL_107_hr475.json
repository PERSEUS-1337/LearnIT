    "content": "The \"Securing Affordable Vocational and Collegiate Education (SAVE) Act\" allows for deductions for payments to qualified state tuition programs under section 222 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"SAVE Act\" allows individuals to deduct payments made to qualified state tuition programs under section 222 of the Internal Revenue Code, with a maximum deduction of $5,000 ($10,000 for joint returns). The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. The Internal Revenue Code is amended regarding distributions for qualified higher education expenses. In-kind distributions are not included in gross income if they cover qualified higher education expenses. Cash distributions must meet certain criteria to avoid inclusion in gross income. Treatment as distributions under a qualified State tuition program is based on whether the expenses exceed the distributions. If they do not exceed, no amount is included in gross income. If they exceed, the amount included in gross income is reduced proportionally to the expenses. The total amount of qualified higher education expenses for an individual in a taxable year is reduced by the amount taken into account for the hope and lifetime learning credits. The taxpayer must allocate qualified higher education expenses among distributions to determine tax implications. Amendments to the tax code regarding exclusions for education expenses, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2001."
