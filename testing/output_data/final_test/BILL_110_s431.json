    "content": "The \"Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act of 2008\" or the \"KIDS Act of 2008\" requires sex offenders to provide Internet identifiers to sex offender registries under the authority of the Attorney General. The information must be reported in a timely manner to the National Sex Offender Registry. The Attorney General, under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, specifies information requirements, exempts disclosure of information provided by sex offenders, notifies offenders of new requirements, and defines \"social networking website\". The Attorney General defines a \"social networking website\" as a platform that allows users to share public information, communicate with others, primarily for social interactions, and includes contractors acting on behalf of the website. Internet identifiers refer to email addresses and designations used for self-identification in online communication. SEC. 3. CHECKING SYSTEM FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES. The Attorney General will establish a secure system for social networking websites to compare users' Internet identifiers with the National Sex Offender Registry without transmitting the information. The Attorney General will establish a secure system for social networking websites to compare users' Internet identifiers with the National Sex Offender Registry without transmitting the information. Social networking websites seeking to use the system must submit an application providing their name and legal status. The system will use secure procedures to protect the secrecy of information provided by the Attorney General, including rendering Internet identifiers and data elements indecipherable. Upon receiving a matched Internet identifier, the website may request information related to the individual's identity, limited to name, sex, address, photograph, and physical description. The General requires social networking websites to provide contact information, describe their operations, state reasons for using the system, and outline policies for denying access based on information obtained. Websites must promptly notify individuals of denial reasons and allow challenges. Inaccurate information must be reported to State registry and Department of Justice for correction. The Attorney General requires social networking websites to provide contact information for contractors using the system, along with other necessary information to ensure user safety. Approved websites can conduct searches as allowed by the Attorney General, who also has the authority to suspend or terminate system use. The Attorney General can deny, suspend, or terminate a social networking website's use of the system for providing false information, using it unlawfully, failing to comply with procedures, or misusing information. There are limitations on releasing internet identifiers of sex offenders from the system. The system established under subsection (a) limits the release of information by approved social networking websites. Websites must adhere to limitations and pay a fee for system use. The Attorney General retains authority for searches against sex offender registration information, and websites are not liable for using the system. Limitation on liability for social networking websites using the National Sex Offender Registry. Civil claims cannot be brought in Federal or State court unless intentional misconduct is proven. The limitation on liability for social networking websites using the National Sex Offender Registry only allows civil claims to be brought in Federal or State court if intentional misconduct is proven, such as actual malice, reckless disregard, or unrelated purposes. Modification of minimum standards required for electronic monitoring units used in sexual offender monitoring pilot program under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. Social networking websites are not required to use the system and will not face liability for choosing not to do so. The number of employees with access to Internet identifiers must be minimized. The electronic monitoring units in the pilot program must provide tracking devices with GPS for offenders and allow continuous monitoring 24 hours a day. The amendment applies to grants after the enactment of the Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
