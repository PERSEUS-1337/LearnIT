    "content": "The electrical grid in the United States is evolving from a patchwork system to a national interconnected system to accommodate massive transfers of electrical energy among regions. This modernization includes incorporating electronic intelligence capabilities for power control and operations monitoring, known as the \"Smart Grid.\" The \"Smart Grid\" is an evolving intelligent electric power network that uses digital technologies to improve system efficiency and reduce operating costs while maintaining reliability. It is seen as a modernization of the nation's power grid by the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned utilities serving 68% of electricity customers. The smart grid utilizes telecommunications and information technology to enhance the electric delivery system's reliability and efficiency, meeting the growing electricity needs of the digital economy. Originally designed by electric utilities to serve customers within the same state, the grid has evolved to handle more complex power flows with the development of regional transmission organizations. The smart grid is evolving with new technologies to manage two-directional power flows and optimize electricity generation, demand response, and energy storage. Smart Grid technologies aim to monitor, protect, and optimize the operation of interconnected elements in the electric grid, increasing reliability, flexibility, and resiliency. New technologies like phasor measurement units and advanced meters are expected to enhance the electric system within the delivery portion of the grid. Smart grid technology enables improvements in distribution and transmission automation. Emerging technologies on the distribution grid present technical and policy challenges. DOE sees opportunities to infuse advanced technology into key grid elements. The nation's electricity system is undergoing transformative change with challenges for Smart Grid deployment, including incorporating renewable energy sources and adapting to consumer-oriented applications. Cost is a primary barrier to Smart Grid adoption, with technical solutions offering benefits at the transmission and distribution levels. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 directed NIST to develop Smart Grid standards, but FERC did not adopt them due to cybersecurity concerns raised by industry and state stakeholders. The Smart Grid Advisory Committee (SGAC) is working on developing standards for interoperability and cybersecurity, with estimated costs ranging from $338 billion to $476 billion over a 20-year period. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated costs for transmission, distribution, and consumer systems, while the Brattle Group previously estimated the electric utility industry's total needs. Brattle Group estimated in 2008 that the electric utility industry needs a $1.5 trillion to $2.0 trillion infrastructure investment by 2030. This includes $880 billion for transmission and distribution system modernization to integrate renewable energy and Smart Grid installation. EPRI projected investments of $338 billion to $476 billion could yield net benefits of $1,294 billion to $2,028 billion with a benefit-to-cost ratio of 2.8 to 6.0. The Smart Grid enables consumer participation, offering choices, incentives, and accommodating all generation and storage options. The Smart Grid accommodates all generation and storage options, enables new products, services, and markets, provides power quality for the digital economy, optimizes asset utilization and operational efficiency, anticipates and responds to system disturbances, and operates resiliently against attacks and natural disasters. The Smart Grid is seen as a key technology for renewable energy, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency improvements. EISA Section 1306 directed DOE to establish a Smart Grid Investment Grant program to support modernizing the electricity system. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided funding for Smart Grid investments, with potential federal matching grants up to 50 percent. From 2010 to 2015, $3.4 billion was allocated for 99 projects under the SGIG program, resulting in $8 billion in grid modernization. The high cost of Smart Grid adoption remains a barrier, with ongoing development of technologies influencing future build-out costs. DOE estimated historical and forecast investment in the Smart Grid at $32.5 billion between 2008 and 2017, averaging $3.61 billion annually. The Smart Grid investment funding gap could be bridged by Congress to accelerate adoption. Estimates suggest annual expenditures ranging from $23.8 billion to $44 billion by 2030. Current spending by the electricity industry is approximately $3.5 billion annually, with total U.S. Smart Grid spending potentially reaching $46 billion for the 2018-2030 period. Grid spending by the electricity industry could reach $46 billion for the 2018-2030 period. Estimates for fully implementing the Smart Grid range from $400 billion to $800 billion. Alternatively, annualizing the estimates over 20 years results in investment amounts ranging from $309 billion to $572 billion. Deducting the $46 billion in assumed industry spending further reduces the investment needs. The estimated cost to modernize electricity infrastructure ranges from $260 billion to $526 billion. Other estimates suggest costs between $350 billion to $500 billion. The electricity infrastructure includes power plants, transmission lines, and equipment. As of 2014, there were over 3,300 electricity providers serving nearly 148 million customers, with investor-owned utilities accounting for about 52% of electricity sales. Almost 148 million customers are served by various electricity providers, with investor-owned utilities leading in electricity sales. Different providers have varying sources of financing for infrastructure development, with public power entities relying on tax-free bonds and revenue bonds. Public power entities rely on tax-free bonds and revenue bonds for infrastructure financing. New bond issues for public power in 2016 were expected to be $7 billion, averaging between $10 billion and $13 billion over the last 10 years. Electric power IOUs are privately owned, for-profit entities operating in most U.S. states, with estimated capital expenditures of $120.8 billion in 2016. Smart Grid investments by IOUs averaged $8.5 billion annually for transmission system upgrades and $17 billion annually for distribution system upgrades from 2003 to 2012. IOUs raise funds from stock, corporate bond issues, and bank loans. IOUs operate in competitive regional markets for power generation, overseen by FERC. They require FERC approval for interstate transmission projects. IOU credit ratings have declined over 30 years, leading to higher capital costs. Co-ops, serving rural areas, are owned by consumers and governed by elected boards. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation provide debt financing for co-op infrastructure projects. Various government agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers and TVA, play a role in the funding and operation of electric cooperatives. TVA is a self-financing government corporation that funds operations through electricity sales and bond financing. TVA uses integrated resource plans to address future capacity needs, environmental responsibilities, and modernize its generation system. The financial statement shows $2.1 billion in construction expenses for FY2017, likely including Smart Grid innovations. Most utilities view Smart Grid systems positively despite cybersecurity concerns. Integration of automated switches and sensors could reduce costs and improve system resiliency. Some foresee gradual modernization of the system with older components being replaced, rather than a formal transition. The Smart Grid has the potential to enable significant change. The Smart Grid has the potential to enable significant change by integrating renewable resources at a lower cost and supporting energy needs across different regions. The modernization of the grid involves replacing old analog components with new digital systems, leading to more effective deployment of technologies like microgrids, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles. Successful deployment of components like synchrophasors and new inverters on solar photovoltaic systems has been achieved. The Smart Grid is facing challenges with the introduction of new components like smart meters due to cost, performance issues, and resistance from customers concerned about health impacts. Despite obstacles, industry investments in the Smart Grid are increasing due to technology, environmental concerns, and consumer interest. One potential area for increased electricity consumption is transportation, with more automobile manufacturers introducing plug-in EVs. Utilities are exploring EVs as a means to address rising electricity demand and offer vehicle-to-grid energy storage services. The wider adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) faces obstacles like high cost and limited travel range. Establishing a national EV charging infrastructure could help address these concerns. Regulatory issues, such as the classification of EV charging stations as electric utilities, have also been raised. A United Nations study predicts a shift to EVs by 2050 for carbon dioxide reduction. Several nations are already considering a transition to EVs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Several nations are looking at greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate change goals. Swedish car maker Volvo and General Motors have announced plans to phase out internal combustion engines for electric vehicles. China, Britain, and France have plans to ban gasoline-fueled vehicles in the next 20 years. The readiness of the grid to accept EVs is an issue, with some jurisdictions better able to accommodate EVs than others. Charging and discharging of EV batteries will primarily affect electricity distribution systems. The deployment of smart technologies and real-time pricing programs for EV charging can benefit electric utilities by increasing power demand. Grid modernization investments in reliability, adaptability, and price responsive demand are essential for a grid that serves customer needs efficiently. Smart Grid adoption involves building blocks for a grid that best serves customer power needs, considering financial and physical factors. Customer price responses based on marginal supply costs signal essential aspects of grid modernization. Electric utilities generally view the intelligence and communications capabilities of Smart Grid systems positively for potential benefits. Smart Grid modernization involves upgrading electric power infrastructure with automated substations and phasor measurement units for better control and reliability. These advancements, including wireless communication and internet-connected devices, also raise concerns about cybersecurity. The Smart Grid's digital technologies increase cybersecurity vulnerabilities, with potential for major disruptions from cyberattacks. AI integration in defenses may not be effective, as machine learning is not a silver bullet for cybersecurity. Hackers could use machine learning to carry out cyberattacks, making AI vulnerable to intrusion feints. The DOE and electric utility industry collaborate to address cybersecurity concerns and strengthen the security of critical infrastructure in the electricity subsector. The collaboration between the DOE, vendors, utility owners, and operators in the electricity and oil and natural gas sectors enhances cybersecurity for critical energy infrastructure. Concerns about the safety of information shared in Smart Grid applications include protecting customer data through encryption, data aggregation, and real-time monitoring. These measures may not be sufficient against sophisticated threats. The development of Smart Grid standards is crucial for protecting customer data in demand-side management programs. Customer-specific data in home area networks must be secure to ensure privacy. The \"Distributed Energy Demonstration Act of 2017\" aims to establish demonstration grants for energy initiatives. EVs could potentially provide data on customer movement and habits if not restricted to electricity consumption for billing purposes. S. 1874, introduced in September 2017, aims to establish demonstration grant programs for Smart Grid and distributed energy resource technologies. It includes energy generation, demand response, EVs, virtual power plants, microgrids, and networks of microgrid cells. Federal matching funds would be provided for qualifying investments to support Smart Grid deployment and ensure consumer benefits. The bill aimed to capitalize on the Smart Grid for energy efficient technologies, requiring DOE to develop an energy security plan and report on smart meter security concerns. It also directed the FTC to consider Energy Guide labels on products with Smart Grid capability, which could reduce annual operation costs when utilized effectively."
