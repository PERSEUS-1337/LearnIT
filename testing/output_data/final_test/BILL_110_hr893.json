    "content": "The Act titled \"John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007\" amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include loan repayment for prosecutors and public defenders. Grant authorization is provided under this new section. The Act \"John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007\" aims to encourage qualified individuals to work as prosecutors and public defenders by offering loan repayment. The section defines a prosecutor as a licensed attorney who handles criminal cases at the state or local level, and a public defender as a licensed attorney who works for a state or local agency or a nonprofit organization providing legal services. The Act defines a public defender as a licensed attorney providing legal representation to indigent persons in criminal cases, either at the state or local level or as a full-time Federal defender attorney. The term 'student loan' refers to loans under part B of the Higher Education Act of 1965, excluding certain types of loans. The Attorney General will establish a program to repay student loans, including loans under specific sections of the Higher Education Act of 1965, through direct payments on behalf of borrowers. The Attorney General will establish a program to repay student loans for prosecutors and public defenders who are not in default, requiring a minimum 3-year service commitment. If a borrower is terminated for misconduct or voluntarily leaves before the agreed period, they must repay benefits received. Failure to repay will result in the Federal Government recovering the amount owed. The Attorney General has the discretion to waive the right of recovery in certain cases. The Attorney General may waive the right of recovery for student loan payments if it is deemed against equity or the public interest. Any repayments made by the borrower will be credited back to the original appropriation account. The Attorney General may make student loan repayments subject to agreed-upon terms and limitations, not exceeding $10,000 per borrower per year or $60,000 in total. The Attorney General can make student loan repayments up to $10,000 per borrower per year or $60,000 in total. The borrower cannot be reimbursed for any repayments made before entering into an agreement. After completing the required service period, the borrower and Attorney General can enter into an additional agreement, which may require the borrower to work as a prosecutor or public defender for less than 3 years. The Attorney General provides repayment benefits on a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to borrowers who have completed less than 3 years of required service. The Attorney General can issue regulations to implement this section. Authorization of appropriations for this section includes $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and additional funds as needed for future years."
