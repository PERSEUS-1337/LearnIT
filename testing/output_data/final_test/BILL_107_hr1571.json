    "content": "The Act titled \"Alien Child Protection and Deferred Enforced Departure Family Unity Act of 2001\" provides permanent resident status for alien orphans under 12 years old physically present in the United States. The Alien Child Protection and Deferred Enforced Departure Family Unity Act of 2001 allows for the adjustment of status to permanent residence for eligible aliens, exempting certain grounds for inadmissibility. Aliens present in the United States who have been ordered excluded, deported, or removed may apply for adjustment of status without needing to file a motion to reopen the order. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains in effect. This provision applies to eligible aliens under the Alien Child Protection and Deferred Enforced Departure Family Unity Act of 2001. Aliens under 12 years old, physically present in the US, and without living parents can apply for a stay of removal. The Attorney General can provide regulations for aliens facing deportation to seek a stay based on an application. The Attorney General cannot order removal if the alien raises eligibility as a defense during proceedings. Aliens facing deportation can apply for a stay of removal if they are under 12 years old, physically present in the US, and without living parents. The Attorney General cannot order removal if the alien raises eligibility as a defense during proceedings. Applicants for adjustment of status have the right to administrative review, similar to applicants under the Immigration and Nationality Act. When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of this section, without affecting the powers of the Attorney General. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent aliens from seeking status under other laws. Deferred enforced departure is granted to alien parents of children born in the US who are under 18 years old. Deferred Enforced Departure is granted to alien parents of children born in the US who are under 18 years old, allowing the Attorney General to defer their removal or enforced departure. Aliens with deportation orders can still apply for this deferral. Alien parents of children under 18 in the US can apply for Deferred Enforced Departure, allowing the Attorney General to defer their removal. If the application is granted, the order is canceled; if denied, the order remains in effect. The Attorney General allows aliens facing deportation or removal to seek a stay based on an application. The alien cannot be removed if they are in proceedings and raise eligibility for adjustment of status, unless the application is denied. Administrative review is available. The Attorney General provides deferred enforced departure applicants with the right to administrative review and work authorization during the application process. If the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, the Attorney General must authorize employment. During deferred enforced departure, the Attorney General authorizes aliens to work in the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply, and the Attorney General's powers in immigration enforcement remain unaffected. The Attorney General authorizes aliens to work in the United States during deferred enforced departure, and the Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply. Eligibility for deferred enforced departure status does not prevent an alien from seeking immigration status under other laws."
