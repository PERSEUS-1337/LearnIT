    "title": "AB 2062",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 11265.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to establish an income reporting threshold for CalWORKs recipients. Recipients must report when their monthly household income exceeds the threshold within 10 days. The amended Welfare and Institutions Code sets an income reporting threshold for CalWORKs recipients. Recipients must report any income exceeding the threshold within 10 days. Additionally, counties must inform recipients of their reporting duties and the consequences of failing to report, and redetermine eligibility and grant amounts when income exceeds the threshold. If a CalWORKs recipient reports an increase in income during the first through fifth months of a semiannual reporting period, the county will verify the report and adjust the recipient's financial eligibility and grant amount accordingly. If the recipient is found financially ineligible due to the income increase, they will be discontinued with notice. If the grant amount needs to decrease, it will be reduced for the rest of the reporting period with notice. If a CalWORKs recipient reports a change in income, an overpayment will not be assessed if the county couldn't provide 10 days' notice before the next month. If there is an increase in income during the sixth month of a reporting period, eligibility will not be redetermined for the current period but will be considered for the next period. When changes in income are reported and verified, counties must adjust benefits accordingly within 10 days. Decreases in income will prompt a recalculation of benefits for the current and future months in the reporting period. When income changes are reported and verified, counties must adjust benefits within 10 days. If the new income results in a higher grant amount, the county will revise the grant for the current and remaining months in the reporting period to the higher amount and issue any increased benefit amount. During the semiannual reporting period, recipients can report changes in income and household circumstances to increase their grant. Counties will act on reported changes in household composition that result in a benefit increase, with verification required. If the change is reported in the first through fifth month, the grant will be recalculated for the following month. If reported in the sixth month, the grant will be redetermined for the next reporting period. During the semiannual reporting period, recipients can report changes in income and household circumstances to increase their grant. The grant will be redetermined for the following reporting period as provided in Sections 11265.1 and 11265.2. During the semiannual reporting period, recipients can request to discontinue their entire assistance unit or individual members not in the home. The county must provide a 10-day notice for verbal requests or discontinue benefits at the end of the month for written requests. This section becomes operative on April 1, 2013, and counties must implement semiannual reporting by October 1, 2013, certifying its implementation to the director. Section 11265.47 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to establish an income reporting threshold for CalWORKs assistance units. The threshold is based on federal poverty levels and eligibility for federal benefits. Upon filing the required certificate, counties must comply with semiannual reporting provisions. Recipients of CalWORKs benefits must report income exceeding the threshold, changes in household composition, address changes, or legal issues within 10 days. Counties must reassess eligibility and grant amounts when recipients report changes. If a CalWORKs recipient reports an increase in income or change in household composition, the county will verify and adjust their financial eligibility and grant amount accordingly. If the recipient is found financially ineligible, benefits will be discontinued with notice. If the grant amount needs to be adjusted, the county will do so with timely notice. If a CalWORKs recipient reports a change in income or household composition, the county will verify and adjust eligibility and grant amount. An overpayment will not be assessed if the county couldn't provide timely notice. If income increases in the 12th month, it will be considered for the following year's eligibility and grant amount. During the year, CalWORKs recipients can report changes in income to the county, resulting in increased benefits if verified. The increased benefit amount will be issued within 10 days of receiving required verification. During the year, CalWORKs recipients can request to discontinue their assistance unit or individual members not in the home. A verbal request requires a 10-day notice, while a written request results in benefits ending at the end of the month. This section becomes effective 90 days after the act's effective date or October 1, 2012. The State Department of Social Services will implement the act by July 1, 2017, through a directive from the Director of Social Services. Regulations to support the act must be in place by July 1, 2018. No funds from Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code will be allocated for this act. If the Commission on State Mandates finds state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
