    "content": "The Senate PAYGO rule requires legislation to include spending cuts or revenue increases to offset any projected increase in the deficit. Direct spending, controlled by laws other than appropriations acts, includes programs like Medicare and unemployment compensation. Direct spending, distinct from discretionary spending controlled through annual appropriations, is overseen by authorizing committees. Revenues, collected from the public by the federal government, include taxes and miscellaneous receipts under the Senate Committee on Finance. The Senate PAYGO rule applies to legislation, not existing direct spending or revenues, allowing for potential increases in direct spending and declines in revenues. The Senate PAYGO rule, along with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, aims to prevent legislative actions that would increase the deficit. While similar, they differ in enforcement methods and timing. The Senate rule applies during legislation consideration on the Senate floor, while the statutory requirement applies over six-year and 11-year periods. The Senate PAYGO rule applies to each measure individually on the Senate floor and is enforced by a point of order. In contrast, the Statutory PAYGO Act applies to legislation after it has been enacted and is enforced by sequestration to eliminate any deficit increase. The current Senate PAYGO rule prohibits direct spending or revenue legislation that would cause an on-budget deficit in the current fiscal year, budget year, or the following six years. The Senate PAYGO rule applies to measures affecting direct spending and revenues in four time periods: the current fiscal year, the budget year, a six-year period, or an 11-year period. Each measure must not increase the on-budget deficit and must include changes to reduce direct spending or increase revenues. The rule includes a \"pay-as-you-go ledger\" to record deficit reduction resulting from legislation. The Senate PAYGO rule includes a \"pay-as-you-go ledger\" to track deficit reduction from legislation enacted and not included in the baseline. This ledger can be used to offset on-budget deficit increases in new measures. Estimates for direct spending and revenues are determined by the Senate Budget Committee, which can use its own estimates or those from the CBO and JCT. The Senate PAYGO rule requires estimates to determine if a measure increases the deficit, using the baseline surplus or deficit from the most recent budget resolution. CBO usually provides the baseline estimates, projecting revenue, spending, and deficit levels under existing law. The rule can be waived by unanimous consent. The Senate PAYGO rule, requiring a three-fifths vote of Senators, aims to prevent legislation increasing the deficit. It is enforced through a point of order and has no expiration date. The rule has been successful in blocking deficit-increasing measures, with most waiver motions being rejected. During the period between 1993 and the end of the first session of the 115th Congress, the PAYGO rule prevented consideration of 44 amendments in the Senate. A total of 58 points of order were raised under the rule, with 14 waivers granted. Despite its success in blocking deficit-increasing measures, the rule has not completely prevented the Senate from passing such legislation. The Senate established the PAYGO rule in the FY1994 budget resolution in 1993, and it has been modified and extended several times since then. The Senate has found ways to bypass the rule, such as fitting legislation within the available surplus, designating provisions as emergency requirements, or not enforcing the rule when cost estimates project a deficit increase. The Senate established the PAYGO rule in the FY1994 budget resolution in 1993 to prevent deficit increases from new legislation. The rule has been modified over the years, including changes to establish, extend, and repeal expiration dates. The PAYGO rule was established in 1993 to prevent deficit increases from new legislation. It has been modified over the years for various reasons, including to offset revenue reductions and direct spending increases. The key changes were made in 1994, prohibiting legislation that would increase the deficit in specific time periods. The PAYGO rule, established in 1993, was modified in 1994 to allow deficit reduction from other legislation as an offset for deficit-increasing legislation. In 1995, the rule was further modified to only allow deficit reduction from legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year as an offset. The rule prohibited using deficit reduction from reconciliation legislation as an offset. The rule's expiration date was extended to September 30, 2002 by the Senate. The PAYGO rule was modified in 1999 to allow on-budget surpluses to offset tax reductions or spending increases. The rule expired in 2002 but was restored and extended through April 15, 2003 by the Senate. The PAYGO rule was modified in 1999 to allow on-budget surpluses to offset tax reductions or spending increases. In 2003, the Senate expanded the rule to cover any direct spending or revenues included in appropriations acts, effectively curtailing potential evasions of the rule. Reconciliation legislation in 2003 did not violate the rule as it was consistent with the reconciliation instructions in the FY2004 budget resolution. The Senate made significant changes to the PAYGO rule in 2007, eliminating exemptions for direct spending and revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution. The rule's applicable time periods were also modified to prevent on-budget deficit increases in specific fiscal years. In 2015, the expiration date was repealed, and in 2017, the current fiscal year and budget year were added as applicable time periods for deficit increases. The Senate PAYGO rule underwent changes in 2007, removing exemptions for direct spending and revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution. The rule's applicable time periods were adjusted to prevent on-budget deficit increases in specific fiscal years. In 2015, the expiration date was repealed, and in 2017, the current fiscal year and budget year were included as applicable time periods for deficit increases. The rule drew attention on the Senate floor during the 107th Congress, with attempts made to extend it before its scheduled expiration on September 30, 2002. The Senate PAYGO rule expired on September 30, 2002, but was later restored and extended through April 15, 2003. Multiple attempts to extend the rule through FY2007 failed due to points of order. In April 2003, the Senate modified and extended its PAYGO rule in the FY2004 budget resolution. The following year, the Senate restored the rule to its pre-108th Congress form in the FY2005 budget resolution. The Senate agreed to S.Con.Res. 23 on March 26, with amendments, and later approved the conference report on H.Con.Res. 95 on April 11. The FY2004 budget resolution exempted legislation assumed in the budget and extended the rule through September 30, 2008. In 2004, modification of the Senate PAYGO rule was a significant issue during the FY2005 budget resolution discussions. Senator Feingold proposed an amendment to restore the Senate PAYGO rule to its previous form. During the 108th Congress, the Senate adopted the Feingold amendment to S.Con.Res. 95, which modified the PAYGO rule. The House-passed FY2005 budget resolution did not include any changes to the existing rule. The conference report included a provision similar to the Senate language but exempted reconciliation legislation. The 2003 version of the PAYGO rule remained in effect as the Senate did not consider the conference report. During the 109th Congress, the Senate considered modifications to the PAYGO rule but rejected amendments to restore it to its pre-108th Congress form. The 2003 version of the PAYGO rule continued to remain in effect. Senator Feingold proposed an amendment to remove the exemption for legislation assumed in the budget resolution, but it was rejected by the Senate. During the 109th Congress, the Senate rejected amendments to restore the PAYGO rule to its pre-108th Congress form. Senator Feingold's amendment to remove the exemption for legislation assumed in the budget resolution was also rejected. In the 110th Congress, the new Democratic leadership aimed to \"restore\" PAYGO rules and the House adopted its own PAYGO rule. The Senate modified its PAYGO rule in the FY2008 budget resolution, eliminating exemptions for direct spending and revenue changes assumed in the budget resolution. Senator Jeff Sessions proposed an amendment to exempt legislation extending tax relief provided in previous reconciliation measures. In 2001, 2003, and 2006, budget-related points of order were enacted, including the modified PAYGO point of order. The Senate rejected the Sessions amendment and agreed to S.Con.Res. 21. The Senate later approved the conference report for the FY2008 budget resolution, which included a modified version of the Senate-passed PAYGO rule. This rule generally prohibited legislation increasing the on-budget deficit in specific time periods. The Senate implemented a modified PAYGO point of order in 2001, 2003, and 2006. This rule prohibits legislation that would increase the on-budget deficit for specific time periods, as outlined in Section 4106 of H.Con.Res. 71 for FY2018. It includes applicable time periods such as the current fiscal year, the budget year, and the ensuing fiscal years. The Senate implemented a modified PAYGO point of order in 2001, 2003, and 2006 to prohibit legislation increasing the on-budget deficit for specific time periods. Direct spending legislation refers to bills affecting spending as defined by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, excluding certain resolutions and provisions related to deposit insurance. Estimates prepared under this subsection use the most recent budget surplus or deficit baseline. The Senate implemented a modified PAYGO point of order in 2001, 2003, and 2006 to prohibit legislation increasing the on-budget deficit for specific time periods. Direct spending or revenue legislation must increase the on-budget deficit when taken together with all enacted legislation since the beginning of the calendar year. The PAYGO rule prohibits legislation increasing the on-budget deficit and is dedicated to deficit reduction. Waivers require a three-fifths vote in the Senate. Budget levels are determined based on estimates for new budget authority, outlays, and revenues. Budget levels are determined based on estimates for new budget authority, outlays, and revenues made by the Senate Committee on the Budget."
