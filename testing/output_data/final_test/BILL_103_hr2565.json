    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes National Program Act\" and includes provisions for Lakewide Management Plans. Paragraph (4) of section 118(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1268(c)(4)) is amended to set deadlines for publishing Lakewide Management Plans for Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario. The final plan for Lake Michigan and Lake Superior must be published by January 1, 1995, while proposed plans for the other lakes must be published by January 1, 1998. Each plan must outline specific contents for management. Each Lakewide Management Plan must comply with Annex 2 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and assess the lake's environmental condition, including water and sediment quality. It should identify pollutants exceeding standards, describe their loadings, and distinguish between point and nonpoint sources. The Lakewide Management Plan must include a protection plan to restore and maintain the lake's integrity by identifying specific actions to reduce pollutants from point and nonpoint sources. This plan aims to ensure high water and sediment quality standards are met. The Lakewide Management Plan aims to restore and maintain the lake's integrity by reducing pollutants from various sources. It includes specific actions to meet water and sediment quality standards, protect indigenous wildlife, and provide a schedule for implementation. Cooperation with bordering states is required in plan development. The Lakewide Management Plan involves cooperation with bordering states, Canada, and the Great Lakes Policy Committee. SEC. 3. SEDIMENT CLEANUP. The Program Office will conduct 5 full-scale demonstration projects of promising technologies to remedy contaminated sediments at selected sites, with priority given to specific sites. The Program Office will complete engineering plans for full-scale demonstration projects by December 31, 1995, and finish the projects by December 31, 2000. The Program Office will conduct assessments of contaminated sediments at each area of concern and make recommendations on technologies for remediation based on the assessments. Previous relevant findings will be incorporated to avoid duplication of efforts. The Program Office will conduct pilot scale demonstration projects of promising technologies to remedy contaminated sediments at areas of concern if sufficient information is not available from assessments. Deadlines for these projects are set by the Program Office. The Program Office will conduct pilot scale demonstration projects of promising technologies to remedy contaminated sediments at areas of concern. Recommendations on technologies to remedy contaminated sediments will be transmitted to Congress by December 31, 1999, as part of a comprehensive report. The pilot scale demonstration projects under clause (ii) will include engineering plans and locations. By December 31, 2001, all projects must be completed, and a final report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress. The Program Office will assist in disseminating information on technologies to remedy contaminated sediments at areas of concern, including to Federal departments and agencies. Amendments to the Act include changes to headings for the 5-year plan and program, and study and demonstration projects. Amendments to the Act include changes to headings for the 5-year plan and program, and study and demonstration projects. Authorization of Appropriations for the Program Office is amended to $30,000,000 per fiscal year for fiscal years 1994 through 2000."
