    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Play in Sport Act of 2002\". The findings are also included in the Act. The National Commission on Sports and Substance Abuse found that doping is a serious problem in Olympic sports, threatening athlete health and the integrity of competition. There is a lack of comprehensive studies on the effects of performance-enhancing substances. The National Commission on Sports and Substance Abuse identified doping as a significant issue in Olympic sports, endangering athlete well-being and fair competition. Key challenges include developing accurate tests for performance-enhancing substances and accrediting testing labs globally. The US Government supports the United States Anti-Doping Agency financially and the National Institute of Standards and Technology is crucial for setting testing standards and accreditation procedures. SEC. 3. RESEARCH FOR TESTING OF PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING SUBSTANCES. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in collaboration with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, will establish a research program to enhance testing for prohibited performance-enhancing substances in the Olympic Games. The program will focus on developing tests for steroids, human growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor, ensuring the ability to test new banned substances, and creating standard reference materials for accurate measurements using the best available technology. Research projects should be evaluated based on the best available technology and peer-reviewed criteria, regardless of the sample specimen used. The National Institute of Standards and Technology assists the United States Anti-Doping Agency in accrediting testing laboratories and provides guidance on sampling and analysis procedures. The Institute limits its assistance to areas where it has technical competence. Additionally, research is conducted on the long-term consequences of using performance-enhancing substances. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in collaboration with the United States Anti-Doping Agency, will establish a research program to study the long-term effects of performance-enhancing substances. Research priorities include health effects and the efficacy of steroids. Population studies will not be limited to elite athletes but will also include adolescent athletes. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Authorization of appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and Technology includes $5,000,000 for sections 3 and 4, and $2,000,000 for section 5, for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007."
