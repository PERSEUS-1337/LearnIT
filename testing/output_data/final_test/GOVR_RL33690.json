    "content": "Federal nutrition program policies, farm support, and agriculture-related programs are governed by separate laws, often amended through an omnibus farm bill. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 reauthorized appropriations for the Food Stamp program and other domestic food aid programs. Congress is set to address the next farm bill in 2007 as many provisions expire at the end of FY2007. The provisions and authorizations for appropriations expire at the end of FY2007. Proposed changes affecting food stamps and other nutrition programs covered by the farm bill will likely play a major role in congressional consideration. This report details what happened in 2002 regarding nutrition programs under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture. The Food Stamp Act includes various block grant programs for Puerto Rico and American Samoa, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, Community Food Projects, and rules for providing federally acquired food commodities to domestic feeding programs. The 2002 farm bill introduced new programs and provisions in different areas. The 2002 farm bill introduced new programs and provisions, including a Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition program, a Fruit and Vegetable pilot program for schools, funding for purchasing fresh produce for schools, Congressional Hunger Fellowships, and changes to eligibility rules for military families and the WIC program. The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry has jurisdiction over these programs. The House Committee on Agriculture has limited jurisdiction, sharing provisions affecting school meal programs with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The 2002 farm bill, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act, was enacted on May 13, 2002, involving participation from multiple committees. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, renamed H.Rept. 107-424, made no significant changes to nutrition program provisions since its enactment. Unlike the 1996 farm bill, which mainly focused on welfare reform, the 2002 bill included major provisions for food stamps and other nutrition programs to garner support for farm legislation. The 2002 farm bill included major provisions for food stamps and other nutrition programs to garner support for farm legislation. The balance of new spending between domestic food assistance and other parts of the bill was a subject of negotiation and contention. Congress agreed to substantial added funding for programs covered by the bill, leading to debate on how the funding would be divided among different components. The Senate version provided more funding for nutrition programs than the House bill. The 2002 farm bill included provisions for food stamps and nutrition programs, with debate over funding allocation. The nutrition title claimed 5-6% of total spending, sparking discussions on food stamps, TEFAP, CSFP, and fresh produce initiatives. Key factors in the food stamp debate were low program participation, dissatisfaction with eligibility policies, and administrative issues. In 2001-2002, frustration with federal food stamp policies persisted, with concerns over noncitizen eligibility. Despite increasing enrollment, participation rates were low, hindering support for working poor families. State officials and advocates criticized eligibility rules for impeding effective administration and coordination of assistance. Poor families and others in need face challenges with overly complex policies and inadequate benefits in the federal food stamp program. Critics argue that the program's quality control system penalizes states too harshly, leading to over-administration and limited participation. Calls for simplified rules and greater state control have been made to address these issues. Advocates for federal food stamp reform seek greater state control, revamped benefit rules, and improved eligibility. They emphasize the need for quality control system revisions and support eligibility for legal noncitizens. Welfare reform supporters agree on quality control changes but stress the program's role in supporting the working poor as a priority. The food stamp program plays a crucial role in supporting the working poor as a priority. The farm bill's provisions responded to criticisms by easing administrative requirements, increasing benefits, and expanding eligibility for noncitizens. The Administration's reform package addressed concerns from states, advocates, and welfare reformers by providing benefit increases for larger households, standardizing federal rules, liberalizing eligibility rules, and including low-income noncitizens who have resided legally in the U.S. for 5 years. The Administration's reform package includes restructuring spending for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients, ending automatic eligibility for some welfare beneficiaries, and reforming the food stamp quality control system. Advocates and state representatives welcomed the proposals but had reservations about the extent of quality control reforms and restrictions on food stamp eligibility for welfare recipients. Federal food donations under TEFAP had increased, but many argued that federal help was not keeping pace with growing demand. The final farm bill addressed criticisms of underfunded food storage and distribution costs by increasing funding. Specific initiatives to expand fresh fruit and vegetable availability were included, such as a pilot project for schools. Disagreements between the House and Senate arose over new spending allocation and substantive issues regarding the Food Stamp program. The House and Senate had differing views on the Food Stamp program. The House bill aimed to increase benefits for families with children and streamline the application process, while the Senate bill included amendments to raise benefits for larger households and expand eligibility for noncitizens. The Senate bill went beyond the House measure by offering more state options and simplifying reporting requirements. The 2002 farm bill aimed to simplify food stamp eligibility rules, increase benefits for recipients with high shelter costs, relax work requirements for able-bodied adults, remove limits on work/training funds, and allow the use of food stamp benefits for dietary supplements. Congressional decision-makers used a cost estimate based on the April 2001 spending \"baseline\" despite a higher estimate in March 2002. The cost estimates for the nutrition title in the 2002 farm bill varied between the April 2001 and March 2002 versions. The April 2001 estimate projected a total cost of $2.66 billion in new budget authority and $3.17 billion in outlays over 6 years, with food stamp revisions accounting for the majority. In contrast, the March 2002 estimate predicted costs of $2.79 billion in new budget authority and $3.18 billion in outlays, with food stamps still being the main expense. There was no direct measure of the actual cost of the nutrition title in the 2002 farm bill. The 2002 farm bill's nutrition title led to unforeseen participation changes in domestic food assistance programs due to economic conditions. Actual costs were 12% higher than projected in FY2005, increasing to 20% when comparing to FY2006 and FY2007 estimates. The bill made significant changes and included new initiatives, with specific provisions outlined in a table. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill expanded eligibility for legally resident noncitizens, allowing more individuals to receive federal benefits regardless of their date of entry or length of residence in the United States. These changes accounted for the majority of the costs incurred under Title IV. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill increased food stamp benefits for larger households by adjusting the standard deduction and eligibility limits on liquid assets. It also provided states with new options to vary from regular food stamp rules, such as disregarding certain types of income and tracking household expenses. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill allowed states to disregard changes in household expenses and liquid assets when determining food stamp eligibility. It also gave states the option to require households to report changes in their circumstances every 6 months and provide up to 5 months of transitional food stamp benefits to those leaving the program. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill allowed states to provide up to 5 months of \"transitional\" food stamp benefits to individuals leaving the TANF program. The Food Stamp program's quality control system measures states' eligibility and benefit determinations, with penalties for high error rates over 3 years. Performance bonuses totaling $48 million a year were also introduced for states meeting certain criteria. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill introduced performance bonuses of $48 million a year for states meeting federal standards for high/most-improved performance. It also provided funding for employment and training programs for food stamp recipients, including up to $20 million a year for able-bodied adults without dependents. Additionally, Title IV consolidated nutrition assistance block grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa, increasing the grant slightly above regular inflation indexing levels. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill increased funding for TEFAP commodities and administration costs, as well as CSFP administrative costs. It also required schools to disregard housing allowances for military personnel when determining eligibility for free and reduced-price school meals. Additionally, Puerto Rico's share of the new grant was set at 99.6%, and the Agriculture Department was required to spend up to $5 million a year on grants to improve program access. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill increased funding for community food projects, authorized a program to encourage the purchase of locally produced foods, established a Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition program with mandatory funding, and implemented a pilot program for free fruit and vegetables in schools with funding for the 2002-2003 school year. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 extended and expanded a project related to the farm bill, providing $50 million annually for fresh fruit and vegetable purchases for schools. A Congressional Hunger Fellows program was authorized but funded through Agriculture Department appropriations. Notable proposals for changes in the Food Stamp program were not included in the 2002 farm bill. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill did not include provisions to raise benefits for those with high shelter costs, ease work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, or allow states to conform their method of reviewing food stamp eligibility to other public assistance programs. Title IV of the 2002 farm bill did not include proposals to allow food stamp benefits for dietary supplements. Issues not addressed in the 2002 bill may resurface in the 2007 farm bill, such as restricting eligibility, increasing benefits for high shelter costs, and quality control error rates."
