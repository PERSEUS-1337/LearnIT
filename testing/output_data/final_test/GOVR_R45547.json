    "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is used to advance U.S. interests, with aid programs tailored to the diverse needs of countries in the region. Some countries receive assistance for political, socioeconomic, and security challenges, while others no longer receive traditional development aid but still get support for security issues. Congress authorizes and oversees foreign assistance, with the Trump Administration proposing significant reductions. The Trump Administration has proposed significant reductions in foreign assistance expenditures to shift resources to other budget priorities, including those in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress would need to approve any shifts in aid funding levels or priorities. This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to the region, historical and recent trends in aid, the Administration's FY2019 budget request, and how scaling back assistance could affect U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 1946 and 2017, the United States provided over $88 billion in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. Aid spiked in the 1960s with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, aimed at countering Soviet and Cuban influence. Support increased again in the 1980s to prevent Soviet allies from gaining footholds in the region. Aid flows declined in the mid-1990s. U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean declined in the mid-1990s but began to increase again in the late 1990s. The higher levels of assistance were due to increased spending on humanitarian and development aid, including assistance after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and the establishment of new aid programs like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Haiti also received significant assistance after a massive earthquake in 2010. The U.S. provided significant assistance to Haiti after a massive earthquake in 2010. Increased funding for counternarcotics and security programs also contributed to higher levels of aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors. President George W. Bush announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008 to combat drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America. Congress and the Obama Administration split the Central American portion of the initiative into the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) in FY2010. The U.S. provided assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean through programs like the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. Assistance began to decline in FY2011 due to budget cuts and changes in the region, with some countries now able to provide technical assistance. Some nations have expelled U.S. personnel, leading to the closure of USAID offices. The U.S. government has concentrated foreign assistance resources in fewer countries and sectors, with aid levels rebounding since FY2014. The Trump Administration requested $1.1 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2019, which was significantly less than the previous year's appropriation. The Administration also proposed eliminating the Inter-American Foundation and consolidating its programs into USAID, with proposed reductions for the region exceeding those for the global. The Trump Administration proposed significant reductions in foreign aid for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2019, with cuts greater than the global foreign aid budget. Congress did not adopt many of the proposed cuts. $515.9 million was requested for a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) to consolidate aid for democracy, rule of law, economic reform, education, agriculture, and natural resource management in the region. The ESDF would focus on short-term U.S. security in critical countries and programs. The FY2019 request for Latin America and the Caribbean included significant reductions in foreign aid, with cuts greater than the global foreign aid budget. The proposed $515.9 million for the Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) would focus on critical countries and programs for short-term U.S. security objectives. The request also included funding for Global Health Programs (GHP) accounts, with declines in funding for HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health programs compared to FY2018. The Administration's FY2019 request for Latin America and the Caribbean included $442.9 million for security assistance programs, with reductions in INCLE and NADR funding compared to FY2018 estimates. The Trump Administration's FY2019 foreign assistance request for Latin America and the Caribbean included reductions in funding for various programs. This included a $1.5 million decrease in IMET funding and a $66 million decrease in FMF funding compared to the FY2018 estimate. Additionally, there was a proposed $191 million cut in funding for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The Trump Administration's FY2019 foreign assistance request for Latin America and the Caribbean included reductions in funding for various programs. This included decreased funding for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, with significant cuts for countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Additionally, there was a proposed reduction in aid to Colombia for counternarcotics efforts. Colombia has received significant U.S. assistance for counternarcotics and counterterrorism efforts since FY2000. The FY2019 request included funds for implementing the peace accord with FARC, fostering reconciliation, expanding state presence in FARC-controlled regions, and supporting rural economic development. Haiti, facing development challenges, was the second-largest recipient of U.S. assistance in the region in FY2019. Assistance to Haiti increased after the 2010 earthquake but has since declined. The Administration's FY2019 request included $170.5 million for Haiti to improve food security, economic opportunity, governance, and health challenges. This represented an 8% cut compared to the FY2018 estimate. Mexico would have received $78.9 million, a 48% cut compared to FY2018, for initiatives such as strengthening the rule of law, securing borders, and combating organized crime. The FY2019 request included $36.2 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), a 37% cut compared to FY2018. The CBSI funds security cooperation, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice-sector reform, and crime prevention programs in the region. Additionally, the Trump Administration's budget proposed eliminating the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) and merging its programs into USAID. The IAF was established in 1969 to provide independent foreign assistance after government-to-government programs were deemed ineffective. The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) provides grants directly to the organized poor in 20 countries to foster economic and social development. The Trump Administration proposed merging IAF's programs into USAID for better integration and efficiency. The FY2019 request included $3.5 million for an orderly IAF closeout and $20 million for other programs. The FY2019 request included $3.5 million for an orderly IAF closeout and $20 million for small grants in Latin America and the Caribbean. Opponents of the merger argued that USAID may not maintain the IAF's unique model and flexibility. President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, which includes funding for foreign assistance programs in the region. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 includes funding for foreign assistance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, with significant amounts designated for key U.S. initiatives in Central America, Colombia, and Mexico exceeding the Administration's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provides funding for key U.S. initiatives in Central America and Colombia, exceeding the Administration's request. Central America receives $527.6 million, $92 million more than requested. The Secretary of State has flexibility in allocating funds based on countries' commitment to reduce illegal migration and corruption. Colombia receives \"not less than\" $418.3 million, nearly $153 million more than requested. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provides additional funding for key U.S. initiatives in Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. Colombia receives $418.3 million to bolster drug eradication and security efforts. Mexico receives $162.7 million to support security and border control programs. Venezuela receives at least $17.5 million for democracy and rule of law promotion programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provides funding for key U.S. initiatives in Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, including assistance for Venezuelan refugees and migrants. The act allocates $22.5 million for the Inter-American Foundation and designates an additional $10 million for programs in Central America. The Trump Administration's foreign assistance cutbacks could impact U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean, potentially shifting towards other forms of bilateral engagement and increasing the Department of Defense's role in security cooperation. The Department of Defense is increasing its role in U.S. security cooperation in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Administration's proposed foreign assistance cuts, along with the region's economic ties with China, may lead to a decline in U.S. influence. Many countries in the region have made progress in democratic governance and living conditions. Budget cuts have led to a reduction in U.S. assistance, forcing agencies to focus on fewer countries. Budget cuts have led to a reduction in U.S. assistance efforts in Latin America, with field offices closing in several countries. The Trump Administration's desire to reduce foreign assistance funding could lead to further aid transitions, as seen in the FY2019 budget request targeting countries like Brazil, Jamaica, and Nicaragua. The Administration may push for additional cuts in the future, as outlined in the National Security Strategy released in December 2017. The United States' strategy, released in December 2017, aims to shift towards attracting private capital and promoting self-reliance in development partnerships. Experts emphasize the need for strategic transitions to ensure sustainability and prevent disruptions in bilateral relations. Successful transitions require careful planning and coordination across governments and stakeholders. The U.S. government, along with partner-country governments and international donors, believe a timeline of three to five years is needed for transition. Ending foreign aid for a country doesn't mean an immediate halt to assistance programs. Congress typically provides aid for Latin America and the Caribbean with a timeframe of up to six years for expenditure. The U.S. could stay engaged with partners in the region through various means as development programs wind down. The U.S. government could utilize smaller, more nimble programs like those managed by the IAF to maintain its presence in remote areas and build relationships with local leaders as large-scale development programs are closed out. Partner countries could be assisted in mobilizing private capital through trade agreements, investment agreements, loan guarantees, and technical assistance from the IDFC. Trilateral cooperation initiatives could be established to jointly fund and implement programs in third countries. Congress has shown interest in influencing aid transitions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 directed USAID to submit a report to Congress on aid transitions, including conditions, benchmarks, costs, and post-transition plans. USAID uses 17 metrics to assess self-reliance of countries and conducts consultative assessments for potential transition models. Jamaica is one of two countries selected for this process. The Trump Administration's focus on U.S. national security objectives in Latin America and the Caribbean is evident in the FY2019 foreign assistance request for the region. USAID is testing a new strategic transition process in Jamaica, with Congress potentially requiring additional information on the agency's framework for strategic transitions. For example, H.R. 6385 in the 115th Congress would have mandated regular consultation with Congress and development stakeholders on transitioning nations from assistance recipients to enduring partners. The Administration's FY2019 budget proposal would reduce State Department-managed security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by 33% compared to FY2018. Some analysts suggest that cuts to State Department programs could be offset by increased support from DOD, which is authorized to provide security assistance to foreign nations. The FY2019 budget proposal would reduce State Department-managed security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by 33% compared to FY2018. DOD is required to submit formal budget requests for security cooperation efforts, including specific regions, with a request of $55.1 million for security cooperation in the areas of responsibility of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command. The FY2019 budget proposal would reduce State Department-managed security assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean by 33% compared to FY2018. DOD's request for security cooperation in the region is $55.1 million, excluding funds for drug interdiction and counter-drug activities. The lack of specific country-by-country data in DOD's request makes it challenging to assess the extent of planned activities and potential overlap with State Department programs. The lack of specific country-by-country data in DOD's security assistance programs may hinder congressional efforts to establish budget priorities and shape U.S. assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean. Congress could use legislation to clarify the information it expects to receive from DOD. In recent years, U.S. assistance in Latin America has focused on reducing illicit drug production, ending internal conflicts in Colombia, combating organized crime in Mexico, and addressing root causes of unauthorized migration from Central America. Some analysts and officials see the Administration's cuts in foreign aid as part of a trend of U.S. disengagement from the region. President Trump's actions, such as withdrawing from trade agreements and imposing tariffs, have raised concerns about the U.S. commitment to Latin America. Some analysts warn of a leadership vacuum in Latin America due to President Trump's absence at the Summit of the Americas, leading to increased Chinese influence in the region. Research shows declining approval of U.S. leadership in the region, with only 31% approving in 2018. Declining approval of U.S. leadership in Latin America, with only 31% approval in 2018. Concerns raised in Congress about foreign assistance cuts weakening U.S. influence globally. House and Senate Appropriations Committees criticize proposed reductions to diplomatic and development operations as counterproductive. The United States is perceived to be retreating from its role as a superpower, influencing Congress's decision not to adopt proposed foreign assistance cuts for FY2019."
