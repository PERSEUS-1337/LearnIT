    "content": "The \"Conservation Enhancement Act of 2001\" includes provisions for the extension and additional funding of conservation programs through 2012. It also outlines substantive changes to programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. The \"Conservation Enhancement Act of 2001\" extends conservation programs through 2012 and introduces pilot programs for endangered species and critical habitats, full enrollment of authorized acreage, expanded haying and grazing, and wetlands reserve program enhancements. The \"Conservation Enhancement Act of 2001\" extends conservation programs through 2012 by amending various sections of the Food Security Act of 1985 related to environmental conservation, wetland reserves, and wildlife habitat incentives. The \"Conservation Enhancement Act of 2001\" extends conservation programs through 2012 by amending the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. SEC. 102 of the Conservation Enhancement Act of 2001 provides additional funding for environmental conservation programs, amending the Food Security Act of 1985 and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 to allocate more resources for conservation efforts. SEC. 201 amends the Food Security Act to include best management practices approved by the Secretary. SEC. 202 changes the timing of payments under the Act. SEC. 203 reduces the contract term from 5 to 3 years. SEC. 204 adjusts the federal share of cost-share payments. SEC. 204 amends the federal share of cost-share payments. SEC. 205 allows for multi-year availability of funds. SEC. 206 addresses conservation priority areas and issues. Section 1240B(e)(1) of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to repeal the limitation on assistance for confined animal feeding operations. Section 1240C is also amended to reserve funds for conservation priority areas, with a new limitation on the total amount of funds that can be used for land management practices in these areas. Priority funding for confined livestock feeding operations is recommended by Congress, regardless of the operation's size. This priority includes implementing land and structural practices for producers who own or operate confined animal feeding operations. Subtitle B--Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program: Pilot programs to prevent listing of endangered species and preserve critical habitats. Section 387 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 is amended to include pilot programs supporting local initiatives to prevent the listing of endangered species and preserve critical habitats. $40,000,000 will be allocated for these programs from 2003 to 2012, with a limit of two programs per region in the United States. Participation in pilot programs funded under subsection (c) of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 is voluntary. Participants receiving cost-share payments will not face penalties or increased land use regulations if a threatened or endangered species is found on the preserved wildlife habitat. Participants will retain rights to control access to private property despite receiving payments under this section. Subtitle C--Conservation Reserve Program\n\nSEC. 221. FULL ENROLLMENT OF AUTHORIZED ACREAGE.\n\nSection 1231(d) of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to ensure full enrollment of authorized acreage.\n\nSEC. 222. ADDITIONAL PILOT PROGRAM. Section 1231(b) of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include a new subsection for a Pilot Program addressing local and regional conservation issues. The Secretary is authorized to enroll up to 10,000,000 acres in the conservation reserve program under this subsection. Pilot programs will evaluate using the program to support local and regional conservation efforts, with grants and agreements made with public and private entities. The Secretary can conduct up to 10 pilot programs enrolling a maximum of 1,000,000 acres each. Eligible lands include those described in subsection (b) and croplands/pasture lands with suitable habitat for threatened species. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 allows lands used for agriculture to remain in production after enrollment for conservation purposes. SEC. 223. EXPANDED HAYING AND GRAZING. Section 1232(a)(7)(A) of the Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to allow for harvesting or grazing of forage on land if it enhances vegetative cover quality and is conducted at approved stocking rates. The Food Security Act of 1985 allows grazing on land under a contract for growing winter-seeded crops. SEC. 224. PROTECTION OF FARM PROGRAM BASE. Amends Section 1236 of the Food Security Act of 1985 to require protection of farm program base. Subtitle D--Wetlands Reserve Program. SEC. 231. INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED MAXIMUM ENROLLMENT. Amends enrollment numbers under the Food Security Act of 1985. SEC. 232. ENROLLMENT METHODS. SEC. 232 of the Food Security Act of 1985 amends enrollment methods for the wetlands reserve program, allowing up to 1,000,000 acres to be enrolled using permanent easements. The remaining acreage can be enrolled in 30-year easements or restoration cost-share agreements. SEC. 241 of the Food Security Act of 1985 emphasizes the need for $1 billion annually to restore staffing and technical assistance levels for the Natural Resources Conservation Service to pre-1985 levels. This funding is crucial for delivering conservation programs and supporting producers in implementing successful initiatives."
