    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 11658 of the Insurance Code in California states that a workers' compensation insurance policy or endorsement cannot be issued by an insurer unless the form or endorsement is filed with the rating organization and approved by the commissioner within 30 days. An ancillary agreement in California cannot be issued by an insurer to an employer without filing a copy with the rating organization and receiving approval from the commissioner within 30 days. An ancillary agreement in California between an insurer and a California employer with a deductible obligation or retrospectively rated loss limitation of $250,000 or more is exempt from certain provisions, provided the employer meets specific criteria. An ancillary agreement in California between an insurer and a California employer is subject to specific criteria, including having 500 or more employees, an annual nationwide payroll exceeding $20 million, and a workers' compensation manual standard premium over $1 million. This does not apply to agreements under coemployment arrangements or managed by a managing general agent. The agreement must not exceed a deductible obligation or loss limitation of $250,000. An ancillary agreement in California must adhere to specific criteria and cannot amend coverage, costs, or benefits under a workers' compensation policy without approval. The terms of the policy take precedence over the agreement in case of inconsistency. An insurer in California must provide a draft of any ancillary agreement to the employer's insurance agent when offering workers' compensation coverage. The insurer must also notify the insurance commissioner of the ancillary agreement within 30 days of issuance, but approval from the commissioner is not required. An ancillary agreement described in paragraph (2) must state that it has not been filed with the rating organization or approved by the commissioner. This applies to agreements issued or renewed after January 1, 2017. If the commissioner finds a policy form, endorsement, or ancillary agreement non-compliant with the law, the insurer cannot issue it. The commissioner can withdraw a policy form, endorsement, or ancillary agreement without affecting the policyholder's compensation or insurer substitution in workers' compensation proceedings. Collateral and security agreements must be negotiated at policy inception or renewal, with any subsequent revisions agreed upon by both parties. Limited policies submitted for approval are not covered by this section. The definition of \"ancillary agreement\" for insurance policies is a supplementary contract that modifies the obligations of the insured or insurer. It excludes certain types of endorsements and agreements. \"California employer\" is defined as an employer with a majority of payroll in California. A coemployment arrangement involves utilizing a third party for worker services for compensation. A collateral and security agreement is between a California employer and insurer under specific programs. The curr_chunk outlines important details regarding payments, funding, collateral, payment due dates, claims administration, termination provisions, and default terms under a collateral and security agreement. Additionally, it defines a \"customized limiting and restricting endorsement\" as a unique endorsement used for specific policy circumstances. The curr_chunk explains situations where an employer's business makes it difficult to determine the extent of workers' compensation coverage, to prevent hazardous work conditions, and to avoid encouraging illegal operations. It also defines a \"limiting and restricting endorsement\" as an exclusion from workers' compensation coverage that can be added to a policy after approval by the Insurance Commissioner. Section 11658 of the Insurance Code states that a workers' compensation insurance policy cannot be issued in California without the insurer filing a copy of the form with the rating organization and receiving approval from the commissioner within 30 days. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2022, unless extended by a later statute. Section 11658.5 of the Insurance Code specifies that if the commissioner deems a filed form or endorsement non-compliant, the insurer cannot issue any policy in that form. The withdrawal of a form by the commissioner does not affect the policyholder's compensation or insurer substitution in workers' compensation proceedings. Limited policies submitted for approval are exempt from this section, which becomes effective on January 1, 2022. Section 11658.5 of the Insurance Code requires insurers to disclose to California employers the option to negotiate choice of law and venue in dispute resolution agreements for workers' compensation insurance policies. The agreement can be negotiated before any disputes arise. Section 11658.5 of the Insurance Code allows California employers to negotiate choice of law and venue in dispute resolution agreements for workers' compensation insurance policies. Failure to comply results in default to California law. The section applies to employers with a majority of payroll in California and is effective until January 1, 2022. Section 11658.5 of the Insurance Code requires insurers offering workers' compensation insurance to California employers to disclose that choice of law and venue in dispute resolution agreements may be outside California and negotiable. Employers must sign the disclosure if they accept coverage, and agreements can be negotiated before any disputes arise. The Insurance Commissioner's authority is not affected by this section. Insurers must comply with California law or default to California for dispute resolution. A \"California employer\" is defined as one with a majority of payroll in California. This section takes effect on January 1, 2022."
