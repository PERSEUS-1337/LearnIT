    "content": "In FY2006, the federal government's real property portfolio included 3.87 billion square feet of office space. The General Services Administration manages 8,847 buildings with an estimated value of $68.8 billion. GSA is responsible for building design, construction, and safety for federal employees and visitors. The federal government lacked building security standards during the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, prompting President Clinton to order the DOJ to assess vulnerability and develop minimum security recommendations. The U.S. Marshals Service coordinated two committees to address this issue. The Standards Committee, consisting of security experts and representatives from various agencies, developed minimum security standards for federal facilities. These standards cover perimeter buffer zones, entrances and exits, employee and visitor identification, garage entrances, day care center locations, and closed-circuit television monitoring. Federal buildings were categorized into five levels with corresponding security standards based on factors like building size and agency mission. Level I, II, III, and IV federal buildings are categorized based on factors like building size, number of federal employees, and public access. Level II buildings, such as the Social Security Administration Office in El Dorado, CO, have 2,500 to 80,000 sq. ft. of space and 11 to 150 federal employees. Level III buildings occupy 80,000 to 150,000 sq. ft. and house 151 to 450 federal employees with moderate to high public access. Level IV facilities occupy over 150,000 sq. ft. and house more than 450 federal employees. Level IV facilities have more than 150,000 sq. ft. of space and house over 450 federal employees. Level V facilities, critical to national security, include buildings like the CIA headquarters and the Pentagon. The Profile Committee inspected 1,200 federal facilities to gather security data for upgrading conditions to meet proposed standards. The 1995 Vulnerability Assessment report set broad security standards for federal facilities, leading President Clinton to direct agencies to upgrade their security to meet the recommended standards. E.O. 12977 was issued to establish a permanent Interagency Security. President Clinton issued E.O. 12977 in 1995 to establish the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) within the executive branch. Chaired by the GSA Administrator, the ISC included representatives from various executive branch agencies and was tasked with addressing government-wide security for federal facilities. Other members included officials like the Director of USMS and the Assistant Commissioner of the Federal Protective Service. The ISC was authorized to consult with other parties, such as the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, to fulfill its duties. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) was established by President Clinton in 1995 through E.O. 12977 to enhance security for federal facilities. ISC's duties included developing security policies, sharing intelligence, evaluating technology for security upgrades, setting construction standards for high-risk facilities, and maintaining a centralized security database. The 1995 Vulnerability Assessment report guided security standards for existing facilities but lacked criteria for design and construction. In 1997, GSA established design standards for new federal buildings to protect employees. The ISC worked on integrating security standards into all building phases, considering technology, cost, and public access. In 2001, the ISC issued Security Design Criteria for New buildings. In May 2001, the ISC issued Security Design Criteria for federal buildings, including glazing protection, setback distances, vehicular access control, and air intake security. In July 2001, minimum standards for building access procedures were set. Draft documents on entry security technology and preparedness for attacks were not officially issued. The September 2001 terrorist attacks raised concerns about building vulnerability. Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, the ISC issued revised procedures for potential vehicle bomb attacks on federal buildings, recommending a minimum distance of 20 to 50 feet from perimeter barriers. Despite completing Security Design Criteria, a 2002 GAO report noted little progress in other responsibilities, with only two of 13 working groups still active. GAO also highlighted the ISC's effectiveness being hindered by GSA's lack of aggressive leadership. The ISC's effectiveness was hindered by GSA's lack of aggressive leadership and support, as the agency failed to issue operating procedures and provide sufficient staff support and funding. Congressional enactment of the Homeland Security Act centralized efforts to respond to terrorism, transferring the ISC chairmanship to the Secretary of Homeland Security in 2003. Within DHS, the ISC chairmanship was delegated to the Director of the Federal Protective Service in 2004. The ISC's challenges in integrating security initiatives led to GAO recommending a plan with resource needs and time frames in 2004. DHS is assisting the ISC in creating a centralized security database and updating security standards for federal facilities. The ISC updated its Security Design Criteria for Federal Office Buildings in 2004, with responsibilities to review federal agencies' physical security plans. DHS assigned implementation responsibilities to protect critical infrastructure and key resources from terrorist attacks. The ISC was designated in 2004 to oversee and review agency security plans. The ISC's responsibilities include overseeing federal agencies' security plans and protecting critical infrastructure. The ISC aims to improve security programs by setting standards and integrating updated security technologies. The current projects involve updating the Vulnerability Assessment Report to align with agencies' missions and strategic plans. The ISC is working on better security policies and directives to gain consensus and compliance within the federal community, aiming for greater accountability and oversight to integrate physical security initiatives successfully for the government."
