    "content": "Variance reduction methods like SVRG and SpiderBoost require more computational resources than SGD. To reduce the cost, a sparse gradient operator blending top-K and randomized coordinate descent operators is introduced. The algorithm shows that a sparse gradient based on past gradients' magnitudes reduces computational cost without significant variance reduction loss, being at least as good as SpiderBoost theoretically. Our algorithm outperforms SpiderBoost in image classification tasks by capturing gradient sparsity efficiently. It minimizes the finite sum objective in machine learning applications using batch SGD as a prototype for stochastic gradient methods. The batch size in stochastic gradient descent impacts variance and gradient query complexity. Lower variance improves convergence rate, allowing for increased learning rates. New variance reduction techniques blend large and small batch gradients to further enhance optimization algorithms. The text discusses variance reduction techniques in optimization algorithms, such as SpiderBoost, which are proven to be better than SGD in various settings. A novel approach is introduced to reduce computational complexity using gradient sparsity estimates, leading to algorithmic improvements and experimental evidence of sparsity. The paper introduces a sparse variance reduction algorithm based on SCSG and SpiderBoost. It demonstrates the benefits of sparsity in deep neural networks, improving convergence rate by reducing variance and computational complexity. Additional experiments in natural language processing and sparse matrix factorization show competitive performance compared to SGD baselines.

An operator is defined to select specific entries in a vector based on their absolute values, reducing computational complexity. SpiderBoost with Sparse Gradients algorithm is detailed, including inner and outer loops, geometric random variables generation, and the \"geometrization\" trick proposed by Lei & Jordan (2017). The \"geometrization\" trick proposed by Lei & Jordan (2017) simplifies analysis and is applied in theory to make arguments clean and readable. In nonconvex optimization, the output is taken as uniformly random elements from the set of last iterates in each outer loop. Similar to Aji & Heafield (2017), a memory vector is maintained at each iteration of the algorithm. The algorithm uses an exponential moving average to approximate the variance of gradient coordinates. The rtop k1,k2 operator targets high variance gradient coordinates and randomly selected coordinates. The cost is dominated by selecting the top k coordinates with linear complexity. Details for sparse back-propagation can be found in the appendix. Sampling an index and accessing gradient pairs incurs a unit cost, while accessing the truncated version incurs (k1 + k2)/d units of cost. The algorithm uses an exponential moving average to approximate the variance of gradient coordinates. The computational cost of selecting the top k coordinates is linear. The complexity analysis involves defining the Euclidean norm, geometric distribution, and variance of stochastic gradients. The worst-case guarantee for achieving certain conditions is provided. The complexity of SpiderBoost is also mentioned. Sparse SpiderBoost has the same complexity as SpiderBoost under appropriate settings, with a penalty term due to information loss by sparsification. The algorithm aims to capture sparsity, resulting in small values for certain variables. The complexity analysis involves defining parameters and setting conditions to achieve certain outcomes. In practice, the algorithm's complexity is affected by the size of m compared to b. Experiments were conducted to showcase Sparse SpiderBoost's performance and the potential of sparsity. Sparse SpiderBoost aims to improve gradient query complexity through sparsity. Performance is evaluated on image classification tasks, natural language processing, and sparse matrix factorization. Experiments use specific parameters and sparsity levels to test various tasks and plot learning curves. Sparse SpiderBoost aims to improve gradient query complexity through sparsity in classification tasks. Experiments involve testing neural networks on datasets like CIFAR-10, SVHN, and MNIST, with a focus on the magnitude of derivative of model parameters. The method includes updating estimates of variance using entropy calculations. The entropy of the probability vector p is used to measure the structure in gradients during Sparse SpiderBoost experiments on various datasets and model architectures. Results show the entropy of the memory vector before and after training for each model. The entropy of the memory vector before and after training is analyzed for different models. The convolutional model shows a drop in entropy from 15.92 to 3 after 150 epochs, indicating a significant gradient structure. Results suggest that gradient structure is more dependent on the model rather than the dataset. Sparsity in training a convolutional neural network on MNIST provides an advantage over using SpiderBoost alone. Training Resnet-18 on CIFAR-10 also shows promising results. SpiderBoost algorithm works well on large neural networks and non-trivial datasets. It is further evaluated on an LSTM model trained on the MovieLens database. SpiderBoost is tested with a learning rate schedule that changes from 1.0 to 0.1 within the inner loop iterations. In the inner loop, the learning rate changes from 1.0 to 0.1. SpiderBoost is slightly worse than SGD, but sparsity improves performance. Sparse gradients with memory can enhance gradient query complexity in variance reduction algorithms. Our algorithm improves complexity over SpiderBoost by capturing sparsity structure. Entropy experiment supports gradient sparsity hypothesis. Comparison to SpiderBoost validates algorithm performance. Top k operator outperforms random k operator. Algorithm performs no worse than SpiderBoost in settings without structure. Results in natural language processing and matrix factorization show variance reduction with extra engineering effort. Our algorithm improves complexity by capturing sparsity structure and shows variance reduction in natural language processing and matrix factorization with extra engineering effort. Further improvements can be made in better utilization of reduced variance during training and control over increased variance in high-dimensional models. The proof of Lemmas 6, 7, and 8 involves taking expectations over randomness in different loops of Algorithm 1 and applying various equations to show the results. The complexity of the algorithm is improved by capturing sparsity structure and reducing variance in natural language processing and matrix factorization. Further enhancements can be made to better utilize reduced variance during training and control increased variance in high-dimensional models. The proof involves applying Lemmas 6, 7, and 8 to show key results on one inner loop. A weakness is the technical difficulty of implementing sparse backpropagation in modern machine learning libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch. The optimal implementation requires a sparse forward pass and a sparse computation graph for backpropagation, which is easily achieved in libraries like Pytorch. The algorithm performs best on libraries supporting dynamic computation graphs. The forward pass of a deep neural network involves minimizing a constrained optimization problem. Applying the rtop k1,k2 operator reduces the number of multiplications in the forward pass. A sparse forward-pass yields a computation graph for a (k1 + k2)-parameter model. The experiments involved a convolutional neural network with specific layer configurations and a natural language processing model with specific dimensions. The LSTM model used a variance reduction training algorithm and was described as a classifier. The algorithm for the model involves a classifier with cross entropy loss and dependence on s i. The dataset is split into sequences and stored in matrices for processing. State is maintained for batches at different time scales using different matrices."
