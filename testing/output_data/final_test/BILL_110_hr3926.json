Congress recognizes the importance of mitigation planning in saving lives, protecting properties, and developing disaster-resistant communities. Recent studies show that enforcing State building codes reduces property damage and personal injury during disasters. Modern building codes ensure the protection of residential and commercial structures from natural disasters, providing assurance of minimum standards for safety. Active enforcement of building codes based on nationally recognized models reduces the need for public disaster aid, promotes sustainable communities, and contributes to the durability of structures. Federal assistance is provided to States for mitigation efforts under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Federal mitigation assistance aims to encourage States to adopt and enforce building codes as part of a comprehensive disaster loss reduction plan. The purpose of federal mitigation assistance is to encourage states to implement building codes as part of disaster loss reduction plans. The Act aims to reduce property loss, improve property quality, and minimize damage by incentivizing the adoption and enforcement of State building codes. It also emphasizes the coordination of State and local activities for hazard evaluation and mitigation. The Act promotes the adoption of a nationally applicable model building code for State-sponsored mitigation projects to address natural hazards. The Act promotes the adoption of a nationally applicable model building code for State-sponsored mitigation projects to address natural hazards. Additionally, there is a provision for additional mitigation assistance. Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to allow for an increase in federal contributions for states with approved building codes during a major disaster declaration. The increase is equal to 4 percent of the estimated grants for the disaster. Under paragraph (1), a State must submit its building code to the President every 6 years for approval. The President will approve the code if it aligns with a nationally recognized model, is adopted within 6 years of the model code, and uses it as a minimum standard. Definitions for \"actively enforcing\" are provided in this subsection. Definitions for \"actively enforcing\" and \"nationally recognized model building code\" are provided in this subsection. \"Actively enforcing\" refers to the effective implementation of all phases of a State building code, while a \"nationally recognized model building code\" is a code developed in an open consensus forum with input from national experts. The term 'State building code' refers to requirements and standards for residential and commercial construction implemented statewide to ensure the safety and welfare of building users against natural disasters. The State building code sets requirements and standards for residential and commercial construction to ensure safety. These regulations apply to construction activities of residential building contractors for single-family and 2-family structures, as well as engineers, architects, designers, and commercial building contractors for commercial, industrial, and multifamily structures. The President, through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, must establish regulations within 180 days of enactment. The Administrator of FEMA will issue necessary regulations to implement the State building code requirements for construction activities. SEC. 5. PREDISASTER HAZARD MITIGATION. Section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include the establishment and operation of a building department for enforcing State building codes. Section 203(g) is also amended to include criteria for assistance awards. The amendment adds a new paragraph (10) regarding the implementation of a State building code approved under section 404(d) by State or local governments."
