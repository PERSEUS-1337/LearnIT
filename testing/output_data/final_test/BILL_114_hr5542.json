    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicaid and CHIP Quality Improvement Act of 2016\". Congress finds that despite significant spending on care for Americans through Medicaid and CHIP programs, there is no systematic method for reporting, collecting, evaluating, or improving the quality of care across all payment and delivery systems. Quality of care in Medicaid health plans is measured but there is no systematic way to improve care for all beneficiaries. Federal requirements for comparable care are lacking for most Medicaid and CHIP enrollees. Currently, there are no Federal requirements for monitoring or improving the quality of care for Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, leading to a lack of ability to make fair assessments across all modes of care. State flexibility in these programs allows for innovation, but without a systematic way to measure quality, policymakers cannot determine the most effective innovations. SEC. 3. MEASURING AND REPORTING ON COMPARABLE HEALTH CARE QUALITY MEASURES FOR ALL PERSONS ENROLLED IN MEDICAID. The amendment to the Social Security Act includes quality assurance standards for primary care providers and health care services in fee-for-service settings. Additionally, there are updates to quality measures for adult health reporting in Medicaid. The Secretary will require States to use specified measures and approaches to report on quality measures for Medicaid eligible adults, stratified by delivery system, starting 2 years after the Medicaid and CHIP Quality Improvement Act of 2016. The Secretary will have discretion to further stratify reporting on quality measures for Medicaid eligible adults based on factors like eligibility category or income level, in addition to the required stratification by delivery system. In subsection (b)(2), revisions are made for quality measures for Medicaid eligible adults receiving health services through managed care, primary care case management, and fee-for-service settings. Pediatric health care measures are also included. Beginning in January of the calendar year two years after the Medicaid and CHIP Quality Improvement Act of 2016, States must report pediatric health care measures annually as required by the Secretary. The Secretary requires annual reporting of pediatric health care measures by States starting two years after the Medicaid and CHIP Quality Improvement Act of 2016. Reporting must be stratified by delivery system, with certain measures exempt from stratification if deemed infeasible or incomparable. The Secretary has discretion to further stratify reporting on measures based on factors like eligibility category or income level. In subsection (c), revisions are made to core measures described in subsection (a) and comparable primary care case management services providers. The amendments made in this subsection will take effect as if included in the enactment of section 1905(t) for healthcare services providers and analysis of quality measures for children receiving health services through various delivery systems. The amendments made in this subsection shall take effect as if included in the enactment of section 1139A of the Social Security Act, as added by the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009. SEC. 4. PERFORMANCE BONUSES FOR SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT IN MEDICAID AND CHIP QUALITY PERFORMANCE. The Social Security Act is amended to establish a Medicaid Quality Performance Bonus fund for awarding bonuses to States for high performance on quality measures related to the goals of the Medicaid program. The Secretary will establish a methodology for awarding these bonuses annually. Medicaid quality performance bonuses will be awarded based on annual State reports and regulations by the Secretary. Bonuses will be given to the top 5 States with superior quality performance and the 5 States showing the greatest improvement in quality performance. The Medicaid quality performance bonuses are based on State reports and regulations by the Secretary. The total amount for all fiscal years is $500,000,000. Funds must be used for quality improvement activities to receive the bonus. State must allocate 75% of bonus funds for quality-related initiatives benefiting providers and managed care entities. Initiatives include pay-for-performance programs, collaboration initiatives, and quality improvement projects for special populations. State may establish criteria for the performance program to limit awards to specific providers or entities, geographic areas, or populations, including those eligible under title XVIII. The State can allocate up to 25 percent of bonus funds for activities related to the State program under this title, targeting eligible individuals and hard-to-reach populations."
