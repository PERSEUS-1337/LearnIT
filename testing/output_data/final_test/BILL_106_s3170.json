    "content": "The Act is titled the \"College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 2000\". References in the Act are made to the Higher Education Act of 1965. Section 3 discusses summer programs and supplementary grants. The College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 2000 amends various sections of the Higher Education Act of 1965. It includes provisions for duration and minimum grants, as well as the establishment of College Completion Challenge Grants for eligible entities. The College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 2000 amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 by providing grants to eligible entities for services described in subsection (a). Recipients of the grant can use the funds to provide grant aid or summer programs to students in their first 2 years of postsecondary education. The College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 2000 provides grants to eligible entities for services in postsecondary education. The Secretary may establish minimum award levels for Pell Grants, and institutions must demonstrate grant size effectiveness for student retention. The College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 2000 provides grants for postsecondary education services. Grants awarded to students do not affect their need for financial assistance, and the total amount should not exceed the student's cost of attendance. Recipients can use the funds to establish intensive summer programs for incoming first-year students or those at risk of dropping out. The College Completion Challenge Grant Act of 2000 provides grants for postsecondary education services, including intensive summer programs for students at risk of dropping out. These programs must be at least 6 weeks long, provide room, board, and program costs at no charge to students, and include a stipend. Recipients can also serve students who have completed their first 2 years of postsecondary education if they demonstrate a high risk of dropping out and prioritize first- and second-year students for services. Each eligible applicant must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under the College Completion Challenge Grant Act, detailing how they will provide both grants and a summer program. Applicants whose previous grant will end before the new one must explain how they will continue their services. Each eligible applicant for a grant under the College Completion Challenge Grant Act must describe how they will continue providing services from their previous grant. Applicants not receiving funds under subsection (a) must explain how they are currently funding services described under subsection (a). Applicants applying for grants under both subsections must already be providing services described under subsection (a) through other funding sources to be eligible for a grant. Grants under this subsection require a 33% match in non-Federal funds, except for eligible institutions of higher education under specific titles. The duration of grants awarded is 4 years."
