    "content": "Since 1961, the Secretary of State has led foreign assistance, including military education and training, under the Foreign Assistance Act. The State Department oversees security assistance programs, with the Department of Defense implementing them to support foreign and national security policy. The Department of Defense had little interest in security assistance activities for many years, considering them of marginal value to national security. However, perspectives began to change after 9/11, with defense officials realizing the importance of training foreign military forces in defeating terrorist groups for U.S. national security. The Department of Defense recognized the need for foreign military forces to lead counterterrorist activities due to U.S. forces lacking language and cultural knowledge. DOD officials proposed a \"Global Train and Equip\" authority to support foreign military forces in combating emerging threats. The proposal for a \"Global Train and Equip\" authority aimed to increase U.S. support for foreign military and security forces to disrupt terrorist networks and build their capacity. It required DOD lead with State Department concurrence, gaining support from high-level officials and Combatant Commanders. Perspectives on using U.S. military forces to train foreign military forces were evolving. The evolution of training foreign military forces began with the proposal for a \"Global Train and Equip\" authority. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates emphasized the importance of U.S. general purpose forces in this mission. Section 1206 was granted as a special contingency authority in 2005, with caution from Congress. Secretary Gates described this authority as a way to help other nations build capable military forces after 9/11. \"Building partner capacity is crucial for DOD's national security mission post-9/11. Section 1206 aids allies in addressing threats before they escalate, but some see it as a substitute for FMF due to funding shortages.\" The Section 1206 program is a vital tool for the Department of Defense to shape the environment and counter terrorism by training and equipping foreign military forces to respond to urgent threats. Congress authorized this program for two main purposes: counterterrorism operations and supporting military and stability operations involving U.S. Armed Forces. The Section 1206 program, authorized by Congress, aims to train and equip foreign military forces for counterterrorism and stability operations. The program has provided equipment such as radios, surveillance systems, vehicles, aircraft, weapons, and clothing. Funding has also been allocated for training foreign military forces to support operations like the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. The Section 1206 program, funded from the DOD operations and maintenance account, has a cap of $350 million per fiscal year. Congress has largely appropriated funds under the defense-wide O&M account, with a limit of $100 million for building foreign military forces' stabilization and peacekeeping capacity. The FY2014 NDAA restricts FY2015 funds to $262.5 million until the Secretary of Defense reports on proposed planning and execution. The DOD, with the Secretary of State's approval, reports on proposed programs to enhance a foreign country's counterterrorism capacity in FY2015. A request for $136.4 million for programs in 12 countries was submitted in November 2014. Total funding from FY2006-FY2014 is $2.2 billion, with Section 1206 supporting programs in over 40 countries. Since FY2010, assistance has been provided to train and equip Eastern and Central European forces for NATO's ISAF coalition operations. European forces have participated in NATO's ISAF coalition operations, with Yemen being the largest recipient of funding at $400 million. Other major recipients include Lebanon, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Funding for Pakistan under Section 1206 ceased after special counterinsurgency funds were created. The Philippines received assistance annually from FY2007 to FY2012. In recent years, African countries such as Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Uganda, and Burundi have received increased Section 1206 assistance to support counterterrorism operations against various groups and prepare troops for peacekeeping missions in Somalia. For FY2014, DOD allocated $314.0 million for 20 programs in 18 countries, with Yemen receiving the largest amount at over $69 million for counterterrorism purposes. Other significant recipients included Niger, Kenya, and Lebanon. $100 million was provided to train and equip Central and Eastern European countries to support NATO ISAF operations in Afghanistan, while Section 1206 of the FY2006 NDAA mandates respect for human rights and civilian authority in program implementation. The authority for providing assistance under the legislation is subject to certain restrictions, including a 15-day advance notification to congressional committees. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must submit a report within 120 days of enactment addressing specific topics related to assistance purposes. Section 1206 authority allows the Secretary of Defense to provide support for capacity building activities with the approval of the Secretary of State. Programs are developed through a \"dual-key\" process involving both Secretaries. Monitoring, evaluation procedures, and a prioritized list of security threats are key components of Section 1206 programs. Section 1206 requires joint formulation and coordination of programs by both Secretaries. Coordination was initially reported as spotty in FY2006, but a joint review process was later developed. A 2013 RAND report described Section 1206 as encumbered by a complex approval process involving both DOD and the State Department. The process begins with a call for proposals issued by the DOD Joint Staff and the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. Recommendations typically originate at the field level. The approval process for Section 1206 programs involves joint formulation and coordination by the Secretaries of Defense and State. Recommendations originate at the field level, with proposals forwarded to the Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense or the State Department for review. The relevant Ambassador and Combatant Commander must sign off on each proposal, with a prioritization process conducted by staff at the Pentagon and State Department. The OSD Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations Capabilities and Counterterrorism leads the coordination efforts. The approval process for Section 1206 programs involves joint formulation and coordination by the Secretaries of Defense and State. Recommendations originate at the field level, with proposals forwarded to the Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense or the State Department for review. The OSD Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations Capabilities and Counterterrorism leads the coordination efforts, coordinating reviews for feasibility, political-military considerations, and legal status with OSD and Joint Staff regional and functional offices. The State Department's Bureau for Political-Military affairs consults with various offices and forwards proposals for vetting. Selection criteria include threat urgency, host nation capability, sustainability, and risks of inaction. Once prioritized within each agency, DOD and State lead the process. The approval process for Section 1206 programs involves joint formulation and coordination by the Secretaries of Defense and State. Recommendations originate at the field level, with proposals forwarded to the Joint Staff and Office of the Secretary of Defense or the State Department for review. The DOD and State lead offices convene a joint review board to select proposals recommended to the Secretaries. Funds cannot be obligated until 15 days after congressional notifications are sent. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has taken steps to improve the timeliness of Section 1206 deliveries. The Defense Institute for International Legal Studies (DIILS) administers Section 1206 programs, including a two-day training course on human rights and international humanitarian law. Course components cover human rights, respect for civilian authority, regional human rights agreements, torture prevention, gender violence, rules of engagement, and laws on armed conflict. The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the FY2015 NDAA would codify current Section 1206 global train and equip authority with modifications. The conference version of the FY2015 NDAA retains the proposal with some changes, expanding support to foreign national military forces for military and stability operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the FY2015 NDAA would expand support for military and stability operations, including allied or coalition operations benefiting U.S. national security interests. It would also redefine forces eligible for assistance and retain the authorized limit of $350 million for funding under Section 1206 authority. The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the FY2015 NDAA proposes changes to Section 1206 authority, including increasing funding cap to $150 million for training and equipping foreign military forces, allowing funds for small-scale military construction, supplies, training, and assessments of program effectiveness. The proposed changes to Section 1206 authority include provisions for annual reports summarizing program assessments and audits by the Comptroller General. The Senate Armed Services Committee aims to make Section 1206 a permanent law to address emerging threats to U.S. security. In the decade since Section 1206 was established, DOD and the State Department have worked to improve decision making and implementation of programs. Concerns remain about effectiveness, timeliness of deliveries, sustainability of capabilities, and program accomplishments. Questions also arise about whether Section 1206 is appropriately codified under Title 10. The effectiveness of Section 1206 programs is discussed, along with the question of codifying this authority and whether DOD should retain its T&E authority. The key components of effectiveness include shortened timelines, sustainability of programs, and meeting assistance purposes. Despite the aim to respond quickly to emerging needs, the delivery of Section 1206 equipment has not always been as expedient as intended. The delivery of Section 1206 equipment has not always been as expeditious as expected. DOD has improved the process to reduce timelines, aiming for delivery within 18 months for routine deliveries and 6 months for surge requirements. Efforts are being made to deliver articles in less than six months from the end of the congressional notification period. An April 2010 GAO report viewed Section 1206 response timeframes as an improvement compared to other equipping programs. The delivery of Section 1206 equipment has improved, with DOD and State able to respond quickly to urgent needs. Projects are implemented within 1 fiscal year, compared to FMF projects that require up to 3 years of planning. The winding down of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan has also positively impacted timeliness and cost of deliveries. Commercial shippers are now competing for business, facilitating rapid delivery and reducing costs. Delays in delivery are due to various causes, including national customs and import processes in partner nations. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) faced challenges in delivering Section 1206 equipment to various countries, including aircraft, armored vehicles, and weapons. Delays were caused by events in recipient countries and processing issues at DSCA and military contracting offices. DOD and the State Department worked together to expedite proposal development and selection, increasing staff time and creating new procedures. DSCA implemented mechanisms to speed up deliveries, improving the timeliness of equipment distribution. DSCA implemented new procedures and mechanisms to expedite deliveries, including dedicated staff, a delivery tracking tool, and a centralized system for Section 1206 orders. These steps improved accountability and predictability. Despite these efforts, quick delivery of high-demand items like night-vision goggles remains challenging. Some Combatant Commands still face timeliness issues, partly due to perceived delays in the approval process. RAND found that the approval process for Section 1206 projects is perceived as too long, leading to delays in resource allocation. Some analysts suggest that making Section 1206 a permanent program could improve efficiency and promptness in delivery. Sustainment of Section 1206 CT programs is crucial for long-term effectiveness. Sustainment is crucial for long-term effectiveness of Section 1206 CT programs, as highlighted by reports from the State Department, DOD, GAO, and RAND. Host nation governments need to commit to sustaining programs, and U.S. agencies must address sustainment issues to ensure the long-term impact of projects. Section 1206 assistance must cease when threats are no longer \"emerging.\" Section 1206 assistance must cease when threats are no longer \"emerging,\" and there are concerns about recipient countries sustaining capabilities after funding ends. DOD and State Department consider recipient governments' ability to sustain programs in planning, and some programs have been cut back for this reason. Recipient countries may be asked to sustain Section 1206 projects established in response to U.S.-perceived needs. In 2012, Congress made a change to Section 1206 authority to allow for small-scale military construction as part of the program. This includes funding for projects like building boat houses to maintain patrol boats. However, there are concerns about recipient countries being able to sustain and maintain Section 1206 capabilities. One 2013 RAND report found that sustainment is crucial for long-term effectiveness of Section 1206 capabilities. Sustainment funding is sometimes provided through the State Department's FMF account, but there are limitations on using FMF funds for sustainment. Analysts suggest allocating a percentage of each fiscal year's Section 1206 funding for sustaining prior year programs. In a 2013 study, RAND recommended linking FMF to security cooperation programs under NDAA Title XII, including Section 1206, to address capability sustainment deficiencies. Section 1206 was rated similarly to other train and equip mechanisms but varied in utility among commands like AFICOM, EUCOM, and PACOM. RAND compared ratings of train and equip authorities used by each command, including FMF and IMET for PACOM. In a 2013 study, RAND recommended linking FMF to security cooperation programs under NDAA Title XII, including Section 1206, to address capability sustainment deficiencies. AFRICOM's Section 1206 is ranked moderately high in efficiency but moderately low in effectiveness compared to other security cooperation mechanisms. This includes DOD and State Department mechanisms like FMF, Section 1203, OEF-TS, and PREACT. The effectiveness and efficiency of various DOD security cooperation activities, including military train and equip projects, Traditional Commander's Activities, and SOF Joint Combined Exchange Training exercises, were assessed. EUCOM and PACOM ranked Section 1206 moderately high in effectiveness but low in efficiency. Comparatively, FMF was rated higher in efficiency by EUCOM but lower by PACOM. Additionally, two theater-specific DOD train and equip authorities were rated equally effective but more efficient than Section 1206 for EUCOM. The RAND BPC review assessed the effectiveness and efficiency of various DOD security cooperation activities, including Section 1206, IMET, FMF, and SOF Joint Combined Exchange Training exercises. While Section 1206 and IMET ranked similarly in effectiveness, IMET was rated higher in efficiency. Some small-scale educational security cooperation programs were found to be more efficient than both Section 1206 and IMET. However, SOF's Joint Combined Exchange Training exercise authority was rated lower in effectiveness and efficiency due to the main benefit accruing to U.S. SOF. The review noted that improvements have been made in Section 1206, which may impact the current ratings. The RAND study found that Section 1206 funding is limited to two years and lacks long-term sustainment, making it less effective. There were differing opinions on why PACOM's use of Section 1206 declined, with security cooperation personnel stating goals were met, while PACOM SOF cited deficiencies such as time limitations and inability to work with Ministries of the Interior. The use of Section 1206 to work with personnel under Ministries of the Interior is now allowed as of FY2014. DOD developed a qualitative assessment mechanism for Section 1206 programs, with the first results reported in 2013. The assessment of these programs has been an ongoing concern, with skepticism about developing useful measures of accomplishments due to the preventive nature of the programs. DOD presented a new assessment framework in mid-February 2013 to evaluate Section 1206 programs. The Department of Defense (DOD) conducted qualitative assessments of 1206 programs to evaluate program implementation, effects, and return on investment. Three programs were identified as successes, with overall enhancement of recipients' capabilities for counterterrorism (CT) or stability operations. Lessons learned included challenges in program design, varying partner nation absorptive capacity, and sustainment issues such as maintenance processes and funding. The sustainment problems in the defense strategy include maintenance processes, securing funds, and assessing partner capacity. A 2013 RAND study found that Building Partner Capacity (BPC) assistance is more effective when partner nations invest their own funds. The effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) assistance is influenced by factors such as partner nation investment, absorptive capacity, governance indicators, economy strength, and shared security interests with the United States. A 2012 study highlighted the importance of deep involvement in partner state military affairs and minimizing external interference for successful security assistance programs. The effectiveness of Building Partner Capacity (BPC) assistance is influenced by various factors. Some analysts suggest that Section 1206 is used to build relationships regardless of capacity effects. RAND finds it beneficial that BPC programs focus on relationship building and capacity building. Policy makers are considering codifying Section 1206 to Title 10 based on various factors. Section 1206 has become a critical tool for DOD leaders and military commanders to enhance partner nations' forces to address emerging threats, including terrorism. Its proven track record motivates codification, with a focus on emerging and urgent threats. Policy makers should consider its utility, impact on State Department's foreign policy coordination, DOD's security cooperation priorities, and core warfighting mission. Several foreign policy research institutions have advocated transferring Section 1206 authority and programs to the State Department, which historically oversees foreign assistance and policy coordination. Codifying Section 1206 to Title 10 would be a significant departure from current practice, potentially impacting foreign policy. Critics see Section 1206 as a key tool for DOD leaders to enhance partner nations' forces against emerging threats like terrorism. Critics argue that Section 1206 of foreign assistance programs gives the Department of Defense undue influence over U.S. foreign relations, weakening congressional oversight and human rights protections. The State Department traditionally oversees foreign policy and security assistance, but Section 1206's militarization is seen as damaging to the U.S. image with foreign populations. The State Department provides security assistance to foreign military and security forces through various programs funded by Department of State budgets. The U.S. Army Operational Law Handbook states that DOD may fund training for foreign military forces under certain conditions. The Department of Defense (DOD) can provide funding for training foreign military forces to promote interoperability, safety, and familiarization with U.S. forces. Congress must specifically authorize and appropriate funds for other training and security assistance. Section 1206 authority is seen as a military tool to further U.S. security objectives by responding to needs identified by the U.S. military. Section 1206 authority is viewed as a military tool to advance U.S. security objectives by addressing needs identified by the U.S. military. Critics argue that the distinction between Section 1206 and FMF funding has blurred over time, with some programs appearing to respond to longstanding rather than emerging threats. Despite this, advocates maintain that in an era of evolving threats, Section 1206 remains essential. Some Section 1206 advocates argue for continued high levels of flexible train and equip funding to meet U.S. military priorities. They suggest a new security assistance architecture to provide combatant commanders with increased resources and targeted authorities. Options include codifying Section 1206 to Title 22 or incorporating it under State Department programs. Some suggest subsuming Section 1206 assistance programs under the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) to address funding considerations. GSCF authority bestows lead responsibility on the Secretary of State, maintaining the traditional division of labor on security assistance between the State Department and DOD. However, concerns exist about the State Department's management of GSCF, with some analysts favoring its expiration. Some analysts express concerns about the cost-effectiveness of Section 1206 assistance, questioning its significance in tight budget times and its impact on other DOD priorities and programs. DOD is reviewing its security cooperation portfolio to optimize fund usage. Concerns exist about the increasing acceptance of providing arms and training to foreign countries as a core DOD function. Questions arise about the impact of expanding the DOD security assistance role on its core combat mission amid military force reductions. Expanding the DOD security assistance role may require more resources, including personnel for program development, administration, doctrine development, and training. Concerns exist about conventional forces lacking the necessary skills to effectively train foreign forces, leading to a need for increased training and education. Dedicated forces may be considered as an alternative, potentially impacting preparedness. In the FY2014 NDAA, Congress broadened Section 1206 authority to include training and equipping national military, maritime, and border security forces for counterterrorism missions. The SASC version of the FY2015 NDAA would further narrow the provision to focus on national military forces and security forces with a counterterrorism mission. Some sources argue that the FY2014 provision is already broader than necessary. The SASC provision in the FY2015 NDAA would allow DOD to train and equip counterterrorism forces under a Ministry of the Interior. Some analysts argue that the provision's language could be broader than intended, potentially including other security forces with a counterterrorism mission. Congress is advised to allocate funding specifically for civilian security forces. Some analysts argue that Congress should allocate funding for civilian security force training to the State Department, as there are concerns about using U.S. military forces for this purpose. This could blur the lines between police and military roles, potentially causing tensions and complicating bilateral relations. Section 1206 discussions often highlight the need for broader security assistance reform. Some analysts suggest allocating funding for civilian security force training to the State Department to avoid using military forces, which could blur roles and complicate relations. Section 1206 is a significant part of security assistance, but concerns exist about problems in various security assistance programs. There are questions about the necessity of Section 1206 if traditional security assistance mechanisms were adequately funded and reorganized for efficiency. The MIT report recommends substantial reforms for security assistance programs, including creating a new agile and adequately funded architecture. Specific recommendations include improving strategic planning, policy coherence, interagency coordination, budgeting procedures, transparency, and congressional oversight. Suggestions for Congress include restructuring security assistance authorities, expanding contingency authority, and providing multiyear funding. The MIT report recommends reforms for security assistance programs, including expanding contingency authority and providing multiyear funding. The Obama Administration released Presidential Policy Directive 23 on U.S. Security Sector Assistance Policy to improve security assistance delivery and programs. Consider joint congressional hearings on security assistance programs for better oversight. The PDD-23 fact sheet outlines nine goals for security sector assistance (SSA), emphasizing alignment with national security objectives, policy coherence, interagency collaboration, comprehensive strategies, resource optimization, and responsiveness to crises and changing partner security environments."
