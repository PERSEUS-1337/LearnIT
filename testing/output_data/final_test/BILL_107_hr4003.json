    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ocean Habitat Protection Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that marine species in 3-dimensional seafloor habitats are valuable resources, essential for biodiversity, contribute to the economy and food supply, support coastal communities, and provide recreational opportunities. Fishing is a significant source of employment and economic contribution in the United States, which relies on healthy and diverse marine ecosystems. The United States relies on healthy and diverse ocean ecosystems for various benefits such as income, nutrition, medicines, and raw materials. Marine habitats contain diverse species like sponges and deep-sea corals, which play a crucial role in supporting fish species and other marine life. Habitat complexity and biodiversity created by geologic structures are essential for fish species, but bottom trawling can reduce this complexity and diversity. Bottom trawling reduces biodiversity by disturbing geologic bedforms and harming benthic organisms. This practice negatively impacts commercially important species and industries dependent on them. Technological advancements have enabled bottom trawling in complex marine habitats, once considered refuges for marine life. The expansion of bottom trawling to structurally complex habitats over the past 20 years has had significant adverse effects on diversity and habitat complexity. Scientific studies show that bottom trawling is especially damaging to habitats like corals, boulder fields, and sponge beds, reducing their value for economically and ecologically important marine life. Recovery of these areas after trawling may take decades or centuries. Prohibiting the use of large rockhopper, roller, and other groundgear is a practical measure to protect benthic marine habitats from irreversible damage caused by bottom trawling. Prohibition on using large rockhopper and roller gear on bottom trawl nets is implemented to protect benthic marine habitats from irreversible damage caused by bottom trawling. The purpose of this section is to prevent bottom trawls from accessing and damaging marine habitats needed by important marine life. It prohibits the use of bottom trawls with large rockhopper and roller gear exceeding 8 inches in diameter to protect benthic habitats from irreversible damage. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits the use of bottom trawls with gear exceeding 8 inches in diameter to protect marine habitats. Vessels with such gear beyond the exclusive economic zone are presumed to be engaged in fishing activities."
