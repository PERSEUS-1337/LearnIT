    "content": "Cellulosic biofuels are produced from renewable biomass feedstocks like corn stover, switchgrass, and wood chips. Current production is limited to small-scale pilot projects, with hurdles to overcome for industrial-scale production. Ethanol from corn starch and biodiesel from vegetable oil are the primary U.S. biofuels. Interest in biofuels is driven by high oil prices, environmental concerns, rural development, and energy security. To meet goals, biofuels must come from sources that do not compete with major food crops for land. Cellulosic biofuels are seen as a potential solution to challenges in the biofuel industry. Government incentives and private investments are supporting efforts towards commercial production. Critics in the petroleum industry argue that technological advances in fossil fuels make them cheaper and more accessible than biofuels. Until significant technological improvements are made, critics argue that subsidies for biofuels distort energy markets and divert funds from other renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Some question the feasibility of producing enough feedstocks for biofuel production to offset petroleum imports. Additionally, there are concerns that focusing on alternative energy sources may hinder efforts to achieve energy savings. The development of alternative energy sources, such as cellulosic biofuels, is driven by the renewable fuel standard (RFS) mandate, which requires a minimum usage of biofuels in the nation's fuel supply. The RFS includes carve-outs for cellulosic biofuels, biomass-based diesel fuel, and other fuels, with a shift towards advanced biofuels over time. The RFS mandate for cellulosic biofuels in the EISA starts at 100 million gallons per year in 2010 and increases to 16 billion gallons per year in 2022. Despite the challenge of no large-scale commercial production of cellulosic biofuels in the US, the EPA has set lower mandates for 2010 and 2011. The RFS also sets maximum lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for each type of biofuel. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates specific volumes of renewable biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels, with a goal of reducing U.S. gasoline use by 20%. Cellulosic biofuels have potential but face hurdles to competitiveness. The law limits greenhouse gas emissions for qualifying biofuels to 60% of those from gasoline production. President Bush's \"Twenty in Ten\" initiative aimed to expand biofuels production, leading to the EISA in 2007 mandating RFS through 2022. The report discusses the challenges in developing technology for producing biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks, including feedstock supply, fuel extraction from cellulose, and distribution/marketing issues. It also examines the government's role in technology development and Congress's involvement in the emerging cellulosic biofuels industry. Feedstocks for cellulosic biofuels are diverse and potentially abundant. Cellulosic biofuels can be derived from inexpensive feedstocks like agricultural, forest, and urban sources. However, challenges such as establishment costs and transportation costs are proving to be more difficult than initially thought. Cellulose, along with hemicellulose and lignin, provides structural rigidity to plants and is found in plant-derived products like paper and cardboard. Agricultural sources include crop residues and biomass crops like switchgrass, while forest sources include tree plantations and natural forests. Biomass feedstocks, including tree plantations, natural forests, and municipal solid waste, are sources of renewable biomass for biofuels production. However, there are environmental drawbacks and challenges in handling bulky feedstocks. Specialized machinery is needed to harvest and handle large volumes of biomass from agriculture or forests. The estimated cost of biofuels production does not consider environmental impacts, which are crucial for overall consideration of biofuels issues. Specialized machinery is required to harvest and handle large volumes of biomass for biofuels production. One-pass machines capable of processing both grain and stover simultaneously are being developed. Storage facilities for cellulosic material may need to be developed for the industry to grow. Crop residues like corn stover, rice, and wheat straw are abundant sources of biomass. However, using crop residue as a feedstock may lead to a potential loss of soil fertility. Harvesting crop residue for biofuels may lead to soil fertility loss, but research shows up to 60% can be removed without harm. Corn stover can yield 180 gallons of ethanol per acre, compared to 425 gallons from corn grain and 662 gallons from sugar cane. Switchgrass, a native perennial grass, is a potential biomass source. Switchgrass is a native perennial grass with high density and native immunity to diseases and pests, making it a potential cellulosic feedstock. Research shows that if harvested after frost, the 10-foot tall grass can produce for 10 to 20 years. It takes time to establish, with yields estimated at 30% in the first year, 70% in the second year, and reaching full potential in the third year at seven tons per acre. Miscanthus, another fast-growing perennial grass, produces green leaves early in the planting season and retains them through early fall, maximizing production. Miscanthus, like switchgrass, maximizes biomass production on marginal lands with minimal inputs. Research shows it can produce 2\u00bd times more ethanol per acre than corn. Field trials with mixtures of native grasses suggest better soil health, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Forest biomass resources include trees, logging residues, and fire prevention treatments. Processing forest biomass can be costly due to accessibility, transportation, and labor issues. Commercial tree plantations, such as hybrid poplar and willow, require specialized equipment for harvesting in the winter. Trees are converted to chips on site and transported to refineries for processing. Willow trees can be harvested multiple times after cutting. An acre of woody biomass yields around 700 gallons of biofuel annually. Secondary and tertiary feedstocks, derived from manufacturing or consumer sources, recover value from low-value materials like citrus skins and wood processing residues. Urban wood residues and municipal solid waste are also used. One ton of dry woody biomass produces about 70 gallons of biofuels. Ethanol plants operate year-round with brief maintenance stoppages. Storing enough feedstock for a refinery producing 10-20 million gallons per year would require up to 700 tons. A refinery producing 10-20 million gallons per year would need 700 tons of feedstock daily, totaling 240,000 tons annually. The U.S. Department of Energy is researching challenges in harvesting, preprocessing, and transporting feedstocks for biofuels. Pelletizing reduces transportation costs but increases processing costs. Transporting biomass 30 miles costs $39 to $46 for corn stover and $57 to $63 for other feedstocks. The USDA-DOE aims to reduce feedstock costs at biofuel plants from $60 to $46 per ton by 2012. A study estimates over 1.3 billion tons of biomass could be available annually in the U.S. for bioenergy production. This biomass could potentially replace 30% of U.S. transportation fuel consumption. The USDA-DOE study estimates over 1.3 billion tons of biomass could be available annually in the U.S. for bioenergy production. However, there are challenges associated with harvesting woody biomass and urban waste, and the biomass tonnages rely on optimistic yield growth assumptions. Current provisions restrict the use of woody biomass to certain sources, potentially limiting the volume available for conversion. Cellulosic feedstocks have smaller impacts on food supplies compared to corn, as they are non-food commodities and do not directly affect food markets. Many cellulosic feedstocks, such as waste streams and crop residues, do not compete with food crops for land. Corn stover can be used for ethanol production without affecting food supplies. Perennial crops like switchgrass and fast-growing trees have minimal impact on food production. Producers may need to adjust contracts and arrangements for multi-year cycles of perennial crops. Producing perennial crops like switchgrass requires long-term agreements for multi-year cycles. The University of Tennessee has three-year contracts with producers for switchgrass availability. Converting cellulose into fuel is complex and expensive, requiring enzymatic processes or thermochemical methods. Converting cellulose into fuel can be done through enzymatic processes or thermochemical methods. Three basic methods for converting cellulose into ethanol are acid hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis, and thermochemical gasification. These methods are currently limited to pilot or demonstration plants and are part of the pre-treatment phase of ethanol production. Dilute and concentrated acid hydrolysis use sulphuric acid to separate cellulose from lignin and hemicellulose. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a biochemical process that converts cellulose into sugar using cellulase enzymes, offering processing advantages and potential cost reductions. However, the high cost of cellulase enzymes remains a significant barrier to the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals. Enzyme cost is a barrier to converting lignocellulosic biomass to fuels. The goal is to reduce cellulase enzyme costs from $0.50 to $0.60 per gallon of ethanol to $0.10 per gallon. Research is being done to lower costs by allowing cellulase yeasts and fermenting yeasts to work simultaneously. The total conversion cost for biochemical conversion of corn stover to ethanol is estimated at $1.59 per gallon. Thermochemical processes like gasification and pyrolysis convert biomass into syngas. Gasification and pyrolysis convert lignocellulosic biomass into syngas for further refining into ethanol, diesel, methane, or butanol. Efficiency rates for ethanol production from syngas have reached 50%, while two-stage processes producing methanol have achieved 80% efficiency. The Fischer-Tropsch process uses gasification to produce biofuels like diesel, methane, or butanol. However, biomass-derived syngas processing is technically challenging due to impurities. The cost of gasification conversion was estimated at $1.21 per gallon in 2005. The cost of cellulosic biofuels in 2005 was $1.21 per gallon, with a goal of $0.82 per gallon by 2012. Distribution constraints may hinder their use on an industrial scale. Greater volumes of advanced biofuels need to be blended into motor fuel to meet mandates, but distribution issues may impede efficient delivery to retail outlets. Ethanol production in the Midwest faces challenges in transportation and storage due to its tendency to attract water and separate if not blended prior to delivery. The ethanol distribution system relies on rail cars, tanker trucks, and barges, with limited options due to competition. Infrastructure concerns may be alleviated with non-corn biofuels and increased production of biomass-based diesel substitutes. The blend wall, around 12-13 billion gallons per year, poses challenges in transporting and storing ethanol in coastal markets. The U.S. ethanol production is nearing the blend wall limit of 12-13 billion gallons per year, which may lead to difficulties in further increasing production. E-85 usage is limited by infrastructure and the size of flex-fuel fleets. Introducing non-ethanol biofuels, like \"drop-in\" fuels, could help overcome these challenges. EPA considered raising the ethanol blend level to E-15 or E-20, and in 2010, issued a waiver for up to 15% ethanol (E15) in fuel for model year 2007 vehicles. In October 2010, the EPA issued a waiver allowing fuel to contain up to 15% ethanol (E15) for model year 2007 and newer light-duty vehicles. The decision on E15 use for model year 2001-2006 vehicles is pending additional DOE testing. No waiver is granted for E15 use in model year 2000 and older vehicles, motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines due to insufficient testing data. Gas stations selling E15 will require state approvals and infrastructure changes. The vehicle limitations and infrastructure issues are expected to slow the expansion of blending rates. EPA also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to support the introduction of E15. The EPA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to promote the successful introduction of E15 into commerce by ensuring its use in approved motor vehicles and reducing misfueling. Cellulosic biofuels are seen as economically efficient, but current estimates show higher production costs compared to corn ethanol. The development of a cellulose-based ethanol industry is hindered by the state of cellulosic conversion technology. DOE aims for competitiveness in 2012 with lower costs for corn ethanol. DOE aims for competitiveness in 2012 with a target cost of $1.30 per gallon for corn stover ethanol, compared to $0.958 per gallon for corn-based ethanol in 2002. The cost of harvesting and transporting cellulosic biomass is often undervalued, putting cellulosic biofuels at a disadvantage despite a higher production tax credit. The net energy balance is improved with the use of cellulosic biomass in biofuel production. The use of cellulosic biomass in biofuel production improves the net energy balance compared to corn ethanol. Estimates show that cellulosic biomass has a higher energy balance ranging from 300% to 900%, while corn ethanol's energy balance was estimated at 67%. Cellulosic ethanol's co-products, especially lignin, can be used as a processing fuel, increasing energy efficiencies. Switchgrass, used in cellulosic ethanol production, requires less fertilizer than corn. Switchgrass and woody biomass, including fast-growing trees, have the potential to significantly improve the energy and environmental impacts of biofuels. They require less fertilizer, reduce the need for chemical inputs, and offer additional benefits such as improved soil and water quality. Ethanol from switchgrass has a much higher energy output compared to fossil energy input. Fast-growing trees and woody crops could also help reduce CO2 emissions. Switchgrass and woody biomass offer environmental benefits like improved soil and water quality, reduced CO2 emissions, and enhanced biodiversity. Concerns about cellulosic feedstocks include the need for increased per-acre yields, potential use of fertilizers or water resources, limited feedstock supply, and land use pressures. Other environmental drawbacks include soil erosion, increased runoff, invasive species spread, and wildlife habitat disruption. Ethanol's greenhouse gas emissions vary based on the feedstock crop used. The greenhouse gas emissions of ethanol production vary based on factors like feedstock crop, type of fuel used, and land use. For example, using virgin forest land for switchgrass cultivation results in higher emissions compared to using previously cleared cropland. Cellulosic refineries powered by coal or natural gas emit more greenhouse gases than those powered by recovered feedstock co-products. Multi-year harvesting of perennial crops reduces emissions by minimizing field passes, while prairie grasses and woody crops have lower emissions than corn due to reduced inputs. The use of cellulosic feedstocks for ethanol production can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. Advances in technology could reduce fossil energy consumption per mile by 8% with herbaceous-feedstock cellulose-based E-10 and by roughly 70% with herbaceous-feedstock cellulose-based E-85. Cellulosic ethanol can reduce total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by about 90% per unit of energy replaced, compared to 22% with corn ethanol. Private investment is crucial for the development of the cellulosic biofuels industry. Private investment, mainly from venture capitalists and petroleum companies, is crucial for the development of the cellulosic biofuels industry. Venture capitalists have a long-term perspective, while petroleum companies are eager to invest due to mandatory blending of biofuels with gasoline. Partnerships like BP and Verenium, as well as Royal Dutch Shell and Imogen Corporation, have been formed to accelerate the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol. Mascoma, a major ethanol producer, raised $30 million for the industry. Mascoma, a major ethanol producer, raised $30 million to support its investment in cellulosic feedstock conversion with technical support from General Motors and Marathon Oil. A collaboration between Monsanto and Mendel Biotechnology Inc. will focus on breeding and developing crops for cellulosic biofuels production. USDA and DOE are actively promoting the development and demonstration of cellulosic biofuels technologies through various programs supported by legislation like the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI) coordinates federal efforts for R&D in the cellulosic biofuels industry. In 2008, the National Biofuels Action Plan outlined challenges such as feedstock production, conversion technology, and distribution infrastructure. This plan aims to improve national energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. DOE appropriations for cellulosic biofuels R&D totaled $196 million in FY2007, $198 million in FY2008, $217 million in 2009, $220 million in FY2010, and a request for $220 million in FY2011. Additionally, there was a stimulus of $786 million in FY2009. USDA discretionary outlays for cellulosic biofuels were around $100 million. USDA discretionary outlays for cellulosic biofuels were approximately $100 million in FY2009, with commercialization of thermochemical conversion technologies accounting for an estimated $80 million. Private sector investment received a substantial federal policy boost in 2007 with up to $385 million in funding for six cellulosic ethanol plant projects. These projects focus on near-term commercial processes and are expected to produce up to 100 mgpy of cellulosic ethanol when fully operational. The demonstration-scale biorefinery projects, with a total planned investment of over $1.2 billion, faced uncertainties in transitioning from the laboratory to commercial reality. Two recipients dropped out of the program, one due to a better offer from the Canadian government and the other because the risks outweighed the benefits. The 2008 farm bill emphasizes cellulosic biofuels and authorizes new programs and grants to support research in agriculture-based renewable energy. The 2008 farm bill reauthorizes grants, loans, and loan guarantees for research on agriculture-based renewable energy and promotes the adoption of renewable energy systems. Funding for cellulosic biofuels programs is challenging to determine due to support for a wide range of biofuels. Title VII supports R&D in cellulosic biofuels, while Title XV provides tax incentives and tariffs. Various programs offer support for cellulosic biofuels research, demonstration, and production. Congressional focus is expected to shift towards reauthorization in 2012 when most farm bill provisions expire. The 2008 Farm Bill includes tax and trade provisions that benefit cellulosic biofuels, such as a production tax credit of $1.01 per gallon. This credit is set to expire on December 31, 2012. Additionally, an ethanol tariff helps the U.S. industry by imposing a duty on imported ethanol. The tariff on imported ethanol was extended through 2011 to prevent it from benefiting from the U.S. blender's tax credit. A new program provides grants for on-farm biomass crop research and integration with bioenergy production. Funding of $50 million annually is authorized for FY2008 through FY2012, but has not been appropriated in recent years. Loan guarantees are also available for biorefinery development and construction. The USDA provides grants and loan guarantees for biorefinery development and construction. Loan guarantees are limited to $250 million per project. The program received mandatory funding of $320 million for commercial-scale biorefinery loan guarantees. The Repowering Assistance program encourages existing biorefineries to replace fossil fuels with renewable biomass for heat or power production. The Bioenergy Program, established in 1999, receives funding from the 2008 farm bill for the development of conversion technologies for cellulosic biofuels. Producers of advanced biofuels are eligible for payments based on production quantity and duration. The program continues to be implemented using mandatory funding through a NOFA. The Bioenergy Program, established in 1999, receives funding from the 2008 farm bill for the development of conversion technologies for cellulosic biofuels. Producers of advanced biofuels are eligible for payments based on production quantity and duration. The program is administered jointly by USDA and DOE, supporting research, development, and demonstration of biofuels and biobased products. Total funding of $300 million is provided from FY2009 to FY2012, with additional $25 million annually subject to appropriations. The Bioenergy Program, funded by the 2008 farm bill, focuses on developing biofuels and biobased products. It received $118 million for FY2009 to FY2012 and an additional $35 million annually. The program aims to help farmers grow crops for bioenergy and support the collection and transportation of materials for biomass conversion facilities. The Bioenergy Program, funded by the 2008 farm bill, aims to assist the bioenergy industry by providing funding for biomass conversion facilities. The program, implemented by the Farm Service Agency, supports continuous biomass availability and has mandatory CCC funding. USDA implemented the Collection, Harvest, Storage, and Transportation (CHST) matching payment program to address market competition for wood scraps. The USDA implemented the Bioenergy Program to support the bioenergy industry by providing funding for biomass conversion facilities. The program includes the Collection, Harvest, Storage, and Transportation (CHST) matching payment program, which was suspended in 2010. The program allows various entities to compete for funds, with discretionary appropriations of $15 million annually authorized. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) provides tax and trade incentives for renewable energy production, expanding benefits to fuels and processes that previously did not qualify. It allows immediate write-off of 50% of the cost for facilities producing cellulosic biofuels placed in service before January 1, 2013, without limiting the type of fuel or production process. Congress has a strong interest in developing biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels. The development of biofuels, especially cellulosic biofuels, has garnered strong interest. Debate continues on the level of incentives needed to support the industry. A critical issue is the federal mandate for cellulosic biofuels under the RFS and the industry's ability to meet it. Congress may need to consider ongoing government support for the industry, which some view as essential for meeting the RFS. The 2008 farm bill determined the level of support through grants and loans, but this may be revisited. The cellulosic biofuels tax credit applies to fuel produced from 2009 to 2012, and its extension may be debated in the 112th Congress. During the 112th Congress, debates revolved around the definition of biofuels and feedstocks for federal incentives, with some calling for a reduction in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Legislation was introduced to limit the corn-starch component of the RFS, which opponents argued would hinder efforts to reduce dependence on foreign oil. The focus shifted towards advanced fuels like cellulosic biofuels to meet the mandate, as altering RFS volume requirements was not pursued in the 111th Congress. The definition of forest-based renewable biomass under the RFS is considered restrictive, excluding biomass from federal forests and privately owned naturally regenerated forests. This exclusion limits potential biomass sources and creates regional disparities, particularly in the western and northern/southeastern parts of the country. Some argue that biomass extraction could improve federal land management. Biomass extraction could be a valuable tool for enhancing federal land management by creating markets for small-diameter trees. This could offer more options for managing wildlife habitat, forest hydrology, hazardous fuels, and pest infestations. Discussions in Congress have focused on producer eligibility under the RFS, with concerns raised about barriers for agricultural producers. Legislation such as H.R. 2454 aimed to modify the non-federal lands portion to address these issues. H.R. 2454 aimed to modify the definition of \"renewable biomass\" to include low-value materials like wood waste and residues from private forests. The House passed a related energy security act in the 110th Congress, but no Senate action was taken. Estimates for cellulosic biofuels production varied, with some small-scale plants coming online in 2010. The pace of cellulosic ethanol plant construction falls short of DOE's goal to be competitive by 2012. Analysts predict growth similar to corn-starch ethanol, but the process is newer. USDA projects commercial viability by 2015, with a 3 billion gallon mandate by then. FAPRI assumes production will lag behind the mandate. Cellulosic biofuel production is projected to fall behind the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), leading to a potential waiver by the EPA. FAPRI estimates cellulosic ethanol production in 2013 to be 245 mgpy, significantly lower than the 1 billion gallon RFS target for that year."
