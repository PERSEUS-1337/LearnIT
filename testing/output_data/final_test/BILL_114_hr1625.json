    "content": "The Insider Trading Prohibition Act, also known as the \"Act,\" prohibits insider trading under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This new section, SEC. 16A, outlines the prohibition on insider trading. The Insider Trading Prohibition Act prohibits trading securities while in possession of material, nonpublic information. It is unlawful to purchase, sell, or enter into any security based on such information. The Insider Trading Prohibition Act prohibits the communication of material, nonpublic information related to securities or security-based swaps to others who may act on that information. The Insider Trading Prohibition Act prohibits trading or communicating material nonpublic information obtained through theft, bribery, misrepresentation, espionage, violation of federal laws protecting computer data, intellectual property, or privacy, conversion, or misappropriation. The Insider Trading Prohibition Act prohibits trading or communicating material nonpublic information obtained through unauthorized means, breach of trust, or fiduciary duty. It does not require knowledge of how the information was obtained, as long as the person was aware or recklessly disregarded that it was wrongfully obtained. The Insider Trading Prohibition Act states that individuals are not liable solely for controlling or employing someone who violates the act, as long as they did not participate, profit from, or induce the violation. The Commission has the authority to exempt certain persons, securities, or transactions from the provisions of the act if it deems necessary and consistent with the act's purposes. The Insider Trading Prohibition Act exempts individuals acting on behalf of others whose actions would be lawful under the act. Amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 include references to the new section 16A."
