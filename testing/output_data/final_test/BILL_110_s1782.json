    "content": "The \"Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007\" may be cited as the Act. The Act includes findings. The Federal Arbitration Act was originally intended for disputes between commercial entities of similar power but now applies to consumer and employment disputes, leading to many individuals giving up their right to a judge or jury in favor of binding arbitration. Private arbitration clauses strip individuals of their rights, often without their awareness. These clauses are becoming increasingly common in various industries, forcing people to give up their rights as a condition for employment, medical care, purchasing goods, and more. Arbitration companies may be biased towards corporate interests, undermining public law for civil and consumer rights. Arbitrators have near complete freedom to ignore the law and their own rules due to lack of judicial review. Mandatory arbitration lacks transparency and is not conducive to protecting civil and consumer rights. Corporations often include unfair provisions in arbitration clauses that disadvantage individuals. The curr_chunk discusses how mandatory arbitration clauses strip individuals of their rights, ban class actions, and force arbitration far from their homes. Some courts have upheld unfair arbitration clauses, prioritizing arbitration over individuals' constitutional rights. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to arbitration. The curr_chunk amends Section 1 of title 9, United States Code by defining key terms related to arbitration, such as 'maritime transactions', 'commerce', 'employment dispute', and 'consumer dispute'. The curr_chunk defines 'consumer dispute' as a disagreement between an individual and a seller/provider of goods or services for personal use, and 'franchise dispute' as a disagreement between a franchisor and franchisee regarding their contractual agreement. The curr_chunk defines a 'pre-dispute arbitration agreement' as an agreement to arbitrate disputes that had not yet arisen at the time of the making of the agreement, involving the payment of a franchise fee by the franchisee. The curr_chunk states the validity and enforceability of agreements. Section 2 of title 9, United States Code, is amended to address the validity and enforceability of agreements. It specifies that no predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable for certain types of disputes, and that the applicability of this chapter to an arbitration agreement shall be determined by Federal law. The validity and enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate shall be determined by Federal law, with the court making the decision regardless of challenges raised by the party resisting arbitration. This chapter does not apply to arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will be effective upon enactment and apply to disputes or claims arising after that date."
