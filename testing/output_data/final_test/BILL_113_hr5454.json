    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Targeted Use of Sanctions for Killing Elephants in Their Range Act of 2014\". The Congress finds that poaching of African elephants has increased dramatically since 2006 due to high demand for ivory in Asia, leading to the involvement of organized criminal elements and terrorist groups in trafficking ivory to finance their operations. The elephant poaching crisis has worsened, with poachers using sophisticated tactics to evade traditional conservation law enforcement. Some countries are unable or unwilling to stop the illegal ivory trade, and strategies to reduce demand through education are deemed insufficient to protect African elephant populations. The purpose of this Act is to address the demand for and trafficking of African elephant ivory globally. The Act aims to combat the illegal ivory trade globally by requiring countries to engage in consultations with the United States to end the trade as a condition for accessing US markets for natural resources. The African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to define illegal ivory trade as any sale, purchase, barter, transit, or exchange of ivory taken in violation of laws or international agreements. Additionally, findings in the Act are amended to combat the global illegal ivory trade. The African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to address the global crisis of poaching and trafficking of wildlife, particularly focusing on the demand for ivory and the profit incentive for poachers and traffickers. The African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to prevent additional African elephant ivory from entering global commerce and reduce demand for ivory driving elephant poaching by limiting natural resources-related trade with countries engaged in illegal ivory trade. SEC. 6. CERTIFICATION UNDER FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF 1967.\n\nSection 2202 of the African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to include certification for countries identified by CITES as significant in illegal ivory trade for the purposes of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967.\n\nSEC. 7. CONSULTATION AND SANCTION.\n\nPart II of the African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to include consultation and sanction measures. The President must consult with countries identified for illegal ivory trade and seek agreements to stop the trade. If consultations fail, the Secretary will prohibit imports of wildlife products from that country until an agreement is reached. The Secretary will publish public notice of any prohibition under subsection (a) 30 days before it takes effect. Within 180 days of a prohibition under subsection (b), the Secretary will report to Congress on its effectiveness in stopping illegal ivory trade and any retaliatory actions by the country. The President shall seek consultations within 30 days for countries identified as primary concerns for illegal ivory trade by the CITES Standing Committee before the enactment of this Act."
