Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is amended to require the court to award sanctions for violations, which shall be sufficient to deter similar conduct and compensate injured parties. Sanctions may include payment of reasonable expenses and attorney's fees. In State court civil actions affecting interstate commerce, the court must determine within 30 days if the action substantially impacts interstate commerce based on economic costs. If so, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applies. This aims to prevent forum-shopping. A personal injury claim must be filed in the State and county where the person bringing the claim resides, where the injury occurred, where the defendant's principal place of business is located (for corporations), or where the defendant resides (for individuals). The court determines the most appropriate forum for a personal injury claim if it occurred in multiple counties. If another forum is deemed more suitable, the claim is dismissed, with the statute of limitations tolled from the filing date to the dismissal date. The curr_chunk discusses the types of claims that can be made for personal injury, illness, or death, excluding class actions and claims against debtors in bankruptcy cases. It also mentions the inclusion of derivative actions brought by representatives of the injured party. The section defines terms such as \"person\" and \"State\" and specifies that it applies to personal injury claims filed in Federal or State court after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5 clarifies that new claims or remedies under civil rights law can still be pursued despite the provisions in section 3. SEC. 6 introduces a three-strikes rule for suspending attorneys who violate Rule 11 multiple times.

Reinstatement to practice law in the Federal district court is possible after completing the suspension. Attorneys must petition the court for reinstatement after completing a suspension under subsection (a), following procedures and conditions set by the court. SEC. 7. PRESUMPTION OF RULE 11 VIOLATION FOR REPEATEDLY RELITIGATING SAME ISSUE. Whenever a party presents a pleading, motion, or paper with a claim or defense previously lost on the merits in 3 consecutive final decisions, there is a rebuttable presumption of Rule 11 violation. SEC. 8. ENHANCED SANCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION IN PENDING FEDERAL COURT PROCEEDINGS. SEC. 9. BAN ON CONCEALMENT OF UNLAWFUL CONDUCT. Whoever intentionally destroys documents relevant to a pending Federal court proceeding will face civil sanctions and contempt of court, with attorneys possibly facing disciplinary actions by State bar associations.
