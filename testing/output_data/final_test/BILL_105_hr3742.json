    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Helping Empower Low-income Parents (HELP) Scholarships Amendments of 1998\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include definitions for \"poverty line\" and \"voluntary public and private parental choice program\". The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a definition for a \"choice program\" as a program authorized by State law that allows low-income parents to choose a private school for their children. SEC. 3. ALLOCATION TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. Section 6102(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to ensure that State educational agencies distribute at least 90 percent of funds to local educational agencies based on enrollments in public and private schools, with adjustments for higher per pupil allocations to agencies with more children in need, such as those in low-income areas. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to prioritize funding distribution to local educational agencies based on enrollments in public and private schools, with adjustments for higher per pupil allocations to agencies with more children in need, including low-income families, children from low-income families, and children in sparsely populated areas. States with voluntary parental choice programs can reserve an additional 15 percent of funds for these programs. SEC. 4. USES OF FUNDS. Uses of Funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 are amended to include establishing voluntary public and private parental choice programs. This includes programs located in areas with the greatest need. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to establish voluntary public and private parental choice programs in areas with the greatest need. These programs have specific criteria for participation, including income limitations and scholarship amounts tied to local educational agency expenditures. The voluntary public and private parental choice scholarship program requires the minimum scholarship amount to be 60 percent of the local educational agency's per pupil expenditure or the cost of tuition at a private school. Private schools, including religiously affiliated ones, can participate in the program. Private schools, including religiously affiliated ones, can participate in the choice program as long as they meet certain academic requirements, are not restricted in using funds for sectarian purposes, and comply with state regulations for private schools. The Helping Empower Low-income Parents (HELP) Scholarships Amendments of 1997 allow State, local, and private funds to be used for voluntary public and private parental choice programs, ensuring priority for students previously enrolled in a public school. SEC. 5. EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY. Part C of title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding SEC. 6304 for Education Flexibility. A local educational agency can apply for an education flexibility waiver of certain Federal requirements by establishing a parental choice program and meeting specified criteria. The application must identify the state and federal requirements to be waived, provide justification, and outline goals and performance criteria. The application for an education flexibility waiver must include goals, performance criteria, and certification that information has been shared with local entities for feedback. The State educational agency must also describe the actions taken or planned within 90 days of notification from the Secretary. The Secretary has granted a waiver request to remove State barriers for local educational agencies. The Secretary will approve the request if the agency complies with requirements and the State agrees to grant mutually acceptable waivers within 90 days. The Secretary will notify local educational agencies of waiver request compliance within 60 days. Waivers cannot be granted for civil rights protections and discrimination prohibitions. The curr_chunk discusses discrimination prohibitions and fiscal accountability measures, including services for disabled individuals, maintenance of effort requirements, and equitable participation of private school students and teachers. Parental involvement in program activities and services is emphasized in addition to discrimination prohibitions and fiscal accountability measures. SEC. 6. EVALUATION. Part D of title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new subsection stating that the section does not apply to funds used for a voluntary parental choice program. Additionally, a new section, SEC. 6404, is added for evaluation purposes. The Comptroller General of the United States will contract an evaluating agency to conduct annual evaluations of programs under section 6301(b)(9) and those applying for education flexibility waivers under section 6304. The evaluating agency must transmit annual evaluation findings to the Comptroller General of the United States. Criteria for evaluating programs under section 6301(b)(9) will be established by the Comptroller General in consultation with the Secretary, focusing on program implementation, effects on participants, schools, and communities, parent involvement, and educational achievement. The evaluation of educational achievement in the program area includes comparing students with and without parental choice scholarships. The Secretary will reserve up to 0.50 percent of funds for evaluation purposes, considering the scale and scope of the evaluation. Funds used for parental choice programs are considered assistance to students, not schools participating. The Secretary cannot control the curriculum or administration of schools in these programs."
