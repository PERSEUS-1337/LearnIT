    "content": "The Director of OMB oversees the development and compliance of security policies for federal computer systems, excluding national security systems. The Committee on National Security Systems handles national security systems, while NIST and the National Security Agency develop standards for federal and national security systems respectively. This report outlines federal laws and directives governing computer security roles and responsibilities. The report discusses the roles and responsibilities for computer security assigned to federal departments and agencies, focusing on the security of computer systems and electronic information from unauthorized access. It does not cover broader issues like information assurance or telecommunications in depth. The federal government's role in computer security focuses on securing federally owned systems, while also requiring certain information on non-government systems to be protected. This includes efforts to enhance the security of critical infrastructure. The federal government works with the private sector to improve the security of the nation's information infrastructure. It investigates and prosecutes federal computer crimes and assists state and local law enforcement in similar cases. Additionally, it has programs for research and development in computer security, building upon various acts related to information technology management and security. The Federal Information Security Act of 2002 (FISMA) mandates federal agencies to secure their computer systems by inventorying, identifying security protections, and implementing an agency-wide information security program. FISMA authorizes NIST to develop security standards, the Secretary of Commerce to choose which to promulgate, and the OMB Director to oversee compliance with these standards. FISMA authorizes the Director of OMB to require agencies to follow NIST standards, review agency security programs annually, and take actions to ensure compliance. Agencies must conduct an independent evaluation of their security programs annually, with results forwarded to OMB for reporting to Congress. The Director of OMB is also directed to ensure the operation of a federal information security incident center. The Federal Computer Incident Response Capability (FedCIRC) provides technical assistance to federal agencies in detecting and handling computer incidents. It evolved from a pilot project at NIST in 1996 and is now located within the National Cyber Security Division. The roles and responsibilities of NIST, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Director of OMB do not extend to national security systems. The definition of a national security system includes any computer system used by an agency for intelligence, cryptologic activities, military command and control, or critical military/intelligence missions. It excludes systems used for routine administrative and business applications. The roles and responsibilities for securing national security systems are outlined in National Security Directive 42 (NSD-42) signed by President George H. W. Bush in 1990. NSD-42 establishes the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) chaired by the Department of Defense, providing system security guidance and evaluating the security status of national security systems annually. NSD-42 establishes the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) chaired by the Department of Defense, assigning membership to voting representatives of various departments and agencies. The Secretary of Defense is named as the Executive Agent for National Security Telecommunications and Information. NSD-42 designates the Executive Agent to implement policies for securing national security systems, providing technical assistance, endorsing research, and coordinating federal technical centers. The Executive Agent also reviews and assesses recommendations on national security systems programs and budgets for executive departments and agencies. NSD-42 instructs the Executive Agent to report the security status of national security systems to the President through the National Security Council and designates the Director of the National Security Agency as the National Manager for National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security. The National Manager has authorities to evaluate system vulnerability, approve security research, standards, and equipment, assess security posture, and disseminate threat information. The Director of OMB oversees the development and compliance of security policies for federal computer systems, excluding national security systems. The Committee on National Security Systems is responsible for evaluating and certifying national security systems, setting standards for their protection, and reviewing department and agency programs and budgets. They also procure security materials and equipment for government entities and foreign governments. The Committee on National Security Systems and the Director of Central Intelligence have authority over national security computer systems. NIST develops security standards for federal computer systems, excluding national security systems. The National Security Agency oversees security for national security systems. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace provides recommendations for improving security for all computer network operators, including federal agencies. The Strategy recommends federal agencies improve security by conducting exercises, reporting results to OMB, developing a patch management system, and coordinating IT security research annually. NSD-42 references the National Communication System's Committee of Principals. The National Communication System (NCS) was established by Presidential Memorandum No. 252 in 1963 after the Cuban Missile Crisis. It has been amended over time, with the current Executive Order 12472 signed by President Reagan in 1984. This order defines the NCS as telecommunication assets owned or leased by the federal government for national security and emergency preparedness. The National Communication System (NCS) was established in 1963 to address national security and emergency preparedness needs. It includes an administrative structure with a Committee of Principals, an Executive Agent, and a Manager to oversee telecommunications infrastructure. The Committee of Principals assists the President, National Security Council, and other key entities in making recommendations for telecommunications policy. The Committee of Principals, along with key entities like the National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, the Director of OSTP, and the Director of OMB, determine the requirements for the national communication system. They work closely with private sector service providers through the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee to ensure the NCS is responsive and capable of meeting priority telecommunication needs. The National Communication System (NCS) is responsible for ensuring responsive, secure, and survivable telecommunications during crises. The Executive Agent, initially the Secretary of Defense and later the Secretary of Homeland Security, oversees NCS operations and coordination with emergency management activities. The NCS Manager prepares recommendations for an evolving telecommunications architecture. The Committee of Principals oversees recommendations for an evolving telecommunications architecture to meet national security and emergency preparedness needs. The Manager chairs the Committee and implements approved plans. The NCS Manager, designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating with emergency management activities. EO 12472 established the National Coordinating Center (NCC) for assisting in national security and emergency coordination. The federal government is involved in the initiation, coordination, restoration, and reconstruction of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunication services. Private entities are not generally required to secure their computer systems, except for federal contractors. However, entities handling certain personal information like financial and medical data must ensure confidentiality. Additionally, firms registered with the SEC must assess their internal financial controls in their reports. Some private computer systems fall under federal regulation if they process electronic information. Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to protect customers' nonpublic personal information. Federal regulatory agencies coordinate regulations for information security programs, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Financial institutions must designate an employee to coordinate the program, conduct risk assessments, and perform regular tests. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adopt standards that require health plans, providers, and clearinghouses to implement safeguards to protect health information integrity and confidentiality. These security standards include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. The Security Exchange Commission is authorized by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to regulate entities producing annual financial reports, ensuring internal financial controls are in place. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining these controls, with external audits required to attest to their effectiveness. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 authorizes the Security Exchange Commission to regulate entities producing annual financial reports and ensure internal financial controls are in place. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Framework for Enterprise Risk Management includes the security of information technology as a critical element to assess. The Bush Administration's Homeland Security Presidential Directive No. 7 (HSPD-7) enhances U.S. policy in this regard. Directive No. 7 (HSPD-7), issued in December 2003, aims to enhance the protection of critical infrastructure in the U.S. It designates certain agencies as lead agencies to collaborate with the private sector. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is assigned as the lead agency for the information and telecommunications sectors. DHS is responsible for sharing threat information, assessing vulnerabilities, and promoting protective measures. The directive also mandates the Secretary of Homeland Security to maintain an organization that serves as a focal point for securing cyberspace and facilitating collaboration between federal departments, agencies, and state/local entities. The National Cyber Security Division was established within the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IA/IP) Directorate in June 2003 to facilitate collaboration between federal departments, state and local governments, the private sector, academia, and international organizations. Its mission includes 24x7 analysis and warning, information sharing, vulnerability reduction, mitigation, and aiding national recovery. The division leverages capabilities transferred to DHS by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and is responsible for coordinating the national effort to protect critical infrastructure across all sectors. The National Cyber Security Division, established within the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IA/IP) Directorate, collaborates with federal departments, state and local governments, the private sector, academia, and international organizations. It provides analysis, warning, information sharing, crisis management support, and technical assistance to recover from critical computer system failures. The division also establishes a \"NET Guard\" to help communities respond to and recover from attacks on information and telecommunication systems. The Department of Homeland Security is recommended to be responsible for interacting with state, local, and private sectors in the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. The National Cyber Security Division collaborates with various sectors to establish a 24x7 view of information infrastructure health, share threat information, conduct exercises for coordination, develop a national threat assessment, and encourage cybersecurity professional training and certification. NIST assists the private sector in applying security standards, and the Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 is also relevant. The Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 makes unauthorized access to computers a federal crime. It includes gaining unauthorized access to federal or protected computers, obtaining sensitive information, and transmitting harmful programs. The Act gives the Attorney General authority to enforce federal laws related to cybersecurity. The USA PATRIOT Act amended the Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984, giving the FBI primary authority to investigate offenses involving espionage or national security, while the Secret Service has authority for computer-related offenses. The Act also authorizes the Secret Service Director to establish electronic crime task forces nationwide. The USA PATRIOT Act authorizes the Attorney General to establish regional computer forensic laboratories for investigating electronic crimes. It also modified ground-rules for investigating computer crimes found in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The USA Patriot Act allows investigators to obtain a court order from any jurisdiction. FISMA mandates training for personnel with security responsibilities and ensures agencies have trained personnel in information security. NIST, in consultation with OPM, develops guidelines for training agency employees in information security practices. The National Security Agency (NSA) has guidelines for training personnel in securing national security systems, including the National Information Assurance Education and Training Program. This program selects universities meeting specific criteria to develop information security programs. Scholarship-for-Service (SFS) program, initiated after PDD-63, supports students and schools in developing information security programs aligned with NSA's Centers of Excellence program. The National Science Foundation was tasked with running a program to support students with 2-year scholarships in information security. The Cyber Security Research and Development Act authorized grants for computer security research and the establishment of Centers for Computer and Network Security Research. The Cyber Security Research and Development Act authorized programs to improve computer and network security, provide graduate assistance, research fellowships, and grants for university programs. NIST was also authorized to support research partnerships and fellowship programs in computer security. The federal government conducts research and development in computer systems security through agencies like NIST, DOD, and NSA. The federal government, including agencies like NIST, DOD, and NSA, is authorized to conduct research in computer systems security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishes the Office of Science and Technology within the Department of Justice to conduct research in tools and techniques for computer crime investigation. The Science and Technology Directorate also focuses on computer security within its portfolio. The federal government agencies like OMB, NIST, DOD, NSA, and Department of Homeland Security have defined roles in computer security. The Department of Homeland Security primarily works with private sector, state, and local governments to protect the nation's information infrastructure. The Secretary of Health and Human Services enforces regulations related to privacy of health information. Human Services enforces regulations on health information privacy, while the SEC oversees financial institutions' privacy regulations. The SEC also certifies internal financial controls for private sector firms. Various agencies, including the Department of Justice and Secret Service, investigate federal computer crimes. NSA, NSF, NIST, and DHS support research in computer security. However, concerns have arisen regarding these agencies' roles. The federal government faces issues in regulating privately owned critical information infrastructure, with concerns about the roles of different agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency. The current focus is on protecting privacy and overseeing financial reporting in the private sector. The debate over federal government involvement in improving private sector computer security has critics who argue for more secure software development and user maintenance. Critics believe the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace falls short in these areas, with developers and users advocating for market-driven security solutions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defines critical infrastructure information as sensitive data from the private sector and state/local governments regarding critical assets, vulnerabilities, protection measures, and suspicious incidents. This information is shared with the Department of Homeland Security, and the Secretary has the authority to develop systems for sharing, storing, and analyzing it. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defines critical infrastructure information as sensitive data exempt from public disclosure, handled by national security systems. The Information Protection side of DHS oversees policies and standards for systems handling this information, including the National Cyber Security Division and the National Communication System. There may be some overlap in roles between these entities. The National Communication System (NCS) has over 40 years of experience and deals with assets necessary for national security communications. The National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) works with all owners, operators, and users of the nation's information infrastructure. There is a debate on whether these functions should merge or remain separate."
