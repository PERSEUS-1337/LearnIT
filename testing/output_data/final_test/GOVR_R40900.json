    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, introduced in the House of Representatives on October 29, 2009, based on H.R. 3200. It was modified by a manager's amendment on November 3, 2009, and passed by the House on November 7, 2009. The Congressional Budget Office released an updated estimate on November 6, 2009. The Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009, signed into law on November 6, is projected to reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over a 10-year period. By 2019, it would insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population. The total cost of the coverage provisions, including Exchange subsidies, increased federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers, would be $1.052 trillion over 10 years. The net cost of the coverage expansions would be $891 billion, offset by other spending changes and income tax surcharges on high-income individuals. The Office of the Actuary estimated the financial effects of H.R. 3962, projecting a cost of $935 billion excluding tax offsets. This is slightly higher than CBO's estimate of $891 billion, which includes tax provisions. The CMS report also projected that H.R. 3962 would insure an additional 34 million legal residents, or 93% of the U.S. population. H.R. 3962 proposes sweeping reforms to the U.S. health insurance and health care system, with three main components: Divisions A, B, and C. Division A focuses on reducing the number of uninsured and restructuring the private health insurance market. Division B proposes modifications to Medicare and Medicaid to align with Division A and improve quality of care. Division B also aims to reduce federal and state expenditures and address coverage gaps for both programs. Division B of H.R. 3962 aims to expand Medicaid eligibility and address coverage gaps, while Division C focuses on public health and workforce development. The report discusses Medicaid and CHIP provisions, including eligibility, benefits, financing, waste, fraud, abuse, payments to territories, demonstrations, and pilot programs. Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program operated by states within federal guidelines. Medicaid eligibility is determined by categorical and financial requirements, with limits on assets and income. States set specific guidelines based on federal parameters, leading to variations in standards across states and population groups. There are around 50 different pathways into Medicaid, with some being mandatory while others are optional for states. Pregnant women are among the groups that states must provide Medicaid to. H.R. 3962 makes changes to Medicaid eligibility, including expanding coverage for certain groups like pregnant women and infants with higher family incomes. \"Childless adults\" are generally not eligible for Medicaid, regardless of income. Medicaid eligibility varies across states and population groups based on federal guidelines. H.R. 3962 expands Medicaid eligibility by adding new mandatory and optional groups, modifying existing groups, and enhancing outreach efforts for enrollment in Medicaid, CHIP, and the Health Insurance Exchange. It introduces four new mandatory eligibility groups, including individuals under 65 not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare Part A with family income up to 150% of the federal poverty level. Individuals over age 18 and under age 65 who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid as individuals qualifying for certain programs would receive full Medicaid benefits fully financed by the federal government. The federal medical assistance percentage would be 100% before 2015, decreasing to 91% in 2015. Children through age 18 with family income between 133% and 150% of the FPL would be eligible for full Medicaid benefits, with federal financing decreasing to 91% in 2015. Children age 1 through 18 with family income between 100% and 150% of the FPL would be eligible for full Medicaid benefits, matched at the CHIP enhanced rate starting in 2014. Other children under 19 eligible as CHIP targeted low-income children under Medicaid would also receive full Medicaid benefits. New mandatory eligibility groups would include individuals covered under Medicaid waivers and state-funded coverage. The Medicaid statutory language would extend eligibility for newborns up to 60 days old without coverage. Full Medicaid benefits would be provided and fully financed by the federal government. States cannot enroll non-traditional Medicaid eligibles in managed care without capacity to meet their needs. The cost estimate is included in expanding health insurance coverage, totaling $891 billion. The net cost of coverage provisions is estimated to be $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. States would be restricted from adopting more restrictive eligibility standards for Medicaid or CHIP programs. Federal matching funds would not be available for applying asset or resource tests for Medicaid eligibility in certain groups. The bill outlines eligibility requirements for Medicaid and CHIP programs, including income thresholds and benchmark coverage standards. It also includes a CHIP maintenance of effort requirement until December 31, 2013, after which CHIP eligibles would receive coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange. Additionally, the bill prohibits the appropriation of federal CHIP funds beyond 2013. The bill includes a CHIP maintenance of effort requirement until December 31, 2013, after which CHIP eligibles would receive coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2011, comparing benefits packages offered under State children health plans in 2011 to those available under the Exchange, with recommendations to ensure comparable coverage for CHIP enrollees. The bill includes provisions for transitioning CHIP eligibles to Health Insurance Exchange coverage by the end of 2013. The Secretary may allow states with Medicaid or CHIP waivers to amend eligibility standards for childless individuals receiving subsidies for health insurance coverage. The estimated cost for expanding health insurance coverage is $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) rules by disregarding the first $2,000 earned in a clinical trial for eligibility and benefit calculations. SSI provides cash benefits to aged, blind, and disabled individuals based on income and resources. Eligibility for SSI also grants access to Medicaid for recipients. The provision in H.R. 3962 allows the first $2,000 earned in a clinical trial to be disregarded for SSI eligibility and benefit calculations. This may increase Medicaid participation for clinical trial participants. The provision would become effective after the Commissioner of Social Security promulgates regulations or a 180-day period from the bill's enactment. The provision in H.R. 3962 expands Medicaid eligibility to include non-pregnant individuals with income up to the highest level applicable to pregnant women. It also allows for presumptive eligibility determinations for individuals eligible for family planning services, enabling states to enroll them for a limited period before full Medicaid applications are processed. The provision in H.R. 3962 expands Medicaid eligibility to include non-pregnant individuals with income up to the highest level applicable to pregnant women. It allows for presumptive eligibility determinations for individuals eligible for family planning services before formal application. States cannot provide Medicaid coverage through benchmark plans without including family planning services. Another optional eligibility group includes individuals with HIV infection meeting income and resource criteria for SSI-related Medicaid eligibility. The provision in H.R. 3962 expands Medicaid eligibility to include non-pregnant individuals with income up to the highest level applicable to pregnant women. It allows for presumptive eligibility determinations for individuals eligible for family planning services before formal application. States cannot provide Medicaid coverage through benchmark plans without including family planning services. Additionally, the federal government's share of expenditures for the new eligibility group would be based on the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) applicable to CHIP, costing $1.1 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. States are required to continue Medicaid benefits for certain low-income families through transitional medical assistance (TMA). The work-related Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) requirements have been extended through various legislative actions, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and H.R. 3962. This extension allows for coverage for certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries under the Medicare Savings Program. The cost of this provision is estimated to be $2.4 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Part B premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance under the Medicare Savings Program (MSP) are covered for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs), Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMBs), and Qualifying Individuals (QIs). QMBs have specific income and asset limits, while SLMBs and QIs have different criteria. Medicaid pays for Medicare premiums, coinsurance, and deductibles for these individuals. H.R. 3962 proposes expanding the income eligibility threshold for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs) to 150% of poverty. This would require Medicaid to cover Medicare coinsurance and deductibles for QMBs with income between 100% and 150% of poverty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this provision would cost $7.2 billion over the FY2010-FY2019. The bill would delay the asset test increase for the Medicare Savings Program to January 1, 2012, with new asset test levels set at $17,000 for an individual and $34,000 for a couple. The cost of this provision is estimated at $1.5 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The bill also extends the QI group through December 2012, with the federal government covering 100% of the cost. State allocation limits would no longer apply. Under Medicaid law, states must cover prescription drugs for certain low-income individuals, including pregnant women, children, families with dependent children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. States have the option to extend coverage to individuals who meet these requirements but have higher income levels. States can also allow individuals with high medical expenses to qualify for Medicaid through \"spend-down\" groups. These groups require individuals to deplete their income and assets on medical expenses to specified Medicaid thresholds. Under Medicaid law, states can establish nominal service-related cost-sharing requirements, with amounts typically between $0.50 and $3. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to increase beneficiary cost-sharing, capped at 5% of monthly or quarterly family income. Certain groups and services are exempt from these rules. H.R. 3962 gives states the option to disregard family income for individuals with high prescription drug costs when determining Medicaid eligibility. Individuals with high prescription drug costs may qualify for Medicaid eligibility if they meet specific criteria, including having exhausted all available prescription drug coverage and having anticipated annual orphan drug costs exceeding $200,000. States have the option to apply income disregards for these individuals, with a maximum limit of $200,000 in 2009 or 2010, adjusted for inflation in subsequent years. States can also disregard income equal to the cost of orphan drugs for eligible individuals with income exceeding the ceiling. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 limited access of noncitizens to certain federal benefits, including Medicaid, food stamps, SSI, and TANF. Citizens of the Freely Associated States are not considered qualified aliens under this act. H.R. 3962 would make citizens of the Freely Associated States eligible for full Medicaid without the five-year bar if they are lawfully residing in the United States or its territories according to the Compacts of Free Association. H.R. 3962 allows citizens of the Freely Associated States to be eligible for full Medicaid without the five-year bar if they are lawfully residing in the United States or its territories. The provision would cost $0.2 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Additionally, the bill requires state Medicaid agencies to coordinate with the Health Choices Commissioner to ensure Medicaid eligible individuals are enrolled in acceptable coverage. The state may conduct redeterminations of eligibility for Exchange-eligible individuals as outlined in the MOU. If the state Medicaid agency determines eligibility for affordability credits, they must provide determinations for any Exchange-eligible individual upon request. If the agency finds an individual ineligible, they must report the basis of the determination to the Commissioner for reimbursement of costs. In cases where the state lacks authority to determine eligibility for health insurance affordability credits, individuals must be referred to the Commissioner for a determination. Children born in the US without coverage are automatically enrolled in Medicaid, with eligibility determined within 60 days of birth. If still uncovered after this period, they are considered traditional Medicaid eligible until they obtain coverage. H.R. 3962 would establish a publicly administered voluntary LTC insurance program within the Community Living Assistance and Supports (CLASS) provisions, providing benefits to eligible individuals needing long-term care services. Benefits include cash payments starting at $50 a day, varying based on the beneficiary's impairment level, along with advocacy services and counseling. The estimated cost for expanding health insurance coverage, including this provision, is $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The CLASS program under H.R. 3962 offers advocacy services and counseling for accessing LTC services. It allows employed individuals aged 18 and older to enroll voluntarily. Medicaid would comply with CLASS program regulations, with CLASS as the primary payer for LTC services. CLASS beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid can retain 5% of the cash benefit, with the remainder applied to facility costs. The CLASS program under H.R. 3962 offers advocacy services and counseling for accessing LTC services. Medicaid would comply with CLASS program regulations, with CLASS as the primary payer for LTC services. The remainder of the benefit would be applied to the facility's cost of providing the beneficiary's care. Medicaid would be required to provide secondary coverage of such care. For those receiving home- and community-based services, the state would receive 50% of a beneficiary's daily or weekly cash benefit from the CLASS program. Not later than two years after enactment, each state would assess the capacity of certain long-term care providers to serve as fiscal agents for the CLASS program and ensure an adequate supply of workers for individuals receiving benefits. The CLASS program in H.R. 3962 offers advocacy and counseling for accessing LTC services, with Medicaid complying with CLASS regulations as the primary payer for LTC services. Medicaid must also provide secondary coverage for care. State eligibility workers at outstation locations process Medicaid applications for low-income pregnant women, infants, and children under age 19. H.R. 3962 requires states to process Medicaid applications at specified outstation locations and allow individuals to apply for Medicaid coverage at designated healthcare facilities. The estimated cost for this provision is $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The net cost of coverage provisions is estimated to be $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Federal rules do not require states to terminate Medicaid eligibility for inmates in public institutions, but H.R. 3962 would require states to maintain Medicaid eligibility for certain youth during incarceration. States must establish a process to ensure no federal matching funds are claimed for services delivered to youth in public institutions. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires states to maintain Medicaid eligibility for youth under 18 in public institutions, ensuring enrollment before release. This would cost $0.6 billion over FY2010-FY2019. States can enroll low-income children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions, with eligibility re-determined every 12 months. Continuous eligibility allows children to remain enrolled. H.R. 3962 mandates 12 months of continuous coverage for children in CHIP programs with family incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. This provision is estimated to cost $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. States can use various factors to determine eligibility for beneficiaries, but are not allowed to terminate coverage based on certain conditions. H.R. 3962 prohibits states from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions or applying waiting periods for certain groups, such as children under two years old or those who lost insurance due to job loss or reduction in work hours. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) included provisions to facilitate access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, authorizing $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants. The cost of health insurance coverage exceeding 10% of family income can lead to termination of coverage. CBO estimates the cost for expanding health insurance coverage to be $891 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The outreach and enrollment grants from CHIPRA will fund a national campaign and target Native American children. 80% will go to state and local governments and community organizations for outreach in rural and underserved areas. Funds will address cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. States must describe procedures to reduce enrollment barriers for children and pregnant women in Medicaid and CHIP. H.R. 3962 requires the Secretary to issue guidance on best practices for enrollment. The Secretary must issue guidance on standards and best practices for outreach and enrollment of eligible individuals in Medicaid and CHIP, targeting vulnerable populations. The guidance must be issued within 12 months of the Act's enactment and may involve working with appropriate entities for effective implementation. The Secretary must review and report to Congress on the implementation of these programs within two years of the Act's enactment and annually thereafter. The Secretary is required to review and report to Congress on progress in implementing targeted outreach, application and enrollment assistance, and administrative simplification methods for vulnerable and underserved populations. States can seek federal reimbursement for Medicaid managed care enrollment brokers under certain conditions. Enrollment brokers act as a link between the Medicaid managed care delivery system and enrollees. H.R. 3962 would require Medicaid enrollment brokers to maintain independence in their activities from managed care entities. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for Medicaid and CHIP under current law. H.R. 3962 specifies that unauthorized aliens are only eligible for emergency Medicaid services, such as labor and delivery costs for pregnant women. This provision does not change current prohibitions on federal Medicaid and CHIP payments for individuals not lawfully present in the U.S. Medicaid benefits cover a wide range of medical care and services, including specific items like eyeglasses and prosthetic devices. Medicaid benefits cover a wide range of medical care and services, including specific items like eyeglasses and prosthetic devices. Benefits are defined in terms of providers, services, and additional support for dual eligible individuals. Basic benefit rules require states to provide mandatory services, with optional services available for federal matching payments if states choose to offer them. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to Medicaid benefits, including adding a new mandatory benefit for preventive services and clarifying existing optional services. It also makes coverage of services by podiatrists and optometrists mandatory. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to Medicaid benefits, including adding a new mandatory benefit for preventive services recommended by the Task Force on Clinical Preventive Services. The bill proposes changes to Medicaid benefits, including adding a new mandatory benefit for preventive services recommended by the CDC Director. This provision would cost $10.7 billion. H.R. 3962 would modify Medicaid benefits, including adding a new mandatory benefit for preventive services recommended by the CDC Director. This provision is estimated to cost $10.7 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Some standard Medicaid benefits are mandatory, while others are optional. H.R. 3962 would modify Medicaid benefits to include podiatric and optometry services as mandatory, costing $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion respectively over FY2010-FY2019. Federal regulations require Medicaid plans to provide transportation for recipients. The final rule modified federal regulations on transportation assurance for school-based administrative costs. A moratorium delayed the implementation of the rule until July 1, 2009. The Obama Administration rescinded the final rule on school-based administration and transportation in 2009. H.R. 3962 added non-emergency transportation to medically necessary services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The cost for this provision was estimated to be negligible. The bill would modify federally qualified health centers to include school-based health clinics receiving grants under a new program. CBO estimates a cost of $1.0 billion over FY2010-FY2019. Medicaid law requires states to cover drug products from manufacturers with rebate agreements, except for smoking cessation products. Medicaid programs may cover tobacco cessation counseling services for pregnant women as an optional benefit. States receive FFP for covering tobacco cessation drugs dispensed as part of counseling. Under H.R. 3962, smoking cessation products would be required to be covered by state Medicaid plans, costing $0.1 billion over FY2010-FY2019. Medicaid benefits cost is shared between federal and state governments based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes. States have the option to cover language translation services as a benefit, allowing Medicaid programs to receive federal financial participation. Under H.R. 3962, Medicaid programs could receive federal financial participation for language translation or interpretation services, including for children of families whose primary language is not English. The estimated cost of this provision is $0.3 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Additionally, there is no statutory authority to provide direct payments to freestanding birthing centers for facility services under Medicaid. H.R. 3962 would add an optional benefit for freestanding birth center services under the state Medicaid plan. It defines freestanding birth center services as those provided by licensed birth attendants at a health facility separate from a hospital, where childbirth is planned away from the pregnant woman's residence. The provision in H.R. 3962 adds an optional benefit for freestanding birth center services under state Medicaid plans. It would not change state law requirements for licensed birth attendants and is estimated to have a negligible cost. Therapeutic foster care (TFC) places youths with emotional and behavioral issues in structured environments for six to seven months, rewarding positive behavior and penalizing disruptive behavior. TFC is not specifically addressed in Medicaid law. Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) is not specifically addressed in Medicaid law but is sometimes considered a service under the rehabilitative services benefit. There has been debate over whether TFC should be classified as a medical treatment and how it should be funded. CMS issued a proposed rule in 2007 that would have prevented states from receiving federal financial participation for TFC under rehabilitative services, but a final rule was never implemented. Congress imposed a moratorium on the rule until July 1, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the moratorium on a proposed rule regarding Therapeutic Foster Care (TFC) until July 1, 2009. The provision in H.R. 3962 clarifies that states have the option to cover TFC for Medicaid eligible children in out-of-home placements. TFC is defined as a foster care program providing services to parents and children. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this provision would cost $0.6 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Day health care services for adults in a community-based group setting vary depending on the model of care. These services provide social and some health services to adults needing supervised care outside the home during the day. There is debate on whether these services are medical treatment or rehabilitative, with a proposed rule by CMS in 2007 aiming to clarify this distinction. The 2007 CMS rule aimed to clarify the difference between rehabilitative and habilitative services. A 1989 law prevented adverse action against states covering habilitative services until regulations were issued. Congress imposed a moratorium on the rule until April 1, 2009, and ARRA included a provision against promulgating a final rule for rehabilitative services. H.R. 3962 would prohibit the Secretary from denying federal reimbursement. H.R. 3962 would prohibit the Secretary from denying federal reimbursement for certain adult day health care services and rehabilitative services under state Medicaid plans. CBO estimates no effect on direct spending over FY2010-FY2019. Section 1928 of the SSA authorizes the VFC program for low-income children's vaccinations under Medicaid. H.R. 3962 aims to expand the VFC program to include public health clinics as providers for eligible children without health insurance coverage for vaccines. CBO estimates a cost of $0.5 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Medicaid financing is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), which ranges from 50% to 83% based on states' per capita income. The passage discusses how states receive temporary enhanced FMAP rates for Medicaid programs through the ARRA, with federal funding matching state expenditures at a 50% rate. States control Medicaid spending levels by adjusting eligibility, services, and provider reimbursement rates. States submit quarterly expenditure reports to CMS for federal payment. The Medicaid financing provisions in H.R. 3962 aim to reduce federal and state healthcare expenditures by affecting Medicaid purchases of prescription drugs, DSH payments, and GME payments. These changes are outlined in two Subtitles of the bill. States are required to make DSH adjustments to hospital payment rates for treating uninsured individuals and Medicaid beneficiaries. Federal statute provides a formula for determining DSH allotments for each state. The statute specifies a formula for determining DSH allotments for each state, with Tennessee and Hawaii having special arrangements. States must define qualifying DSH hospitals and payment formulas in their Medicaid plans. H.R. 3962 requires a report on the role of Medicaid DSH payments in reducing the number of uninsured, consulting with community-based networks serving low-income beneficiaries. The report will include recommendations on targeting and distributing Medicaid DSH funds among states, with aggregate reductions totaling $1.5 billion in FY2017, $2.5 billion in FY2018, and $6.0 billion in FY2019. The Secretary must coordinate the Medicaid DSH report with the Medicare DSH report. The largest percentage reduction in DSH allotments will be imposed on states with the lowest percentages of uninsured individuals. The provision imposes the largest percentage reduction on states with low uninsured percentages or those not targeting DSH payments to hospitals with high Medicaid patient volumes and high uncompensated care levels. Hospitals must provide services without discrimination to be considered DSH hospitals. The provision defines a DSH hospital as one that provides services without discrimination based on payment or Medicaid status and accepts Medicaid reimbursement. States make Medicaid payments to cover costs of training new doctors in teaching hospitals. In 2005, total state and federal Medicaid payments for GME were nearly $3.2 billion, representing 7% of total Medicaid inpatient hospital expenditures. In 2007, CMS proposed eliminating federal reimbursement for GME under Medicaid. H.R. 3962 would authorize GME payments under Medicaid, requiring states to provide information on annual GME payments for monitoring purposes. Final action on the proposed Medicaid GME rule is still pending. H.R. 3962 authorizes GME payments under Medicaid, requiring states to report information on payments. The bill also mandates the Secretary to issue rules on program goals and use of GME funds by December 31, 2011. Additionally, states have the option to make hospital GME payments under Medicaid. The provisions under H.R. 3962 regarding Medicaid GME payments would be effective upon enactment, with no impact on direct spending. States can use provider-specific taxes to fund Medicaid, but must adhere to certain rules to receive federal matching dollars. H.R. 3962 would postpone the effective date of the Medicaid managed care organization (MCO) provider tax rule from October 1, 2009 to October 1, 2010 for states with provider taxes based on the prior Medicaid provider tax classification. The provision in H.R. 3962 would change Medicaid provider tax classification effective as if included in DRA, costing $0.4 billion over FY2010-FY2019. States can seek federal reimbursement for administrative activities for home visitation services under Medicaid. EPSDT benefits allow states to seek Medicaid reimbursement for care coordination and case management through home visitation services. H.R. 3962 would give states the option to cover nurse home-visitation services for first-time pregnant women or children under age two, costing $0.8 billion over FY2010-FY2019. It also includes a technical correction to the definition of Medicaid medical assistance. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is the rate at which states are reimbursed for Medicaid service expenditures, based on a formula that considers states' per capita incomes. Exceptions to the FMAP formula exist for certain states and situations, such as the District of Columbia and territories. Temporary increases in Medicaid FMAPs were provided under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) adjusted FMAP rates for states, the District of Columbia, and Territories during the recession adjustment period from FY2009 to FY2011. Under ARRA, states received an across-the-board FMAP increase of 6.2 percentage points and qualifying states received an additional unemployment-related increase. Territories had the option of choosing between an FMAP increase or a spending cap increase. Each territory elected the 30% spending cap increase. H.R. 3962 would extend the ARRA recession adjustment period for states and DC through June 2011. The 30% increase in Medicaid spending caps for territories would not apply after October 1, 2010. However, H.R. 3962 includes a provision to increase Medicaid spending caps in territories from FY2011 to FY2019, costing $23.5 billion in FY2011. Under H.R. 3962, states have flexibility to set provider reimbursement rates for Medicaid services, with specific requirements for primary care services based on 2010 Medicare payment rates. Medicare payment rates for E & M services would be increased by 1.25% in 2010 and subsequent years. Medicaid payments to physicians and other health care professionals would increase by 1.25% in 2010 and subsequent years, not based on Medicare updates. Payment rates for E & M services would be 80% of Medicare in 2010, 90% in 2011, and 100% in 2012 onwards. Medicaid managed care would follow these rates regardless of payment method. The federal government would fully finance these payments until 2015. The federal government would fully finance Medicaid payments to physicians and other health care professionals until 2015, with a cost estimated at $57.0 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. State Medicaid plans must ensure efficient payment methods and provider enlistment to meet care availability standards. Beginning in 2011, states must submit annual Medicaid plan amendments detailing payment rates and additional data for evaluation of compliance. If the Secretary disapproves, states must submit a revised amendment. This provision has no direct spending impact. Until 1980, state Medicaid programs followed Medicare reimbursement principles for nursing facilities. States were required to use a retrospective reasonable cost system under Medicare rules. The Boren amendment in 1980 repealed this requirement for nursing facility services, allowing states to establish new payment methodologies. Payment rates for hospitals and nursing facilities had to be \"reasonable and adequate\" under the new rules. Most states shifted to prospective payment systems for nursing facility services in response to this flexibility. Under prospective payment systems, rates may be set in advance and may not be related to actual costs incurred by providers; H.R. 3962 would appropriate $6 billion to reimburse dually-certified nursing facilities for Medicaid underpayments. Funds would be available in 2010-2013, with any remaining funds going to the Medicaid Improvement Fund. The Secretary would determine payment amounts for eligible dually-certified facilities under H.R. 3962, with payments made directly to nursing facilities to cover Medicaid reimbursement deficits. Certain high-cost facilities would be excluded from receiving these payments. The Secretary would determine payment amounts for eligible dually-certified facilities under H.R. 3962, with payments made directly to nursing facilities to cover Medicaid reimbursement deficits. Certain high-cost facilities, such as those in the highest quartile of costs per day, would be excluded. Eligible facilities must provide quality care, maintain appropriate staffing levels, and meet other restrictions. No administrative or judicial review of eligibility or payment amounts would be allowed, with annual reports submitted to congressional committees. CBO estimates this provision would cost $6.0 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. Outpatient prescription drugs are an optional Medicaid benefit, with states purchasing drugs from manufacturers for beneficiaries. Medicaid law requires manufacturers to provide rebates for drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries in exchange for entering rebate agreements. In 2004, CMS estimated that 550 manufacturers participated in the Medicaid drug rebate program, covering all drugs except certain excluded classes. Participating manufacturers must report average manufacturer price (AMP) and lowest transaction price for each prescription drug purchased by Medicaid. H.R. 3962 includes three Medicaid prescription drug provisions. The CBO estimates that provisions in the Medicaid law would save $24.6 billion over a 10-year period. These provisions include establishing federal upper payment limits (FULs) to encourage the use of lower-cost generic drugs. National pharmacy associations legally challenged the implementation of these provisions. National pharmacy associations legally challenged the DRA FUL changes that prohibited CMS from setting FULs for Medicaid covered generic drugs based on AMP. The court issued an injunction in 2007, which remains in place, and Congress imposed a moratorium on using AMPs to set FULs until MIPPA became law in 2008. FULs were temporarily based on the pre-DRA methodology, resulting in higher prices than AMPs. Under H.R. 3962, the Secretary would calculate FULs at 130% of the weighted average of monthly AMPs, excluding certain discounts and payments. Drug manufacturers must report total units used in AMP calculations within 30 days. The Secretary can expedite regulations on upper payment limits and AMP requirements before public comment. This authority is effective until December 31, 2010. States would receive federal financial participation for multiple source drug purchases under upper limits in effect on December 31, 2006. Brand-name prescription drugs have basic rebate and additional rebate components based on AMP and best price. An additional rebate may apply if a drug's current AMP exceeds inflation-adjusted levels. H.R. 3962 would change Medicaid rebates for extended release versions of single source drugs, allowing manufacturers to set higher prices without incurring additional rebates. Effective after December 31, 2009, the rebate for these versions would be based on a new calculation involving the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for the extended release formulation. H.R. 3962 would increase the minimum rebate for single source and multiple source prescription drugs purchased under Medicaid agreements from 15.1% to 23.1% starting January 1, 2010. The Secretary would be required to reduce quarterly Medicaid matching payments to states by the amounts attributable to the federal share of the increased minimum rebate. States use various service delivery mechanisms for Medicaid beneficiaries, including full-risk capitation agreements with managed care organizations and fee-for-service. MCOs are paid a fixed amount for all care, responsible for costs exceeding the fixed payments. Drug manufacturers pay rebates for Medicaid drug purchases, excluding certain drugs like those dispensed by Medicaid MCOs and inpatient drugs. H.R. 3962 would require prescription drug manufacturers to pay rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid managed care beneficiaries, similar to the rebates required in the fee-for-service component of Medicaid. States would need to report quarterly the total dollar amount and volume of rebates received from drug manufacturers for managed care enrollees. Drug purchases under the 340B program discount program would be exempt from rebate requirements for Medicaid MCOs. The 340B program discount program would be excluded from rebate requirements for Medicaid MCOs starting July 1, 2010. H.R. 3962 would introduce new reporting requirements for states regarding Medicaid payment rates to providers, including annual reports on payment rates, methods used to determine rates, justification for rates, and opportunities for review and comment. CBO estimates no direct spending impact during FY2010-FY2019. H.R. 3962 mandates states to establish laws for disclosing hospital charges and quality information to the public and the Secretary starting October 1, 2010. Hospitals must report on common services charges, Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, and factors for reduced charges. Individuals must be notified of charge information availability and have timely access to it, including through an Internet website. Quality of care information must also be accessible at each hospital. The provision mandates states to establish laws for disclosing hospital charges and quality information to the public and the Secretary. States with existing programs can certify compliance, while non-compliant states have two years to make necessary modifications. The federal and state governments' share in Medicaid costs is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage formula, with a minimum matching rate of 50% and a maximum of 83%. H.R. 3962 would require GAO to study federal matching payments made to state Medicaid programs and make recommendations on the FMAP formula to Congress. The study would assess the effect of removing the 50% floor or 83% ceiling, or both, and revising the current FMAP formula to better reflect state fiscal capacity and efforts to finance health services. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act established the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to review program policies affecting children's access to benefits. The commission will assess the effectiveness and efficiency of federal funding for Medicaid administration. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission was established to review payment policies impacting children's access to benefits under Medicaid and CHIP. The commission will make recommendations to Congress regarding payment and access policies, submitting annual reports starting in 2010. Additionally, the commission will examine issues affecting Medicaid and CHIP, including changes in healthcare delivery and the market for healthcare services. MACPAC must create an early warning system to identify provider shortage areas or problems threatening access to care for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries. H.R. 3962 mandates new reports on nursing facility payment policies and Medicaid payment policies for pediatric subspecialists. MACPAC's scope will expand to review policies affecting low-income children and other eligible individuals' access to Medicaid benefits, with report deadlines extended to 2011. The commission will also assess the impact of the Affordable Health Care for America Act on access to needed health care services. The Affordable Health Care for America Act would allocate $11.8 million for Medicaid and CHIP services for low-income individuals and families. States must create Medicaid plans following federal guidelines, covering various program elements like eligibility, benefits, and quality assurance. States must update their plans when making changes to the Medicaid program. States must update their Medicaid plans by submitting a state plan amendment for review and approval by CMS. Program integrity activities aim to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid by ensuring correct payments to legitimate providers for eligible beneficiaries. The federal government provides the majority of Medicaid spending for services and program integrity efforts, including combating fraud and abuse by providers and beneficiaries. Medicaid program administration costs are shared between the federal government and states, with certain administrative functions receiving higher federal matches. The federal government provides the majority of Medicaid spending for program integrity efforts, including combating fraud and abuse. Congress allocated funds for the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) and HHS Office of Inspector General activities to detect improper payments and billing patterns. Under the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, federal agencies must identify programs susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate overpayments, and report annually to Congress. In FY2008, Medicaid had a 10.5% error rate, resulting in $32.7 billion in improper payments, with a federal share of $18.6 billion. For CHIP, the error rate was 14.7%, totaling $1.2 billion, with a federal share of $0.8 billion. Improper payment measures focus on payment errors, not fraud, which is often undetected. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates significant losses to health programs. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that health insurers lose 3% to 10% of paid claims to fraud. States set Medicaid payment policies for providers like hospitals and nursing facilities. Medicare reimburses hospitals through a prospective payment system based on diagnosis and procedures. Under Medicare's prospective payment system, hospitals are reimbursed based on diagnosis-related groups (MS-DRG) with predetermined amounts. Hospitals could receive higher payments for patients with complicating conditions. The Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) program was initiated to prevent additional payments for complications acquired during admissions. Starting in FY2008, hospitals had to report certain conditions upon admission, and by FY2009, coded HACs present at admission would not be considered acquired. In January 2009, CMS issued national coverage determinations to prevent Medicare from paying for preventable medical care errors. Medicaid was also instructed to align its payment policies with Medicare's HAC policies, denying payments for HACs in dual eligible beneficiaries. H.R. 3962 would require state Medicaid and CHIP programs to deny hospital payments for certain preventable errors in medical care, including health-care acquired conditions (HACs) and never events. States would have the authority to identify additional HACs for non-payment. This provision would be effective for hospital discharges on or after January 1, 2010, with estimated costs being negligible according to CBO. The DRA's Medicaid Integrity Program allows the Secretary to contract with entities to conduct program integrity activities, audit claims for payment, identify overpayments, and educate providers. The law establishes conditions for eligible entities and requires the Secretary to follow specific contracting requirements. The Secretary must establish a five-fiscal year plan for ensuring Medicaid program integrity. H.R. 3962 would require eligible entities (MIP contractors) to conduct periodic evaluations of their activities and submit annual reports to the Secretary. This reporting requirement would start in 2011. CBO estimates no direct spending impact during FY2010-FY2019. Medicaid program administration is delegated to states, leading to variation in provider enrollment processes. States require written agreements with providers and suppliers, including record maintenance and ownership disclosure. Re-enrollment policies are set by states, with federal rules for certain providers like nursing facilities and ICF/MRs. OIG has issued compliance guidelines. The OIG has issued compliance guidance documents for providers in federal health care programs to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. While adoption of compliance programs is not mandatory, H.R. 3962 would require states to ensure Medicaid providers implement compliance programs and enforce determinations of fraud risk. H.R. 3962 would extend the period for states to repay overpayments to one year when due to fraud, costing $0.1 billion during FY2010-FY2019. The provision would cost $0.1 billion during FY2010-FY2019. Medigap insurance policies help cover items not included in Medicare. States have varying minimum medical loss ratio requirements for insurers. Medicaid managed care organizations must meet certain requirements to receive payments from states. H.R. 3962 would require Medicaid managed care organizations to maintain patient encounter data and have a medical loss ratio of at least 85% to receive federal payments. CBO estimates this provision would cost $0.1 billion during FY2010-FY2019. The Secretary is required to exclude providers from Medicare or Medicaid program participation if convicted of certain criminal offenses related to healthcare delivery or financial misconduct. Exclusions may also apply for felony convictions related to controlled substances. The Secretary can exclude providers from Medicare or Medicaid for various prohibited acts, including criminal convictions, license revocation, and defaulting on obligations. H.R. 3962 mandates states to terminate federal financial participation for providers excluded from Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. This provision is estimated to have no direct spending impact from FY2010-FY2019. H.R. 3962 mandates states to exclude individuals or entities from Medicaid or CHIP participation if they have unpaid overpayments, are suspended, excluded, or terminated from participation, or are affiliated with a suspended entity. This provision would have no effect on direct spending. H.R. 3962 mandates states to operate an automated claims processing system for Medicaid, requiring new data elements for fraud detection. CBO estimates no direct spending impact. The Secretary requires Medicaid providers to disclose ownership information for entities with 5% or more control interests. This applies to various healthcare organizations. H.R. 3962 mandates Medicaid agents, clearinghouses, or alternate payees to register with the state and the Secretary in a process similar to Medicare enrollment. Failure to register will result in denial of federal financial participation. This provision is estimated to have no impact on direct spending from FY2010-FY2019. States must deny Medicaid assistance payments in specific circumstances outlined in the law. Under H.R. 3962, the Secretary would deny payment for litigation expenses if sanctions are imposed on a state or managed care entity for misconduct. This provision would apply from January 1, 2010, with no effect on direct spending. CMS processes Part B Medicare claims, including physician, laboratory, and radiology payments, using the correct coding initiative to ensure accurate reimbursement. Under H.R. 3962, Medicaid claims submitted for federal reimbursement after October 1, 2010, must follow Medicare's National Correct Coding Initiative. This initiative uses automated pre-payment edits to detect incorrect information in claims, such as duplicate services or billing errors. The Secretary must identify and incorporate CCI methodologies compatible with Medicare's National Correct Coding Initiative into Medicaid claims processing systems by September 1, 2010, to control improper coding and ensure appropriate payment. States will be notified of the identified methodologies and how to integrate them into their Medicaid claims processing. The Secretary must incorporate CCI methodologies into Medicaid claims processing systems by September 1, 2010, to control coding errors. A report to Congress must include notice to states about the methodologies and analysis supporting their application to Medicaid claims, estimated to save $0.3 billion over FY2010-FY2019. Medicaid in states is an individual entitlement with no federal payment limits, while territories have annual spending caps. Congress has increased federal Medicaid funding for territories in recent years. In recent years, Congress has increased federal Medicaid funding for territories. The total annual cap on federal funding for Medicaid programs in territories is calculated based on inflation. Once the cap is reached, territories assume full costs of Medicaid services. The federal share for Medicaid service costs is determined by the FMAP, with territories typically set at 50%. ARRA allows territories to choose between an FMAP increase of 6.2 percentage points with a 15% spending cap increase, or their regular FMAP. The five territories chose a 30% increase in their spending caps for Medicaid programs. American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands operate under a Section 1902(j) waiver. This waiver allows certain Medicaid rules to be waived, except for specific requirements. Under H.R. 3962, the provision would increase spending caps in the territories for FY2011 through FY2019. The Secretary must submit a report by October 1, 2013, outlining a transition plan for Medicaid programs to achieve full parity in financing with states by FY2020. The report should include FMAP rates for each territory and recommendations on increasing mandatory ceiling amounts if necessary. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress in 2015, 2017, and 2019 detailing progress towards achieving Medicaid parity in financing for territories. FMAP rates for territories would be set at the highest level for FY2011 through FY2019, with recommendations on calculating FMAP for territories starting in FY2020 for parity with states. The provision extends waiver authority to territories starting in FY2011 and requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance for upgrading computer systems. CBO estimates a cost of $9.3 billion over FY2010-FY2019. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 mandated a Medicare medical home demonstration project to provide coordinated care to patients with chronic illnesses. The Medicare medical home demonstration project provides family-centered care management to beneficiaries with chronic illnesses. The program aims to enroll 400 practices as medical homes and is set to end in 2012, with a final evaluation due by December 2013. Unlike Medicaid, Medicare has more experience with medical home pilots and programs. Some federal programs, like Medicaid Transformation Grants, have supported the creation of medical homes in Medicaid. Some states have used grants to fund medical homes, with a focus on developing information technology infrastructure. The Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA) initiative has also provided funding to enhance Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) capacity, with the goal of facilitating the creation of medical homes in Medicaid. Despite federal funding, most medical home activity in Medicaid has been state-initiated and state-funded. The National Academy for State Health Policy identified 34 medical home programs in 31 states for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries. H.R. 3962 proposes a five-year Medicaid medical home pilot program for medically fragile children and high-risk pregnant women. States would need to choose between an Independent Patient-Centered Medical Home model or a Community-Based Medical Home Model for the pilot projects. Payments would be made to practices for services like care coordination and chronic illness management. The Community-Based Medical Home Model pilot program aims to provide self-care skills for managing chronic illnesses to high-need beneficiaries. Payments would be made to nonprofit organizations or states working closely with healthcare providers. The pilot includes services like transitional care, care plan setting, and nutritional counseling. Matching percentage for administrative expenditures would increase for the first two years. A report on the pilot's evaluation would be submitted to Congress. The implementation of project H.R. 3962 includes a pilot program under Medicaid for Medicare accountable care organizations (ACOs) to redesign care processes and reward efficient practices. ACOs would have to meet reporting requirements and contribute to a best practices network. The participation cost for this provision is estimated at $0.5 billion over a five-year period. The Medicaid ACO project under H.R. 3962 would last five years with increased federal matching rates for administrative services. The Secretary would evaluate the payment model's impact and submit a report to Congress. CBO estimates a $0.1 billion savings over FY2010-FY2019. Medicaid does not reimburse for treatment in institutions for mental disease, except for certain cases. IMDs are defined as hospitals or facilities with more than 16 beds primarily providing care for mental diseases. Hospital-based IMDs with emergency departments must conduct medical screening exams for individuals requesting treatment. If a medical emergency is found, further examination and treatment must be provided to stabilize the condition. The Secretary would establish a Medicaid demonstration project to reimburse certain IMDs for stabilizing emergency medical conditions in individuals aged 21-65 expressing suicidal or homicidal thoughts. In-stay review would determine stabilization before the third day of inpatient stay. The Secretary would establish a Medicaid demonstration project to reimburse certain IMDs for stabilizing emergency medical conditions in individuals aged 21-65 expressing suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Eligible states would be selected based on geographic diversity to manage benefits through utilization review, authorization practices, or medical necessity criteria. Up to $75 million would be appropriated for FY2010, available for obligation until December 31, 2012. Quarterly fund allocation would be based on availability and the FMAP formula, with annual reports to Congress required on project progress and impact evaluation. The final report for the Medicaid demonstration project would evaluate its impact on the health and mental health service system, access to inpatient mental health services, lengths of stays, emergency room visits, and provide a recommendation on its continuation and expansion. The provision is estimated to cost $0.1 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The \"Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2009\" in Division D of H.R. 3962 aims to enhance American Indian and Alaska Natives' access to Medicaid and CHIP programs through the Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal organizations. IHS provides healthcare through programs on reservations and urban areas, with reimbursements available for services provided. Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) also offer IHS services through grants and contracts. American Indian and Alaska Native healthcare facilities operated by IHS, tribes, and UIOs can receive reimbursements from Medicaid and CHIP programs. The federal government covers the entire cost of services provided by these facilities. Efforts have been made to increase enrollment of American Indians and Alaska Natives in these programs, with statutes amended to require states to enhance outreach, enrollment facilitation, and eliminate cost sharing for eligible individuals. H.R. 3962 aims to eliminate cost sharing for eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives in Medicaid and CHIP. The bill includes definitions for Indian terms and cross-references to related amendments. CBO estimates Division D would cost $0.2 billion over FY2010-FY2019. H.R. 3962 aims to eliminate cost sharing for eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives in Medicaid and CHIP. It includes definitions for Indian terms and cross-references to related amendments. The bill would require that payments received by Indian Health Programs (IHPs) or Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) from Medicaid or CHIP not be considered in appropriations for Indian health care services. It designates IHPs and UIOs as the payor of last resort for services provided to eligible individuals, and Medicaid payments to IHS facilities would be placed in a special fund. H.R. 3962 would authorize Tribal Health Programs (THPs) to directly bill Medicaid or CHIP, excluding them from the special fund. THPs would be required to use excess reimbursed amounts to improve facilities or increase services. H.R. 3962 would expand Medicaid and CHIP payments for services provided by Indian Health Programs (IHPs), allowing them to receive reimbursements directly. Non-compliant THPs may have direct billing terminated, and IHPs must meet requirements applicable to other providers for payment eligibility. The Secretary can also reimburse states for Medicaid/CHIP services provided by IHPs. H.R. 3962 expands Medicaid and CHIP payments for services provided by Indian Health Programs (IHPs), allowing direct reimbursements. It also allows states to be reimbursed for services provided by IHPs. H.R. 3962 expands Medicaid and CHIP payments for services provided by Indian Health Programs (IHPs), allowing direct reimbursements. It also allows states to be reimbursed for services provided by IHPs, including assistance with enrollment in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP for individual Indians on reservations and trust lands. The bill sets conditions on contracts and grants to improve Indian participation in the programs and requires consultation with CMS. H.R. 3962 mandates consultation with states, IHS, ITs, TOs, and UIOs to develop best practices for enrolling and retaining Indians in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. It includes provisions for agreements on Medicaid and CHIP applications, targeted CHIP assistance for low-income Indian children, and increased outreach for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The bill also requires studies on SSA programs and reports to Congress. The Secretary is required to conduct studies related to SSA programs and submit reports to Congress. One study focuses on treating the Navajo Nation as a state for Medicaid purposes, considering options like allowing an Indian entity to operate as a state Medicaid program within the Nation's boundaries. The report must include consultation details, projected costs, and legislative actions needed. An annual report is also mandated. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the enrollment and health status of Indians receiving health benefit programs funded under the SSA. The report must include information on the number of Indians enrolled, their health status, compliance of IHP and UIO facilities with Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP terms, and progress towards compliance. The Secretary must work through the administrator of CMS and the director of IHS for this report. The Secretary, in consultation with state Medicaid and CHIP directors, must submit a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment. The report will identify barriers to interstate coordination of enrollment and coverage for children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP who frequently change their state of residence or are temporarily outside their state for various reasons. This includes Indian children temporarily residing in out-of-state boarding schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The report will contain recommendations for legislative and administrative actions to address these coordination barriers. H.R. 3962 aims to improve coordination between Medicare and Medicaid for dual eligible beneficiaries by establishing a dedicated office within CMS. This office would review enrollment, benefits, and payment policies, issue guidance to states, and simplify access to benefits and services for dual eligibles. The Secretary's responsibilities for implementing the CMS office for coordination and protection for dual eligibles include examining payment systems, developing strategies for integrated care, facilitating access to post-acute and community-based services, and studying enrollment in the Medicare Savings Program to improve efficiency. The CMS office for coordination and protection for dual eligibles focuses on improving efficiency and effectiveness in reaching and enrolling dual eligibles. This includes assessing communication strategies, researching areas for improvement in service utilization and access to cost-sharing protection, and providing support for state Medicaid agencies in coordinating Medicare and Medicaid initiatives for duals. The office of dual eligible coordination and protection oversees acute and long-term care services for duals, monitors total program expenditures, coordinates Medicare Advantage plan activities, and collaborates with state agencies to improve reporting requirements and minimize duplication. It also identifies quality metrics to facilitate comparisons across different Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Secretary would be required to seek endorsement by the quality metrics contractor described under Sec. 1890 (a) of H.R. 3962 for Medicare Advantage, FFS Medicaid, and Medicaid managed care. The office or program of dual eligible coordination and protection would consult with relevant stakeholders and submit progress reports to Congress every three years. CBO estimates no effect on direct spending during FY2010-FY2019. Congress directed the Secretary of HHS to establish a Medicaid Improvement Fund (MIF) under the Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-252) for improving Medicaid program management. The Medicaid Improvement Fund (MIF) was established to improve Medicaid program management. H.R. 3962 proposes to strike MIF funding amounts authorized for FY2014-2018 and specify funds available for expenditures as appropriated by law. CBO estimates a savings of $0.7 billion during FY2010-FY2019. Personal Care Attendants assist individuals with significant disabilities with daily activities. Under current law, states have the option to cover personal care services, including personal care attendant services, for activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). This includes preparing meals, managing money, shopping, housework, and using a telephone. States can offer personal care through various state plan benefits and waiver authorities, with flexibility in determining the scope of these benefits. H.R. 3962 allows states to elect a Community First Choice Option under Medicaid programs to provide community-based attendant services and supports for individuals who qualify for institutional coverage. This includes assistance with daily living activities, enhanced FMAP for services, quality assurance standards, and data collection. The provision in H.R. 3962 allows states to offer community-based attendant services and supports under Medicaid programs. This includes quality assurance standards and data collection on the cost and effectiveness of services provided. Federal assistance is provided to low-income individuals to help with Medicare Part D charges, with no direct spending impact estimated by CBO. Low-income individuals can qualify for Medicare assistance through various programs like SLMB or QI, or by receiving Supplemental Security Income benefits. The Commissioner of Social Security conducts outreach efforts to identify eligible individuals and notify them of available assistance. MIPPA extended outreach requirements, including transmitting data from LIS applications to state Medicaid agencies with applicant consent. H.R. 3962 clarifies that states must process Medicaid applications, including MSP applications, promptly upon receiving electronic transmission of low-income subsidy program data from the LIS application. The date of the individual's LIS application serves as the application date for MSP benefits. The date of the electronic transmission of low-income subsidy program data to the state Medicaid Agency would be considered the date of filing for benefits under the MSP. CBO estimates this provision would cost $2.0 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. CHIPRA restated federal funding rules for non-legal residents and erroneous expenditures under Medicaid and CHIP. H.R. 3962 would make a technical correction to CHIPRA. The provision in H.R. 3962 makes a correction to CHIPRA by replacing \"legal residents\" with \"lawfully residing in the United States.\" This change clarifies that Medicaid coverage under approved Section 1115 waivers is part of a state's Medicaid plan for federal reimbursement. CBO estimated this change would not impact direct spending over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires the Secretary to develop quality measures for pediatric and maternity care under Medicaid and CHIP, including standardized reporting formats. Initiatives include grants for evidence-based measures and demonstrations to improve children's healthcare quality. The bill requires the Secretary to develop quality measures for services provided to adult Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries ages 21-64, in consultation with academic institutions and stakeholders. Standardized reporting formats will be published for use by participating providers. The bill mandates the development of quality measures for maternity care and services for adults aged 21-64 under Medicaid and CHIP, with a $40 million appropriation over five years. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on data availability and make recommendations for improving care quality. The cost estimate for this provision is negligible. The provision in this title does not need to meet requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session. CBO estimates no impact on direct spending from FY2010 to FY2019."
