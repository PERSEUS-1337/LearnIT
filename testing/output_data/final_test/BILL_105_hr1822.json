The Congress finds that $10.42 billion was spent on education infrastructure in 1995, with an average cost of $15.4 million for a new high school. An estimated $112 billion is needed for school repairs and construction. 14 million students attend schools needing extensive repairs. Research shows a link between school conditions and student achievement. Students in poor school conditions fall behind by 10.9 percentage points compared to those in excellent buildings. Moving students to new facilities can lead to a 20% increase in test scores. 52% of schools lack technology elements, affecting 21.3 million students. Local educational agencies struggle to finance school improvements. Collaboration is needed from all levels of government and the community to address challenges in public schools. The United States's competitive position in the world economy is at risk if the future workforce continues to be educated in schools not prepared for the 21st century. Collaboration is necessary from all levels of government and the community to address challenges in public schools. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, may enter into cooperative agreements with States to establish State infrastructure banks and multistate infrastructure banks for providing loans to local educational agencies for school construction or repairs. Congress grants consent for multiple States to establish a multistate infrastructure bank through cooperative agreements. The establishment of a multistate infrastructure bank requires funding from the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Education. Grants are provided to State infrastructure banks for initial capital for loans to local educational agencies. Repayments are used to make additional loans, and grant applications must be processed within 90 days. States must contribute to each account of the bank to establish it. The bank must contribute 25 percent of each capitalization grant from non-Federal sources to its accounts. It should designate a State entity to manage loan funds and issue debt instruments. The funds can be used as reserves for State-issued debt, with investment income credited to the account for providing loans to eligible projects. The bank must invest in approved financing instruments to earn interest for projects, ensure low interest rates on loans, start repayment within a year of project completion, and limit loan repayment term to 30 years after the first payment. An infrastructure bank established under this section may provide loans to local educational agencies for eligible projects, with applications including details of deficiencies to be corrected and priorities. An infrastructure bank may provide loans to local educational agencies for eligible projects, with applications detailing deficiencies, priorities, corrective actions, improvements, cost estimates, energy conservation promotion, and other required information. Final action on applications must be taken within 90 days. Loan criteria include consideration of various factors. The infrastructure bank considers fiscal capacity, safety threats, demonstrated need, and facility age for loan eligibility. Eligible projects must meet specific criteria. The infrastructure bank considers fiscal capacity, safety threats, and facility age for loan eligibility. Eligible projects include construction of new schools, repair/upgrading of classrooms, physical safety enhancements, accessibility improvements for individuals with disabilities, addressing environmental hazards, and provision of basic infrastructure. The provision of basic infrastructure for educational technology, bringing facilities into conformity with environmental and safety regulations, and enabling efficient use of energy resources like coal and solar power. The infrastructure bank loans are meant to supplement, not replace, other funds available at federal, state, and local levels. Repayments cannot count towards the non-Federal share of project costs. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish procedures for the infrastructure bank. Federal funds contributed to the bank do not create obligations for the United States. The infrastructure bank loans are not a commitment or guarantee by the United States to any third party. Federal funds contributed do not create obligations for the United States. States can use up to 2% of federal funds to administer the bank. The Secretary of the Treasury will review the financial condition of each infrastructure bank and report to Congress within 90 days. $250,000,000 is authorized for grants to States for the initial capitalization of infrastructure banks for fiscal year 1998 and the next 4 years."
