This work explores applying similar methods to alter the musical style of audio, focusing on long time-scale high-quality audio transfer and texture synthesis in the time-domain. The study demonstrates the ability to transfer harmonic, rhythmic, and timbral elements of musical style using different audio representations like the STFT, Mel spectrogram, and Constant-Q Transform spectrogram. The study explores altering musical style using neural networks and different audio representations like STFT, Mel spectrogram, and Constant-Q Transform spectrogram. It shows that combining these representations can capture desired characteristics for style transfer in music. The paper explores transferring artistic style from one musical audio example to another, similar to image style transfer algorithms. It aims to develop an algorithm that can answer the question, \"What would it sound like if a musical piece by ensemble/artist A was performed by ensemble/artist B?\" The paper proposes a style transfer algorithm for music, aiming to transfer harmonic and rhythmic patterns from one musical piece to another. It focuses on transferring acoustic features related to harmonic, rhythmic, and timbral aspects, rather than strict musicological definitions. The algorithm aims to answer the question of how a musical piece by one artist would sound if performed using the style of another artist. The text discusses different approaches to image style transfer, focusing on synthesizing new data that matches the representations of data in a learned model in a specific way. The challenge lies in accurately measuring the algorithms' ability to transfer style due to the complexity of disentangling data. The text explores challenges in transferring musical style, particularly in disentangling content and style components. It suggests using image style transfer algorithms for musical audio but emphasizes the importance of carefully representing content and style for optimal performance. The text discusses the challenges of transferring musical style, using image style transfer algorithms for audio synthesis. It emphasizes the need to carefully represent content and style for optimal performance. The visualization in the log-magnitude STFT representation shows how a style transfer result combines local content information with the characteristic nature of the style signal. Original attempts at single image style transfer successfully transferred artistic style through gradient-based optimization of convolutional map representations in the VGG network. The text discusses using gram matrix to match layer representations of a target style image with a content image. Style transfer can be optimized through separate content and style loss terms. Previous work has shown that single image style transfer can be re-written as a Maximum Mean Discrepancy problem without the need for a pre-trained network. The ability to recreate the content of the original image was improved when using randomly initialized weights. Shallow, untrained neural networks with as little as 1 layer can represent artistic style in images. An algorithm for audio style transfer using log-magnitude STFT and a single random convolutional layer was proposed. The Griffin-Lim algorithm is used to restore phase information for generating results. Only 1 convolutional layer with random weights and rectified linear activation function is needed, along with 4096 different convolutional kernels. Recent advances in generative music models like WaveNet and SampleRNN offer possibilities for style transfer in audio signals. These models use autoregressive techniques and have shown success in generating long-term structure in audio. WaveNet utilizes causal, dilated convolutions and residual skip-connections, while SampleRNN employs a multi-hierarchical recurrent neural network trained with Truncated Backpropogation Through Time (TBTT). WaveNet can also be conditioned on vocal features to generate speech patterns with different voices. The ability to generate words and speech patterns with different voice characteristics, such as male or female, is possible through models like WaveNet and WaveNet Autoencoder. These models use techniques like causal, dilated convolutions and residual skip-connections for style transfer in audio signals. The text discusses the use of log-magnitude STFT representations for style and content audio in style transfer or texture generation. Content loss is calculated using the L2 distance between target and content audio feature maps. Style representation involves maintaining information on how musical events relate to each other. Gram matrix of convolutional feature maps is used for style representation. Style loss is calculated as the sum of L2 distances. The text discusses the style loss in transferring musical audio styles using log-magnitude STFT representations. It introduces an extended algorithm to address shortcomings in capturing timbral style, focusing on short time envelope and harmonic statistics. The algorithm adjusts the log magnitude STFT representation of the target audio without altering network weights. The text proposes using the Mel Spectrogram to capture rhythmic information and the Constant Q Transform (CQT) Spectrogram in a 2-D convolutional neural network for harmonic style representation. It highlights the benefits of the Mel spectrogram in representing rhythmic information and discusses the limitations of the current design in capturing longer-term rhythmic components in audio signals. The Mel spectrogram is used to compress the frequency dimension in a spectrogram, reducing computation time for synthesis while preserving rhythmic information. It maps perceived Mel center frequency to actual frequency, creating a filter bank for optimal channel projection. This method decreases spectral resolution uniformly and is favored in neural networks for audio processing. The Mel spectrogram is commonly used in neural networks for audio processing. Instead of 2-D convolutions, a new approach treats the mel-frequency axis as a channel axis, reducing the number of parameters needed in the kernel. By using a longer kernel and a multi-tiered dilated non-causal convolutional structure, the model can achieve a larger receptive field for audio processing. This architecture is inspired by WaveNet auto-encoders and utilizes dilated convolutions with residual, skip-connections to enhance the receptive field. Our model builds upon the WaveNet auto-encoder architecture by incorporating a Mel spectrogram transformation at the initial layer. It can represent up to 4 seconds of audio with only 2 residual blocks, reducing computation time. Dilated convolutions are used with increasing dilation rates for each additional residual block. The model builds upon the WaveNet auto-encoder architecture by incorporating a Mel spectrogram transformation at the initial layer. Dilated convolutions are used with increasing dilation rates for each additional residual block. Style loss is computed from each layer, content loss from the last layer. Mel filters are used for representation, while a 2-D convolution over a spectral representation is needed for musically relevant frequency patterns. The CQT spectrogram BID15 is chosen for its ability to represent transposition in musical pitch. The \"pseudo-CQT\" is implemented by projecting the magnitude STFT signal onto a wavelet filter bank with Constant Q frequency scaling. This method allows for key invariance in musical content and is a natural representation for 2-D convolutional kernels to capture joint time-frequency spatial features. The \"pseudo-CQT\" method achieves key invariance for musical content using 86 bins with 12 bins per octave. Max-pooling along the convolved frequency axis helps match features from target audio with content and style audio from multiple keys. Increasing pooling width enhances key-invariance but also distorts content representation. The filter bank is logarithmic like the Mel filter bank in higher frequencies but oversamples lower frequencies. The method uses L2 loss for content and style representations, with gram matrix representations for style loss. The CQT network uses inner-product for frequency and time invariance. Initializing loss term coefficients and controlling scaling with a parameter helps optimize style transfer. The method proposes a new approach for estimating phase simultaneously with optimizing the STFT representation, using the L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm. This method is fully differentiable to the raw audio signal, allowing for phase approximation in overlapping time windows. The method proposes a new approach for estimating phase simultaneously with optimizing the STFT representation using the L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm. It can reconstruct phase in time-domain signals from magnitude STFT representations and allows for neural representations of the time-domain audio to be optimized simultaneously. The work presented focuses on using ensemble representations of neural networks to combine advantages from different representations. Key-invariance is emphasized in creating a meaningful content representation for musical events, aiming to capture general information without specifics like key and timbre. This is crucial due to the nature of modern popular music composition. The work emphasizes key-invariance in creating a content representation for musical events. Three methods are proposed and tested to examine invariance to musical key between content and style audio sources. The first method uses a Mel spectrogram content representation with few channels, capturing rhythmic hits and overall phonemes. The second method involves using a convolved 2-D feature map of the CQT spectrogram with a specific convolutional kernel size. The content representation for musical events focuses on key-invariance. A convolutional kernel of 11x11 is used with max-pooling to ensure key-invariance. The representation preserves melodic and harmonic information without maintaining local key information. A stride of 2 is typically used for pooling. Pooling in the convolutional layer versions of the representation, not the raw CQT itself, is crucial for preserving harmonic information. A greater stride can increase invariance but at the cost of information loss. Combining loss terms for key-invariant representation is recommended. Instance normalization layers, while beneficial for image style transfer, introduced noise when applied to audio synthesis. Using newly proposed SeLUs activation functions instead of ReLUs improves audio quality, reduces convergence time, and ensures consistent weighting for style and content terms. By avoiding dense neural network layers, different lengths of content and style audio can be used with the same convolutional kernels. The algorithm improves musical style transfer by using Mel spectrogram representation to capture musical statistics through texture generation. It combines Mel and CQT representations for frequency-invariant content. The quality is assessed quantitatively and qualitatively for various style transfer examples. Hyper-parameters include using 4096 filters for STFT, 1025 for Mel, and 256 for CQT in each convolutional layer. The algorithm enhances musical style transfer by utilizing Mel spectrogram representation to capture musical statistics. It incorporates Mel and CQT representations for frequency-invariant content. Hyper-parameters include using 4096 filters for STFT, 1025 for Mel, and 256 for CQT in each convolutional layer. Kernel sizes vary for different networks, with SELUs and LeCun Normal weight initialization used. Residual dilated non-causal convolutions on the Mel spectrogram help achieve a large receptive field and better capture rhythmic statistics. To measure rhythmic style similarity between a texture and its source audio, KL-divergence of Inter-Onset Interval Length Distributions is computed. Onsets are detected using Librosa's onset detector. Increasing the receptive field improves rhythmic similarity without copying sections of the original audio. Maximum cross-correlation values between audio waveforms are not significantly affected by the receptive field length, ensuring the source and texture remain distinct. The text discusses the importance of maintaining the difference between source and texture in audio generation. It mentions the use of KL divergence to measure rhythmic similarity and the need for key-invariance in style transfer experiments. The results are summarized in Figure 4, showing consistent hierarchical rhythmic structure at different lag times. The text discusses the increase in hierarchical rhythmic structure of audio over time without significant changes in cross-correlation values. Key-invariance in style transfer experiments is measured using mean squared error of log-magnitude STFT representation. Results show that changing key between style content has minimal effect on key-invariant content representations. The study focuses on key-invariant content representations in style transfer experiments, showing that using both CQT and Mel representations together yields the best results. Different combinations of loss terms and hyperparameters were tested, revealing that the optimal set varies depending on the specific style transfer task. In style transfer experiments, using both CQT and Mel representations together yields the best results. Different loss term formulations improve example quality, especially when using Mel spectrogram representations for a larger receptive field in time. The complex nature of audio style recognition is crucial for musical style transfer. Utilizing Mel and CQT representations enhances performance, particularly in singing style transfer. Increasing Mel channels and residual blocks creates a \"mash-up\" effect, blending style and content audio seamlessly. This approach preserves high-resolution frequency information for timbral representation. The Mel spectrogram representation in musical style transfer helps preserve timbral and short-time harmonic features. To address the \"breathy\" quality in synthesized audio, an L1 penalty is added to enforce a sparse spectrum. Multiple improvements have been introduced for style transfer on raw audio, including the utilization of various audio representations. Our contributions include demonstrating the use of additional representations of Mel and CQT spectrograms to capture musically meaningful style information. We also proposed a novel, key-invariant content representation for musical audio and showed the ability to synthesize a target audio waveform in the time domain using log-magnitude spectrograms. Future work may involve exploring tempo invariance, using generative models for musical style transfer, and improving phase information representation in neural models."
