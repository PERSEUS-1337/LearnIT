The Congress finds that rural school districts lack specific federal education policies to address their needs, receive a disproportionately low amount of education funds, and struggle with hiring and retaining qualified teachers, especially in special education, science, and mathematics. The purpose of this Act is to provide rural school students in the United States with increased learning opportunities, as they face challenges such as shrinking tax bases, high transportation costs, limited resources, and achievement gaps compared to other schools. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the terms \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", and \"State educational agency\" are defined as per section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"eligible local educational agency\" refers to an agency serving a school-age population with 20% or more from families below the poverty line and specific school designations. The \"poverty line\" meaning is based on section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act. The term \"rural area\" is defined by the Secretary using school locale codes 6, 7, and 8. \"School-age population\" refers to students aged 5 through 17. The term \"specially qualified agency\" is an eligible local educational agency that may apply directly to the Secretary for a grant. The Rural Education Initiative is authorized under Section 4. The Rural Education Initiative authorizes grants to State educational agencies for local educational activities based on a formula tied to student attendance. The Rural Education Initiative provides grants to State educational agencies based on student attendance data from the Census Bureau. If a State agency does not participate, the Secretary can award funds directly to qualified agencies in the State. Funds under the Rural Education Initiative can be used for local educational technology efforts, professional development for teachers, academic enrichment programs, and innovative programs for at-risk students. The Secretary reserves 0.5 percent of funds for schools supported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Funds received under this Act will not affect eligibility for other federal funding. Each State educational agency or specially qualified agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act, including specific measurable goals for student academic achievement and drop-out rates. The State educational agency or specially qualified agency can choose other factors to measure. State educational agencies receiving funds under this Act must award grants to local educational agencies or schools based on a competitive basis or a formula tied to student population. They are limited to using 5 percent of the grant funds for administrative costs. State educational agencies must submit annual reports to the Secretary detailing grant awards, fund usage by local agencies and schools, and progress towards goals outlined in their application under this Act. The Secretary will share these reports with Congress and interested parties. Each specially qualified agency receiving a grant under this Act must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing how funds were used to coordinate with other programs. The Secretary will prepare and submit an annual report to Congress outlining grant awards, fund usage, and progress made by agencies and schools under this Act. Local educational agencies must meet specific performance goals and objectives annually under this Act. The Secretary can withhold funds from a State agency if it fails to meet performance goals for three consecutive years. $300 million is authorized for this Act annually from 2002 to 2005."
