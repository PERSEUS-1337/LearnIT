    "content": "This report analyzes child support financing, trends in collections and expenditures, and the impact of declining TANF rolls on CSE program financing. It also discusses the distribution of child support collections to families and governments, with state-by-state data provided in two appendices. The CSE program, established in 1975, aims to reduce welfare costs by obtaining support from noncustodial parents and establishing paternity for children born outside marriage. Both welfare and nonwelfare families are eligible for CSE services. Since its establishment in 1975, the CSE program aims to reduce welfare costs by obtaining support from noncustodial parents and establishing paternity for children born outside marriage. Federal matching funds for CSE nonwelfare services became available permanently in 1980. States administer the program with federal assistance in funding, monitoring, and providing technical support. All states and territories operate CSE programs eligible for federal support. Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have CSE programs eligible for federal matching funds. To qualify, each state's CSE plan must be approved by the Office of Child Support Enforcement. The program offers seven major services for children, including parent location, paternity establishment, and collection of support payments. Collection methods include income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, and liens against property. The federal law provides various enforcement measures for child support, including withholding licenses, seizing assets, and passport restrictions for debtor parents. States must comply with the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and international enforcement laws. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 replaced the AFDC program. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program with a TANF block grant and made significant changes to the Child Support Enforcement program. It allowed states to access databases for various purposes related to child support, including establishing parentage and enforcing support obligations. The law required automated comparisons of Social Security numbers to ensure compliance with child support orders. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 made changes to the Child Support Enforcement program, requiring state directories to report new hire information to the CSE agency for child support withholding. Employers were mandated to remit income withheld to the state disbursement unit within seven days. A centralized unit was established to send child support payments to custodial parents within two days. The \"family first\" policy prioritized child support payments to families no longer receiving TANF benefits. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 made changes to the Child Support Enforcement program, including reducing federal matching rates for paternity establishment costs, ending federal matching of state expenditures on incentive payments, and implementing a $25 annual user fee for child support services. It also simplified distribution rules and extended the \"families first\" policy. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 made changes to the Child Support Enforcement program, including reducing federal matching rates for paternity establishment costs, ending federal matching of state expenditures on incentive payments, and implementing a $25 annual user fee for child support services. It also extended the \"families first\" policy by providing incentives to states to allow more child support to go to former welfare families and families still on welfare. Additionally, P.L. 109-171 revised child support enforcement collection mechanisms and reduced cash welfare rolls, resulting in decreased TANF expenditures. The CSE program serves both TANF and non-TANF recipients. In FY2010, the CSE program handled 15.9 million cases, with 43% being families who had never been on TANF, 43% former-TANF families, and 14% current TANF assistance cases. A CSE \"case\" is a noncustodial parent obligated for child support. A current assistance case involves children receiving TANF cash aid. In FY2010, the CSE program handled 15.9 million cases, with 43% being families who had never been on TANF, 43% former-TANF families, and 14% current TANF assistance cases. The children in these cases are recipients of cash aid under TANF or entitled to Foster Care maintenance payments. Former assistance cases involve children who were formerly receiving TANF or foster care services, while never assistance cases involve children currently receiving services under the CSE program but have not previously received assistance under TANF or foster care. AFDC/TANF cases comprised 85% of the CSE caseload in FY1978 but dropped to 14% in FY2010. Non-TANF cases increasingly consist of families who formerly received TANF. The CSE program reported data on current, former, and never assistance categories instead of TANF and non-TANF. The number of CSE families currently receiving TANF has decreased over time, while those formerly receiving TANF has increased. The proportion of families who never received TANF has remained stable. The CSE caseload decreased from 17.3 million families in FY1999 to 15.9 million families in FY2010, with the largest group being former TANF families at 43%. The CSE program consists of current, former, and never TANF families. Former TANF families make up 43% of the caseload, while those currently on TANF are 14%. The majority of the caseload (86%) is non-TANF families, with 57% having received TANF in the past. The program aims to provide stable income through child support to prevent families from returning to TANF. States receive federal funding for CSE expenditures, with a matching grant system in place. The CSE program receives federal funding and incentive payments, with state funding determining total resources available. The program aims to reduce public expenditures by obtaining child support from noncustodial parents. Custodial parents are required to assign their rights to collect child support while receiving AFDC benefits. When AFDC benefits end, custodial parents regain the right to collect child support. Arrearages can be claimed by the state if paid out in AFDC benefits. Child support for TANF children is paid to the state for distribution. If child support doesn't lift income above TANF limit, full grant is received. Excess income ends TANF benefits, and child support is sent accordingly. When the family's TANF cash benefits end, child support payments are sent directly to the family. The CSE program aims to recover welfare costs by offsetting AFDC benefit costs with child support. States reimburse the federal government for child support based on the federal matching rate, which varies with state per capita income. States with different federal matching rates for child support collections have varying reimbursement rates to the federal government. This cost-recovery procedure rewards wealthier states more than poorer states for their efforts in collecting child support. The matching rate ranges from 50% to 83%, and even after the transition from AFDC to TANF, the same procedure is still in place. States with varying federal matching rates for child support collections have different reimbursement rates to the federal government. Poorer states have to collect more child support payments per administrative dollar than wealthier states. The shift in the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is moving away from the cost-recovery goal due to changes in the program. Despite an overall increase in child support collections, collections for TANF families have decreased, with only 14% of the CSE caseload being composed of TANF families in FY2010. In FY2009, 92% of Child Support Enforcement (CSE) collections went to families on the CSE rolls, totaling $24.3 billion. This is an increase from 85% in FY1999 and 80% in FY1996. The CSE program is funded by both state and federal dollars through five funding streams. The funding for Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies is determined by state and local allocations, with the federal government reimbursing states 66% of allowable expenditures. States collect child support for families receiving TANF to reimburse themselves and the federal government for TANF cash payments. Families on TANF must assign their child support rights to the state and cooperate in establishing paternity. Child support payments collected by states for TANF families can be used to reimburse state and federal governments. States have the option to pass through some of the collected child support to the TANF family without affecting eligibility. This option was established under P.L. 109-171 in 2008. The federal government allows states to pass through collected child support to TANF families without paying the federal government its share if the amount passed through does not exceed $100 per month ($200 for families with two or more children). States receive incentive payments to operate effective child support enforcement programs, with a maximum incentive payment of $454 million in FY2004. Starting in FY2008, federal matching of state expenditure of incentive payments was prohibited. The federal government allows states to pass through collected child support to TANF families without paying the federal government its share if the amount passed through does not exceed $100 per month ($200 for families with two or more children). States receive incentive payments to operate effective child support enforcement programs, with a maximum incentive payment of $454 million in FY2004. Starting in FY2008, federal matching of state expenditure of incentive payments was prohibited. However, P.L. 111-5 temporarily reinstated federal matching of incentive payments for FY2009 and FY2010. Currently, there is no federal match on incentive payments. Application fees and costs recovered from nonwelfare families may help finance the CSE program, with a maximum application fee of $25 for families not on welfare. Hiring a private attorney is more expensive than applying for services under the federal/state CSE program. The CSE agency may charge fees to applicants or noncustodial parents, with the option to use state funds. Costs can be recovered from either parent, and fees from nonwelfare cases must be deducted from administrative costs for federal reimbursement. A $25 annual user fee is required for successful child support enforcement for non-TANF families. This fee collection is expected to increase significantly. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, initially focused on welfare cost recovery. However, the program has shifted away from this goal due to changes in its nature. Child support collections for nonwelfare families make up the majority, with only a small portion going towards welfare families. Medical child support accounted for 1% of total collections in FY2010. The 1996 welfare reform law established a \"family first\" policy for child support arrearage payments, prioritizing former welfare families over state and federal reimbursement. This policy aimed to promote self-sufficiency and cooperation with Child Support Enforcement (CSE) efforts. The CSE strategic plan shifted focus from welfare reimbursement to ensuring families' self-sufficiency through reliable child support income. The 1996 welfare reform law established a \"family first\" policy for child support arrearage payments, prioritizing former welfare families over state and federal reimbursement. This policy aims to promote self-sufficiency by making child support a more reliable source of income, reducing dependence on public assistance. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritizes arrearage payments to former TANF families over state and federal reimbursement. This may lead to reduced collections for the states and federal government. Some policymakers argue that states should bear a higher proportion of child support enforcement costs to operate more efficiently. The National Governors' Association supports continued federal funding for the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program to avoid cost shifts to states and maintain program effectiveness for serving families and children. Many commentators acknowledge the evolving mission of the CSE program over the years. The CSE program's mission has evolved over the years, expanding from recovering welfare costs to emphasizing service delivery. The 1984 amendments broadened incentive payments criteria to include nonwelfare families. The 1996 welfare reform legislation reinforced the service-delivery goal with the \"family first\" policy, prioritizing child support arrearage payments for former welfare recipients. The decline in TANF rolls and reduced expenditures have further shifted the program's focus. Expenditures on TANF have shifted the program's focus from recovering costs for a smaller population to collecting and paying child support to nonwelfare families. Child support collections for welfare and nonwelfare families increased significantly in real terms from FY1979 to FY2010. Nonwelfare collections increased almost elevenfold, while welfare collections increased by 15%. The Child Support Enforcement program saw an increase in collections from FY1980 to FY2008, with a slight decrease in FY2009 and FY2010 attributed to the economic downturn. The program generates income and expenditures for both federal and state governments. The Child Support Enforcement program generates income for federal and state governments through reimbursement for welfare and foster care costs. Collections made by noncustodial parents also contribute to the program's finances. The Child Support Enforcement program views collections as reimbursement for welfare and foster care costs, impacting federal and state budgets differently. Federal budget has been negatively affected since 1979, while state budgets were positively affected for the first 24 years. Since FY2000, both federal and state governments have experienced financial losses in the Child Support Enforcement program. Federal child support enforcement outgo exceeded income by $1.795 billion in FY1999, while state child support enforcement income exceeded outgo by $87 million. The trend in the difference between income and outgo for both federal and state governments is shown in Table 2 and Figure 4, with Table 3 displaying the long-term trend from FY1979-FY2009 in constant 2009 dollars. The decline in AFDC/TANF is a contributing factor to the increasing federal losses and the switch from gain to loss for state governments. Since FY2000, state governments have experienced financial losses in the Child Support Enforcement program, with losses increasing each year from FY2000 through FY2008. In FY2009, state losses amounted to $718 million, as states had to pay out more to operate their CSE programs than they received back in recovered welfare payments, incentive payments, and federal matching funds. This cash flow issue has implications for funding the CSE program in some states, leading some state administrators to seek support from their state legislatures. In FY2009, state losses in the Child Support Enforcement program amounted to $718 million, as states had to pay out more than they received back. Some state administrators \"sold\" their CSE program to state legislatures by highlighting its financial benefits, but only five states were able to make that argument. In FY1999, only 13 states saw increased income from the CSE program, down from 41 states in FY1994. By FY2009, only five states had income exceeding outgo in the CSE program. The number of states with income exceeding outgo in the CSE program fell to five, with high-income states benefiting more due to lower federal assistance. Mississippi lost money while New Hampshire gained financially from the program. An examination of FY2009 data shows that high-income states retain more child support collections as reimbursement for welfare costs. States with low federal medical assistance percentages no longer consistently have income exceeding outgo in the CSE program. Massachusetts and Kentucky both gained financially from operating a CSE program, regardless of their FMAP percentages. The effectiveness of CSE programs can be measured by dividing total state collections by total state administrative expenditures. In FY2009, the collections-to-costs ratio for child support varied among states, ranging from $2.03 in New Mexico to $9.80 in Texas. Despite differences, states like Maine and Kentucky both financially benefited from their CSE programs. In FY2009, states like Maine (below national average) and Kentucky (almost 57% higher than national average) financially gained from their CSE programs. Analysts debate whether the 66% reimbursement rate incentivizes states to spend money inefficiently. Limited state resources and the need to fund various programs may drive states to keep CSE expenditures reasonable. Nonwelfare collections may explain why states have been \"losing\" money on the CSE program in recent years. Nonwelfare child support collections have been increasing significantly, while welfare collections have been decreasing. This has led to states \"losing\" money on the CSE program as nonwelfare collections go directly to the custodial parent. Retained child support collections are seen as a way to finance a portion of state cash welfare expenditures. In a study for HHS, researchers found that 25% of states used child support collections to finance their TANF programs instead of their CSE programs. States like California and New York used collections to fund TANF, despite it being a block grant program with fixed grant amounts. Federal law requires families receiving TANF assistance to assign their child support to the state, and states must pay the federal government the federal share of child support collections for TANF families. The federal medical assistance percentage formula, used for AFDC and child support enforcement collections, determined the share of AFDC/TANF cash expenditures reimbursed by child support collections. Between FY1994 and FY2010, child support collections for welfare families increased while cash welfare payments decreased. Retained child support collections for welfare families as a percentage of total cash welfare expenditures rose from 11% in FY1994 to about 18% in FY2010, reaching nearly 31% in FY2002. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 replaced the old incentive payment system with a revised one, providing incentive payments based on state collections, incorporating performance measures, and mandating reinvestment of payments into the CSE program. The aggregate incentive payment to states was $504 million in FY2009 and FY2010, adding uncertainty to states' reliance on the system. The CSE incentive payment system, implemented in FY2002, adds uncertainty to states' reliance on a predictable source of income. States compete for a fixed amount of incentive payments based on performance measures and collections. The revised incentive system for Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program requires states to reinvest incentive payments into improving program efficiency or effectiveness. Indirect savings from keeping families off welfare are often overlooked in cost accounting, making the CSE program worthwhile despite apparent losses. Some analysts argue that the indirect benefits of the CSE program, such as reducing government spending on public assistance programs, make it worthwhile despite apparent losses. A strong CSE program encourages noncustodial parents to fulfill their child support obligations, leading to families becoming ineligible for programs like TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid. The impact of changes in the CSE program on other programs is considered in cost estimates of legislation. The CBO estimates the impact of changes in the CSE program on outlays for programs like Food Stamps and Medicaid. Some argue that the budget should reflect welfare cost avoidance by crediting the CSE budget account with indirect savings from other programs, showing the net cost to the federal government. However, there are practical and conceptual issues with including welfare cost avoidance in federal budgeting. The CBO estimates the impact of changes in the CSE program on outlays for programs like Food Stamps and Medicaid. Some argue that the budget should reflect welfare cost avoidance by crediting the CSE budget account with indirect savings from other programs, showing the net cost to the federal government. However, there are practical and conceptual issues with including welfare cost avoidance in federal budgeting, as it does not change the revenues or outlays of the federal government. The federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) report highlights the importance of cost avoidance in child support programs. Cost avoidance, unlike cost recovery, can only be estimated but plays a significant role in financial stability for families and government benefits. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program benefits the government through cost avoidance by transferring private funds to nonwelfare families, imposing personal responsibility on noncustodial parents to meet financial obligations to their children. Child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly over a 32-year period, but the program still only collects 19% of child support obligations if arrearage payments are considered. In FY2010, $142.9 billion in child support obligations was owed, but only $27.6 billion was paid. Total expenditures on CSE activities increased from $312 million in FY1978 to $5.776 billion in FY2010. Paternity had been established for 92% of children without legally identified fathers. The CSE program collected $4.88 in child support payments for every dollar spent. Many child support advocates are concerned about reductions in federal financing for the CSE program, fearing it will make the program less cost-effective and hinder its success. They argue that funding cuts could lead to fewer noncustodial parents supporting their children, more families enrolling in welfare programs, and reduced enforcement actions for difficult cases, ultimately impacting low-income children's child support payments. The federal match on CSE incentive payments was eliminated in FY2008 but reinstated for FY2009 and FY2010. State officials used the reinstated funds to sustain program operations and avoid layoffs during budget constraints. Funding uncertainty loomed for FY2011, with concerns about the expiration of the incentive match and state budget situations. Planning for future state CSE appropriations has become more challenging due to uncertainty about the extension of the incentive match. State officials are concerned about maintaining overall expenditure levels, especially as state budget situations have worsened since the economic recession. Delivery of services beyond the core mission of the CSE program, such as job skills training and fatherhood initiatives, is also uncertain. Officials believe these services are necessary to increase collections, but they may need to be reduced to preserve core services in the event of budget shortfalls. Enactment of P.L. 109-171 in 2006 allowed states to adopt a \"family-first\" policy, which could impact funding for the CSE program. This policy would allocate more child support to families, reducing funds available for states and the federal government. Additionally, states no longer receive federal matching funds for CSE incentive payments reinvested in the program, leading to a decline in funding sources. This poses challenges for future state CSE appropriations, especially with uncertain extension of the incentive match and worsening state budget situations. Delivery of additional services like job skills training and fatherhood initiatives may need to be reduced to maintain core services in case of budget shortfalls. The elimination of federal reimbursement for CSE incentive payments may lead to a significant decrease in CSE financing. Before FY2008, the federal match tripled state CSE funding, but now states must compete for funds from general or county treasuries. This shift has changed the CSE program from adding money to state treasuries to requiring states to seek funding from other sources. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 reduced federal financial support to state CSE programs, leading to a potential increase in state funding requirements. Appendices provide state-by-state financing information and details on the distribution of child support payments. Since the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, child support distribution rules have undergone significant changes. Payments can be split between federal and state governments, with some going to families. The rules determining who receives child support arrearage payments are complex, involving assignment rules and payment order regulations. Child support distribution rules enacted in the 1996 welfare reform law were criticized for being difficult to follow, explain, and implement. They created accounting nightmares, litigation, headaches for programmers, and audit deficiencies for states. The rules became complex once a family leaves welfare, especially regarding pre-assistance arrears and arrearages owed to the state. The child support distribution rules post-welfare reform were criticized for their complexity, involving various categories of arrearages and shifting money among \"buckets\" based on collection sources, family status, and dates. Implementation differences before and after October 1, 1997, added to the intricacy of the rules. The child support distribution rules were simplified after full implementation on October 1, 2000. States may find it easier to distribute child support under the \"family first\" approach. TANF recipients must assign the right to collect current and past-due child support payments to the state. P.L. 104-193 repealed the $50 required pass through for TANF families, allowing states to decide how much of child support payments to send to the family. States also determine if child support payments count as family income. P.L. 109-171 clarified that child support owed before or after TANF enrollment belongs to the family, while support during TANF period is assigned to the state. After leaving TANF, child support owed belongs to the family, while support during TANF is assigned to the state and federal governments. P.L. 109-171 waived federal share of child support collections passed through to TANF families by the state, up to $100 per month for one child and $200 per month for two or more children. Former TANF recipients had child support arrearage payments divided between state and federal governments before 1996. Under P.L. 104-193, child support arrearages are paid to the family first, unless collected from federal tax refunds. If a custodial parent assigns support rights to the state after October 1, 2000, all support rights accrued during TANF must be assigned. States are required to distribute child support collections to former TANF families first since October 1, 2000. Under P.L. 104-193, child support arrearages are paid to the family first, unless collected from federal tax refunds. The 1996 welfare reform law requires states to distribute child support collections to former TANF families before reimbursing the state and federal government. This includes current child support and any arrearages accrued after leaving TANF, known as never-assigned arrearages. The hold harmless provision, included in P.L. 106-169, was repealed on October 1, 2001. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 simplified child support distribution rules, allowing states to give families that have left TANF the full amount of child support collected on their behalf. This includes current child support and arrearages, with the federal government sharing the costs. The federal government shares costs of paying child support arrearages to families first, effective from October 1, 2009. A 2011 GAO report found that most states have not implemented \"family first\" policy options due to funding constraints. States retain less child support collections for public assistance costs."
