    "content": "To be eligible for unpaid leave under the FMLA, an individual must work for a covered employer and meet certain criteria. Covered employers include private companies with 50 or more employees, as well as federal, state, and local agencies. Eligible employees must have worked for their current employer for at least 12 months and have worked 1,250 hours in the previous 12-month period. If eligible, an employee can take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for specific qualifying reasons. The FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave for specific qualifying reasons, including caring for a family member with a serious health condition, their own serious health condition, or for military exigencies. The FMLA provides eligible employees with up to 26 workweeks of unpaid leave in a single 12-month period to care for a military servicemember, with job protection and continued health coverage. Accrued paid leave can be substituted for unpaid leave. The FMLA allows employees to substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave, running concurrently with the FMLA leave. Notice requirements apply before taking foreseeable FMLA leave. Employees must provide notice to their employer for leave taken due to a qualifying exigency caused by a family member serving on active duty. Employers must inform employees of their FMLA eligibility and designate FMLA-qualifying leave within five days of determining eligibility. The FMLA protects employee rights by prohibiting interference with FMLA rights and retaliation. The FMLA prohibits interference with or retaliation against an employee's exercise of FMLA rights. Employees have a private right of action against employers for violations, seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. The Supreme Court has issued three decisions related to the FMLA, addressing issues such as leave designation and lawsuits against state entities. The Supreme Court has issued three decisions related to the FMLA, addressing issues such as leave designation and lawsuits against state entities. In Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, the Court determined the validity of a DOL regulation implementing the FMLA. Wolverine World Wide gave its employees up to seven months of unpaid sick leave, but failed to designate it as FMLA leave for an employee with Hodgkin's disease, leading to her termination when she requested additional leave. In Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, the employer failed to designate an employee's medical leave as FMLA leave, resulting in the leave not counting towards the employee's FMLA entitlement. The employee sought reinstatement, back pay, and other relief for the interference with her FMLA rights. The Court acknowledged the DOL's regulation but also noted the need for deference in judgment. The Court emphasized the importance of the regulation but also highlighted its limits, stating that it must not be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the FMLA. The regulation in question imposed a categorical penalty on employers for not designating leave as FMLA, regardless of prejudice to the employee. This presumption of interference with FMLA rights was found problematic by the Court. The Court found the regulation's failure to consider instances where an employer may not have designated an employee's leave as FMLA leave, but it did not harm the employee, incongruent with the FMLA's remedial scheme. Ragsdale would have taken a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave even without the designation because of her medical condition. The Court held the regulation invalid, leading to its amendment by the DOL. Now, employers must still designate leave as FMLA but failure to provide timely notification may constitute a violation. The regulation now requires an individualized approach for FMLA leave, exposing employers to liability only if an employee was prejudiced by the failure to designate leave. Courts have ruled that employees must show prejudice to sue for interference with FMLA rights. In Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, the plaintiff, a Nevada agency employee, was fired for taking FMLA leave to care for his seriously injured wife. The agency argued that sovereign immunity shielded it from lawsuits regarding FMLA rights. The 11th Amendment provides sovereign immunity to state entities, shielding them from lawsuits. However, Congress can eliminate this immunity in federal court with clear statutory language and proper use of its power under the 14th Amendment. The FMLA allows suits against states, depending on Congress's valid exercise of its Section 5 power. The 14th Amendment allows Congress to pass legislation to prevent discrimination, such as the FMLA which protects against gender-based discrimination in workplace leave policies. Congress relied on evidence of gender-based discrimination by states in family leave practices when passing the FMLA. The Supreme Court ruled that states can be sued for interfering with an employee's FMLA right to take leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, based on preventing unconstitutional reliance on gender stereotypes in family leave policies. The decision did not address other FMLA rights like leave for childbirth or adoption. In Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, the Supreme Court addressed FMLA suits against state entities regarding employee self-care. Coleman, a state employee, was threatened with termination for requesting FMLA leave due to his own serious health condition. He sought damages for FMLA violation, while the employer argued immunity under the 11th Amendment. The Court applied similar analysis as in previous cases, emphasizing Congress's intent in FMLA enforcement. In Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, the Supreme Court addressed FMLA suits against state entities for interfering with an employee's self-care rights. The Court found that Congress did not validly authorize suits against states for such interference, unlike in Hibbs where suits for caregiving leave were permitted based on evidence of gender-based discrimination. The Coleman court found that the 11th Amendment precludes money damages suits against states for interfering with an employee's rights under the FMLA's self-care provision. The Court in Hibbs addressed suits against states for interfering with FMLA leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, but did not address leave after childbirth or adoption. The Coleman court referred to FMLA provisions for family care, allowing states to be sued for interfering with FMLA rights after childbirth or adoption. Justice Ginsburg noted that Coleman blocks monetary relief but allows injunctive relief against states for FMLA interference. One circuit court has ruled that the 11th Amendment does not prevent claims for injunctive relief against individual state officials in their official capacities for ongoing interference with FMLA's self-care provision."
