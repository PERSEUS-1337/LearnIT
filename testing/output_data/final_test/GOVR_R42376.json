    "content": "The military construction appropriations account includes funds for new construction, improvements, and planning for active and reserve military forces and Department of Defense agencies. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program (NSIP) is a common fund for NATO members to cover construction costs. Family housing accounts cover various expenses related to family housing. The DOD Housing Improvement Fund provides seed money for privatization of military housing. The Homeowners Assistance Fund aids federal personnel unable to sell homes near closing installations. The ARRA expanded eligibility for wounded DOD personnel in the Homeowner Assistance Program. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction, Defense-Wide account funds disposal facilities for chemical weapons destruction. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 1990 covers environmental remediation from past BRAC rounds. The Base Realignment and Closure Account 2005 supports military construction and relocation. President Obama requested military construction appropriations on February 14, 2012. Barack Obama submitted a request for military construction appropriations for FY2013 to Congress. The House Committee on Appropriations introduced the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2013 (H.R. 5854). The House passed the bill on May 31, 2012, and it was received in the Senate on June 5, 2012. The Office of Management and Budget recommended a veto of H.R. 5854 due to issues with military construction funding and Project Labor Agreements. The Senate introduced its own draft of the bill (S. 3215) on May 22. Congress must authorize funding for DOD, including military construction, through the National Defense Authorization Act. Authorization for military construction funding is granted through the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House version of the NDAA for FY2013 (H.R. 4310) was introduced in March 2012 and passed by the House in May 2012. The bill was then referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. OMB issued an SAP on H.R. 4310 on May 15, 2012, citing objections to the legislation that could impede the Administration's defense strategy. Issues included a prohibition on proposing additional BRAC rounds, freezing Air Force structures, reducing funding for missile defense, lack of authorization for new BRAC rounds, and enabling retroactive DOD liability for environmental conditions. The Senate version of the NDAA (S. 3254) introduced on June 4, 2012, includes provisions for retroactive DOD liability for environmental conditions at military installations closed after October 24, 1988. The Department of Defense has completed implementing recommendations from the 2005 BRAC Commission. The Department of Defense has completed implementing recommendations from the 2005 BRAC Commission, including preparing new facilities, closing unnecessary bases, and transferring personnel and equipment. The House version of the NDAA contains a provision to establish a single \"Department of Defense Base Closure Account\" consolidating all existing BRAC Treasury accounts for federal funding of environmental restoration. The House version of the NDAA includes a provision to establish a single \"Department of Defense Base Closure Account\" for federal funding of environmental restoration and property management at closed military installations. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced plans for new BRAC rounds in 2013 and 2015, citing potential reductions in military infrastructure needs due to troop reductions. The Secretary proposed using the BRAC process to reduce military infrastructure, submitting recommendations to Congress for approval. The President submitted legislation for the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2012, similar to the 1990 act, requiring a detailed analysis of future military infrastructure needs. The Secretary proposed using the BRAC process to reduce military infrastructure, submitting recommendations to Congress for approval. An independent commission assessed the recommendations and submitted an adjusted list to the President for approval. The President had limited options for disposing of the commission's recommendations. The President had limited options for disposing of the commission's recommendations list under the governing statute. Congress had up to 45 days to pass a resolution of disapproval to halt the BRAC process. The Secretary was required to implement all recommendations within six years of presidential approval, with sunset provisions written into the law. The 1990 and 2001 BRAC Commissions were terminated in 1995 and 2006 respectively, creating temporary processes for closing military installations. The President's recommendation for new BRAC rounds combines elements from previous rounds. The new recommendation for a BRAC Commission terminates on April 15, 2016. The House NDAA draft prohibits additional BRAC rounds, citing testimony that the 2005 round only eliminated a small percentage of excess infrastructure. The committee directed the Comptroller General to review DOD's processes for identifying excess bases and report findings to Congress by May 7, 2013. Congress shares authority with the executive branch to govern the military establishment. The Constitution empowers Congress to govern the military forces, while Article II, Section 2 designates the President as the Commander in Chief of the Army, Navy, and Militia when called into service for national defense. During the 1960s and 1970s, tension between Congress and the President escalated over military base closures and reductions in operational activity. President Lyndon B. Johnson vetoed a military construction bill in 1965 due to increased congressional control over base realignments. The issue resurfaced in 1977 with a proposed delay on closures or realignments in the military construction authorization bill. President Ford vetoed a bill in 1976 that would delay closure or realignment of military installations affecting DOD civilian employee positions. Congress passed a new bill with reduced notification to 60 days, enacted as P.L. 94-431. Senate Committee on Armed Services made restrictions permanent in 1977, codified as Section 2687 of Title 10 of the United States Code. The statute, codified as Section 2687 of Title 10 of the United States Code, prohibits closure or realignment of military installations with certain criteria unless specific notification and evaluation steps are followed, including a waiting period of 30 legislative days or 60 calendar days. The NDAA for FY2012 added a new restriction on changing operational activity at military installations through 10 U.S.C. 993. This statute requires notification to Congress before reducing more than 1,000 armed forces members at an installation, barring irrevocable actions until notification and justification are provided to the Committees on Armed Services. The NDAA for FY2012 added a new restriction on changing operational activity at military installations through 10 U.S.C. 993, requiring notification to Congress before reducing more than 1,000 armed forces members at an installation. The President or defense secretaries do not need specific authorization from Congress to initiate closure or realignment of a domestic military installation. Army and Air Force personnel in Germany are being consolidated into two large military communities at Kaiserslautern and Grafenw\u00f6hr-Vilseck. Military construction has been focused in these areas for the relocation. The Secretary of Defense reconsidered moving two brigade combat teams from Germany to the United States after a defense review. The U.S. military presence in Europe will be reduced by 15% over the next decade, with units like the 170th and 172nd Infantry Brigades being recalled and inactivated by FY2014. The U.S. military presence in Europe will be reconfigured, with the relocation of several units and approximately 2,500 additional Army personnel over the next five years. This includes keeping two heavy brigade combat teams in Germany, establishing a rotational brigade to support NATO, home-porting ballistic missile defense-capable destroyers in Spain, and basing new V-22 aircraft in Europe for special operations support. The U.S. military presence in Europe is being reconfigured, with the relocation of units and additional personnel. This includes keeping two heavy brigade combat teams in Germany, establishing a rotational brigade for NATO support, home-porting ballistic missile defense-capable destroyers in Spain, and basing new V-22 aircraft in Europe for special operations. Additionally, there are plans for construction projects in Germany, including upgrades to facilities and replacement projects for schools and medical centers. Japan has also undertaken construction projects as part of intergovernmental agreements. Japan is constructing a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps aviation units, replacing the current facility at MCAS Futenma. Delays in site selection and political considerations have pushed back construction, but plans have been formalized for a potential site and runway configuration. The completion date is now uncertain, with both governments aiming for completion \"at the earliest possible date after 2014.\" The FRF completion date is uncertain, with plans to finish \"at the earliest possible date after 2014.\" The U.S. force posture in the Pacific AOR has shifted, with changes to the relocation of U.S. marines from Okinawa to Guam and the construction of a new military base in Okinawa. The administration has limited the number of marines relocating and is renegotiating the relocation plan with Japan. The Administration has proposed a new strategic plan for the Pacific AOR, including U.S. rotational forces in Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines, a reduced presence of U.S. marines in Guam, and a shift of 2,500 marines from Okinawa to Hawaii. This has implications for military construction requirements in the PACOM AOR, with the House Committee on Armed Services deferring funding for additional military construction related to the relocation of U.S. marines to Guam. The House Committee on Armed Services recommended temporary authorization for the Secretary of Defense to use funds to assist Guam in preparing for U.S. marine redeployment. They also suggested prohibiting a firing range on Guam until national security needs are certified. The Senate Committee on Armed Services noted the President's request for defense funding, including $139.4 million for DOD's Office of Economic. The House Committee on Armed Services recommended temporary authorization for the Secretary of Defense to use funds to assist Guam in preparing for U.S. marine redeployment. They also suggested prohibiting a firing range on Guam until national security needs are certified. The committee expressed unease with the uncertainty in Guam relocation planning and lack of comprehensive cost and schedule data. The strategic implications of the realignment are being independently assessed. The committee directed the Comptroller General to assess the costs associated with the project. The committee directs the Comptroller General to assess costs associated with the revised plan to realign marines in the Asia-Pacific region, including movements to Guam, Hawaii, and Australia. The assessment will distinguish between known, estimated, and unknown costs, and include recurring annual costs affecting future Department of Defense budgets. Armistice on the Korean Peninsula in 1954 led to the concentration of U.S. ground forces in forward bases along the demarcation line. U.S. Forces, Korea (USFK) headquarters and military units are now centered on Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys. Military personnel's tours of duty are being extended, allowing them to bring their families, increasing the size of these communities. The GAO reported a $17.6 billion cost estimate for initiatives in South Korea through 2020, with incomplete DOD estimates. The Department of Defense (DOD) has incomplete cost estimates for initiatives in South Korea, including a plan to extend tour lengths and move dependents. The initiative could cost $5 billion by 2020 and $22 billion or more through 2050, but lacks a business case analysis to justify its cost-effectiveness. This raises concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys where tour normalization is being implemented. The House Committee on Appropriations has expressed doubts about the initiative. The Department of Defense is working on normalizing deployments to Korea with two-year tours for single servicemembers and three-year tours for married servicemembers with families. There are concerns about the expense of this initiative, and the Committee has directed the Secretary of Defense to report on the total cost and plan within 60 days. The Senate Committee on Appropriations has also raised concerns about tour normalization and the redeployment of U.S. forces in Korea. The lack of a business case analysis for construction funds in FY2012 raises concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys, Korea, for the relocation of US troops. Full tour normalization would require additional facilities and a revised master plan, impacting efficiency and costs. Funding was not requested in the 2012 budget, and detailed cost information and a business case analysis are expected by the Committee. The Senate Committee on Armed Services requires a business case analysis for strategic objectives driving tour normalization decisions before approving future funding requests. This analysis should evaluate alternative courses of action and recommend the most cost-effective option. Additionally, funding for tour normalization is barred until the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation conducts an analysis of alternatives and a master plan detailing schedule and costs is submitted by the Secretary of the Army. The provision for facility and infrastructure construction authorization was originally enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Senator Carl Levin expressed concerns about high costs for family housing in Korea. Project Labor Agreements are arrangements between contractors and labor organizations in construction projects. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) are pre-hiring arrangements between contractors and labor organizations that establish employment terms for construction projects. President Obama's Executive Order 13502 allows executive agencies to require PLAs on large-scale construction projects under certain circumstances, but it is not mandatory for all projects. The Executive Order 13502 allows agencies to require Project Labor Agreements on certain construction projects, but it is not mandatory for all projects. The House-passed version of H.R. 5854 prohibits the use of funds to require or prohibit contractors from entering into agreements with labor organizations. The House-passed version of H.R. 5854 prohibits contracting officers from requiring or prohibiting contractors from entering into Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) or discriminating based on such agreements. This provision was adopted by a recorded vote on May 19, 2012 and led to an objection from the OMB. The NDAA for 2013 extends the Secretary of Defense's authority to use funds for construction in USCENTCOM and Africa. Congress provides budget authority for military construction projects. Construction projects may be broken up into phases or funded incrementally to manage budget authority. Phased construction requires completion of a usable structure at the end of each phase, while incremental funding stages funding rather than construction. This approach has caused controversy between the executive and legislative branches over budget allocation for large projects. Congress has debated whether to allocate full budget authority when requested or to spread funding out to avoid over-committing limited resources. Congress has debated whether to allocate full budget authority for military construction projects or to provide incremental funding for certain large projects to allow for more efficient allocation of resources. This approach has caused controversy between the executive and legislative branches. The Senate-reported version of the NDAA includes provisions for creating a \"National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force\" to study and report on the force structure needed to support certain goals. It would prevent the Air Force from removing any aircraft from Reserve Component units without commission findings or recommendations, and authorize $1.4 billion for this purpose. The bill authorizes $1.4 billion to freeze Air Force structure in place or as planned, retaining Reserve Component aircraft at their current locations through FY2013. The Secretary of the Air Force's plans to transfer aircraft from reserve component units are subject to a report by March 31, 2013. The Comptroller General is tasked with oversight in Section 2704 of the bill. Section 2704 of the bill tasks the Comptroller General with submitting a report to congressional defense committees outlining criteria for realignments of military units at installations not covered by certain requirements. It also prohibits actions before October 1, 2013, that would result in the closure of military installations with at least 300 civilian personnel. The bill prohibits closure of military installations with over 300 civilian personnel without proper notification to Congress and justification. The Secretary claims that the civilian manning at these installations already falls below the required levels, potentially minimizing the impact of this provision on planned closures."
