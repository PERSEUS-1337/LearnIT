The court found EchoStar in violation of the Satellite Home Viewer Act and imposed a permanent injunction effective December 1, 2006. The court of appeals imposed a nationwide injunction against EchoStar for violating the Satellite Home Viewer Act by retransmitting programming from distant network affiliate stations. This differed from the district court's decision, which allowed EchoStar to re-analyze its subscriber base under court supervision to ensure compliance with the Act. The report discusses the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988, which grants satellite carriers like EchoStar a compulsory license to retransmit copyrighted \"distant network programming\" to \"unserved households\" in rural areas. This is to balance the public interest in providing network programming while protecting the network-affiliate distribution system. The Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988 allows satellite carriers to retransmit distant network programming to unserved households in rural areas. Unserved households are those unable to receive an over-the-air television signal at a certain level of intensity, have a waiver from the local network station, or are grandfathered in. Satellite carriers must prove their subscribers reside in unserved households, or they may face liability for damages. Two methods, accurate measurements, and accurate predictive models, are used to determine if a household cannot receive a signal of requisite strength. The Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988 allows satellite carriers to retransmit distant network programming to unserved households in rural areas. Two methods, accurate measurements, and accurate predictive models, are used to determine if a household cannot receive a signal of requisite strength. Penalties for violating SHVA vary based on individual violations or patterns of violations. Individual violations involve willful or repeated retransmissions to ineligible subscribers, while patterns of violations occur with a repeated pattern of delivering distant network service. A district court has discretion to remedy individual violations but less in cases of patterns of violations. For repeated violations, a permanent injunction can be issued against the satellite carrier and damages up to $250,000 per six-month period. For violations on a nationwide basis, a permanent nationwide ban can be imposed on the carrier. The court examined whether EchoStar willfully violated SHVA by retransmitting distant network signals to ineligible satellite TV subscribers from 1996 to 2003. Improper methodology led to 60% or more of subscribers being ineligible for service. EchoStar was found to have willfully violated SHVA by retransmitting distant network signals to ineligible satellite TV subscribers. The court held that EchoStar's conduct constituted willful copyright infringement, but did not find a pattern of violations to warrant a permanent injunction. The court of appeals overturned this decision, requiring a nationwide permanent injunction against EchoStar's retransmission of network programming. The court of appeals found EchoStar guilty of willful copyright infringement for retransmitting network signals to ineligible subscribers. They determined that a \"pattern or practice\" of violations had occurred at some point, leading to the imposition of a permanent injunction. The court evaluated EchoStar's history of violating SHVA and concluded that the company failed to prove eligibility for distant network service on a sufficient scale, indicating a pattern of violations. The court of appeals found EchoStar guilty of willful copyright infringement for retransmitting network signals to ineligible subscribers. They determined that a \"pattern or practice\" of violations had occurred, based on EchoStar's history of inadequate procedures for assessing subscriber eligibility and exceeding the 20% threshold of unlawful subscribers nationwide. The court concluded that EchoStar's behavior showed a lack of interest in complying with the law. The court of appeals found EchoStar guilty of willful copyright infringement for retransmitting network signals to ineligible subscribers. They determined a \"pattern or practice\" of violations, citing EchoStar's history of inadequate procedures for assessing subscriber eligibility and exceeding the 20% threshold of unlawful subscribers nationwide. The court ordered a nationwide permanent injunction against retransmitting distant network programming under the act's statutory license. EchoStar and the Affiliate Associations filed a Notice of Settlement in the district court ten days after the court of appeals decision. Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox) then filed a motion for a nationwide permanent injunction. The district court issued two orders in response to Fox's motion, with EchoStar and the Affiliate Associations arguing against the injunction, claiming Fox lacked standing and that the injunction was overly broad. The district court rejected EchoStar and Affiliate Associations' arguments against the nationwide permanent injunction sought by Fox, stating that Fox's standing was irrelevant and the court had an obligation to implement the Eleventh Circuit's mandate. The court also found it could not review or alter the mandate based on the parties' settlement agreement. The district court granted a Permanent Injunction against EchoStar from retransmitting certain network stations' content. This decision was based on the court's discretion and the absence of manifest injustice. The injunction was effective from December 1, 2006. Introduced by Senator Sununu and co-sponsored by Senator Gregg, the bill allows satellite broadcasters to continue retransmitting network stations in states with a single full-power network station. Introduced by Representative Boren, it permits subscribers in Oklahoma to receive secondary transmissions of network stations. Introduced by Senator Salazar, it allows subscribers in certain Colorado counties to receive secondary transmissions of network stations located in the state capital. The legislation introduced in the second session of the 109th Congress aimed to allow satellite providers to continue offering distant network services under certain conditions despite a court's permanent injunction. Senator Leahy and Representative Mollohan were among the key sponsors of the bill. The legislation introduced in the second session of the 109th Congress aimed to allow satellite providers to continue offering distant network services under certain conditions despite a court's permanent injunction. It would have allowed a satellite broadcaster to continue retransmitting in states with a single full-power network station and permitted subscribers in two counties in Colorado to choose to receive transmissions of any network station located in Denver. Additionally, it would have allowed a court to approve a settlement agreement reached in litigation resulting in a permanent injunction."
