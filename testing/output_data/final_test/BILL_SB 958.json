    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Chapter 6.3 of the Elections Code adds a Citizens Redistricting Commission in the County of Los Angeles, with defined terms and responsibilities. The commission will adjust supervisorial district boundaries following the decennial federal census, starting in 2020. The Citizens Redistricting Commission in the County of Los Angeles consists of 14 members selected independently to represent the county's diversity. Members' political party preferences are proportional to registered voters, with at least one member from each supervisorial district. All members must be residents of the county. To be eligible for the Citizens Redistricting Commission in the County of Los Angeles, applicants must be residents of the county, continuously registered with the same political party or unaffiliated for five years, have voted in one of the last three statewide elections, and not have had any immediate family members involved in political office within the past 10 years. To be eligible for the Citizens Redistricting Commission in the County of Los Angeles, applicants must have relevant experience in politics, analytical skills, impartiality, and an appreciation for the county's demographics and geography. This includes serving as an employee or consultant for elected representatives, candidates, or political parties, being a registered lobbyist, and understanding state and federal legal requirements. Interested individuals meeting specified qualifications can apply to the county elections official for membership on the commission. The official will review applications and select 60 qualified applicants based on outlined requirements. The names of the selected applicants will be made public for 30 days, and there should be no communication regarding the nomination process before the publication of the list. After reviewing applications, the county elections official may eliminate applicants who do not meet qualifications. Subpools are created for each supervisorial district, with one commissioner selected from each subpool through a random drawing. Additional commissioners are chosen randomly from the remaining applicants, regardless of subpools. The eight commissioners will appoint six additional members to the commission based on relevant experience, analytical skills, and diversity. Political party preference will also be considered. Commission members must act impartially and uphold public confidence in the redistricting process. The term of office for each member expires upon the appointment of the next commission member. The commission requires nine members for a quorum and nine affirmative votes for official action. Consultants must meet qualifications as applicants. Each member must adhere to conflict of interest regulations. The commission will establish supervisorial districts based on specific criteria. Districts must comply with the US Constitution, have reasonably equal populations, be geographically contiguous, and adhere to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Districts must be geographically contiguous and respect the geographic integrity of communities of interest. Communities of interest are defined as populations with common social and economic interests. Districts should also be drawn to encourage geographical compactness. The commission responsible for drawing district maps in Los Angeles must comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act and conduct public hearings before finalizing a map. Incumbents' residences cannot influence map creation, and districts should not favor any political entity. The commission in Los Angeles must hold public hearings following the Ralph M. Brown Act to finalize district maps. Hearings must be scheduled at various times to accommodate different schedules and reach a wide audience. The agenda for the hearings must be posted at least seven days in advance, and live translation in applicable languages can be arranged with a 24-hour notice. The Los Angeles commission must encourage residents to participate in the redistricting public review process by providing information through various channels, coordinating with community organizations, and posting details on the County's website. The board overseeing redistricting must ensure a complete database is available to the public, provide funding and staffing for the commission, and make all records and data public. The commission must adopt a redistricting plan by August 15 following the decennial census, which can be subject to referendum like ordinances. The commission overseeing redistricting must issue a report with the final map, explaining the basis for their decisions. Commission members are ineligible for certain public offices for a specified period after appointment. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the unique circumstances in Los Angeles County. If state mandates incur costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
