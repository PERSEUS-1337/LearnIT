The DBCFT with a border-adjustment tax would only tax production consumed in the US, exempting domestically produced goods sold abroad. This proposal has sparked interest in evaluating the costs and benefits of switching to a DBCFT and BAT, with a focus on the impact on exchange rates. The report discusses how exchange rates could respond to a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) proposed as part of the \"A Better Way\" tax reform blueprint. It explores the potential implications for U.S. businesses and consumers if exchange rate movements do not completely offset the tax, affecting the U.S. trade balance. The report provides a framework for understanding the impact of a BAT on exchange rates and the economy. The report reviews the standard economic theory on how exchange rates should respond to a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) and the arguments against these predictions. It also examines existing literature on the relationship between exchange rates and BAT systems in other countries. A border adjustment is typically part of a national consumption tax that applies differently to imports and exports. The recent congressional debates propose a 20% tax on all imports into the United States, with no tax on exports. American companies selling goods domestically would also face the 20% tax. This destination-based tax system would only apply to goods consumed in the US, adjusting business taxes at the border to tax imports and exempt exports. In examples illustrating how a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) functions, a Japanese firm selling $1 million worth of goods in the US would pay a 20% tax of $200,000. An American firm buying $200,000 of domestically sourced inputs to produce $1 million worth of goods for domestic sale would deduct the production costs and pay a 20% tax on the remaining amount. An American firm pays $200,000 for domestically sourced inputs to produce $1 million worth of goods. Sales abroad result in no tax, while half of sales in the US incur a 20% tax on $300,000. With full border adjustment, the firm could receive a tax refund of $40,000. The American firm pays $200,000 for domestic inputs to produce $1 million in goods. Sales abroad are tax-free, while half of US sales incur a 20% tax on $300,000. For foreign sales, only domestically sourced inputs are deductible against $500,000 in sales, resulting in a $80,000 tax. Economists believe exchange rates will adjust to offset price changes from a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) in the US. The implementation of a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) in the United States should have no direct effects on the trade balance. The theory assumes flexible U.S. exchange rates and a full border adjustment, where all imports are taxed and exports are not. With a flexible exchange rate regime, the analysis focuses on the implications of the tax without full border adjustment. Understanding how exchange-rate adjustments can offset the effects of a BAT involves supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. Initially, a BAT would make U.S. exports more attractive to foreigners, increasing demand. The implementation of a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) in the United States would initially increase the demand for U.S. exports, leading to a rise in the value of the dollar. This would make imported goods less attractive to American consumers and businesses, reducing the supply of dollars in the market. The combination of increased demand for dollars and decreased supply due to reduced imports would cause the dollar's exchange rate value to appreciate. The BAT rate determines the dollar's appreciation in value against other currencies. Debate exists on how fast the exchange rate adjustment will occur, with some arguing for an almost instantaneous adjustment and others suggesting real-world frictions may slow the process. The BAT rate determines the dollar's appreciation against other currencies, with debate on the speed of exchange rate adjustment. Contracts in dollars may delay adjustment, but ultimately, the BAT cannot sustainably increase exports over imports due to economic constraints. Countries can have bilateral trade surpluses or deficits, and less than full border adjustment could affect the exchange rate. The \"A Better Way\" blueprint proposes full border adjustment for taxation on imports and exports. If not made refundable, large U.S. exporters could face significant tax losses. They would need a refund from the Treasury to offset their negative income positions. The \"A Better Way\" plan proposes full border adjustment for taxation on imports and exports, potentially leading to firms unable to use their tax losses. This could result in firms merging with profitable companies to claim losses, indirectly affecting the trade balance. Additionally, a BAT could increase government saving by raising revenue in the near term. The proposed Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) is expected to raise revenue in the near term, increasing government saving and reducing the trade deficit by lessening reliance on foreign capital. However, a country cannot sustain a trade surplus or deficit indefinitely and must have a zero present-value trade balance. While a temporary revenue surge may improve the trade balance temporarily, it cannot make the United States a permanent net exporter. Initial indications suggest that the revenue generated from a BAT may be offset by other aspects of the tax reform proposal. The proposed Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) is expected to raise revenue in the near term, increasing government saving and reducing the trade deficit. However, estimates from the Tax Policy Center (TPC) and the Tax Foundation suggest that the \"A Better Way\" plan would result in an overall revenue loss. This could alter the national investment and saving relationship, potentially increasing the trade deficit. Other proposals in the plan, such as a repatriation holiday or incentives for investment in the U.S., may also dampen any improvement in the trade deficit. Exchange-rate responses to the proposed tax reform are uncertain due to limited empirical evidence, as similar taxes have not been implemented in other countries. The international experience with value-added taxes (VAT) shows that border adjustments are used to ensure taxes apply to consumption. However, applying empirical VAT exchange rate evidence to a U.S. Border Adjustment Tax (BAT) may be limited due to uncertainties in timing and global market complexities. The implementation of border-adjusted taxes may lead to responses in exchange rates and trade balances, but uncertainties arise due to timing, global market complexities, and accompanying changes in tax and spending policies. Some recent implementations of border adjustment have occurred in countries with smaller global impacts than the United States, potentially affecting the likelihood of interference with full exchange-rate adjustment. Exchange-rate changes could significantly impact countries with debt in U.S. dollars but assets in their own currencies, leading to effects on financial markets. Other obstacles to exchange-rate adjustment are independent of economy size. Additionally, VAT introductions in economies with fixed exchange rates may not be suitable for evaluating border adjustments. Countries with fixed exchange rates may not be suitable for evaluating border adjustments due to limitations in trade flow adjustments. Even countries with flexible exchange rates, like those in the Eurozone, may have restricted exchange rate responses. Studies suggest a full and timely exchange-rate response to VATs, with research showing the impact of VATs on trade balances in OECD countries. The authors analyzed the effect of VAT implementation on trade balances, finding no significant impact in countries with flexible exchange rates. Timing and compliance issues play a role in determining short-run effects of tax reform. Desai and Hines (2001) studied market reactions to potential EU actions against the US regarding tax incentives for exporters. The authors studied the impact of VAT implementation on trade balances, with findings showing no significant effect in countries with flexible exchange rates. Research has shown varying effects of VATs on export performance and trade behavior across industries in OECD countries. Taxation reduces trade volumes of exports and imports, with different effects across industries. Freund and Gagnon (2017) analyze the impact of consumption taxes on trade behavior using OECD data. Replacing the corporate income tax system with a DBCFT with a BAT would be a significant shift in U.S. tax policy, with economists suggesting that any tax-induced advantage for U.S. exports or costs on U.S. imports would be balanced by adjustments to the exchange rate. The DBCFT proposal may lead to adjustments in trade balance due to dollar appreciation, but the speed of these adjustments is uncertain. Concerns include potential conflicts with WTO rules, tax losses for exporting companies, and the need for further analysis on its impact. The tax reform plan may lead to difficulties for exporters in offsetting losses with taxable income. Other parts of the reform could impact exchange rates and trade balance, potentially contradicting traditional economic theory on border adjustments."
