    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Work Force Diversity Partnership Act of 1993\". Congress acknowledges the increasing diversity in the American workforce, with people of color, Caucasian women, and immigrants expected to make up a significant portion of the labor force growth. There is a lack of preparedness among employees, managers, and government officials to effectively manage this diversity, which is crucial for competing in the global market. Employers need to effectively motivate and manage a diverse workforce, especially as more parents join the workforce, making it challenging to balance work and family demands. Understanding and valuing diversity can lead to improved creativity, self-initiative, leadership, innovation, and teamwork, ultimately enhancing working conditions and economic success for all Americans. The Act aims to establish a grant program to study and address workforce and cultural diversity issues, and develop education and training materials. The Act establishes a grant program to address workforce and cultural diversity issues. The Federal share of the grant is 50%, but the Secretary can increase it if needed. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The non-Federal share is the amount required to be expended by the recipient. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Labor. The non-Federal share for a grant recipient may include in-kind services or other resources. The Workforce Diversity Grant Program is established under Section 5. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities for programs focusing on workforce and cultural diversity, including developing education materials, fostering research, and assisting in dissemination for private sector training efforts. The Secretary awards grants for workforce diversity programs, including education and training for industry leaders and workers. Recipients must establish and fund the programs for up to 3 years. SEC. 6. GRANT RECIPIENT SELECTION. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, an entity must submit a proposal to the Secretary. Institutions of higher education partnering with organizations like corporations, businesses, labor organizations, or those with expertise in workforce diversity can receive grants. Selection criteria for approval are based on various factors. The Secretary considers factors like potential impact, participant involvement, diversity awareness, best practices development, and project impact when approving grant proposals under this Act. The Secretary prioritizes grant proposals that show non-Federal contributions and resources from non-governmental entities. Faculty participation in grant proposals is encouraged to involve teams from various disciplines, student affairs professionals, and multicultural education organizations. Other criteria may be prescribed by the Secretary for evaluating the impact on the international competitiveness of the US economy. SEC. 7. AREAS OF ACTION. A grant recipient must use the funds for activities related to addressing cultural and workforce diversity issues in the workplace. This includes developing instructional materials, education and training materials for the public and private sectors, and creating new approaches to diversity issues in various academic disciplines. The grantee can implement approaches in conjunction with corporate education and training programs, conduct research on multicultural workplace interactions, implement faculty development programs focusing on teaching multicultural management, develop models for precollege business internship programs, and organize forums, workshops, and conferences. (7) Forums, workshops, and conferences will focus on sensitizing managers, employees, and leaders to workplace diversity issues. (8) Any other activities deemed appropriate by the Secretary to meet the Act's purposes. SEC. 8. PEER REVIEW. The Secretary will establish peer review panels to evaluate grant proposals under this Act, seeking qualified individuals from participants. Each panel will report findings to the Secretary. SEC. 9. RECIPIENT REPORTS. Each recipient of a grant under this Act must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing progress, expenditures, planned use of funds, and results of the grant program. The Secretary will also provide an annual report to Congress evaluating the progress of achieving the Act's purposes. Authorization of appropriations is included. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and necessary sums for fiscal years 1995 through 1998."
