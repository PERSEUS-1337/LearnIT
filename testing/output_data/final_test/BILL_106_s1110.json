    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering Establishment Act\". The Congress finds that basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, and informatics is crucial for improving healthcare. This research requires a separate identity and research home at the NIH independent of existing institutes. Noninvasive imaging techniques are essential for early disease detection and diagnosis. The development of advanced genetic and molecular imaging techniques is crucial for rapid discovery in molecular biology. Telemedicine, especially teleradiology, plays a vital role in delivering reliable medical care to underserved populations. Federal departments and agencies support imaging and engineering research for potential medical advancements. The development of advanced genetic and molecular imaging techniques is crucial for rapid discovery in molecular biology. A central coordinating body at the NIH is needed to facilitate the transfer of breakthrough imaging technologies with medical applications and promote scientific advance and U.S. economic development. It is appropriate to modernize the structure of the NIH to ensure research progress and add significant resources in the coming years. The NIH needs to modernize its structure to improve research efficiency and emphasize fields that have made significant contributions to medical science. Establishing a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering would accelerate technology development, improve coordination, reduce waste, promote economic development, and train young researchers for future discoveries. Establishment of National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering under Part C of the Public Health Service Act to accelerate technology development, improve coordination, reduce waste, promote economic development, and train young researchers for future discoveries. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering (referred to as the Institute) conducts research, training, and dissemination of health information in the field of biomedical imaging and engineering. The Director establishes a National Biomedical Imaging and Engineering Program to support activities related to these technologies. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering focuses on research and development in biomedical imaging and engineering. This includes new techniques and devices, research in various disciplines, technology assessments, disease screening, advancing existing modalities, and developing target-specific agents for disease identification. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering focuses on developing advanced engineering and imaging technologies for research at molecular, genetic, organ, and body levels. This includes new techniques and devices for interventional procedures like image-guided interventions. The Director prepares a plan to coordinate activities in biomedical imaging and engineering. The Director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering prepares a plan with recommendations for enhancing support of basic biomedical imaging and engineering research, including the consolidation of programs at the National Institutes of Health. The plan is periodically reviewed and revised, with any revisions transmitted to the Secretary and the Director of NIH. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering conducts research in biomedical imaging and engineering. An advisory council with 12 members is established, including scientists, engineers, physicians, and health professionals in the field. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering establishes an advisory council with 12 members, including scientists, engineers, physicians, and health professionals from various disciplines. Ex officio members include officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Authorization of appropriations is subject to specific conditions. For fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002, appropriations are authorized for biomedical imaging and engineering, adjusted for inflation. The authorization of appropriations for biomedical imaging and engineering for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002 is reduced by any appropriations made for similar programs by other national research institutes. The Director of the NIH can transfer personnel and utilize facilities for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering can receive administrative support from other NIH agencies and establish an advisory council within 90 days. No construction of facilities or land acquisition is authorized for the Institute's operation. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Engineering is added as a new entity under the Public Health Service Act. The Act will be effective on October 1, 1999, or upon its enactment, whichever is later."
