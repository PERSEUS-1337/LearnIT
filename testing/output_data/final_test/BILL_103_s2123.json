    "content": "The \"Derivatives Limitations Act of 1994\" may be cited as such. It amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by adding a new section regarding derivative instruments. The Derivatives Limitations Act of 1994 prohibits insured depository institutions and affiliates from engaging in derivative financial instrument transactions, with exceptions for hedging transactions approved by the appropriate Federal banking agency and separately capitalized affiliates. Insured depository institutions and their affiliates can engage in derivative financial instrument transactions if they comply with rules set by the appropriate Federal banking agency. Additionally, insured depository institutions can participate in transactions involving de minimis interests in derivatives as defined and approved by the agency. During the 3-month period after enactment, existing interests in derivative financial instruments of insured depository institutions are protected. This section does not affect current interests or limit the institution's ability to acquire related interests for resolution purposes. The appropriate Federal banking agency shall issue rules, regulations, and orders governing exceptions for derivative financial instruments, including public notice requirements and affiliate notification about lack of federal insurance or guarantees. The appropriate Federal banking agency defines derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions for regulatory purposes. The term 'hedging transaction' refers to a derivative financial instrument used by institutions to reduce risks related to price changes, currency fluctuations, interest rates, and investments. The institution must clearly identify a transaction as a hedging transaction at the time it is entered into, as prescribed by the appropriate Federal banking agency. SEC. 215. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS added to Title II of the Federal Credit Union Act. SEC. 215 of the Federal Credit Union Act prohibits insured credit unions and affiliates from engaging in derivative financial instrument transactions, with exceptions outlined in subsection (b). The term 'derivative financial instrument' is defined as an instrument whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, loan instruments, or other assets. Section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act applies to insured credit unions and affiliates, enforceable by the Board. The Federal Credit Union Act prohibits credit unions from engaging in derivative financial instrument transactions, with exceptions outlined. Derivative financial instruments are defined as instruments derived from various financial assets, as determined by the Board. SEC. 4. BANK HOLDING COMPANIES. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 is amended to allow subsidiaries of bank holding companies to engage in derivative activities if they are separately capitalized from insured depository institutions. This new subsection also applies Section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to bank holding companies and the Board. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 is amended to allow subsidiaries of bank holding companies to engage in derivative activities, separate from insured depository institutions. The Board enforces these provisions with respect to bank holding companies under this Act, defining derivative financial instruments broadly to include various types of instruments."
