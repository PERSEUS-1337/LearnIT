The review includes data on the number of individuals served and details on the types of mental health services provided, such as screenings, assessments, outpatient services, crisis interventions, and psychotropic medication support services. The annual mental health plan review for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care includes access to timely mental health services, quality of services, translation and interpretation services, performance data, and utilization data. The department will post utilization data for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care, along with medication monitoring measures related to psychotropic medications on their website for public access. The department reviews EQRO data for Medi-Cal eligible minors and nonminors in foster care. Identified deficiencies in mental health plans serving these individuals are notified in writing. Plans must submit corrective action plans within 60 days, with final plans made publicly available on the department's website. The department shares data with county boards of supervisors to assist in developing mental health service plans, including performance outcome system data for Medi-Cal eligible minors and nonminors in foster care. This data includes information on youth receiving specialty mental health services and their racial distribution. The curr_chunk provides data on the racial and gender distribution of youth receiving specialty mental health services, the number of youth with different levels of service visits by race, and utilization data for various mental health services. It also includes a unique count of youth receiving services who are arriving, exiting, and continuing with services. The department will include disaggregated data for Medi-Cal eligible minor and nonminor dependents in foster care in the performance outcome system metrics."
