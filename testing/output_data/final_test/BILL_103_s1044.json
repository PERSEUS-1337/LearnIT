    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act of 1993\". The Congress findings include the adoption of a policy in 1991 suspending defense exports to Yugoslavia, the UN imposing an arms embargo through Resolution 713, and the US considering its policy compliant with the resolution. Subsequently, Resolution 727 extended the arms embargo to any emerging independent states. On February 29 and March 1, 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina voted for independence from Yugoslavia. The United States recognized the government on April 7, 1992, and Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the United Nations on May 22, 1992. The US policy towards independent states emerging from former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, has been consistent since July 10, 1991. After Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence referendum, the siege of Sarajevo began, and fighting spread. The Government of Serbia intervened by providing military, financial, and political support to Serbian-allied forces. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe accused Serbia of aggression, leading to UN Security Council Resolution 757 condemning Serbia. Resolution 757 condemned Serbia for supporting Serbian-allied forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, occupying 70% of the territory, committing human rights violations, and aiming for unification with Serbia. This support was deemed an armed attack on Bosnia and Herzegovina by Serbia under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a UN member, has the right to self-defense against Serbia until the UN Security Council acts. However, the Council's response has not been enough to maintain peace. Bosnia lacks the means to counter Serbia's heavy weaponry due to an international arms embargo. The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 47/121 urging the Security Council to exempt Bosnia and Herzegovina from the arms embargo to counter Serbia's heavy weaponry. This embargo undermines Bosnia's right to self-defense as a UN member. Bosnia and Herzegovina's right of self-defense includes the ability to seek military assistance from other countries, as outlined in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The United States imposes an arms embargo on the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The President will end the US arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina upon receiving a request for self-defense assistance under the UN Charter. The embargo refers to the policy in place since July 1991 that restricts defense transfers. The US arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina will be lifted upon request for self-defense assistance under the UN Charter, but transfers of defense articles and services to the former Yugoslavia remain denied. SEC. 4. United States military assistance for Bosnia and Herzegovina includes lifting the arms embargo upon request for self-defense assistance under the UN Charter. Transfers of defense articles and services to the former Yugoslavia are still denied. The President should provide military assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina upon request for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The President is authorized to drawdown defense articles and services from the Department of Defense to provide assistance on determined terms and conditions. The President is authorized to provide military assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The value of defense articles, services, and training provided should not exceed $200,000,000. The authorization expires at the end of fiscal year 1994, and US Armed Forces members involved in these activities must not engage in combat duties. The President is authorized to provide military assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The authorization expires at the end of fiscal year 1994, and US Armed Forces members involved in these activities must not engage in combat duties. The President must report to Congress every 60 days on the defense articles, services, and training provided, and reimbursement for these services will be made available without reimbursement to the Department of Defense.
