In covered civil actions where the United States is substituted as a party-defendant, plaintiffs can request third-party discovery related to electronic communications. In covered civil actions, if a plaintiff serves deposition notices or requests for admission on an electronic communications service provider with dismissed claims, the provider is deemed a party-defendant and its responses are binding on the Government.

The Attorney General or a designee not lower than the Deputy Attorney General shall perform the authority and duties under this section.

It applies to all cases except as expressly provided. Effective Date and Application: This section applies to covered civil actions pending or filed after the enactment of this Act."
