    "content": "Since the early 1960s, the US has imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, leading to restrictions on travel. The embargo regulations, specifically the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR), effectively banned travel to Cuba until changes were made by the Carter Administration in 1977. Subsequent administrations, like Reagan's in 1982, imposed restrictions but allowed certain categories of travelers to engage in travel-related transactions. The Clinton Administration also made changes to the Treasury Department regulations regarding travel to Cuba. Under the George W. Bush Administration, there were significant changes to Treasury Department regulations tightening travel restrictions to Cuba, including restrictions on family visits, educational travel, and sports competitions. Categories like fully hosted travel and people-to-people exchanges were eliminated. The Obama Administration later eased restrictions on travel by Cuban Americans. In March 2009, action was taken to ease travel restrictions for Cuban Americans visiting family in Cuba and for marketing agricultural and medical goods. President Obama further lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba in April 2009. In January 2011, more actions were taken to ease travel and remittances to Cuba, including new general licenses for educational and religious activities, people-to-people exchanges, and remittances. Additionally, general licenses were restored for sending remittances to Cuba and religious organizations. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, allowing for general license travel for various categories and the use of U.S. credit and debit cards. This policy shift was part of a broader engagement with Cuba announced in December 2014. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, allowing for general license travel for various categories and the use of U.S. credit and debit cards. Initially, U.S. travelers were allowed to import up to $400 worth of Cuban goods, with limits on alcohol and tobacco products, but these limits were later lifted. Remittance dollar limits were also increased and then removed altogether, with a general license provided for humanitarian projects, support to the Cuban people, and private businesses. Supporters of change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, including some Members of Congress, had been urging President Obama to ease travel restrictions by authorizing general licenses for all categories of permitted travel. The President's actions were part of the Administration's discretionary licensing authority to amend the embargo regulations, which were provided by the regulations themselves. However, lifting all restrictions on travel would have required legislative action due to the codification of the embargo in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. Additionally, a provision in the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 prevents the executive branch from licensing travel for tourist purposes. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 prohibits the executive branch from licensing tourist activities in Cuba. President Trump's policy changes in 2017 rolled back some of the Obama Administration's engagement policy, including eliminating individual people-to-people travel and imposing restrictions on transactions with Cuban military-controlled companies. This limits the executive branch's authority to issue travel licenses beyond specified categories. Amendments, new legislation, or repeal would be needed to expand travel categories or lift restrictions entirely. The State Department issued a list of \"restricted entities\" in November 2017, adding 26 entities in November 2018, totaling 205, including 99 hotels, controlled by the Cuban military. Prohibitions limit U.S. economic engagement with Cuba, affecting travel transactions. A State Department travel warning in September 2017 also contributed to declining U.S. travel to Cuba due to the risk of injury to U.S. travelers. In January 2018, the State Department updated its travel advisory for Cuba, initially recommending reconsidering travel, but later advising increased caution. Family travel restrictions were eased in 2009 under the Obama Administration. The first congressional action easing Cuba sanctions in almost a decade allowed family travel once every 12 months under a general license to visit close relatives. The definition of \"close relative\" was expanded to include individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption within three generations. Another provision required a general license for travel related to marketing and selling agricultural and medical goods to Cuba. The Office of Foreign Assets Control implemented regulations on September 3, 2009, requiring written reports before and after travel to Cuba for those involved in marketing agricultural and medical products. The Obama Administration also lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba in April 2009. In April 2009, the Obama Administration lifted all restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba. Family travelers were allowed unlimited visits with no baggage limits and could spend up to the State Department's maximum per diem rate for Havana. The previous $300 per quarter limit on family remittances was removed, and authorized travelers could carry up to $3,000 in remittances. Regulations for these changes were issued by the Treasury. The Obama Administration announced policy changes in 2011 to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, allowing for easier engagement in educational and religious travel and enabling all Americans to send remittances. These changes were similar to policies in place from 1999 to 2004 and aimed to support the Cuban people in determining their country's future. The Obama Administration announced policy changes in 2011 to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, aiming to increase people-to-people contact and reduce Cuban people's dependence on the state. The changes allowed for increased purposeful travel related to religious, educational, and journalistic activities, expanded remittance options, and facilitated private enterprise in Cuba. The Obama Administration announced policy changes in 2011 to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, aiming to increase people-to-people contact and reduce Cuban people's dependence on the state. The new measures allowed for licensed charter flights to and from Cuba from all U.S. international airports under certain conditions, expanding on previous policies from the Clinton Administration in 1999. In July 2011, OFAC approved licenses for U.S. people-to-people organizations to bring visitors to Cuba, with trips starting in August. An advisory clarified that group travel to Cuba must involve educational exchange activities, not tourist activities, as per the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 prohibits OFAC from licensing transactions for tourist activities. In 2012, concerns were raised about people-to-people travel focusing on tourist activities rather than purposeful travel. Congressional leaders agreed not to include a provision in the appropriations measure. In response to concerns about people-to-people travel focusing on tourist activities, the Treasury Department issued a warning in March 2012 about misleading advertising. OFAC could investigate organizations conducting these trips and revoke licenses, with penalties up to $65,000 per violation. In May 2012, OFAC revised its people-to-people license guidelines to emphasize enhancing contact with the Cuban people and supporting civil society. Assistant Secretary of State Roberta provided congressional testimony on June 7, 2012. In congressional testimony, Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson expressed strong U.S. support for democracy and human rights activists in Cuba, defending the Obama Administration's policies on travel and remittances. She emphasized empowering Cubans to determine their own future by building connections between the Cuban and American people. The Administration's travel, remittance, and people-to-people policies aim to provide alternative sources of information, support self-employment, and strengthen civil society in Cuba. In September 2012, there was a slowdown in the Treasury Department's approval of licenses for people-to-people travel, causing companies to cancel trips and lay off staff. However, by October 2012, companies started receiving license approvals again. In April 2013, Members of Congress criticized Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z for their trip to Cuba, concerned that it was primarily for tourism, which would violate U.S. laws and regulations. The Treasury Department confirmed that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z participated in an authorized people-to-people exchange trip to Cuba organized by a licensed group. This trip did not violate U.S. sanctions, as stated in a report by the Treasury Department's Office of the Inspector General. President Obama later announced a shift in U.S. policy towards Cuba, moving towards engagement and normalization of relations. Changes in U.S. restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba were implemented by the Treasury Department's OFAC in January 2015. The CACR went into effect on January 16, 2015, with changes to travel restrictions, including authorization for general licenses for 12 categories of travel to Cuba. Under the new regulations, travel to Cuba no longer requires a specific license from the Treasury Department. Authorized travelers can use U.S. credit and debit cards, with no per diem limit on expenditures. They can also bring back up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba for personal use. OFAC eased travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing close relatives to visit or accompany authorized travelers for various activities such as educational, journalistic, professional research, religious, and humanitarian projects. The value limits for bringing back goods from Cuba were removed in October 2016. In January 2016, OFAC amended the CACR to authorize travel-related transactions for professional media or artistic productions in Cuba. This included activities related to professional research, religious activities, humanitarian projects, and private foundations. Authorized travelers were also allowed to open bank accounts in Cuba and transportation by vessel between the US and Cuba was authorized. Commerce Department also issued license exceptions for temporary sojourns for cargo and passenger vessels to Cuba. OFAC expanded travel authorizations in Cuba in March 2016, allowing for professional meetings, public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic competitions, and exhibitions. U.S. profits from these activities no longer needed to be donated to NGOs. Humanitarian projects now included disaster preparedness and response. Individual people-to-people educational travel was also permitted. The Treasury Department made changes to allow individual educational travel to Cuba without the need for a sponsoring organization. Travelers can now import Cuban products without a value limit for personal use. Regularly scheduled air flights to Cuba began in August 2016. Changes to Cuba policy under the Obama Administration included easing restrictions on remittances. OFAC increased the limit on remittances to nonfamily members to $2,000 per quarter and allowed travelers to carry up to $10,000 in remittances to Cuba. In September 2015, OFAC removed dollar limits on nonfamily remittances and licensed travelers' remittance amounts. The CACR were amended in January 2015 to authorize remittances to individuals and NGOs in Cuba for humanitarian projects, human rights organizations, peaceful transition to democracy, and private businesses. OFAC also defined terms like \"prohibited officials of the Government of Cuba\" and \"prohibited members of the Cuban Communist Party\" in October 2016 to restrict remittances to these individuals. The CACR were amended in January 2015 to allow remittances to individuals and NGOs in Cuba for various purposes. In October 2016, prohibited government officials were defined, including ministers, vice ministers, members of various government bodies, and media personnel. Members of the Council of Ministers and flag officers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces were added to the list of prohibited officials in October 2016. The Trump Administration unveiled Cuba policy changes in June 2017, rolling back some of the Obama Administration's engagement with Cuba. The changes included new restrictions on travel and remittances, eliminating individual people-to-people travel and requiring educational travel to be sponsored by an organization. The new policy prohibits financial transactions with Cuban military-controlled entities. The State Department updated the restricted list to include 205 entities, including hotels, tourist agencies, marinas, and stores in Old Havana. The amended CACR prohibits financial transactions with Cuban military-controlled entities, including 2 tourist agencies, 5 marinas, and 10 stores in Old Havana. Exceptions include transactions related to air or sea operations supporting permissible travel, sale of agricultural and medical commodities, direct telecommunications for the Cuban people, and authorized remittances. The definition of \"prohibited officials of the Government of Cuba\" has been broadened. The State Department issued a travel warning for U.S. citizens visiting Cuba due to unexplained injuries of U.S. diplomatic personnel. The warning advised against travel to Cuba, citing the risk of injury at hotels frequented by U.S. citizens. In January 2018, the State Department revamped its travel advisory system to include four levels of caution. The State Department eased its travel advisory for Cuba from Level 3 to Level 2 in August 2018, citing increased caution. This change, along with policy adjustments, led to a decrease in American travelers to Cuba. Travel agencies welcomed the updated advisory. The travel advisory for Cuba was eased in August 2018, allowing for 12 categories of authorized travel under a general license. Specific licenses may be issued by OFAC for activities not covered by the general license, with applications reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Travelers must keep records of their transactions when traveling to Cuba under either type of license. Prior to the Obama Administration's policy changes in January 2015, the 12 permissible categories of travel to Cuba were authorized by a mix of general and specific licenses. OFAC no longer maintains publications for guidelines on license applications, but provides guidance on its website along with the travel regulations in the CACR. Additional regulatory changes in 2015 and 2016 further eased travel restrictions. The Trump Administration amended the CACR to restrict direct financial transactions with Cuban entities linked to the military, intelligence, or security services. A list of restricted entities was issued by the State Department in 2017 and updated in 2018. Most categories of permissible travel to Cuba were unaffected by these restrictions. The CACR was amended by the Trump Administration to restrict financial transactions with Cuban entities tied to the military, intelligence, or security services. Most permissible travel to Cuba, except for official government business, journalistic activities, humanitarian projects, and exports transactions, have provisions against direct financial transactions with entities on the State Department's restricted list. Authorized U.S. travel categories to Cuba include family visits, official government business, journalistic activity, professional research, educational activities, religious activities, and humanitarian projects.

Professional media and artistic productions of information or materials for exportation, importation, or transmission in Cuba are allowed for travelers with relevant experience. Export transactions related to market research, marketing, sales, and contract negotiation are permitted. Restrictions on remittances to Cuba are regulated by the CACR. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on remittances to Cuba, allowing for family and nonfamily remittances. In 2015, OFAC increased the amount allowed for nonfamily remittances to $2,000 per quarter and permitted authorized travelers to carry up to $10,000 to Cuba. Additionally, a general license was created for certain remittances for humanitarian projects and support for the Cuban people. In 2015, OFAC increased the amount allowed for nonfamily remittances to $2,000 per quarter and permitted travelers to carry up to $10,000 to Cuba. OFAC also removed the cap on nonfamily remittances and narrowed the definitions of prohibited Cuban government officials. The curr_chunk discusses the individuals prohibited from receiving remittances from the United States, including members of various Cuban government bodies and organizations. The State Department reported $3 billion in remittances to Cuba in 2016. Authorized individuals in the United States can send remittances to close relatives in Cuba without limits on amount or frequency. Recipients cannot be Cuban government officials or members of the Cuban Communist Party. Authorized individuals in the United States can send remittances to close relatives in Cuba without limits on amount or frequency, excluding Cuban government officials or members of the Cuban Communist Party. Remittances are also allowed for religious organizations, U.S. students in Cuba, emigration-related purposes, and certain individuals and independent organizations in Cuba. Authorized individuals in the United States can send remittances to close relatives in Cuba without limits on amount or frequency, excluding Cuban government officials or members of the Cuban Communist Party. Remittances are also allowed for humanitarian projects, recognized human rights organizations, promoting democracy, and supporting private businesses in Cuba. Travelers to Cuba can carry authorized remittances with no specified limit, but emigration-related remittances require a U.S. immigration visa for the recipient. In Congress, there have been debates over U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba. Various legislative initiatives have been introduced to ease or tighten these restrictions, but none have been enacted. In the 115th Congress, six bills have been introduced to lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba. Supporters argue that lifting these restrictions would help influence political and economic conditions in Cuba by allowing more interaction between U.S. citizens and average Cubans, similar to the impact of person-to-person contact in Russia and Eastern Europe. Travel restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba are seen as hindering interaction and information exchanges with ordinary Cubans, which could help weaken the Cuban government's control over news. Supporters of lifting these restrictions argue that they infringe on Americans' right to travel freely and should not be limited by the government. They also point out that Americans can travel to other authoritarian countries like China, Vietnam, and Iran, as well as the former Soviet Union. There is widespread public support for unrestricted travel to Cuba. Supporters of lifting travel restrictions to Cuba argue that it would benefit the U.S. economy by increasing demand for air and cruise travel, expanding U.S. economic output, and boosting U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. Studies by the U.S. International Trade Commission show that lifting restrictions on travel and financing for agricultural exports would significantly increase U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. The ban on U.S. tourist travel to Cuba has limited Cuban demand for U.S.-sourced food products. Easing restrictions on tourist travel to Cuba would boost demand for high-value food products from the United States and other U.S. brands. Arguments for maintaining travel restrictions include existing provisions for legitimate travel supporting the Cuban people, such as for Cuban Americans visiting relatives and other categories like students, journalists, researchers, artists, musicians, and athletes. Advocates of maintaining travel restrictions on Cuba argue that lifting them entirely would support the Cuban government financially through tourist receipts, potentially prolonging the regime. They believe that current restrictions help influence Cuba's policy and have led to economic reforms and military budget cuts. They argue that maintaining restrictions provides leverage for enacting further reforms and improving human rights in Cuba.

They believe that current restrictions help influence Cuba's policy and have led to economic reforms and military budget cuts. Maintaining restrictions provides leverage for enacting further reforms and improving human rights in Cuba. In the 115th Congress, bills have been introduced to lift travel restrictions to Cuba, such as H.R. 351 (Sanford) and S. 1287 (Flake), focusing on freedom to travel without presidential regulation. The 115th Congress introduced several bills to ease restrictions on agricultural and medical exports to Cuba, lift the embargo by removing trade restrictions, and address concerns about Cuba's airport security. These bills aim to promote American exports to Cuba and normalize trade relations between the two countries. The 115th Congress passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, requiring TSA to provide Congress with a briefing on security measures at Cuban airports with service to the US. The Act also mandates public charters to provide updated flight data for tracking operations between the two countries. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 mandates TSA to ensure security measures at Cuban airports with US service and requires public charters to provide updated flight data for tracking operations between the two countries. President Kennedy imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in 1962 due to ties with the Soviet Union, leading to the Cuban Assets Control Regulations in 1963. In 1977, the Carter Administration lifted restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba, allowing direct flights and issuing a general license for travel-related transactions. However, in 1982, the Reagan Administration reimposed restrictions on travel to Cuba, only allowing certain categories of travel such as for government officials, news organizations, researchers, and close relatives. The Supreme Court decision in 1984 upheld these restrictions. In 1993, the Clinton Administration amended U.S. travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing travel for educational, religious, and human rights activities with specific licenses. In 1994, President Clinton tightened restrictions by prohibiting family visits under a general license. In 1995, President Clinton announced measures to ease U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba, allowing general licenses for Cuban Americans visiting close relatives in extreme humanitarian need situations. This reversed the 1994 action that required specific licenses for such visits. In 1995, President Clinton eased U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba, allowing general licenses for Cuban Americans visiting close relatives in extreme humanitarian need. This reversed the 1994 action that required specific licenses. Additionally, specific licenses were allowed for freelance journalists traveling to Cuba. In 1999, President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including expanding direct passenger charter flights from additional U.S. cities other than Miami. The State Department allowed direct flights to Cuba from New York and Los Angeles. OFAC issued changes to the Cuba embargo regulations in May 1999, loosening restrictions on certain categories of travelers. In 1999, President Clinton announced measures to support the Cuban people, including expanding direct passenger charter flights from additional U.S. cities. The State Department allowed direct flights to Cuba from New York and Los Angeles. OFAC loosened restrictions on certain categories of travelers to Cuba, allowing travel for professional research and a wide range of educational, religious, sports competition, and other activities with specific licenses. Congress approved the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, prohibiting travel-related transactions for \"tourist activities.\" In 2001, OFAC published regulations prohibiting travel-related transactions for \"tourist activities\" in response to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. President Bush requested the Treasury Department to enhance OFAC's capabilities to prevent unlicensed and excessive travel. In 2003, OFAC published proposed enforcement guidelines for economic sanctions programs, including specific penalties for embargo violations in the Cuba sanctions program. OFAC announced amendments to Cuba travel regulations in 2003, allowing easier travel for visiting close relatives up to three degrees of relationship. The new regulations increased the amount travelers could carry to $3,000 and tightened restrictions on certain types of educational travel. President Bush's administration implemented stricter restrictions on travel to Cuba in 2003, including increased inspections of travelers and shipments. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security expanded policing of waters between Florida and Cuba to stop pleasure boating traffic. These actions were part of a broader initiative to enforce the trade and travel embargo. The President's directives in 2003 tightened travel restrictions to Cuba, eliminating fully hosted travel and restricting family visits to once every three years for immediate family members. Spending limits for family visitors were reduced, and specific licenses were required for visiting non-Cuban nationals in exigent circumstances. Amateur athletic teams needed a specific license to travel to Cuba for sports competitions. The new regulations in 2004 further restricted travel to Cuba, requiring specific licenses for educational activities and limiting cash remittances to $300 quarterly for immediate family members. Educational exchange programs for secondary schools were eliminated, and institutional licenses were shortened to one year. The regulations in 2004 restricted cash remittances to Cuba to $300 for immediate family members and imposed new limits on gift parcels and baggage for travelers. Gift parcels could no longer contain certain items, and baggage was limited to 44 pounds. In 2004, regulations limited baggage to 44 pounds for travelers to Cuba. In 2005, OFAC changed guidelines for religious travel licenses, allowing up to 25 individuals to travel to Cuba once per quarter. In 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act. In 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, easing restrictions on travel to Cuba by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations for travel to market and sell agricultural and medical goods without special permission from OFAC. Under a new general license, businesses can travel to Cuba to market and sell agricultural and medical goods. They must provide advance notice and a report of their activities. Funds were prohibited from enforcing family travel restrictions imposed in 2004, allowing for unlimited visits to close relatives once a year. President Obama lifted restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba, allowing for unlimited visits to close relatives once a year. The definition of \"close relative\" was expanded to include individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption within three generations. Additionally, measures were announced to expand humanitarian donations and increase telecommunications links with Cuba. In September 2009, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations were amended to implement President Obama's policy changes on family travel, remittances, and telecommunications links with Cuba. The amendments also included new categories of travel under general licenses, such as for marketing agricultural and medical goods. Additionally, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security expanded the value and list of eligible items in gift parcels to Cuba and removed the weight limit for accompanied baggage. In January 2011, President Obama directed changes to regulations and policies to increase purposeful travel to Cuba for religious, educational, and journalistic activities. The changes also allowed for easier remittances to nonfamily members and religious institutions in Cuba, as well as permitted all U.S. international airports to provide services to licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. OFAC issued changes to the CACR to implement these revised policies. In January 2011, President Obama directed changes to regulations and policies to increase purposeful travel to Cuba for religious, educational, and journalistic activities. On July 25, 2011, OFAC issued an advisory reaffirming the requirements for people-to-people travel groups licensed for travel to Cuba. In 2012, OFAC published an announcement regarding advertising for people-to-people travel. OFAC issued guidelines for advertising people-to-people travel, requiring licensed organizations to use their licensed name and not imply off-hour activities. Failure to comply may result in license revocation or a fine of up to $65,000 per violation. In May 2012, OFAC further tightened restrictions on people-to-people travel. In May 2012, OFAC tightened restrictions on people-to-people travel by requiring organizations to describe how the travel would enhance contact with the Cuban people, support civil society, or promote independence from Cuban authorities. Applicants had to certify that activities would not primarily involve prohibited Cuban government or Communist Party officials, and sample itineraries needed to show how meetings with such officials would advance purposeful travel. In 2015, OFAC amended embargo regulations to ease travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing general licenses for all 12 categories of travel, use of U.S. credit and debit cards, increased remittance limits, and a general license for humanitarian projects and support for the Cuban people. In 2016, OFAC further eased travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing travel related to professional media or artistic production, organization of professional meetings, public performances, clinics, workshops, athletics, and more. OFAC eased travel restrictions to Cuba in 2016, allowing for various activities such as professional meetings, public performances, workshops, competitions, and exhibitions. Additionally, restrictions on bringing back Cuban products and definitions of prohibited individuals were amended. In 2017, OFAC amended the CACR to eliminate individual people-to-people educational travel, prohibit certain financial transactions with Cuban military-controlled entities, and broaden the definition of prohibited officials of the Government of Cuba. The State Department also listed 179 restricted Cuban entities benefiting the Cuban military or security services. In 2018, the State Department updated its Cuba restricted list by adding 26 subentities, including 16 hotels, bringing the total number of entities on the list to 205. Legislative initiatives from the 106th to the 114th Congress involved tightening travel restrictions to Cuba. The law restricts travel to Cuba to authorized categories, preventing tourist activities. This strengthens travel restrictions and limits OFAC's authority to issue specific licenses. The Senate and House considered legislation regarding travel to Cuba, with Senator Christopher Dodd introducing amendments to lift travel restrictions. However, these amendments were defeated, and no further action was taken on the bills. An amendment was approved to prohibit funds from being used to enforce Cuban travel regulations. The language of the amendment was later dropped from a new version of the Treasury Department appropriations bill. The Senate initially rejected the conference report but later agreed to it, bypassing Senate debate on the Treasury appropriations bill. The 107th Congress saw various measures introduced to ease travel restrictions to Cuba, with the House voting to prohibit spending on administering travel regulations. An amendment was approved to prohibit funding for enforcing Cuban travel regulations, but the language was later dropped from the Treasury Department appropriations bill. The House voted to prohibit spending on administering travel regulations to Cuba, but the provision was not included in the final House-Senate conference report on the bill due to changed congressional priorities after the September 11 attacks. Senator Byron Dorgan decided not to offer an amendment on the issue to avoid slowing down the bill's passage. The Bush Administration had threatened to veto the Treasury Department appropriations bill. The Cuba travel issue was a point of contention during the second session of the 107th Congress. A bipartisan House Cuba working group aimed to lift travel restrictions, but Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill stated they would recommend a veto if legislation included loosening travel restrictions to Cuba. In July 23, 2002, the House approved the Flake travel amendment (H.Amdt. 552) by a vote of 262-167, which aimed to ease travel restrictions to Cuba by prohibiting funds for enforcing Treasury Department regulations. The amendment would not affect the issuance of travel licenses to Cuba, but some questioned its effectiveness due to unchanged embargo regulations. Violations of embargo regulations could occur in the future if funding limitations on enforcing travel restrictions are not included in the Treasury Department appropriations measure. During consideration of H.R. 5120, the House rejected two Cuba amendments. The Rangel amendment (H.Amdt. 555) aimed to prevent funds in the bill from being used to enforce the economic embargo of Cuba, including travel, but was rejected. The Goss amendment (H.Amdt. 551) proposed limitations on funds for enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba, pending the President's certification on biological weapons and terrorism, but was also rejected. The House passed H.R. 5120 on July 24, 2002, with the Flake Cuba travel amendment. The Senate version of the Treasury Department appropriations measure included a provision similar to the Flake amendment, preventing funds from enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba. In the 107th Congress, various legislative initiatives were introduced to ease U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba, including bills that would have lifted all sanctions on trade, financial transactions, and travel to Cuba. However, no action was taken on these measures. One bill, H.R. 5022, introduced by Flake, aimed to lift all restrictions on travel to Cuba. Additionally, bills like H.R. 174, S. 400, and H.R. 798 sought to promote free trade with Cuba. In the 108th Congress, various bills were introduced to remove restrictions on travel to Cuba by U.S. nationals or lawful permanent resident aliens. These bills aimed to repeal travel restrictions imposed in the previous Congress and promote free trade with Cuba. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to ease Cuba travel restrictions, but provisions were not included in final appropriations measures. The Administration threatened to veto legislation weakening Cuba sanctions. No action was taken on bills specifically lifting or easing travel restrictions to Cuba. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations measure did not include provisions affecting Cuba travel restrictions. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations measure did not include provisions affecting restrictions on travel to Cuba.

The conference on the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act, P.L. 108-199 (H.R. 2673) dropped a provision allowing travel to Cuba under a general license for the sale of agricultural and medical goods. The Senate had approved a provision for such travel in their version of the bill, but the House-passed version did not include it. Travel to Cuba currently requires approval from OFAC for a specific license. Travel to Cuba is allowed with OFAC's approval of a specific license. In early June 2003, the Treasury Department rejected an application for organizers of a U.S. food and agribusiness fair in Havana. Several FY2005 appropriations measures had provisions to ease Cuba sanctions, but these were dropped in the FY2005 omnibus appropriations measure. The House-passed version of the FY2005 Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill included a provision that would have prohibited funds from being used to enforce recent amendments to the Cuba embargo regulations. The House tightened restrictions on gift parcels and baggage for travel to Cuba with a provision added by a Flake amendment. The Senate version of the bill did not include this provision.

Several bills were introduced to lift or ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, but no action was taken on these measures. Amendments easing Cuba sanctions to H.R. 3058 were rejected by the House in June 2005. An amendment on family travel by members of the U.S. military, H.Amdt. 419 (Flake), was ruled out of order for constituting legislation in an appropriations bill. The amendment was prompted by the case of Sergeant Carlos Lazo, a U.S. military member who was prohibited from visiting his sons in Cuba. The Senate rejected a motion to allow travel to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, prompting the ruling out of the amendment. The House rejected H.Amdt. 270 (Flake) to H.R. 2862, which aimed to prevent the use of funds for tightened restrictions on sending gift parcels to Cuba. Another amendment, H.Amdt. 269 (McDermott), prohibiting funds for prosecuting travel to Cuba, was withdrawn. In the Senate, S.Amdt. 281 (Baucus) and S.Amdt. 282 (Craig) were considered to facilitate the sale of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba during FY2006 and FY2007 Foreign Affairs Authorization Act discussions. The House rejected amendments to ease Cuba travel restrictions and prohibit funds for implementing the economic embargo. The amendments aimed to facilitate the sale of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba but were not completed. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a provision in the FY2007 Agriculture appropriations bill to liberalize travel to Cuba for the sale of agricultural and medical goods.

Final action on this measure was not completed by the end of the 109th Congress. In the 109th Congress, various legislative initiatives were introduced to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba.

Funds were prohibited from being used to enforce family travel restrictions imposed by the Bush Administration in 2004. OFAC reinstated a general license for family travel, allowing visits once every 12 months. The Treasury Department allowed travel to Cuba once every 12 months to visit close relatives for an unlimited stay, with daily expenditure limits matching State Department rates. The definition of \"close relative\" was expanded to include individuals related by blood, marriage, or adoption within three generations. This provision was later superseded by the Obama Administration's further liberalization of family travel to Cuba in 2009. The Treasury Department was required to report on steps taken to assess OFAC's allocation of resources for investigating violations of the Cuba embargo. The Treasury Department was directed to provide detailed information on OFAC's Cuba-related licensing and enforcement of the Cuba embargo. In a hearing on U.S. restrictions on travel to Cuba, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs discussed the possibility of lifting the ban on travel to Cuba.

If enacted, family travel would have been limited to once every three years for up to 14 days, requiring a specific license from the Treasury Department. Licensed travelers would only be allowed to carry $300 in remittances, with family remittances limited to $300 per quarter. Nonfamily remittances up to $500 per quarter would not have been allowed, and the general license for remittances to religious organizations would have been eliminated. The White House opposed this provision, stating it would reverse the President's policy on family travel and remittances. The President's senior advisors would recommend a veto if the bill contained a provision that would undo efforts to increase contact between divided Cuban families, undermine economic independence, and support for private sector activity in Cuba. Another amendment required a report on pending applications for educational exchanges not involving academic study. The report would have required information on the number of licenses approved by OFAC for degree programs promoting people-to-people contact. An attempt to include a Cuba provision in a financial services appropriations measure failed in November 2011. In December 2011, a legislative battle occurred over the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012, H.R. 2055, which combined nine appropriations measures. The issue was the potential inclusion of two Cuba provisions from the Financial Services bill, H.R. 2434, regarding family travel restrictions and payment terms for U.S. exports to Cuba. The legislative battle in December 2011 over the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012, H.R. 2055, involved two Cuba provisions from the Financial Services bill, H.R. 2434, regarding family travel restrictions and payment terms for U.S. exports to Cuba. Congressional leaders decided not to include these provisions in H.R. 2055, which was approved by the House and Senate on December 16 and 17, 2011, respectively, and signed into law on December 23, 2011. The White House pressured against including the Cuba provision that would have reversed the easing of travel and remittance restrictions. The FY2012 Foreign Relations Authorization Act included a provision to enforce travel regulations to Cuba as of January 19, 2009, with corresponding penalties for violations. Representative David Rivera's amendment aimed to reinstate tighter travel restrictions from the Bush Administration. Amendments to the Cuban Adjustment Act were also proposed to limit travel to Cuba. H.R. 2771 and H.R. 2831, introduced by Representative Rivera, aimed to amend the Cuban Adjustment Act to restrict travel to Cuba for recent Cuban immigrants in the U.S. The bills proposed increasing the required period of physical presence in the U.S. to five years for adjustment of status to permanent resident, and making individuals ineligible if they returned to Cuba before becoming U.S. citizens. The House Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Immigration on Policy Enforcement held a hearing on H.R. 2831 on May 31, 2012, regarding initiatives to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba.

However, none of these provisions were included in the FY2014 omnibus appropriations measure signed into law in January 2014. The House bill criticized people-to-people travel to Cuba for not promoting the Cuban people's independence from authorities and not requiring meetings with pro-democracy activists or independent members of Cuban civil society. The House bill included a provision for a Treasury Department report on travelers visiting relatives in Cuba, including spending and trip details. The Senate bill proposed a new general license for professional research and meetings in Cuba.

Section 126 of the bill aimed to block funds for people-to-people travel, while Section 127 required a report on travelers visiting relatives in Cuba since FY2007. The House Committee on Appropriations report to H.R. 5016 (H.Rept. 113-508) argued against people-to-people travel to Cuba, citing violations of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.

Additional legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aimed to lift all travel restrictions, but no action was taken on these initiatives. In the 113th Congress, several bills were introduced to lift travel restrictions and the overall embargo on Cuba, but no action was taken.

Some bills focused on prohibiting restrictions on travel to Cuba, while others aimed to slow down easing of travel restrictions or restrict regular scheduled air travel with Cuba. No action was taken on these measures. Additionally, some bills would have required the President to submit a plan for resolving outstanding claims relating to property confiscated by the government of Cuba before easing restrictions on travel or trade with Cuba. Efforts to ease and tighten travel restrictions between the United States and Cuba played out in the FY2016 appropriations process, but ultimately no provisions were included in the FY2016 omnibus appropriations measure.

The FY2016 appropriations process included provisions in various bills regarding travel restrictions to Cuba. The Senate version aimed to lift restrictions on scheduled passenger air transportation, while the House bills had provisions impeding efforts to increase travel to and from Cuba.

The Senate's FY2017 Financial Services appropriations measure, S. 3067 (S.Rept. 114-280), included provisions to lift restrictions on travel to Cuba and prohibit funds from being used to implement laws that restrict travel or technical services for aircraft en route to or from Cuba. Congress approved the full-year FY2017 appropriations measure in May 2017. In May 2017, Congress approved the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31), which did not include contrasting provisions from the House and Senate versions of the Financial Services appropriations measure."
