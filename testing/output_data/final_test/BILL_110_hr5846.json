    "content": "The Act titled \"Wireless Internet Nationwide for Families Act of 2008\" allows for an open access broadband spectrum auction. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include an open access broadband spectrum auction for nationwide licenses in two bands of frequencies. Each band consists of 20 megahertz of unpaired contiguous spectrum, with the initial band between 2155 and 2180 megahertz. The Wireless Internet Nationwide for Families Act of 2008 mandates the FCC to conduct auctions for nationwide licenses in two bands of frequencies, with the second band below 3 gigahertz and not part of the recovered analog spectrum. The initial auction for the first band must begin within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The FCC is required to conduct auctions for nationwide licenses in two frequency bands, with the second band below 3 gigahertz. The second auction for additional spectrum must be completed within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The FCC must ensure licensees are protected from interference and promulgate service and auction rules for nationwide broadband services. The FCC will require licensees to offer wireless broadband services within 2 years of receiving the license, covering at least 95% of the US population within 10 years for frequencies auctioned under paragraph (4). The FCC mandates that licensees must offer free data service faster than 200 kilobits per second one way to consumers and public safety users without charges. The service must include technology protection measures to prevent underage users from accessing inappropriate content. The FCC mandates that licensees must offer free data service faster than 200 kilobits per second one way to consumers and public safety users without charges. This includes providing open access to affiliated and unaffiliated consumer devices through published technical standards for developing subscriber equipment. The service should use advanced wireless technologies to reach the largest number of users and promote broadband competition to make services more available and affordable. The Commission will review the speed of the free data service requirement. The Commission will evaluate whether the speed of free services should be increased based on consumer demand, technological advancements, and public interest. The evaluation will occur 5 years after the licensee starts operations and at license renewal thereafter. Additionally, starting in March 2009, the Commission and NTIA will jointly review competitive market conditions regarding broadband spectrum utilization. The Commission and the Administration will provide Congress with a joint biannual report on the availability, affordability, and utilization of broadband spectrum. The report will include recommendations based on technological advances and efficient use of spectrum bands. The joint biannual report to Congress will include recommendations for the reallocation or reassignment of underutilized spectrum to promote broadband availability and affordability, along with any necessary statutory changes. Statutory changes may be required to implement spectrum reallocation or reassignment within 24 months of the report."
