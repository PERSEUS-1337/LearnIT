    "content": "The first OPM breach in June 2015 exposed personal information such as Social Security numbers, job details, and training data. The second breach affected 19.7 million individuals who applied for background investigations after 2000, including 1.8 million non-applicants. Stolen data included usernames, passwords, and fingerprints. These breaches were not the first targeting OPM databases. The 2015 OPM breaches exposed sensitive information, with the second breach affecting 19.7 million individuals. Determining the actor's motivation in a cyber incident can guide the US response, whether led by law enforcement or utilizing diplomatic or military tools. Admiral Michael Rogers declined to discuss responsibility for the attacks at an intelligence conference in June 2015. Admiral Michael Rogers of U.S. Cyber Command declined to attribute the attacks, while Director of National Intelligence James Clapper identified China as the \"leading suspect.\" China has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the OPM breaches. Top officials from the United States and China met in Washington, DC for the annual U.S.-China Strategic & Economic Dialogue, discussing cyber issues without mentioning progress on these matters. China emphasized the need to stop baseless accusations and work on an international code of conduct for cyberspace to maintain peace and security. In May 2014, the US filed criminal charges against five members of China's PLA for cyber espionage targeting American firms and a labor union. The United States filed criminal charges against known state actors for cyber economic espionage, targeting five U.S. firms and a labor union. The U.S. distinguishes between cyber intrusions for national security and commercial purposes. Discussions with Chinese officials highlighted this distinction during the U.S.-China Strategic & Economic Dialogue in 2013. The OPM breach is categorized as intelligence-gathering, not commercial espionage. Experts suggest the US could exploit China's vulnerabilities in cyber defenses and industrial development. It is unclear how data from the OPM breaches may be used. China may be attempting to build a large database of federal employees through the OPM breaches, potentially aiding in identifying U.S. officials. This data could be used for spear-phishing attacks and other criminal activities like identity theft. Experts are skeptical about compromised information from the OPM breaches appearing for sale in the online black market, leading to speculation that the breaches were conducted for espionage rather than criminal purposes. The stolen fingerprint information raises questions about potential uses, with some speculating on the quality of the fingerprints. The stolen fingerprint data from the OPM breaches could have serious long-term consequences, as they could be used for criminal or counterintelligence purposes. Unlike other identifying information, fingerprints cannot be reissued, making recovery from the breach more challenging. Reports suggest OPM tried to take over the administration of Scattered Castles, the IC's database of sensitive clearance holders, to create a single clearance system for government employees. Reports suggest that OPM attempted to merge Scattered Castles, the IC's database of clearance holders, with their system to create a single clearance system for government employees. Despite concerns about hacking vulnerabilities, some information sharing between systems was reportedly happening by 2014. If the IC's database was linked with OPM's, hackers could potentially access intelligence agency personnel information and exploit personal weaknesses to target U.S. officials and their relatives abroad. This could also help foreign agents infiltrate the U.S. government by revealing clearance criteria and processes. The OPM breaches have raised concerns about potential damage to U.S. interests, similar to Edward Snowden's leaks. Hackers could manipulate data or create fictitious personnel files undetected. There is a risk of data publication, which could compromise clearance holders and make them vulnerable to foreign intelligence exploitation. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was updated to give operational authority to DHS for cybersecurity implementation and breach notification requirements for federal agencies. Congress may need to assess if current laws provide agencies with sufficient authority and resources to address future intrusion risks. The current authorities and requirements under FISMA may not be sufficient to protect federal systems from future intrusions like the recent OPM breaches. Changes may be needed to reduce the level of risk, such as elevating the priority of cybersecurity and aiming for world-class cybersecurity. Barriers to improving federal cybersecurity need to be addressed, and legislative actions may be necessary to remove them. Concerns exist about whether agency heads have enough understanding of cybersecurity to effectively fulfill their responsibilities. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework was designed to address concerns about private-sector CEOs' cybersecurity responsibilities. Questions remain about the sufficiency of recent amendments to CIO authorities and DHS's ability to protect federal systems. The Obama Administration's actions post-OPM breaches, such as the \"cybersecurity sprint,\" are being evaluated for their effectiveness in improving federal agency cybersecurity. Congress is considering legislation to enhance information sharing among agencies. Congress is currently considering legislation to improve information sharing among private-sector entities and federal agencies. One key question is whether the proposed bills provide sufficient protection against inadvertent disclosure by federal agencies in light of recent breaches like those involving OPM."
