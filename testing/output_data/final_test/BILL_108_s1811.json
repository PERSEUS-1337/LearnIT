    "content": "The Act titled \"Expanding Research for Women in Trauma Act of 2003\" is cited as such. It includes findings related to women and trauma research. Congress finds that most studies on violence against women focus on physical abuse or rape, but psychological abuse is often described as the most harmful. Research has mainly focused on young to middle-aged white women, but data shows high victimization rates among incarcerated women, those in poverty, minority ethnic groups, older women, and women with disabilities. Victims of violence are at increased risk for physical and mental health problems. Women who have been raped experience more symptoms of illness and negative health behaviors compared to nonvictimized women. Effective screening methods are crucial for identifying victims of violence to understand the impact of medical care on health outcomes. Research is needed to explore sociocultural factors that contribute to violence against women and how these factors mediate the effects of victimization. Community-based and legal interventions are also important in addressing violence against women. Research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based and legal interventions for victims of interpersonal violence, especially for different subpopulations of women. Current research focuses on the behavior of perpetrators rather than empowering women to take safety-promoting actions. Research on women's attempts to manage and end violence in work and educational contexts is limited compared to research on violence in streets and homes. SEC. 399O. VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESEARCH INITIATIVES added to Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act to focus on research initiatives for preventing violence. The Secretary, in consultation with various health organizations, will provide grants for research on the psychological effects of violence against women and special populations at risk for violence. Increase research on violence against women as a risk factor for mental and physical health problems, develop effective screening methods in healthcare settings, expand research on socioeconomic and sociocultural factors related to violence, and create measurable tools to address violence. Develop measures to evaluate treatment programs for victims and perpetrators of violence, research victimized women's resilience and coping mechanisms, and create standardized questions on violence for national surveys. Maximum grant amount is $500,000. The Secretary may award grants exceeding $500,000 for a duration of up to 5 years. Eligible entities must submit applications describing the activities and providing necessary assurances. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these grants. Authorization of appropriations is provided for grants awarded by the Secretary, with necessary sums authorized to carry out the section."
