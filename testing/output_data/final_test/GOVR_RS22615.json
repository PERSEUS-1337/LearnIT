    "content": "After General Francisco Franco's death in 1975, Spain transitioned from dictatorship to democracy within three years. Economic reforms led to rapid growth, and Spain joined NATO in 1982 and the European Union in 1986. Spanish diplomats and politicians have taken on leadership roles in international bodies. The United States gained naval and air bases in Spain during the Cold War, which fueled anti-American sentiment among the Spanish left. The United States and Spain have maintained good relations post-Franco, with the US having access to Spanish military bases. The Socialist Party has been in power since 2004, winning a second term in 2008 with 169 seats in the Congress of Deputies. In the 2008 election, the PP won 169 seats in the Congress of Deputies, up from 164 in the previous parliament. The Socialists, with 154 seats, are expected to form a government with the support of small leftist and regional nationalist parties. Zapatero's victory in 2004 was influenced by public disenchantment with Aznar's handling of the Madrid bombings. Zapatero's second term is expected to face less conservative opposition and enjoy broader political and public support. He has made controversial decisions such as legalizing gay marriage, liberalizing divorce, and calling for the removal of General Franco's name from streets and towns in Spain. Public debate over the Spanish Civil War has been reignited under his leadership. Zapatero negotiated autonomy with Catalonia, faced criticism for negotiating with ETA, and took a harder line on the Basque issue after ETA ended a cease-fire in 2007. The 2008 election campaign in Spain focused on the economy and immigration, with analysts predicting Zapatero would address the worsening economic climate. Spain's GDP growth is expected to sharply decline due to global financial crises and higher energy prices, dropping from 3.8% in 2007 to 1.9% in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, Spain's GDP growth is expected to decline sharply to 1.9% due to global financial crises and higher energy prices. Zapatero plans to boost productivity through tax cuts, a tax rebate of 400 Euros for wage earners, and increased government investment in infrastructure, education, research, and development. Analysts predict broad political support for his economic policies but foresee an extended economic slowdown. Spain has been a key base for Islamist extremists, with some convicted of assisting in the September 11 attacks. Spanish officials have made progress in breaking up a terrorist cell responsible for the March 11 attack in Madrid. The Al Qaeda-linked Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group carried out the bombings. Seven suspects involved in the attacks blew themselves up when surrounded by police. Twenty-nine other suspects went on trial in 2007, with 21 convicted and seven acquitted. In February 2007, 21 suspects were convicted and seven acquitted for their involvement in the Madrid attack. Some analysts and victims' groups were frustrated with the lenient sentences given to the alleged masterminds. Spanish police are concerned about potential \"sleeper cells\" operating in the country, especially those involved in recruiting Muslims to fight in Iraq. In January 2008, 6 suspects were arrested for plotting an attack on Barcelona's public transport system. Officials are worried about terrorist recruitment efforts in Ceuta and Melilla. Spanish officials are concerned about terrorist recruiting efforts in Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish enclaves on Morocco's coast. Over 300 men have been imprisoned in Spain for offenses related to Islamist terrorism. France, Britain, Italy, and Spain have a list of about 200 suspected Islamist terrorists in Europe, with 20 in Spain. Prime Minister Zapatero's approach to fighting terrorism differs from the United States, emphasizing addressing social and economic roots of terrorism and promoting an \"alliance of civilizations\" between Western and Islamic countries. Integration of the Muslim population in Spain is also a priority for Zapatero. Estimates of the Muslim population in Spain range from 600,000 to 1 million, mainly of Moroccan or Algerian ancestry. Spain has increased resources for fighting Islamist terrorism, focusing on coordination between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, establishing a database of suspects, and adding more officers and Arabic translators. Spain supports anti-terrorist cooperation with EU partners and the United States. Spain has enhanced cooperation with the United States in combating terrorism, setting up a group to improve legal and police collaboration. There were reports of CIA planes making secret stopovers in Spanish airports, raising concerns about alleged detainee abuse. The Spanish government agreed to release documents on secret flights possibly involving illegal detainee transfers. U.S.-Spanish relations worsened under Prime Minister Zapatero, who shifted foreign policy towards EU partners. Zapatero criticized U.S. policy on Iraq after his election. Since his election victory, Zapatero strongly criticized U.S. policy on Iraq, calling it based on \"lies\" and urging Americans to vote President Bush out in 2004. Despite efforts to mend relations, personal ties between Bush and Zapatero remain strained. The U.S. and Spain have strong economic and cultural ties, with Spain's largest export market outside the EU being the U.S. Tensions arose over Spain's withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2004. In response to Spain's withdrawal of troops from Iraq in 2004, President Bush expressed regret and warned against actions that could benefit terrorists. Some U.S. officials criticized the withdrawal process as uncoordinated and unprofessional. Zapatero later offered to train Iraqi soldiers in demining and contribute to a NATO fund for Iraqi security forces. Spain's High Court issued warrants for the arrest of three U.S. soldiers for a 2003 incident in which a Spanish cameraman was killed. The Spanish government challenged warrants for the arrest of three U.S. soldiers involved in a 2003 incident. The warrants were withdrawn and reissued in January 2007. Despite conflicts over Iraq, Spain and the U.S. continue to cooperate in Afghanistan, with Spain contributing troops to ISAF. Spain has suffered losses, including 17 soldiers in a helicopter crash in 2005 and 62 peacekeepers in a plane crash in 2003. Spain has rejected U.S. calls to send troops to southern Afghanistan. Spain has rejected U.S. calls to send troops to southern Afghanistan due to high conflict potential with Taliban insurgents. Instead, Spain offered unmanned aerial reconnaissance aircraft and training for the Afghan army. U.S.-Spain relations have been strained by differences over Venezuela and Cuba. The Zapatero government aims to improve ties with leftist regimes in the region through engagement rather than isolation. Spain has strong cultural ties and investments in Latin America, playing a key role in EU policy towards the region. U.S. officials are concerned about Spain's military sales to other countries. Spain's agreement to sell military transport planes and coast guard vessels to Venezuela was blocked by the US due to concerns about destabilization in the region. The sale was intended for anti-drug trafficking operations, but the US refused to permit the use of its military technology in the equipment. Spain planned to proceed with the sale using technology from other countries, but ultimately cancelled the aircraft deal in October 2006. In November 2006, Spain, France, and Italy proposed a peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict involving a cease-fire, prisoner exchange, and formation of a national unity government. International monitors would oversee the plan. Spain, along with France and Italy, proposed a peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict involving a cease-fire, prisoner exchange, and formation of a national unity government. The plan was met with cool reception from the EU and the United States, who are part of the Quartet aimed at promoting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Spain also plays a significant role in UNIFIL, contributing 1,100 troops to the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon."
