    "content": "The \"Safe Treatment of Polluted Stormwater Runoff Act\" or the \"STOPS Runoff Act\" establishes the Federal-Aid Highway Runoff Pollution Management Program under Chapter 3 of title 23, United States Code. The \"STOPS Runoff Act\" defines control measures as methods to manage highway runoff pollution and covered projects as those increasing impervious surface on Federal-aid highways. The \"STOPS Runoff Act\" defines highway runoff pollution as discharges of sediment, metals, chemicals, nitrogen, phosphorous, or oil and grease in runoff, and exceeding predevelopment peak flow rate, water temperature, or runoff volume. Predevelopment hydrology requires managing precipitation from rainfall events up to the 95th percentile on-site through stormwater management. The \"STOPS Runoff Act\" requires on-site stormwater management practices to prevent off-site discharge or preserve natural runoff conditions through construction. Watershed-based environmental management approach involves managing stormwater runoff volume, rate, and temperature following construction. The \"STOPS Runoff Act\" requires on-site stormwater management practices to prevent off-site discharge or preserve natural runoff conditions through construction. The watershed-based environmental management approach prioritizes solutions that prevent or minimize environmental impact within the broader context of watershed goals, giving priority to protecting drinking water supplies and restoring impaired waterways. The Water Pollution Control Act establishes a Federal-aid highway runoff pollution avoidance program to protect water quality. The Secretary can approve State projects under certain conditions. The Secretary requires assurances from the State to site, design, and construct the project according to specific design standards. The post-construction condition should aim to maintain or restore predevelopment hydrology, especially in impaired watersheds listed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The covered project must meet specific design standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency or the State. Additionally, it must prioritize reducing highway runoff pollution by avoiding alterations to natural features and maximizing pollution control measures that utilize existing terrain and vegetation. The covered project must prioritize reducing pollution by maximizing control measures that promote evapotranspiration, infiltration, reuse, and retention. Additionally, a watershed-based environmental management approach should be used to avoid adverse water quality effects from the project. The covered project must prioritize reducing pollution through capture and treatment of highway runoff pollution on-site or discharge to an off-site control measure under state control. If on-site measures are not feasible, off-site control measures must provide equivalent management of runoff pollution. The covered project must prioritize reducing pollution through on-site or off-site control measures. Off-site control measures should address impacts on impaired waterways listed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Secretary, in consultation with the EPA Administrator, must provide guidance within 180 days to help States comply with the section on managing highway runoff pollution from covered projects. The guidance provided by the Secretary and EPA Administrator within 180 days helps States manage highway runoff pollution from covered projects by integrating planning, design, and maintenance of control measures, implementing a watershed-based environmental management approach, using off-site pollution mitigation programs, and ensuring State inspection and reporting for compliance. The Secretary and EPA Administrator update guidance every 5 years for State compliance with highway runoff pollution reduction requirements. Reporting on achieved pollution reductions for covered projects is required annually by the Secretary. The State is not required to submit an annual report if operating Federal-aid highways in a post-construction condition according to a permit issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Reporting requirements are in place under such permits. The Act and its amendments apply to covered projects defined in section 330(a)(2) of title 23, United States Code, with construction starting a year after enactment. The State is exempt from annual reporting if operating Federal-aid highways under a permit issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Reporting obligations exist under such permits.
