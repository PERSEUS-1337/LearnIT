    "content": "The House Judiciary Committee reported the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009, expanding the U.S. House of Representatives by two members. The first new seat would represent D.C., and the second would create a temporary at-large district in Utah. The Senate passed a related bill, but no further action was taken by the House. The Senate considered legislation to expand the U.S. House of Representatives by two members, but a cloture motion failed. The report discusses the constitutionality of creating an at-large congressional district. The U.S. Constitution gives states primary authority over congressional elections, with Congress having final authority over most aspects. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress extensive power to regulate congressional elections, including the authority to protect their integrity. House elections are typically decided by popular voting, with Congress having the ability to make or alter regulations. States are responsible for determining the times, places, and manner of elections, but Congress can intervene if necessary. Originally, states divided their territory into districts to elect House members. Congress established standards for House districts in 1842 to prevent gerrymandering, ensuring that each district elects only one Representative. Additional requirements were added in the Apportionment Act of 1872. The Apportionment Act of 1872 added the requirement for districts to have an equal number of inhabitants. The Act of 1901 further mandated districts to be compact and contiguous. These standards were reiterated in the 1911 Apportionment Act until 1929 when the Permanent Apportionment Act removed districting standards. In 1941, Congress enacted a law allowing for at-large representation if states failed to redistrict after a census. In 1967, Congress reinstated the requirement for Representatives to run from single-member districts, codified at 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2a and 2c. The Supreme Court in Branch v. Smith discussed the tension between the 1941 and 1967 laws regarding at-large representation. Congress has broad authority, within constitutional limits, to establish how members' districts are created. The creation of at-large congressional districts may violate the \"one person, one vote\" standard established by the Supreme Court in Wesberry v. Sanders. Wesberry established that each person's vote in a congressional election should be worth as much as another's. Congress has the authority to establish how members' districts are created. The creation of at-large congressional districts under H.R. 157 may not conflict with the \"one person, one vote\" standard. Each Utah voter would have equal value in voting for both district and at-large candidates, aligning with the principle of equal voting worth established by the Supreme Court. Based on relevant Supreme Court precedent, a federal law establishing a temporary at-large congressional district would likely be upheld as constitutional."
