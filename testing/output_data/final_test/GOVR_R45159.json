    "content": "Class action lawsuits are a significant topic in debates over the American private law system. The Supreme Court views class actions as a groundbreaking innovation, while some see them as a tool for leveling the playing field for workers and consumers. However, others believe class actions are used to harm businesses and the economy. This report provides an overview of class action law and addresses key areas of congressional debate on the topic. The report discusses the public policy debate over class actions, requirements for class action certification under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, balancing benefits and drawbacks of class actions by courts, and recent congressional debates on class action litigation focusing on class cohesiveness, ascertainability, and incentives. The report examines the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017 (H.R. 985) and its potential impact on class actions. Class actions allow a large group to challenge unlawful conduct in a single lawsuit, deviating from the usual litigation process. The report considers how H.R. 985 and other avenues for change could modify existing law regarding class actions. Class actions have a long history in English law and federal litigation in the US. In a class action, a plaintiff can sue on behalf of a group with similar legal issues, such as a defective product case involving multiple consumers. This eliminates the need for individual plaintiffs. A class action lawsuit allows a plaintiff to sue on behalf of a group with similar legal issues, such as a defective product case involving multiple consumers. The class representative acts on behalf of all others who purchased the product, eliminating the need for other plaintiffs to join the lawsuit. In a class action, the class members are not formal parties to the lawsuit and do not directly guide the litigation. The class action device serves several purposes recognized by the Supreme Court. The class action device serves to advance the efficiency and economy of litigation by consolidating multiple suits into a single proceeding, avoiding unnecessary duplication of legal processes. It allows large numbers of individuals affected by unlawful conduct to seek relief collectively, rather than individually. Class actions allow individuals to seek relief collectively when their individual claims are too small to justify separate suits. This aggregation of claims into a single proceeding helps overcome the financial disincentive for plaintiffs to pursue small recoveries individually. For example, if a defendant injures a million consumers for $30 each, the costs of individual lawsuits would outweigh potential recoveries, making class actions a more viable option. Class actions allow individuals to seek relief collectively when their individual claims are too small to justify separate suits. If an individual plaintiff could bring a single class action lawsuit on behalf of everyone wronged by the defendant, the potential $30 million recovery could make it economically rational for attorneys to pursue the claims. This way, class actions compensate victims who might otherwise go uncompensated and punish wrongdoers. Class actions compensate victims and punish wrongdoers. A court's decision to not allow a lawsuit to proceed as a class action can end the litigation for plaintiffs. The Supreme Court has stated that class actions protect defendants from repeated suits and inconsistent judgments, providing finality and allowing them to focus on their business. Class actions serve useful purposes by compensating victims and punishing wrongdoers, but they also pose risks for the U.S. civil justice system. The sheer number of class members in a lawsuit can lead to potentially ruinous liability for defendants, forcing them to settle even weak claims to avoid financial strain. Without effective legal safeguards, class actions may incentivize plaintiffs to file lawsuits with minimal chances of success to extract settlements from defendants. Class actions can sometimes be meritless or abusive, with plaintiffs bringing lawsuits that are fanciful or humorous. For example, a California resident sued Cap'n Crunch for deceptive advertising regarding \"Crunchberries.\" The court dismissed the case, stating it would require ignoring personal responsibility and common sense. Class actions, while economizing litigation, still place a significant burden of costs and expenses. Class action litigation imposes a significant financial burden due to complex issues and lengthy proceedings. Concerns arise over named plaintiffs representing absent class members, who are bound by the judgment even if they did not actively participate. Class actions delegate class members' right to a day in court to the named plaintiff, who may not always fairly represent the absent class members. Class members have little control over the class representative or class counsel, and their financial interest in the outcome of the litigation is typically small. In class actions, there is a concern that plaintiffs' attorneys may prioritize their own financial interests over those of the class members. Class counsel often have little accountability to the class members they represent, leading to a conflict of interest where counsel's focus is on their fees rather than the outcome for the class. Class actions may incentivize class counsel to prioritize their own financial interests over those of the class members. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 governs class actions in federal court, requiring certification of the proposed class action and meeting specific criteria. The membership of the proposed class must be \"ascertainable.\" A court's decision to grant or deny class certification is crucial in a class action case, as it can impact the outcome significantly. Denying certification may end the litigation for plaintiffs, while granting it could force a defendant to settle to avoid costly defense. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of federal courts conducting a thorough evaluation before granting or denying certification. The Supreme Court emphasizes the need for a rigorous analysis to confirm Rule 23 prerequisites before certifying a class. Merits questions should only be considered if relevant to class certification. The court must analyze class certification early on, with some leeway in timing. Certification should generally be resolved before addressing the merits of the plaintiff's claims. Prior to ruling on case-dispositive motions, courts can certify proposed classes. The party seeking certification must demonstrate compliance with Rule 23 requirements with evidence. If the class meets the requirements, the court issues a certification order appointing class counsel. Subclasses with separate representation may be certified if interests diverge within the proposed class. The court should certify a class action if interests within the proposed class might diverge, and then direct notice to class members as required by Rule 23. The requirements for class certification include numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequate representation. The proposed class must satisfy all four mandatory requirements established by Rule 23(a) to ensure appropriate representation by named plaintiffs. The numerosity requirement for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 is essential due to the impracticability of joining all injured parties as named plaintiffs in a lawsuit. While there is no specific numerical minimum, having more than 40 class members generally satisfies numerosity, while classes with 20 members or fewer may not meet this requirement. Classes with 21 to 40 members receive varying treatment. The numerosity requirement for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 is crucial as it determines whether a class action lawsuit can proceed. Courts consider various factors beyond just the number of class members, such as geographic dispersion, financial resources, burden on the judiciary, and ease of identifying class members. The plaintiff must also demonstrate common questions of law or fact among the class members to meet the \"commonality\" requirement. In the 2010 decision in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of commonality in class action lawsuits. The plaintiff must establish that the claims depend on a common contention central to the validity of each claim. Wal-Mart's case involved a proposed class of 1.5 million female employees alleging sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiffs in the Wal-Mart case alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion, presenting statistical evidence of favoritism towards men by local supervisors. The Court questioned whether the proposed class met the commonality requirement, as the discrimination faced by each member varied. The Court found that common questions raised by the plaintiffs were not sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement for a class action lawsuit. The Court in the Wal-Mart case found that to satisfy the commonality requirement for a class action lawsuit, plaintiffs must demonstrate that class members have suffered the same injury with claims capable of classwide resolution. The plaintiffs failed to meet this requirement due to the varied nature of discrimination faced by each member. In the Wal-Mart case, plaintiffs failed to show a general corporate policy of discrimination, leading to the commonality requirement not being met. Lower courts have affirmed that commonality is not required to have perfect identity of legal or factual issues among all class members. Even a single common issue can suffice if all class members have suffered the same injurious conduct. The district court erred in finding no commonality in a consumer class action involving Keurig-style coffee pods. Plaintiffs argued that the defendant's packaging was deceptive, seeking to certify a class for all consumers in multiple states. The Seventh Circuit overturned the district court's denial of class certification, stating that differences within the proposed class did not prevent certification. The Seventh Circuit overturned the district court's denial of class certification, stating that differences within the proposed class did not preclude certification. The commonality requirement was satisfied by the question of whether the packaging was materially misleading to a reasonable person, essential for all class members' state law fraud claims. It was irrelevant if some class members were uninjured due to not relying on the deceptive packaging. The determination of valid claims would occur after class certification. The commonality requirement for class certification is rigorous, but cases like Suchanek show it is not an insurmountable barrier. The proposed class representative must also meet the \"typicality\" requirement, ensuring their claims align with those of the class members they represent. This requirement ensures that the interests of the class and the representative are aligned for the benefit of the entire class. The typicality requirement for class certification ensures that the claims of the proposed class representative are reasonably similar to those of absent class members, even if there are factual differences. Courts also consider if the representative's claim arises from the same event or conduct as other class members. This requirement often overlaps with the commonality requirement, which examines if the same conduct by the defendant gives rise to similar claims from all class members. The \"adequate representation\" requirement ensures that representative parties protect the interests of the class. It consists of two parts: evaluating the named plaintiffs' representation of the class members' interests and assessing the proposed class counsel's adequacy. This inquiry aims to uncover conflicts of interest and ensure vigorous prosecution of the class action. Courts consider whether the class representative has adequate incentive to pursue the class's claim and if there are conflicts of interest that could undermine that incentive. A conflict between the class representative and absent class members will only defeat class certification if it is fundamental to the suit. The Supreme Court's opinion in Amchem Products v. Windsor illustrates this concept with a case involving a settlement-only class related to asbestos exposure. The Supreme Court's opinion in Amchem Products v. Windsor involved a proposed class action related to asbestos exposure. The class included both currently injured individuals and those who might be injured in the future, leading to a conflict of interest within the class. This conflict prevented the class from satisfying the adequacy requirement for certification. The Court in Amchem Products v. Windsor found that conflicts of interest between currently injured plaintiffs seeking immediate payments and future claimants seeking a fund for the future required structural assurances of fairness, such as separate subclasses with separate representation. Lower courts have since certified separate subclasses with their own counsel and class representative to avoid similar conflicts. Not all conflicts threaten class certification on adequacy grounds, with courts generally agreeing that incentive awards for class representatives do not create impermissible conflicts with class members. In assessing the adequacy of a class representative, courts consider conflicts between class members and their representatives, as well as the representative's knowledge and understanding of the litigation. Incentive awards for class representatives do not typically create conflicts with absent class members, as they do not diminish the representative's motivation to vigorously pursue the case on behalf of the class. Some courts also look at the representative's level of knowledge and understanding to ensure they can effectively control the litigation. Attacks on a representative's adequacy based on ignorance are generally disfavored, especially in complex cases. The court evaluates the competency and conflicts of class counsel to ensure they are qualified, experienced, and able to represent the class. Factors considered include counsel's work in identifying potential claims, experience in handling class actions, knowledge of applicable law, and resources committed to the case. Conflicts between class representatives and counsel are also scrutinized. In evaluating class counsel, the court also examines conflicts that class representatives may have with counsel. Conflicts of interest, such as familial or business relationships, can lead to inadequate representation and impact class certification. The court examines conflicts that class representatives may have with counsel, which can impact class certification. In Levitt v. Southwest Airlines Co., the Seventh Circuit upheld a class despite a conflict with one of the class representatives who was co-counsel with lead class counsel in another case. The court affirmed the class certification order due to a successful settlement for the class. Different types of class actions have specific requirements under Rule 23(b)(1)-(3). If a proposed class action does not meet these requirements, the court must deny class certification. The court must deny class certification if the proposed class action does not meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1)-(3). Rule 23(b)(1) allows for a class action if separate actions would create risks of inconsistent adjudications or dispositive outcomes for other class members. Class members cannot opt out of a Rule 23(b)(1) class. Rule 23(b)(1) class actions do not allow class members to opt out and may involve incompatible standards of conduct leading to inconsistent outcomes. These cases typically involve limited funds that may not cover all plaintiffs' claims. Rule 23(b)(1)(B) ensures equitable distribution of limited funds in class actions to prevent some claimants from obtaining full recovery at the expense of others. It aims to protect plaintiffs from each other and allows for class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) when the opposing party's actions affect the entire class. Rule 23(b)(2) allows for class certification when the primary goal is not monetary relief but to benefit the whole class with a single injunction or declaratory judgment. The relief sought must be indivisible, benefiting all members at once, and not individualized. Rule 23(b)(2) class certification does not typically allow for individual monetary damages, as the focus is on injunctive or declaratory relief that benefits the entire class. Class members are usually unable to opt out, as the class is assumed to have minimal conflicting interests. A certified Rule 23(b)(2) class will be bound by a single judgment, unlike Rule 23(b)(3) class actions which allow for damages and individual opt-outs. Rule 23(b)(3) allows for damages to secure judgments binding all class members except those who opt out. It applies to classes seeking monetary relief and requires meeting prerequisites of predominance and superiority. The predominance inquiry tests class cohesion for representation. The predominance requirement under Rule 23(b)(3) tests class cohesion for representation in proposed class actions. Courts have not provided a clear methodology for determining if a proposed class satisfies this requirement, which focuses on balancing individual and common questions raised by the class action. Individual questions require varying evidence from members, while common questions can be addressed with the same evidence for each member. The Supreme Court has provided guidelines on predominance in class actions, with a key case being Amchem. The Court rejected a class that included all persons exposed to asbestos, emphasizing the need for cohesive representation and the importance of common issues over individual ones. The Supreme Court case Amchem emphasized the importance of common issues over individual ones in class actions, stating that divergent questions on facts or law within the class can defeat predominance. This includes differences in exposure to asbestos products, physical injuries, smoking history, and state laws among class members. Lower courts have ruled that a proposed class action may violate predominance if each member's claim is governed by different substantive laws, especially when members reside in different states suing the defendant. The Supreme Court case Amchem highlighted the importance of common issues in class actions, stating that divergent questions on facts or law within the class can defeat predominance. Differences in state laws among class members may overwhelm the ability of the trier of fact to advance the litigation through classwide proof. However, lower courts have not automatically concluded that differences in circumstances or damages within the class result in a failure to meet the predominance requirement. For example, the Seventh Circuit suggested that predominance could be satisfied in a case involving consumers in eight different states who had purchased instant-coffee pods. The court in a case involving consumers in eight different states who purchased instant-coffee pods found that individualized issues of reliance and causation could be resolved in follow-on proceedings, allowing for class certification based on the material misleading advertising. Individual damages inquiries do not necessarily preclude class certification as they can be efficiently resolved with formulaic calculations and court tools. In most jurisdictions, individual damages calculations can be efficiently resolved with formulaic tools, allowing for class certification without the need to show identical damages for each member. Some federal appellate courts permit isolating common issues for class treatment, but the Fifth Circuit disagrees, stating that Rule 23(c)(4) cannot be used to avoid the application of predominance to the entire claim. The Fifth Circuit views Rule 23(c)(4) as a \"housekeeping rule\" to certify specific issues without applying predominance to the entire claim. The Third Circuit uses a multifactor test to determine issue class certification. To certify an opt-out class under Rule 23(b)(3), the plaintiff must show that a class action is superior for adjudicating the controversy. This analysis focuses on the advantages of a class action over other litigation methods, with four factors outlined in the Rule for courts to consider. The Rule sets out four factors for courts to consider when determining if a class action is superior: class members' interests, extent of litigation, forum desirability, and manageability. Manageability is the most critical concern, and courts must assess practical problems to decide if a class action is appropriate. The Rule outlines factors for courts to consider in determining if a class action is superior, including manageability. Courts must assess practical problems like notifying class members, calculating damages, and distributing damages to decide if a class action is appropriate. The superiority inquiry focuses on whether a class action presents more management problems than alternatives available to class members. The existence of manageability issues alone cannot defeat class certification, as most class actions pose manageability concerns due to their scope and complexity. The superiority of a class action also depends on the availability of a realistic alternative to class litigation. The superiority requirement for class actions considers factors like manageability, cost, and potential recovery for individual class members. Class actions are favored when individual claims would not be pursued due to high costs, but individual suits may be preferable when damages are significant and class members can afford representation. Class members are bound by the judgment in a class action. Class members in a certified class action can opt out to protect their rights and pursue individual lawsuits. Courts require ascertainability of the proposed class membership for class action certification. Courts have concluded that Rule 23 implicitly requires the named plaintiff to prove that members of the proposed class are \"ascertainable\" by being \"readily identifiable\" to avoid disputes over class membership and enforce final judgments. Disagreements exist on what a plaintiff must prove to satisfy this requirement, with some courts requiring an \"administratively feasible mechanism\" while others do not. The Third and Eleventh Circuits require class actions to be defined with objective criteria and have an administratively feasible mechanism for determining class membership. Subjective considerations are not allowed, and individualized fact-finding is not permitted for proving class membership. The Third and Eleventh Circuits require class actions to be defined with objective criteria and have an administratively feasible mechanism for determining class membership. Plaintiff's evidence of identifying purchasers is crucial for satisfying the administrative feasibility requirement, as seen in other circuits like the Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth. The class must be defined clearly based on objective criteria. Classes defined by subjective criteria, like a person's state of mind, do not meet the objectivity requirement. If all requirements are met, the court may certify the action as a class action, appoint class counsel, and define the class claims, issues, or defenses. Once certified under Rule 23, all class members are included, except for members of a Rule 23(b)(3) class who opt out. Rule 23 states that all class members are bound by the court's rulings, with certification being provisional until final resolution. District courts can monitor and modify class certification, and interlocutory orders are generally not appealable. However, appellate courts have discretion to allow appeals on class certification decisions. Appellate courts consider various legal standards when deciding on interlocutory appeals of class certification orders. The courts may divide a class into subclasses to address conflicts of interest among class members. District courts have discretion in making these decisions. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 allows courts to divide a class action into subclasses and permit the action to proceed with respect to particular issues. For cases requiring individual determinations of causation and damages, the court may bifurcate the case into liability and damages phases. Once certified, the class action can proceed to discovery, pretrial, and trial, with class members bound by the judgment on certified issues. This process can present opportunities for abuse and challenges for courts. The class action process allows courts to manage cases efficiently, with the authority to issue orders that streamline proceedings and prevent unnecessary complications. While most class actions end in settlements rather than trials, these settlements can bind absent class members who do not opt out. Settlement agreements may release claims that were not presented, limiting class members from pursuing additional claims. The settlement agreement in a class action can prevent class members from pursuing claims not in the complaint if they are based on the same factual basis. The court must approve any settlement of a certified class action, ensuring it is fair, reasonable, and adequate for absent class members. Settlement proponents bear the burden of proving the agreement's fairness. When evaluating a proposed class action settlement, the court considers factors like class members' preferences, litigation complexity, likelihood of success at trial, and stage of litigation. The court also assesses the reasonableness of attorneys' fees claimed and whether the settlement is reasonable in light of those fees. The court must evaluate whether the proposed settlement will benefit the class in a meaningful way by securing an adequate advantage for class members in return for giving up their litigation rights against the defendants. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and federal courts have attempted to balance the interests in class actions. Congress may choose to leave the existing class action framework unchanged or modify the laws governing class actions. Congress has the option to leave the class action framework unchanged or modify it to be more or less favorable to different parties. Recent proposals have focused on cohesiveness of the class, administrative feasibility, and incentives for class counsel. Various bills have been introduced to change the system, including H.R. 985 passed by the House of Representatives on March 9, 2017. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017 (FICALA), on March 9, 2017. FICALA proposes significant changes to class action procedures in federal courts, focusing on cohesiveness and addressing issues of commonality in class claims. In the context of proposed changes to class action procedures in federal courts, concerns have been raised about the lack of consistency in lower courts regarding cohesiveness in class claims. There are splits among federal courts on various questions, such as the importance of individualized damages and the use of issue class. Some argue that courts have expanded class action certification beyond permissible bounds. FICALA proposes changes to class action procedures in federal courts, aiming to restrict certification for monetary relief unless all class members suffered the same injury. This addresses concerns about courts broadening class action certification beyond permissible limits. FICALA proposes changes to class action procedures in federal courts, aiming to restrict certification for monetary relief unless all class members suffered the same injury. The committee report emphasizes the importance of grouping \"similarly injured people\" in a single class action to prevent uninjured class members from receiving money that should go to those with actual injuries. The Committee Report emphasizes the need to group similarly injured people in class actions to ensure those with actual injuries receive the most compensation. Proposed Section 1720 aims to codify the approach to issue classes, requiring courts to evaluate predominance for the cause of action as a whole. Critics argue that these provisions in FICALA may not protect absent class members effectively. Critics argue that the provisions in FICALA, particularly proposed Section 1716 and 1720, may lead to fewer individuals obtaining relief through class litigation. They point out that the undefined term \"scope of injury\" and the requirement for a decision on the merits before trial could result in uninjured or differently injured class members being included. This structure could also threaten civil rights class actions. The provisions in FICALA, like Section 1716 and 1720, could hinder civil rights class actions by focusing on individualized questions, as seen in cases like Wal-mart v. Dukes. Courts may need to balance broader cohesiveness to provide resolutions for injured class members, as shown in Nassau County Strip Search Cases where class treatment was approved for an unconstitutional strip search policy. This approval sidestepped individualized questions about appropriate searches for some class members. Supporters of relaxation of cohesiveness argue that cases like Nassau County demonstrate the need to allow noncohesive classes to proceed, as individual rights may be threatened if absent class members are not adequately represented. On the other hand, critics argue that resolving the rights of absent class members without cohesion undermines constitutional values. Critics argue that in class actions with noncohesive classes, absent members may lose individual autonomy rights and control over their cases, leading to courts acting more like legislatures or administrative agencies. This undermines the separation of powers, as courts should focus on resolving specific claims rather than disciplining corporations or rewarding class counsel. FICALA proposes adding a new provision to Title 28 of the U.S. Code, requiring federal courts to determine a reliable method for identifying class members and distributing monetary relief before certifying a class action. This aligns with the approach taken by the Third and Eleventh Circuits. The Committee Report cites Judge Kayatta's dissenting opinion in the First Circuit to support this provision. District courts should identify a method to ensure that the class includes only injured members. Dissenters argue against the ascertainability requirement, stating it could allow defendants to escape liability in small claim consumer class actions. The debate on ascertainability in federal courts continues, with defendants using it to defeat class certification. This issue is considered contentious in class action litigation. Supporters of a rigorous ascertainability requirement argue that it serves important policy objectives by facilitating notice to class members and ensuring clear identification of those bound by the final judgment. Critics, on the other hand, believe that such a requirement could hinder small-claim consumer class actions, especially those involving low-priced items where consumers may lack proof of purchases. Critics argue that the existing class action framework may not adequately protect class members, as standards for counsel conflicts and settlement fairness are court-made and potentially insufficient. FICALA proposes adding provisions to the U.S. Code to address these concerns. Proposed provisions in FICALA aim to address concerns about conflicts of interest in class actions. It would prohibit class representatives with certain relationships with class counsel and limit fees until distribution to class members is completed. This would bring minor changes to existing laws. Proposed provisions in FICALA would require additional disclosure of conflicts to the court and codify the requirement that class counsel should not have certain conflicts of interest. It also proposes significant limitations on the fees that class counsel can obtain, which would be a major change from current practices. Proposed Section 1718 of FICALA would limit class counsel fees to the recovered portion of funds received, excluding any unclaimed portion, and prevent fee collection until monetary recovery is completed. This change could pose challenges in cases with complex fee administration or in class actions with potential beneficiaries. The FICALA provision proposed would restrict class counsel fees to the recovered funds, delaying fee collection until monetary recovery is finalized. This could be problematic in cases with complex fee administration or uncertain beneficiaries, like the NFL concussion settlement. The problem addressed by provisions in class action cases is the mismatch between incentives of class counsel and representatives, leading to a focus on quick settlements benefiting counsel and defendants, rather than absent class members. Unlike traditional lawsuits, absent class members have minimal individual stakes and are unable to hold class counsel accountable. Sponsors of FICALA argue that consumer class members rarely accept compensation, leading to large fee awards for class counsel. Critics claim that courts already address this incentive mismatch by scrutinizing settlements for fairness to class members. Courts aim to ensure fair class action settlements that benefit class members, not just enrich class counsel. Settlements must provide meaningful relief to the class in exchange for giving up litigation rights. Some argue that courts are too lenient in approving settlements that primarily benefit attorneys. The balance of fairness in class action settlements remains a topic of debate, but courts are vigilant in scrutinizing settlements for fairness."
