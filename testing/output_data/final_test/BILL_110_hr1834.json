This program aims to improve public understanding of ocean resources, facilitate data coordination, and promote the development of technologies for ocean research and exploration. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to conduct interdisciplinary voyages and scientific activities to explore little known areas of the marine environment, prioritize deep ocean regions for important scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized to conduct interdisciplinary voyages and scientific activities to explore little known areas of the marine environment, prioritize deep ocean regions for important scientific discoveries, document historic shipwrecks, and enhance the technical capability of the United States marine science community. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducts interdisciplinary voyages and scientific activities to explore marine environments, prioritize deep ocean regions for discoveries, document shipwrecks, and enhance technical capabilities. The Administrator may accept donations of property, data, and equipment for ocean exploration and knowledge enhancement. The Administrator will appoint an Ocean Exploration Advisory Board of experts to advise on survey priorities, develop a strategic plan, review proposal processes, and provide assistance as needed. The Board is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The National Undersea Research Program Act of 2007 authorizes appropriations to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for fiscal years 2008 to 2014. The Act does not supersede the Secretary of the Interior's authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The National Undersea Research Program Act of 2007 authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct undersea research, exploration, education, and technology development. A Director of the program will be designated for this purpose. The National Undersea Research Program Act of 2007 authorizes the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct undersea research, exploration, education, and technology development. The purpose of the program is to increase scientific knowledge for the management and preservation of oceanic resources. The Director will cooperate with educational institutions and organizations, provide research facilities and technologies, and may partner with the private sector for technological advancement in the marine industry. The program authorized under section 202 for undersea research will be overseen by a national headquarters, a network of regional undersea research centers, and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. The program director, along with a Council of Center Directors, will develop the program direction to be published for public comment and finalized within 90 days. The program director will update the program direction every five years after the close of the comment period, allowing for public input. SEC. 205. REGIONAL CENTERS AND INSTITUTE. The network of extramural regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology conduct research, exploration, education, and technology programs focused on undersea research priorities, advanced technology development, ocean observatories, education, and public awareness of the oceans and Great Lakes. The extramural regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology focus on research, development, and partnerships with academia and private industry for ocean and aquatic natural products. SEC. 206. COMPETITION. The program allocates up to 10% of its budget to a discretionary fund for administration and priority research projects. Regional centers are selected through a competitive process every five years based on relevance and feasibility. SEC. 207. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: \n- $17.5 million for 2008\n- $19.5 million for 2009\n- $21.5 million for 2010\n- $23.5 million for 2011\n- $25.5 million for 2012\n- $27.5 million for 2013\n- $29.5 million for 2014\n\nInteragency planning and coordination for ocean exploration and undersea research technology and infrastructure task force. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will convene an ocean exploration and undersea research technology task force with various organizations to develop a strategy for technology transfer, improve communication infrastructure, and establish a data management system. The ocean exploration and undersea research technology task force aims to develop a data management system, conduct public outreach activities, and encourage cost-sharing partnerships for technology transfer. The task force will also coordinate agency budgets to support these activities. The budget supports activities identified in the strategy developed under the ocean exploration and undersea research technology task force. The House of Representatives passed the bill on February 14, 2008."
