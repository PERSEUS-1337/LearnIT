    "title": "SB 377",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 12206.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code states that for projects receiving a preliminary reservation of the state low-income housing tax credit after January 1, 2016, the credit will be allocated to the partners of a partnership owning the project according to the partnership agreement, regardless of how the federal low-income housing tax credit is allocated. For projects receiving a preliminary reservation of state low-income housing tax credits after January 1, 2016, a taxpayer may elect to sell a portion of the credit to unrelated parties for at least 80% of the credit amount. This option is available if the project also receives a preliminary reservation of federal low-income housing tax credits. The taxpayer can sell a portion of the credit to unrelated parties who are eligible for the credit under Section 12206 or Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year of the purchase or any prior year. The taxpayer must report to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee within 10 days of selling the credit, providing details such as the buyer's identification number, face amount of credit sold, and consideration received. The Committee will then share an annual list of taxpayers who have sold or purchased credits with the Franchise Tax Board. Credits can be sold to multiple unrelated parties. A credit can be sold to multiple unrelated parties, but cannot be resold by the unrelated party to another taxpayer. The original taxpayer remains liable for obligations and liabilities imposed by Section 12206. Purchasers of credits can use them in the same way as the original taxpayer. A taxpayer cannot sell a credit allowed by Section 12206 if they have already claimed the credit on their tax return. However, they can rescind the election to sell the credit with approval from the Executive Director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee if the consideration falls below 80 percent of the credit amount after reservation. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee can establish rules and guidelines for the allocation of the credit under Section 17058.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Chapter 3.5 of the Government Code does not apply to these rules. Section 17058.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code states that the state low-income housing tax credit shall be allocated to the partners of a partnership owning the project, regardless of how the federal low-income housing tax credit is allocated. The state low-income housing tax credit allocation to a partner under Section 17058 without substantial economic effect defers any loss or deduction from the sale of the partner's partnership interest until after the federal credit period expires. This does not apply to projects with a preliminary reservation of state low-income housing tax credits unless they also have federal low-income housing tax credits. A taxpayer can elect to sell a portion of a credit allowed under Section 17058 to unrelated parties for each taxable year, starting from 2016 to 2026, as long as the credit is sold for at least 80% of its value. The credit can be sold to unrelated parties who are eligible taxpayers under Section 17058 or Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year of the purchase or any prior year. The taxpayer must report to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee within 10 days of selling the credit, providing details such as the buyer's identification number, face amount of the credit, and consideration received. The Committee will then share an annual list of taxpayers who have sold or purchased credits with the Franchise Tax Board. Credits can be sold to multiple unrelated parties. A credit allowed under Section 17058 can be sold to multiple unrelated parties, with the original purchaser able to resell it once. The taxpayer originally receiving the credit remains liable for obligations imposed by Section 17058, while parties purchasing the credit can use it as the original taxpayer could. A taxpayer cannot sell a credit allowed by Section 17058 if they have already claimed the credit on their tax return. However, they can rescind the election to sell the credit if the consideration falls below 80 percent of the credit amount with approval from the Executive Director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee can establish rules and guidelines for the allocation of tax credits under Section 23610.7 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Chapter 3.5 of the Government Code does not apply to the Committee's prescribed rules. Section 23610.7 of the Revenue and Taxation Code states that the state low-income housing tax credit shall be allocated to partners of a partnership owning a project, regardless of how the federal low-income housing tax credit is allocated. The allocation of the state low-income housing tax credit to a partner must have substantial economic effect, or any related loss or deduction from selling their partnership interest before the federal credit expires will be deferred until the following taxable year. This rule does not apply if the project also receives federal low-income housing tax credits. For projects receiving a preliminary reservation under Section 23610.5 from 2016 to 2026, taxpayers can elect to sell a portion of the tax credit to unrelated parties for at least 80% of the credit amount. Taxpayers can sell a portion of the tax credit to unrelated parties who are eligible for the credit under Section 23610.5 or the federal low-income housing credit. Taxpayers who sell a credit under Section 23610.5 must report the sale details to the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee within 10 days. The committee will provide an annual listing of taxpayers who have sold or purchased credits to the Franchise Tax Board. The taxpayer who originally received the credit remains liable for obligations imposed by Section 23610.5 when selling the credit, which can only be resold once to unrelated parties. Purchasers of credits can use them as the original taxpayer could. A taxpayer cannot sell a credit allowed by Section 23610.5 if they have already claimed the credit on any tax return. However, with approval from the Executive Director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, the taxpayer can rescind the election to sell the credit if the consideration falls below 80 percent of the credit amount after reservation by the Committee. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee can establish rules and guidelines for the allocation of tax credits. They will also cover costs incurred by the Franchise Tax Board for administering certain sections of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Additionally, the Committee is required to report to the Legislature. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee must report to the Legislature on the total amounts of credits allowed and sold by taxpayers for specific sections of the Revenue and Taxation Code for different calendar years. The California Tax Credit Allocation Committee must report to the Legislature on the total amounts of credits allowed and sold by taxpayers for specific sections of the Revenue and Taxation Code for different calendar years. The reports submitted must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. This act establishes a tax levy under the Constitution and takes immediate effect."
