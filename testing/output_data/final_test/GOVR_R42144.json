    "content": "EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced final standards for mercury and other air toxics emissions from electric generating units (EGUs) on December 21, 2011. The rule, known as the \"Utility MACT\" or \"Mercury and Air Toxics Standards\" (MATS), has been in development since the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The estimated annual cost of implementing the rule is $9.6 billion in 2015. Industry and environmental groups are closely monitoring the rule's impact and implementation schedule, with proposed legislation (H.R. 2401) aiming to make changes. The report discusses the rule (H.R. 2401) that aims to change regulations on hazardous air pollutants. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require EPA to impose stricter regulations on sources emitting hazardous air pollutants. EPA was directed to impose the \"Maximum Achievable Control Technology\" on sources emitting more than 10 tons of any individual HAP or 25 tons of any combination. The Clean Air Act amendment required EPA to impose \"Maximum Achievable Control Technology\" on sources emitting specific amounts of hazardous air pollutants. Electric utilities lobbied for an exception, resulting in a study on public health hazards from emissions by EGUs and alternative control strategies. EPA was directed to regulate EGUs if deemed appropriate. The EPA Administrator found it appropriate and necessary to regulate Electric Generating Units (EGUs) due to the health hazards of mercury emissions. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can harm fetuses and children, primarily through fish consumption. All 50 states have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury pollution. The EPA regulated Electric Generating Units (EGUs) due to concerns about mercury emissions, which are harmful to fetuses and children. Regulations established a cap-and-trade system to limit mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants instead of plant-specific MACT standards. The 2005 cap-and-trade rules only addressed mercury emissions from power plants, allowing them to avoid control by purchasing allowances. This could lead to \"hot spots\" of high mercury concentrations in waterbodies. In contrast, MACT standards required by Section 112 of the act must be applicable at each plant and no less stringent than the best performing 12% of sources in the industry subcategory. These standards are known as the \"MACT floor\" and must be met without exceptions. The EPA proposed Utility MACT standards in response to a court decision vacating cap-and-trade rules in 2008. The final rule was finalized in December 2011 after a public comment period with 960,000 comments. The final rule for Utility MACT standards, finalized in December 2011, aims to reduce power plant emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants by about 90%. Power plants are the largest emitters of these pollutants, accounting for a significant portion of the nation's emissions. The rule will also reduce sulfur dioxide and fine particulate emissions, which contribute to premature deaths. It will impact around 1,100 coal-fired and 300 oil-fired units. The Utility MACT standards finalized in December 2011 aim to reduce power plant emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants by about 90%, impacting around 1,100 coal-fired and 300 oil-fired units. The compliance costs for oil-fired units are estimated at $56 million, with no expected change in capacity. The focus is on coal-fired units, where 56% already have equipment to achieve compliance, leveling the playing field for older plants. The EPA's MATS rule aims to bring poorly controlled plants up to standards set by the best performing similar sources. Compliance costs are projected to be $9.6 billion in 2015, decreasing to $7.4 billion annually by 2030. There are concerns about the cumulative impacts of this rule and other regulations on electric generation capacity. The EPA's MATS rule compliance costs are projected to be $9.6 billion in 2015, decreasing to $7.4 billion annually by 2030. The average consumer will see a 3.1% increase in electricity costs in 2015, falling to less than 1% by 2030. EPA estimates that retail electricity prices have declined by about 20% since the early 1980s. The EPA estimates that compliance with the Utility MACT/MATS rule will result in varying retail electricity price increases, ranging from 1.3% in California to 6.3% in the Southwest Power Pool region. The cost of compliance mainly involves installing scrubbers and fabric filters on coal-fired generation units, with 20 GW of coal-fired units expected to install scrubbers. By 2030, compliance costs are projected to decrease to $7.4 billion annually. The EPA estimates that compliance with the Utility MACT/MATS rule will result in varying retail electricity price increases. About one-third of the already installed scrubbers will need to be upgraded, while fabric filters will be added to one-third of coal-fired EGU capacity. Activated carbon injection and dry sorbent injection will be coupled with fabric filters to capture pollutants. EPA estimates that 99 GW of coal-fired capacity will add activated carbon injection by 2015 because of the rule, along with 44 GW of dry sorbent installations. The Utility MACT rule requires coal-fired power plants to install pollution control technologies like activated carbon injection and dry sorbent installations to reduce emissions. The benefits of the rule are estimated at $37 billion to $90 billion annually, primarily due to the avoidance of up to 11,000 premature deaths each year. The EPA's Utility MACT rule is expected to impact older coal-fired plants without current pollution control technology, leading to the retirement of some plants by 2015. This could result in job losses at specific locations, but overall, the rule is projected to increase employment. The agency estimates that 46,000 job-years will be needed for construction/installation of pollution control equipment, and 8,000 long-term utility jobs will be created. Industry groups argue that the rule's increased electricity costs may cause job losses. The EPA's Utility MACT rule may lead to job losses in industries heavily reliant on electricity in affected areas. Regulations allow for emission averaging but most units will still be regulated. Electric power generators are divided on the rule, with some companies supporting it due to reliance on nuclear power or natural gas. The Clean Energy Group, representing utilities with 20% of U.S. electric generating capacity, supports the Utility Toxics Rule, stating it is reasonable and compliant with the Clean Air Act. Compliance will require planning and resources but many companies are already on track. Opponents of the rule are backed by the industry's main trade association. Opponents of the Utility Toxics Rule, supported by the industry's main trade association, argue that compliance would be much more costly and difficult than EPA's projections. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and coal industry groups believe that the rule would require extensive upgrades, such as scrubbers, activated carbon injection, and baghouses, far beyond what EPA proposed. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) also expressed concerns about the rule's feasibility before it was even proposed. The NERC analysis assumed extensive pollution control equipment upgrades for coal-fired plants, including wet scrubbers, SCR, and baghouses/fabric filters. These assumptions, similar to EEI's, would likely result in even higher costs than estimated by EEI. NERC's analysis concluded that scrubbers would be required on all coal-fired facilities, with a higher percentage needing baghouses and ACI than EPA projected. Despite the costly assumptions, only a 1% decline in generation capacity nationwide is expected due to the Utility MACT. The report predicts 6.5 to 9.9 GW of coal-fired capacity will be retired and 2.1 GW derated. NERC also assessed reserve margins in 18 regions, finding only ERCOT and New England with planning reserve margins below the NERC Reference Level of 15% in 2015. In 2015, ERCOT region will have 79,415 MW of generation capacity with a 10.4% reserve margin. EPA rules will only reduce capacity by 267 MW (0.34%), according to NERC. ERCOT may face reliability issues, but emission standards will have a minor role. In New England, conflicting information is reported by NERC regarding reserve margins. Following the publication of the final standards in the Federal Register, existing power plants will have three years, with a possible one-year extension, to meet the standards. The EPA regulations will cause 237 MW of retirements or deratings, impacting regions such as PJM, MISO, and SERC-SE. In SERC-SE, retirements and deratings will remove 2.7% of anticipated capacity, but none of the areas will fall below a 17% reserve margin. The Utility MACT Rule requires existing power plants to retrofit with pollution control equipment within a three-to-four-year timeframe, with a possible one-year extension. Industry argues that the timeline is insufficient and could harm the reliability of the nation's electric power supply during construction. NERC's analysis shows that owners of remaining capacity need to retrofit 277 to 753 units with added environmental controls, posing a significant timing issue with the 2015 compliance deadline. The Utility MACT Rule requires power plants to retrofit with pollution control equipment within a tight timeframe. The number of retrofits needed may impact electric system reliability. EPA believes most units can comply within the deadline, but provisions for additional time have been added to the final rule. The final rule for the Utility MACT Rule allows for additional time for compliance if necessary, with a focus on granting an extra year for the installation of controls. EPA intends to broadly interpret the phrase \"necessary for the installation of controls\" to provide flexibility. Additionally, EPA issued an enforcement policy allowing units to obtain a fifth year for compliance under Section 113 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA is providing assurance regarding electric reliability for sources complying with the MATS. Sources may need to operate in noncompliance temporarily for electric reliability concerns. The EPA may issue an expedited order for compliance within one year if criteria are met. The proposed Utility MACT received a large number of public comments, with about 20,000 unique comments. Congress has shown interest in the proposal through the Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation (TRAIN) Act of 2011. This bill aims to assess the economic impact of the Utility MACT and other EPA rules, potentially delaying the promulgation of a replacement for the Utility MACT.

The Senate has not acted on H.R. 2401 or S. 609, which would require a favorable report from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the votes of 60 Senators. Another route for Senate action on the regulations is the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which removes obstacles to Senate action on final rules. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to consider a resolution of disapproval for final rules, such as the Utility MACT. If enacted, the rule cannot take effect, and similar rules cannot be reissued without new legislation. CRA resolutions can be brought to the Senate floor with 30 Senators signing a discharge petition. Once on the Senate Calendar, a motion to proceed is non-debatable and cannot be filibustered. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to consider a resolution of disapproval for final rules like the Utility MACT. The motion is not debatable and cannot be filibustered, with debate limited to 10 hours and amendments prohibited. Enacting a CRA resolution is challenging, as the Obama Administration strongly supports the Utility MACT. Legislation restricting EPA's authority may face a presidential veto, requiring a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate for a veto override. A court challenge to the Utility MACT rule may be the most likely avenue for success, as changing the rule through Congress would require a two-thirds majority. Court challenges can be lengthy, as seen with past cases like the EPA's 2005 utility mercury rule which took nearly three years to overturn. In the meantime, power companies will need to start planning and construction to comply with the standards."
