    "content": "We introduce a framework using max-affine spline operators to analyze and improve recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs with piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities can be represented as simple piecewise affine spline operators. This representation offers new insights into RNN behavior, including internal input space partitioning, template matching based on affine slope parameters, and the regularization effect of random initial hidden states. Extensive experiments validate these findings. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be improved by using random initial hidden states, which helps in mollifying exploding gradients and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments on various datasets validate these conclusions, showing that RNNs are powerful models for processing sequential inputs. Despite their success, our understanding of how RNNs work remains limited, with the universal approximation property being an attractive theoretical result. In this paper, a new angle for understanding RNNs is provided using max-affine spline operators (MASOs) from approximation theory. The piecewise affine approximations made by compositions of MASOs offer a useful framework to study neural networks, extending insights from feedforward networks to RNNs. Input space partitioning and matched filtering links developed in previous studies extend to RNNs, providing new insights and interpretations. The MASO formulation of RNNs allows for a random initial hidden state to improve performance, focusing on RNNs with piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities like ReLU. These RNNs combat the exploding gradient problem and achieve performance comparable to LSTMs with proper initialization and parametrization. Key contributions include proving that RNNs with these nonlinearities can be rewritten as a composition of MASOs, making them piecewise affine spline operators. The MASO formulation of RNNs allows for a random initial hidden state to improve performance, focusing on RNNs with piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities like ReLU. Key contributions include proving that RNNs with these nonlinearities can be rewritten as a composition of MASOs, making them piecewise affine spline operators with an elegant analytical form. The partitioning of piecewise affine spline operators is leveraged to analyze the input space partitioning that an RNN implicitly performs, capturing informative underlying characteristics of the input sequence. The piecewise affine mapping in an RNN corresponds to an input-dependent template, interpreting the RNN as performing greedy template matching at every RNN cell. Using a random initial hidden state in an RNN is rigorously proven to correspond to an improvement over using a zero initial hidden state. Using a random initial hidden state in an RNN acts as an explicit regularizer to prevent exploding gradients, leading to improved performance on various datasets. The RNN unit at each time step performs recursive computations, with the initial hidden state needing to be set beforehand. Unrolling the RNN through time provides insight into its dynamics, culminating in an output that is typically an affine transformation of the hidden state. The RNN output is an affine transformation of the hidden state at the last time step, with independent max-affine splines. The MASO output for dimension k is produced using dummy variables x and y, with slope and bias parameters corresponding to output, partition region, and input signal index. The MASO performs implicit input space partitioning by using a partition selection matrix Q. Knowing Q is equivalent to knowing the partition of an input x that the MASO computes. The output of the MASO for dimension k reduces to a simple affine transformation of the input, with specific affine parameters A and B. The MASO framework uses partition selection matrices to implicitly partition the input space. The output dimension k is determined by specific affine parameters A and B, which are input-dependent. RNNs with piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities are analyzed using MASO to derive rigorous results. The MASO framework utilizes partition selection matrices to partition the input space implicitly. RNNs with piecewise affine and convex nonlinearities are analyzed using MASO to derive rigorous results. An explicit affine formula for a time-unrolled RNN at layer is derived, showing that the RNN can be represented as a simple affine transformation of the entire input sequence. The affine transformation in multi-layer RNNs is influenced by the initial hidden state and partition region of the input. The output of an L-layer RNN is a piecewise affine spline operator, computed locally via simple functions using MASOs. The affine mapping formula in RNNs allows for analysis through established matrix results. Three analyses are provided: RNNs partition input space and develop partitions over time, analyze affine slope parameter linking to filterbanks, and study the impact of initial hidden state. The MASO viewpoint reveals how RNNs partition input sequences over time, offering a new perspective on dynamics. The piecewise affine and convex activation nonlinearity in RNN cells partitions the cell input into regions. The input sequence partition can be represented by a \"code\" that determines the partition it belongs to. The forward pass of an RNN develops and refines the partition code of the input sequence over time. Visualizing the evolution of partition codes can help diagnose RNNs and understand their behavior. The evolution of partition codes in RNNs can be beneficial for diagnosing and understanding their dynamics. By binarizing and concatenating hidden states, we can visualize how the partition codes of MNIST images evolve over time. t-SNE is used for dimensionality reduction to show the progression from initial clustering to better separated classes. This indicates the model's behavior is well-behaved. The MASO viewpoint connects RNNs to classical signal processing tools like the matched filter. RNNs can be interpreted as a matched filterbank, where the classification decision is based on the inner product between a \"template\" and the input sequence. The slope parameter A for each RNN cell acts as a \"locally optimal template\" that maximizes output dimensions. In a multi-layer RNN, the overall \"template\" is the composition of optimal templates from each RNN cell. The overall template of an RNN is computed via dz/dx and acts as a matched filterbank. A good template produces a larger inner product with the input, providing a principled methodology to visualize and diagnose RNNs. Training a one-layer ReLU RNN on a dataset like SST-2 illustrates the matched filter interpretation. The Sentiment Treebank dataset (SST-2) BID30 involves binary classification, displaying templates for correct and incorrect sentiment classes. The inner product between input and correct template is larger, indicating correct classification. Theoretical motivation for this is provided. Theoretical motivation is provided for using a random initial hidden state in RNNs to improve over setting it to zero. This choice acts as an explicit regularization, addressing the exploding gradient problem. The impact of setting the initial hidden state in RNNs to a Gaussian random vector as a form of explicit regularization is discussed. The modified loss function is shown to be the original loss function plus a regularization term. The standard deviation parameter controls the importance of the regularization term and helps address the exploding gradient problem in RNNs. The exploding gradient problem in RNN training is addressed by introducing randomness into the initial hidden state, which acts as a form of regularization. This approach helps prevent the gradient from blowing up, leading to more stable training. Further analysis is suggested to extend this method to other terms in the training algorithm. Experiments show significant performance gains using a random initial hidden state with properly chosen standard deviation. ReLU RNNs with 128-dimensional hidden states are used in all experiments. Visualizing the regularizing effect of the random initial hidden state is demonstrated on a simulated task of adding 2 sequences of length 100. The second row of X has 1's at 2 random indices and 0's elsewhere. Previous work treats this as a regression task. Visualization in FIG3 shows the impact of random initial hidden state standard deviations on regularization. Larger \u03c3 reduces magnitudes of A h and dL dWr. Too large \u03c3 can hinder learning due to excessive regularization. This raises the question of choosing the optimal \u03c3 value in practice. In practice, the choice of the best value of \u03c3 for the random initial hidden state in RNNs is investigated. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that using a random initial hidden state allows for higher learning rates without gradient explosion. RMSprop is less sensitive to \u03c3 compared to SGD, achieving good accuracy even with large \u03c3 values. RMSprop is recommended for optimization due to its gradient smoothing capabilities. The use of RMSprop with a random initial hidden state is recommended to improve model performance in RNNs. Experiments on MNIST, permuted MNIST, and SST-2 datasets show that a random initial hidden state can elevate the performance of simple ReLU RNNs to near state-of-the-art levels. This approach was also integrated into more complex RNN models like GRU, showing promising results. Our experiments with GRUs on MNIST and permuted MNIST datasets show accuracy improvements from 0.986 to 0.987 and from 0.888 to 0.904, respectively. We also tested a convolutional-recurrent model on the Bird Audio Detection Challenge dataset, achieving an AUC boost from 90.5% to 93.4% by switching from a zero to a random initial hidden state. Encouraging results suggest that a random initial hidden state can enhance the performance of complex RNN models. A novel perspective of RNNs in terms of max-affine spline operators has been developed. Replacing the typical zero initial hidden state with a random one can mitigate the exploding gradient problem and improve generalization. Further research directions include extending the framework to cover more general networks like GRUs and LSTMs. The text discusses the application of random matrix theory to understand RNN training dynamics and the output/prediction associated with input in a time series. It also mentions the use of sigmoid nonlinearity in networks like GRUs and LSTMs. The text describes the parameters and formulas used in an RNN, as well as the preprocessing steps for the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60k training images and 10k test images. The dataset includes permuted MNIST images and SST-2 sentences with a vocabulary of 17539 words. Each sentence is represented by trainable word vectors initialized randomly or using GloVe BID26. Phrases with semantic labels are used in training along with entire sentences. A dropout of 0.5 is applied in all experiments. The Bird Audio Dataset contains 7,000 field recording signals of 10 seconds each, sampled at 44 kHz. The dataset includes diverse scenes like city, nature, train, voice, water, with some including bird sounds. Performance is measured using Area Under Curve (AUC) due to class imbalance. Audio clips are preprocessed using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and 40 log mel-band energy features are extracted. Input dimensions are D = 96 and T = 999. Experiment setup for various datasets is summarized in TAB3. The experiment setup includes input dimensions D = 96 and T = 999. Various experiments are detailed in TAB3 and some are in the appendix. A common setting is the use of a learning rate scheduler to reduce the rate when validation loss plateaus. Experiments cover the influence of different standard deviations in random initial hidden states and input space partitioning using t-SNE visualization on the 10k test set images. Visualization is performed on the 10k test set images. Nearest neighbors in SST-2 dataset are found by constraining distance comparison within +/-10 words of the target sentence. Padding is used for examples of varying lengths before processing with RNN. One-layer GRU with 128 hidden units is experimented on MNIST and permuted MNIST datasets using RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. The study experimented with different standard deviations for random initial hidden states and found optimal values for MNIST, permuted MNIST, and bird detection datasets. Additional visualizations demonstrate the partition codes computed by an RNN on input sequences, focusing on the properties of the final partition. The study visualizes the nearest and farthest neighbors of MNIST digits using partition codes of images. The images are well clustered, and a two-dimensional projection using t-SNE of raw pixel and VQ representations is shown. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using VQ representation over raw pixel representation in clustering MNIST dataset. KNN classification with RNN computed partition codes shows higher accuracy compared to raw pixel representations. The study shows that using RNN VQ representation improves classification accuracy compared to raw pixel representations. Visualization of nearest and farthest neighbors demonstrates the partitioning effect on datasets of different modalities. t-SNE plot reveals distinct clusters with RNN VQ representation, indicating useful information extraction by RNN. The study demonstrates that using RNN VQ representation enhances classification accuracy over raw pixel data. Nearest neighbors show similar sentiment, while farthest neighbors exhibit opposite sentiment. Templates in FIG7 visually appear similar but have meaningful inner product with input. Regularization effect on regression task is illustrated in FIG0. Regularization effect is observed in both classification and regression problems, as shown in FIG0. Classification accuracies under various settings are presented in TAB6. The discussion of the results can be found in Section 6. The film is described as cute, funny, and heartwarming, with slapstick humor for kids and in-jokes for adults. However, some criticize Hollywood for squandering the opportunity with melodrama and choreographed mayhem. LaissezPasser is a distinguished effort by director John Woo, known for choreographed mayhem. It may not be his best work, but it is a fascinating film with rewards for those willing to make the effort. The text also discusses the inner product of templates in relation to hidden states in RNN cells. The proof for multi-class classification problem with softmax output involves recursive application of arguments for each layer. The cross entropy loss is rewritten with random initial hidden state assumptions. The cross entropy loss for multi-class classification with random initial hidden state is simplified using second order Taylor expansion, resulting in a rewritten loss function. The problem of exploding gradients in neural networks has been widely studied, with approaches such as gradient clipping and reparametrization of recurrent weights. Regularization techniques like dropout, noisin, zoneout, and recurrent batch normalization have also been used to address this issue. Using random initial hidden state instead of zero initial hidden state in ReLU RNNs relieves the exploding gradient problem by regularizing the recurrent weight gradient."
