The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow variances for certain structures in special flood hazard areas. The Administrator cannot penalize a community for granting variances, but can enforce action if proper criteria and mechanisms are not in place.

The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 allows variances for structures in special flood hazard areas if certain criteria are met, such as approval from a State or local zoning authority. New construction must show that floodproofing or elevation to base flood elevation is not feasible, and existing structures must not be located in designated regulatory floodways, areas riverward of levees, or areas subject to high velocity wave action. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 allows variances for structures in special flood hazard areas if certain criteria are met, such as approval from a State or local zoning authority. Variances may be granted if a structure is substantially damaged or in need of substantial repairs, floodproofing or elevation to base flood elevation is not feasible, and repairs or improvements do not increase base flood levels in designated floodways. The variance for structures in special flood hazard areas must meet specific criteria to ensure it does not lead to increased flood heights, public safety threats, excessive expenses, nuisances, fraud, victimization, or conflicts with local laws. Additionally, only one claim payment exceeding $1,000 can be made for the structure under flood insurance coverage within a 10-year period prior to the variance approval. The term 'agricultural structure' includes a single-family dwelling on the same property if occupied by the owner. 'Floodproofing' refers to measures that reduce flood damage to real estate or property. The term 'improved real property' refers to enhancements made to land, buildings, or their contents. SEC. 3. PREMIUM RATES.\n\nAmendment to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 regarding premium rates for agricultural structures with variances.

Section 1360 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to include provisions for levee-impacted areas, where the Administrator will establish flood risk zones known as AL zones if a community applies for remapping due to levee system failure to meet accreditation standards. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to include provisions for levee-impacted areas, where AL zones will be established for flood risk. Flood insurance will be available at actuarial rates based on risk, with a transition period for structures in moderate flood hazard areas. SEC. 5. MULTIPLE AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURE POLICY PILOT PROGRAM. The Administrator of FEMA will conduct a pilot program for selling flood insurance contracts covering multiple non-residential agricultural structures under a single policy. Coverage is available only in communities with flood insurance rate maps and limited to $500,000 per policy. The pilot program for flood insurance covers non-residential agricultural structures with a $500,000 aggregate liability per policy for structures and contents. The coverage must comply with waiting periods and be consistent with the General Property Form of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy. The Administrator may issue endorsements to the General Policy Form of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy to implement the pilot program. Contracts for coverage under the program will be sold exclusively through the Administrator's direct servicing agent. Reformation of existing policies is limited. The Administrator may not sell coverage under the pilot program for structures already covered by another insurance contract. The Administrator's authority to provide flood insurance for multiple structures under one policy is not limited. Policies under the pilot program cannot be sold until 6 months after publication of the program notice. The pilot program for flood insurance endorsements will be described in the Federal Register, with general terms and conditions outlined. The program will terminate after a 6-year period from the enactment of the Act, and a report evaluating the program will be submitted to Congress within 5 years."
