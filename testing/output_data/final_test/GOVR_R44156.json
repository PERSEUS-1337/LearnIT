U.S. peanut production is concentrated in the southeastern and southwestern states and has been supported by federal farm programs since the 1930s. The report discusses how peanuts are included in current farm policy alongside other crops like corn, wheat, soybeans, and rice. U.S. peanut production is primarily located in the southeastern United States, with Georgia accounting for nearly half of the production. The crop requires sandy and loamy soil and 120-160 frost-free days for optimal growth. Peanuts are a significant source of income in many peanut-producing counties, with about three-fourths of U.S. peanut acreage being dryland. Three-fourths of U.S. peanut acreage is dryland, with the remainder being irrigated. The major types of peanuts grown in the United States are Runner, Virginia, Spanish, and Valencia. Runner peanuts are the most common variety used in peanut butter production. Peanut butter is the leading use of peanuts in the U.S., followed by snack nuts, in-shells, candy, confections, and peanut oil. Peanuts are the leading snack nut consumed in the U.S., with a two-thirds market share. Peanuts were grown on 6,561 farms in the U.S. in 2012, with an average farm size of 247 harvested peanut acres per farm. Peanut production in the U.S. is mainly done by larger farms with at least 250 acres, accounting for one-third of all farms and three-quarters of national production. Farmers also grow other crops like cotton, corn, or soybeans in rotation with peanuts. The farm value of peanut production was $1.2 billion in 2015. After harvest, peanuts are taken to buying points where shellers, dealers, or warehouse owners purchase them and provide services like drying and cleaning. Shellers sell edible peanuts to processors and bid on USDA-owned stocks. The U.S. peanut market is thin, with only two shellers buying over 80% of all peanuts. There is no futures market for peanuts, and transactions are mostly done through private contracts. Peanut production has seen a decline in acreage but an increase in productivity over the last 25 years. Little public price and market information is available due to the industry's structure and pricing practices. The 2002 policy change in U.S. peanut farming led to a shift towards higher-yielding land in Georgia, resulting in increased peanut production. Market forces played a stronger role, causing greater market volatility since the quota buyout. Concerns exist regarding the impact of new government policies established in the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill policies have reversed the downward trend in peanut planted acreage, with higher plantings in 2015 and 2016. Demand for peanuts is fairly inelastic, leading to large price movements with small supply changes. U.S. peanut exports have increased significantly since 2012, with Canada, the Netherlands, and Mexico being top export markets. China entered the market in 2012 as a buyer, further impacting U.S. exports. In 2015/16, China's entry into the U.S. peanut market led to a 43% surge in exports to a record 1,544 million tons. Domestic peanut use also increased by 28%, reaching a record 5.1 million pounds. Government purchases of processed peanut products contributed to the rise in demand, resulting in a 15% drop in U.S. ending stocks. In 2015/16, the average farm price of peanuts is expected to be 19.3 cents per pound, higher than early predictions of 17 cents per pound. The unexpected increase in demand contrasts with the trend since 2012, when high prices led to a significant increase in plantings. The record U.S. peanut harvest in 2012 resulted in large domestic ending stocks despite record exports and strong domestic use. This surplus has led to a downward trend in farm prices since 2012, impacting government program outlays. The 2014 farm bill introduced new farm revenue programs, including changes for peanuts. Previously, peanuts operated under marketing quotas until 2002 when Congress eliminated them through a buyout. Since then, peanuts have followed a similar structure as other program commodities, remaining eligible for major farm support programs and CCC storage payments. The 2014 farm bill introduced new farm revenue programs for covered commodities, including peanuts. The bill includes Marketing Assistance Loan benefits, Price Loss Coverage (PLC) payments, and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments for crop years 2014-2018. CCC storage payments for peanuts were terminated with the 2007 crop. The 2014 farm bill introduced new farm revenue programs for covered commodities, including peanuts. Farmers had the choice between PLC and ARC payments based on crop revenue levels. Most peanut producers selected PLC for higher payments and risk protection. Most rice, barley, canola, sorghum, and minor oilseed producers chose PLC for government support programs, while corn, soybean, and wheat producers preferred ARC. Peanuts have a separate program payment limit due to the peanut quota buyout, giving farmers growing multiple crops two different payment limits. Under the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program, peanuts and other designated crops are eligible for benefits. MAL provides interim financing through a government loan for up to nine months after harvest. Farmers must produce a crop to benefit from the program, with peanuts having a loan rate of $355 per ton. This separate program payment limit for peanuts could potentially double a farmer's payment limits to $250,000. The Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program offers interim financing for peanuts at a loan rate of $355 per ton. Farmers receive loan proceeds based on the quantity of peanuts placed under loan. The program provides a price floor by allowing farmers to repay the loan if market prices are at or above the loan rate, avoiding selling at seasonal lows. USDA announces a weekly national posted price to determine the marketing loan repayment rate. The government takes ownership of the loan collateral if prices drop below the loan rate, but defaults on marketing loans are rare as farmers can repay at a lower price, receiving a \"marketing loan gain\" (MLG). Farmers may also opt for a \"loan deficiency payment (LDP)\" equal to the difference between the loan rate and the posted price. For most of the last decade, the farm price of peanuts has been above the loan rate, resulting in minimal marketing loan benefits. Farmers can fulfill their loan obligation by forfeiting the crop pledged as collateral if the posted price is below the loan rate. This option is attractive as USDA covers storage, handling, and interest costs. Producers can choose to repay a loan with cash or forfeit the crop, with gains not counting towards the payment limit. If forfeited, USDA takes ownership and incurs storage costs until the crop is sold. Additionally, producers with base acres for covered commodities are eligible for income protection under the PLC program, with payments triggered when the farm price is below the reference price for peanuts. The government payments for peanut crops are based on a reference price of $535 per short ton or 26.75 cents per pound. Payments are made after October 1 following the end of the marketing year, with individual farm payments calculated using historical program yield and acres. The PLC payment formula is the PLC payment rate times historical farm program yield times 85% of historical peanut base acres. The 2014 farm bill allowed farmers to update their farm program yields and crop base acres, with payments based on the PLC reference price. Peanut base represents historical planting on each farm, totaling 2 million acres nationwide. Farmers were given a one-time opportunity to reallocate acreage within their previous base to match their actual crop mix. Unlike previous farm bills, the 2014 bill introduced new income support programs. Payments under PLC and ARC are made on base acres, not current plantings, to comply with WTO commitments and minimize market distortion. Payments are partially decoupled from current market prices, except for generic base acres. PLC payments can also be made on generic base acres, which were cotton base acres from the 2008 farm bill. Cotton is no longer eligible for payments under the 2014 farm bill. The former cotton base, now \"generic base,\" is added to a producer's total base for potential payments, but only if a covered crop is planted on the generic base. PLC payments on generic base acres are fully coupled to actual plantings, proportional to a farm's plantings of peanuts and other covered crops on the entire farm. This coupled nature of PLC payments on generic base is a new program feature under the 2014 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill introduced a new program feature for generic base acres, potentially leading to substantial coupled plantings. Federal crop insurance is available for various crops, including peanuts, with yield-based policies to protect against weather-related yield loss. Insurance guarantees are based on historical yields and market prices, not statutory prices used in farm programs. The 2014 farm bill mandated a peanut revenue insurance product for the 2015 crop year, offering farmers a choice between traditional yield-based policies and revenue protection. USDA's Risk Management Agency based prices for the new revenue product on various factors, including futures prices of cotton, wheat, soybean oil, soybean meal, Brazilian peanut prices, peanut stocks, and USDA loan. Peanut producers rapidly adopted the new revenue insurance policy in 2015, with 44% of policies and 68% of covered acres enrolled in revenue insurance. $96.2 million was paid out in indemnities, with $77.3 million under revenue policies. Payment eligibility for farm program crops is based on adjusted gross income (AGI) limits, with a total AGI limit of $900,000 over three years. Eligibility for payments also requires being \"actively engaged\" in farming. To be eligible for farm program payments, individuals must be \"actively engaged\" in farming, defined as making a significant contribution of capital, equipment, land, personal labor, or active management. Crop planting decisions are based on net returns and rotational considerations. Market conditions for crop choices depend on prices, yield prospects, and production costs. Market conditions for 2016 are being assessed. Preliminary assessment of market conditions for 2016 suggests peanuts could be a competitive option for producers on irrigated and non-irrigated acres. Table 3 compares costs and returns for competing crops, excluding fixed costs. Producers must consider covering fixed costs for long-term economic viability, especially for peanuts with unique equipment costs. Variable cost estimates in Table 3 are subject to changing market conditions. The outlook for 2016 PLC and ARC payments for major covered commodities suggests peanuts are an attractive planting option on generic base acres compared to other crops. Peanut program payments under PLC are projected at $290 per acre, while wheat, corn, and sorghum are lower. Corn and soybeans are more likely to choose the ARC program, with corn projected to receive ARC payments of $92 per acre. Peanuts are projected to receive a PLC payment of $290 per acre in 2016, giving them a competitive edge over other program crops for generic base acres. Farmers may choose to plant their entire farm with peanuts if the PLC payment rates favor them, or opt for other crops if market returns do not support peanuts. Farm policy economists have observed that peanuts and rice have statutory reference prices set significantly above historical market prices, leading to potential PLC payments on generic base that may incentivize farmers to adjust their crop rotations. Since the peanut quota buyout in 2002, monthly peanut farm prices have been below their reference price 88% of the time, compared to corn and soybeans. The potential advantage of peanut production on generic base acres is highlighted by the fact that monthly peanut farm prices have been below their reference price 88% of the time since the peanut quota buyout in 2002. This advantage may incentivize farmers to adjust their crop rotations, as farm program payments increase in proportion to the decline in farm price below the reference price and loan rate for major program crops. The potential advantage of peanut production on generic base acres is highlighted by the fact that monthly peanut farm prices have been below their reference price and loan rate. The largest impacts on planting decisions could be in states with a large generic base, where the planting mix determines the payment. States with more than 50% generic base, such as Alabama, Texas, Georgia, Mississippi, and Florida, could see additional plantings of peanuts in future years if relative returns favor peanuts. Under the 2014 farm bill, peanut base acres and total generic base are summarized in Table 6. The concern is that farm program payments for plantings on generic base could distort the market and potentially exceed the U.S. amber box limit. Large peanut producers pledging their crops for USDA marketing loans may face payment limit issues, risking forfeiture of their crop. Under the 2014 farm bill, peanut producers may risk forfeiting their crops to USDA if marketing loan benefits exceed the payment limit of $125,000. USDA's November 2015 crop forecast initially projected record large peanut ending stocks for the 2015/16 crop year, but revised estimates significantly reduced the likelihood of forfeitures and expected program outlays. Large peanut plantings are still expected despite the revised outlook. Large peanut plantings are expected in 2017 due to farm subsidies providing incentives. If prices are depressed, USDA may struggle to sell excess peanuts without offering discounts, leading to large government outlays. Following the 2002 peanut quota buyout, federal support payments averaged over $300 million annually through 2007. Federal peanut program outlays have averaged about $90 million per year from 2008 through 2015. However, recent projections suggest costs could increase significantly, with USDA projecting costs of $503.6 million in FY2016, $870 million in FY2017, and at least $910 million through FY2025. CBO also projected CCC program outlays for peanuts at $413 million for FY2016, and averaging $548 million through the remainder of the 2014 farm bill period. The CBO projections for U.S. peanut programs do not include costs related to loan forfeiture, focusing on PLC, ARC, and marketing assistance benefits. The annual market value of U.S. peanut production ranges from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. Future government payments will depend on market conditions and peanut prices compared to the PLC reference price. The American Peanut Council administers the export market development program, receiving $2 million annually under the Market Access Program to support foreign market expansion for U.S. agricultural products. Some Members of Congress aim to reduce MAP funding, citing it as \"corporate welfare\" or to offset increased expenditures on other programs. In FY2015 and FY2016, USDA purchased millions of pounds of processed peanut products for domestic feeding programs and international food aid. Arguments for peanut support programs mirror those for U.S. farm programs in general, with proponents advocating for income safety nets and marketing assistance loans to help producers navigate market volatility and power imbalances. Critics argue that farm subsidies for peanuts may keep small, inefficient operators in business, while proponents claim that support is necessary to offset market volatility. Subsidies are said to distort resources and could be better spent in other sectors."
