    "content": "During the 113th Congress, efforts were made to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), with the Senate and House considering legislation such as the Strengthening America's Schools Act (S. 1094) and the Success for All Students Act (H.R. 5). The House passed the amended version of H.R. 5 on July 19, 2013, but it is uncertain if S. 1094 will be considered on the Senate floor. The reauthorization debate in Congress has focused on the federal role in education, particularly on educational accountability. Issues related to the burden of complying with reporting requirements under the ESEA have been discussed, with concerns raised by states and LEAs about data collection and reporting. The NCLB included accountability reforms reliant on testing, data collection, and reporting, particularly for Title I-A. Data collection is crucial for assessing school performance and implementing outcome-based accountability measures for schools and LEAs. The burden of data collection and reporting requirements under ESEA, especially for Title I-A, has increased over time. States and entities must provide information to receive federal funding, which is essential for the Department of Education to award funds and for oversight functions. This report addresses concerns about the growing burden on state and local reporting since NCLB was enacted. The report examines the burden of complying with ESEA reporting requirements, measuring it in terms of burden hours and cost burden. It includes key findings, methodology, and a discussion of 16 information collection packages. The report analyzes the burden of complying with ESEA reporting requirements by examining information collection packages. It includes general information, number of respondents, burden hours, cost burden, and federal costs associated with each package. The largest burden is found in the \"State Educational Agency, Local Education Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA, Title I, Part A (accountability issues)\" package. The report analyzes burden hours and cost burden of information collection packages. Appendices provide details on data sources, paperwork reduction act submission, and statutory/regulatory requirements. Key findings from analysis of 16 packages are summarized. The analysis of 16 information collection packages in the report revealed that the estimated annualized burden hours and cost burden varied significantly. One package, \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A,\" had the highest burden in both categories. Respondents to these packages include SEAs, LEAs, schools, parents, and other entities. The burden of responding to information collection packages varies among respondents, with costs spread across multiple respondents. Respondents may not have to address every item in a package, leading to varying costs for different items. For example, the \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" package has different types of burdens. In the \"Title I, Part A\" information collection package, schools may need to address three types of activities with varying burden hours and costs. Federal agencies must estimate annualized costs to the government, ranging from $0 to $3.1 million for each of the 16 collections. The package with the largest burden hours and cost is \"State Educational Agency, Local.\" The \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" has the largest estimated burden hours and cost burden of 4,710,525 burden hours and $118,075,705. This information collection package is essential for meeting Title I-A requirements to hold schools, LEAs, and states accountable for student performance. The \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" information collection package has seen a significant increase in burden hours over time, peaking at 7.9 million hours after the enactment of NCLB. However, the most recent version shows a decrease in burden hours by 3.2 million hours. The annualized burden hours for the \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" information collection package are expected to decline by 3.2 million hours (40%) due to new flexibility offered to SEAs by the Administration. The estimated annualized cost burden associated with the accountability issues also increased initially but is projected to decrease by $51.4 million (30%) with the new Title I-A flexibility. Despite the increase in burden hours and cost burdens, the data collected and reported are crucial for supporting federal education policies. The federal education policies rely on data collected by SEAs, LEAs, and schools to assess student performance and school progress. Parents use this data to make educational decisions, while the ED uses it for technical assistance and monitoring SEA work. The information collection packages are approved by OMB and are essential for educational accountability under NCLB. The OMB approves information collection packages submitted by federal agencies to OIRA. These packages include descriptions of the collection, its use, and supporting documentation. OIRA maintains an inventory of approved collections related to formula grant programs under ESEA. Criteria for selection include funding in FY2012 or required information for ESEA funding. The primary grantee must respond to the information collection package, regardless of subgrant awards. This report focuses on mandatory participation packages for formula grants under ESEA, administered by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education within ED. The report may not cover all packages due to ongoing changes. Table 1 lists the titles of the discussed information collection packages. The report focuses on mandatory participation packages for formula grants under ESEA, administered by the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education within ED. It includes information on the purpose of the collection, current time and cost burden, and annualized estimated burden hours and cost burden for respondents. The report examines PRA regulations defining \"burden\" as the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to provide information to a Federal agency. This includes reviewing instructions, developing technology for collecting and verifying information, training personnel, and completing information collection. The report examines the annual cost of information collection for the federal government, with a focus on the \"State Educational Agency, Local Education Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA, Title I, Part A\" package. The burden hours and costs associated with this package have fluctuated since the enactment of NCLB. Congress specifies the data that ED should collect, with varying levels of detail for each information package. The burden associated with information packages collected by ED varies based on congressional action and actions taken by ED. For example, the CSPR is the required annual reporting tool for States, Bureau of Indian Education, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico under ESEA. It consists of two parts collecting data related to ESEA goals, Annual State Report, McKinney-Vento Homeless Program, and Migrant Child Count. The CSPR collects information on state activities and outcomes for specific ESEA programs needed for GPRA indicators or reporting requirements. The burden of data collection may vary among states, schools, or respondents. Some entities may already collect the required data, while others may face increased burden due to changes in definitions or information collection processes. The OIRA requires federal agencies to specify the purpose of data collection on Form OMB 83-1, choosing from seven categories such as application for benefits or program evaluation. This can lead to increased burden if definitions or collection practices change. The purpose of data collection for Federal programs is assessed through objective measures and systematic analysis. The data is collected for general government use without primary reference to specific program operations. Audit purposes verify the accuracy of accounts and records, while program planning or management purposes relate to progress reporting and financial reporting. Research purposes further the course of research, and regulatory or compliance purposes measure compliance with laws or regulations. The most common purposes of information collection in the examined packages were application for benefits, program evaluation, program planning, and regulatory compliance. General purpose statistics, audit, or research were not included as purposes in the applications analyzed. The OMB-approved data collection instruments provide information about the purpose of each data collection. The Consolidated State Application and Report under ESEA aim to streamline reporting for States while promoting integration of State, local, and ESEA programs for improved educational planning and service delivery. The goal is to create a well-integrated educational plan that enhances teaching and learning outcomes. In the Supporting Statement to OMB, ED estimates burden hours and costs for each information collection package. Burden hours range from 200 hours to 4.7 million hours, with costs ranging from $6,000 to $118.1 million. Packages with the highest burden hours tend to have the highest costs. The \"Impact Aid Program Application for Section 8003\" has the largest number of respondents. The \"Impact Aid Program Application for Section 8003 Assistance\" has the largest number of respondents, estimated at 501,839, including 500,000 parents. The annual burden hours and cost for this package are 142,942 hours and $1.5 million. On the other hand, the package with the smallest number of respondents is \"State Agency Use of Alternative Method to Distribute Title I Funds to Local Educational Agencies with Fewer Than 20,000 Total Residents,\" with 200 hours and a cost of $6,000. This package addresses the process for obtaining approval to use alternative poverty data for redistributing Title I funds. The curr_chunk discusses the process for SEAs to obtain approval from ED to use alternative poverty data for redistributing Title I funds to small LEAs. The information collection package with the largest burden hours and cost is related to accountability issues, with 4,710,525 burden hours and a cost of $118,075,705. The purpose is to collect and disseminate information to document progress and inform parents and the public about educational performance. The curr_chunk discusses the burden hours and cost calculations for data collection efforts by SEAs, LEAs, and schools. The burden hours and cost vary across different collections, with discrepancies in how parent burden hours are accounted for. The burden hours and costs for information collection by SEAs, LEAs, and other entities are detailed in Table 4. SEAs, LEAs, and other entities have varying levels of burden, with SEAs being respondents to the most packages but not facing as much aggregate burden as LEAs or other entities. On average, SEAs may have higher estimated annualized burden hours and cost burden than other types of respondents due to the larger number of entities responding to the same information collection package. The burden placed on SEAs is not as great as that on LEAs or other entities, particularly schools, for Title I accountability issues collection. Detailed burden hours and costs for information collection by SEAs, LEAs, and other entities are provided in Table 4. The number of reporting requirements varies for different types of respondents within an information collection package, leading to varying costs. For example, schools may need to conduct needs assessments or develop schoolwide plans under the ESEA Title I, Part A accountability issues collection. The program must maintain records demonstrating compliance with federal program intent and purpose. Schools identified for improvement must develop a plan, and those under new ESEA flexibility must plan interventions. Table 5 shows the average burden for schools to meet these requirements, ranging from 4.8 to 960 burden hours and $120 to $24,000 in costs. In Q.14 of the Supporting Statement, agencies must estimate the annualized cost to the federal government for information collections, including activities like application review, data analysis, and guidance development. Table 6 displays the estimated federal costs for 16 information packages, ranging from $0 to $3.2 million annually. The three information collection packages with estimated annualized federal costs are the \"Migrant Education Program (MEP) Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) and Minimum Data Elements\" ($3.2 million), the \"Impact Aid Program Application for Section 8003 Assistance\" ($1.7 million), and the \"State Educational Agency, Local Educational Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA Title I, Part A\" ($1.2 million). Among these, the latter has the largest estimated burden hours (4.7 million) and cost burden ($118.1 million). This report focuses on examining this specific information collection package in detail, addressing accountability issues and underlying requirements. The report examines the burden hours and costs associated with an information collection package related to Title I-A accountability requirements. It compares pre and post-NCLB enactment burdens and recent changes coinciding with ESEA flexibility package availability. The report discusses the burden and costs of an information collection package related to Title I-A accountability requirements under ESEA. It highlights the importance of this package for educational accountability and federal grants to low-achieving children. The \"Educational Agency, Local Education Agency, and School Data Collection and Reporting Under ESEA, Title I, Part A\" information collection package accounts for about 1% of the FY2013 appropriation for Title I-A. The accountability requirements of the ESEA have evolved since the 1994 reauthorization, with enhancements under NCLB. ESEA flexibility packages have been granted to 39 states and the District of Columbia, aiming to reduce the burden associated with this data collection. States receiving Title I-A funds under IASA were required to develop content and performance standards, as well as assessments aligned with the standards in reading and mathematics at three grade levels. Performance standards had to establish three levels for all students, and assessment systems had to include all students in the grades being assessed. Results had to be disaggregated by gender, race, and ethnicity. The ESEA Title I required states to develop content and performance standards aligned with assessments in reading and math for all students. Data disaggregated by various student demographics was used to determine school effectiveness and implement program improvements. Individual performance profiles were prepared for each participating school based on statistically sound achievement data. The IASA expanded on the accountability requirements of Title I-A of the ESEA, requiring annual assessments in reading, math, and science for grades 3-12. Results are used to determine Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) for public schools, LEAs, and states. The IASA expanded on Title I-A accountability requirements by mandating annual assessments in reading, math, and science for grades 3-12 to determine Annual Yearly Progress (AYP) for public schools, LEAs, and states. AYP standards are based on student achievement levels and must include additional academic indicators like graduation rates. AYP calculations must be disaggregated for various demographic groups, with schools failing to meet standards subject to program improvement after two consecutive years. In accordance with the ESEA, schools failing to meet AYP standards for consecutive years face escalating accountability measures, including options for students to transfer to other schools making AYP and receiving supplemental educational services. Schools failing for multiple years must implement corrective actions and eventually develop restructuring plans, such as reopening as a charter school. The ESEA mandates accountability measures for schools failing to meet AYP standards, including options for students to transfer and receive supplemental services. States, LEAs, and schools must develop improvement plans, identify SES providers, notify families of choices, and ensure all public school teachers are highly qualified. Teachers must hold a license and demonstrate subject area knowledge, including passing state academic tests or having advanced certifications. Student assessment results and school data must be reported to parents, including information on student performance disaggregated by various demographics. The report cards must include student progress, graduation rates, schools failing AYP standards, teacher qualifications, and may include additional information like class size or school violence. President Obama and the Secretary announced ESEA flexibility waivers for states for school years 2011-2014. States can apply for a one-year waiver extension. The ESEA flexibility waivers allow states to exempt from certain Title I-A academic accountability and teacher qualification requirements. States can apply for a one-year waiver extension for the 2014-2015 school year by meeting four principles set by the Department of Education. These principles focus on improving student academic achievement and instruction quality. The Administration has redesigned many accountability and teacher-related requirements in Title I-A of current law. ESEA flexibility waivers have been approved for 41 states and the District of Columbia, allowing them to waive AYP determinations and consequences for failing to meet AYP. If Congress reauthorizes ESEA, the final bill may override these waivers. States no longer have to identify schools for improvement or implement specific actions associated with accountability levels. Instead, they must comply with prescribed interventions for the lowest performing schools. ESEA flexibility waivers have been granted to 41 states and the District of Columbia, allowing them to waive AYP determinations and consequences. The ESEA flexibility package replaces outcome accountability requirements for Title I-A schools with more prescriptive requirements for priority schools and interventions for focus schools. It also changes teacher requirements to focus on effectiveness based on student achievement. States with ESEA flexibility waivers must comply with interventions for the lowest performing schools. States receiving the ESEA flexibility package must implement new accountability systems and provide additional information on report cards, including data on student subgroups and \"super subgroups.\" They must also report on college-going data. States receiving the ESEA flexibility package must report data on college-going and college credit accumulation. Changes in reporting requirements have replaced certain data points with new ones, such as identifying priority, focus, or reward schools. The burden hours and cost associated with data collection have increased significantly over time. The enactment of NCLB led to a substantial increase in burden hours and cost associated with data collection. However, with the implementation of the ESEA flexibility package, these burdens are expected to decline. Limited information is available prior to NCLB, and detailed reasons for changes in burden are not available before the information collection package that expired in 2009. The collection package expired on December 31, 2009, and when burden hour estimates change, ED must identify causes for the change. There are four causes of paperwork burden change: adjustments to agency burden estimates, new statutory requirements, discretionary agency actions, and lapses in OMB approval. OMB considers discretionary agency actions and lapses in OMB approval as the best measure of agencies' effectiveness in managing their paperwork burden. Following the enactment of NCLB, the estimated annual burden hours for the information collection package increased significantly. The change was attributed to agency discretion, and ED submitted the package for emergency OMB approval. It was noted that predicting the burden associated with statutory and regulatory provisions was challenging. There was no change in burden hours for the package expiring in 2006. The estimated annual burden hours for the information collection package expiring on October 31, 2006, increased due to agency discretion and adjustments in estimates related to Title I-A, students with disabilities, school improvement, public school choice, SES, limited English proficient students, and SEA and LEA report cards. The increase in burden hours for the package expiring on October 31, 2011, was also attributed to agency discretion. The estimated annual burden hours for the information collection package expiring on April 30, 2012, increased significantly due to agency discretion, with a peak of 7.9 million hours. The most recent version of the package shows a decline of about 3.2 million (40%) annualized burden hours. The package includes a decline of about 3.2 million annualized burden hours due to adjustments in estimate related to 43 SEAs requesting ESEA flexibility. This results in fewer SEAs, LEAs, and schools needing to implement outcome accountability actions. LEAs no longer have to notify parents about school choice or SES, and SEAs no longer have to identify and evaluate SES providers. Based on the analysis of burden hour changes, ED expects significant decreases in burden hours for compliance with regulatory provisions related to LEAs planning for school restructuring, developing improvement plans, and schools newly identified for improvement. The implementation of new state accountability systems may lead to schools being identified as low performing and changes to SEA and LEA report cards. The ESEA flexibility package will lead to changes in SEA and LEA report cards. The reduction in burden hours may not be as expected due to early implementation stages and variations in state applications. As of August 21, 2013, 41 states and the District of Columbia have had their ESEA flexibility package approved. The actual reduction in burden hours may differ from estimates depending on the number of states approved for the package. The estimated annualized burden hours and costs for information collection packages may vary. Changes in burden hours are reflected in corresponding changes in cost burden. For example, the estimated cost burden increased by almost 160% from the previous version of the package that expired in 2006. The estimated annualized cost burden for information collection packages increased over time, peaking at $169.4 million in 2012. The cost burden decreased by $51.4 million with the ESEA flexibility package. The primary purpose of data collection is program evaluation. The primary purpose of the data collection is program evaluation, with additional purposes including program management and regulatory compliance. The collected information is used by SEAs, LEAs, and schools to meet reporting requirements under Title I of the ESEA, facilitate compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, and provide information to school communities. The data is also used to evaluate ESEA flexibility requests and determine the continuation, extension, or termination of waivers. Prior to ED making the ESEA flexibility package available to SEAs, ED responded to the question regarding the use of data in the information collection package. School communities, LEAs, SEAs, and ED have used the data in various ways to help students meet State academic standards and ensure statutory compliance. Parents and community members have used the data to make decisions about their child's education and hold schools accountable. LEAs have utilized the information to identify approved SES providers. Public accountability for school performance is ensured through the use of approved SES providers by LEAs, data on student performance by SEAs to determine progress, and enforcement of sanctions on schools. SEAs also use information from potential SES providers and LEAs to ensure compliance with statutory requirements for private schools. Private school officials are ensuring statutory requirements are met, using student academic achievement data to inform technical assistance efforts and monitor SEAs in various areas. The data is also used for performance measures, responding to inquiries, and running programs efficiently to maximize student achievement. The consequences of not conducting data collection were described in the Supporting Statement. If data collection is not continued, SEAs, LEAs, and schools will lack necessary information for Title I requirements under ESEA. NCLB highlighted achievement gaps but had drawbacks like low academic standards and neglecting student growth and teacher recognition. Many NCLB requirements unintentionally hinder State and local reforms aimed at improving academic achievement. States have requested relief from current law to focus on student learning and instruction quality. ED offers flexibility to SEAs, LEAs, and schools to support these reforms. Regular clearance of information collection is needed to continue this process. The report focused on the burden hours and cost of information collection packages related to ESEA requirements. The analysis showed an increase in burden hours and costs since NCLB, but steps are being taken to reduce them. The report highlighted steps taken by ED to reduce burden hours and cost burden for information collection packages related to ESEA requirements. It did not evaluate the specific purposes or value of the data collected, nor did it assess redundancy in the data collection process. The Education Department (ED) is exploring ways to reduce burden hours and cost burden by evaluating data collection processes for efficiency and potential duplication. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that ED is compiling an inventory of its data collections, expected to be publicly available by November 2013, to provide detailed information on each data collection and its specific elements. The Education Department is working on reducing burden hours and cost burden by evaluating data collection processes. Congress may address these issues in ESEA reauthorization legislation, but the impact on burden hours and cost burden is uncertain. The main data source for this report is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs' Inventory of Currently Approved Information Collections. The Inventory of Currently Approved Information Collections includes expiration dates, burden hours, annual responses, data collection forms, and OMB Control Number History. The information clearance process starts with a Federal Register notice and ends with OIRA action on the ICR. Public comments are considered before finalizing the information collection. The agency considers public comments, makes changes as needed, submits the ICR to OMB for review, and publishes a second notice for OMB's review. OIRA assigns designations like approval or disapproval to the collection and assigns an OMB Control Number. The OMB Control Number allows access to information collection packages in OIRA's Inventory of Currently Approved Collections. The \"View ICR-OIRA Conclusion\" summary page details OMB actions, current burden hours, and changes in approved burden hours for information collection packages. Agencies may request changes in burden hours without providing updated supporting documentation, leading to reliance on Supporting Statements for analysis. This reliance is necessary to understand respondents and associated costs for information collections. The Supporting Statement for Paperwork Reduction Act Submission is submitted to OMB's OIRA when a federal agency requests approval for an information collection. It includes details on the necessity of the information collection, legal requirements, and purpose of the information. The Supporting Statement for Paperwork Reduction Act Submission is submitted to OMB's OIRA when a federal agency requests approval for an information collection. It includes details on the necessity of the information collection, legal requirements, purpose of the information, and methods used to minimize burden on small businesses or other small entities. The Supporting Statement for Paperwork Reduction Act Submission is submitted to OMB's OIRA when a federal agency requests approval for an information collection. It includes details on the necessity of the information collection, legal requirements, purpose of the information, methods used to minimize burden on small entities, and consequences of not conducting the collection. Special circumstances for conducting information collections are also explained. The Supporting Statement for Paperwork Reduction Act Submission provides details on the necessity of information collection, legal requirements, purpose, burden minimization methods, and consequences of not conducting the collection. It also addresses special circumstances for conducting information collections, such as ensuring confidentiality and protection of proprietary information. The agency is required to solicit public comments on information collection before submitting to OMB. They must summarize and address comments received, particularly on cost and burden. They should explain any decision to provide payment or gifts to respondents, assure confidentiality, and justify sensitive questions. The agency must provide an explanation to individuals from whom information is requested, including steps for obtaining consent. Estimates of the hour burden should be provided, indicating the number of respondents, frequency of response, annual hour burden, and how the burden was calculated. Agencies should not conduct special surveys for hour burden estimates unless directed. Consultation with a sample of potential respondents is recommended. If the hour burden varies widely, show the range of estimated hours and reasons for the variance. Customary business practices should not be included in burden estimates. Separate hour burden estimates should be provided for each form if multiple forms are covered. The agency must provide an explanation to individuals from whom information is requested, including steps for obtaining consent. Hour burden estimates should be provided, indicating the number of respondents, frequency of response, annual hour burden, and how it was calculated. Separate hour burden estimates should be provided for each form if multiple forms are covered. Aggregate the hour burdens in Item 13 of OMB Form 83-I and provide estimates of annualized cost to respondents, excluding contracting out or paying outside parties for information collection activities. Total annual cost burden to respondents should be estimated in two components: total capital and start-up cost, and total operation and maintenance and purchase of services cost. The estimates should consider costs related to generating, maintaining, and disclosing information. This includes methods used to estimate major cost factors like system acquisition, equipment lifespan, discount rates, and cost timeframes. Capital and start-up costs involve preparations for collecting information, such as purchasing computers and software, monitoring equipment, and record storage. Agencies should present cost burden ranges if estimates vary widely and explain the reasons for the differences. Consulting with a sample of respondents, utilizing the 60-day pre-OMB submission public comment process, and including the cost of contracting out information collection services are important in developing cost burden estimates. When estimating annualized costs to the Federal government for information collection, agencies should quantify hours, operational expenses, and any other expenses incurred solely for this purpose. Estimates should not include costs for equipment or services purchased before October 1, 1995, for regulatory compliance unrelated to the information collection, or as part of customary business practices. Consulting with respondents and utilizing the 60-day pre-OMB submission process are important steps in developing accurate cost estimates. When estimating annualized costs for information collection, agencies should quantify hours and operational expenses incurred solely for this purpose. They should not include costs for equipment or services purchased before October 1, 1995, unrelated to the collection, or part of customary business practices. Consulting with respondents and using the 60-day pre-OMB submission process are crucial for accurate cost estimates. Agencies may aggregate cost estimates from Items 12, 13, and 14 in a single table. Additionally, explanations for program changes or adjustments in Items 13 or 14, plans for tabulation and publication of results, time schedule for the project, and exceptions to the certification statement should be provided. In the Supporting Statement for the State Educational Agency and Local Educational Agency Data Collection under ESEA, Title I, Part A, the U.S. Department of Education outlines the statutory and regulatory requirements associated with the information collection package. This includes the burden on state educational agencies, local educational agencies, and schools, with specific details provided in Table C-1."
