    "content": "The Act aims to help municipalities and local communities explore alternative electricity options and establish public power systems. Additionally, it includes the creation of a Community Power Investment Revolving Loan Fund. The \"Community Power Investment Revolving Loan Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States to provide loans to State or local governments for feasibility studies and community development programs related to public power systems. Community development assistance programs aim to address rising energy costs, offering low-income customer payment programs and energy efficiency initiatives. Incentives for new renewable energy resources, such as research programs and construction of generation facilities, are also prioritized. Additionally, there is a focus on the rapid deployment of distributed energy generation resources like microturbines, fuel cells, and combined heat and power systems. The curr_chunk discusses various initiatives related to electricity generation and transmission, including advanced natural gas turbines, energy storage devices, distributed generation research, purchase of existing systems, construction of new facilities, and education programs. Loan restrictions under the education and public information programs include no loans to financially distressed entities, those delinquent on Federal debt, or in current bankruptcy proceedings. Loans are only approved if there is reasonable assurance of repayment and the loan amount, along with other funds, is sufficient for project completion. Loan repayment periods are determined by the Secretary before approval. The Secretary sets the repayment timeline for loans under the education and public information programs. Repayment must start within one year of receiving the loan and be completed within 30 years. A temporary moratorium on repayment may be granted in cases of financial hardship for the State. The Secretary may impose finance charges on loans under this section, with rates varying based on the repayment timeline. Repayment amounts are credited to the Community Power Investment Revolving Loan Fund for designated purposes. Administration expenses can be covered by the Secretary. Authorization of Appropriations.--$5,000,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually to the Community Power Investment Revolving Loan Fund for fiscal years 2002 through 2007. Administration expenses may be covered by the Secretary. SEC. 3. STRANDED COSTS. Section 206 of the Federal Power Act is amended to prohibit any public utility or State regulatory authority from imposing fees on electric consumers for recovering wholesale stranded costs. This includes any exit fees when consumers switch to a different provider. The Commission is required to amend rules to enforce this provision promptly. Section 141 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to repeal the restriction on using tax-exempt bonds to acquire output facilities. The amendment applies to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act."
