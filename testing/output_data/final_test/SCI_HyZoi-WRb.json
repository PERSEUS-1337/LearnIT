    "content": "The IWAE approach by Burda et al. provides increasingly tighter bounds on latent variable model likelihoods. Cremer et al. reinterpreted these bounds as variational evidence lower bounds. This work offers a new perspective, treating each IWAE bound as a biased estimator with bias decreasing as sample size increases. Theoretical analysis yields bias and variance expressions, leading to the development of jackknife variational inference (JVI). Jackknife variational inference (JVI) introduces bias-reduced estimators with improved evidence estimates in variational autoencoders. Initial results show promise in applying JVI to learning variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders (VAE) are expressive probabilistic deep learning models used for generative modeling, representation learning, and probabilistic regression. VAEs consist of a probabilistic model and an approximate method for maximum likelihood estimation. The model is defined with a latent variable z and a prior distribution p(z) as a standard multivariate Normal distribution. Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is intractable, but the evidence lower-bound (ELBO) is maximized instead. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Microsoft/jackknife-variational-inference. The VAE approach maximizes the evidence lower-bound (ELBO) using an auxiliary inference network. The limitations include the need for an expressive model and the fact that ELBO is only a lower-bound to the true likelihood. The importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE) method aims to choose expressive distributions to improve upon the VAE approach. It introduces the IWAE objective for estimating \u03b8, showing that as K approaches infinity, the method can significantly enhance model performance. The IWAE method aims to improve model performance by using expressive distributions to estimate \u03b8. Recent research shows that any L K can be converted into the standard form L E through importance sampling. Statistical properties of the IWAE estimator of the log-marginal likelihood are analyzed, with results on bias and variance provided. The jackknife method circumvents the problem of unknown moments in the IWAE estimator. Proposition 1 states that for a distribution P with finite moments of all orders, the bias of the IWAE method decreases at a rate of O(1/K). Corollary 1 shows that the bias of the estimator decreases as K increases. The bias of the IWAE estimator decreases at a rate of O(1/K) due to it being a smooth function applied to a sample mean. The coefficient of the leading bias term is determined by the coefficient of variation, which measures the dispersion of the distribution. For large K, the bias is small when the coefficient of variation is small. The variance of the IWAE estimator is also important, and for K \u2192 \u221e, the variance of LK is quantified. The variance of LK for K \u2192 \u221e is given, with both bias and variance vanishing at a rate of O(1/K). The asymptotic results depend on the distribution of weights, and estimating moments accurately is challenging. The IWAE method shows promising results, but estimating moments from data is difficult. Estimating moments accurately is challenging, but the jackknife method helps avoid this difficulty. The jackknife methodology is a classic resampling technique that allows for the estimation of consistent estimators. Higher-order variants of the jackknife are also reviewed. The jackknife bias-corrected estimator achieves reduced bias by using a linear combination of two estimators. The method involves creating subsets of the original sample to reduce variance, with the possibility of further bias reduction. The generalized jackknife method achieves bias reduction beyond O(n \u22123) by using Sharot coefficients to define estimators of order m. The variance of these estimators is challenging to characterize. The generalized jackknife method is used for bias reduction beyond O(n \u22123) by defining estimators of order m using Sharot coefficients. It is challenging to characterize the variance of these estimators. Other methods for debiasing estimators include the delta method, iterated bootstrap, and the debiasing lemma. The delta method bias correction has been applied to variational inference, and now the generalized jackknife is proposed for bias correction in variational inference by debiasing the IWAE estimator. The Jackknife Variational Inference (JVI) method aims to reduce bias in the IWAE estimator for log-marginal likelihood, but it is not a lower bound like ELBO and IWAE. It can have increased variance compared to IWAE and ELBO estimators. The estimator uses Sharot coefficients and subsets of samples to improve estimates. The Jackknife Variational Inference (JVI) method reduces bias in the IWAE estimator for log-marginal likelihood. It generalizes the IWAE bound and includes the standard ELBO objective. The JVI estimators have less bias than IWAE. The bias of the JVI estimate satisfies a specific condition for any K \u2265 1 and m < K. The JVI estimator applies higher-order jackknife to the IWAE estimator, with an asymptotic expansion of bias in terms of orders of 1/K. In Appendix C, bias removal is discussed for the IWAE estimator. Variance reduction is emphasized by averaging multiple estimates, while bias reduction is more challenging. Efficient computation is crucial due to the large number of IWAE estimates to compute. All IWAE estimates are related and based on subsets of the same weights, making computation of the K weights more manageable. The algorithm presented in the curr_chunk efficiently computes the JVI estimator for variance reduction in IWAE estimates. It outlines a method for log-weight computation and implementation on modern GPUs, with complexity results provided. The algorithm is suitable for CPU and offers a numerically robust approach for estimating the JVI. The algorithm efficiently computes the JVI estimator for variance reduction in IWAE estimates. It is suitable for CPU implementation and offers a numerically robust approach. Experimental runtime evaluation on the MNIST test set shows that runtime is largely independent of the order of the JVI correction and only depends linearly on K. Variations of the JVI estimator with improved runtime exist, such as evaluating only a fraction of all possible subsets. The JVI method reduces bias in estimating the marginal likelihood by using streaming log-sumexp computations. It offers high-order bias reduction while controlling variance. Empirical validation shows that JVI produces better estimates even for small K, improving bias reduction. Variational autoencoders trained on MNIST are used to estimate the marginal likelihood with reduced bias. Higher-order bias reduction is more effective than lower-order bias reduction. The implementation is available on GitHub. The accuracy of evidence estimates is evaluated using different objective functions on the dynamically binarized MNIST dataset. The study trains variational autoencoders on MNIST with different objectives to estimate marginal log-likelihood. Models are evaluated using JVI estimators up to order five for higher-order bias reduction. The final model with the best validation score is tested on the MNIST dataset. The study evaluates JVI estimators up to order five for bias reduction in estimating marginal log-likelihood on MNIST. Higher-order JVI estimates show significant improvement over IWAE estimates, with evidence estimates improving monotonically with the order of the estimator. Higher-order bias remains even for K = 64, indicating a large contribution to the evidence error. Preliminary results on learning models using JVI objectives show comparable marginal likelihood across all estimates, indicating higher-order bias reduction does not increase variance. Results from training on IWAE and JVI-1 objectives show a stronger effect on JVI-1, with the JVI-1-trained model slightly behind the IWAE model in performance. The JVI-1-trained model falls slightly behind the IWAE model, possibly due to issues with log-evidence approximation. Two hypotheses are proposed: using separate learning objectives for the encoder and decoder, and the possibility of bias amplification during optimization. Previous analysis on IWAE bounds does not offer a method to reduce bias. The curr_chunk discusses various methods to reduce bias in variational inference, including DVI, perturbative variational inference, and using larger variational families. Implicit models and non-linear transformations are also mentioned as ways to improve flexibility in the variational family. The curr_chunk proposes leveraging classic higher-order bias removal schemes for evidence estimation in variational inference. The approach is simple, computationally efficient, and improves existing evidence approximations. It also introduces a jackknife variational inference debiasing formula that can be used for debiasing log-evidence estimates from annealed importance sampling. However, using the debiased estimates for training VAE models did not show improvement over the IWAE training objective. One possible extension to the work is to explore other resampling methods for bias reduction, such as the iterated bootstrap, Bayesian bootstrap, and debiasing lemma. These methods may offer improvements in bias reduction or reduced variance, but overcoming computational requirements or deriving key quantities analytically is a challenge. The application of the debiasing lemma requires careful construction of a truncation distribution and often results in estimators with high variance. While variance reduction is important in machine learning, bias reduction techniques are also widely applicable. The text discusses the use of resampling methods for bias reduction in statistical analysis. It mentions exploring methods like the iterated bootstrap, Bayesian bootstrap, and debiasing lemma. These methods aim to reduce bias and variance in estimators, but may pose challenges in computational requirements and analytical derivation. The debiasing lemma, in particular, requires careful construction of a truncation distribution and can result in estimators with high variance. While variance reduction is crucial in machine learning, bias reduction techniques are also widely applicable. The text discusses resampling methods for bias reduction in statistical analysis, including the iterated bootstrap, Bayesian bootstrap, and debiasing lemma. The debiasing lemma requires careful construction of a truncation distribution and can lead to high variance estimators. Variance reduction is important in machine learning, but bias reduction techniques are also valuable. The moment expansion of Y K is simplified by substituting sample moments with central moments of the original distribution, leading to consistency proof through convergence in probability. The Delta method Variational Inference (DVI) is defined with practical Monte Carlo estimator for FORMULA3. The practical Monte Carlo estimator of FORMULA3 is defined as the sample mean. The expected variance of the sample mean around the true mean is related to the variance. Zhang (2007) showed a result about the covariance of sample mean and sample variance for random variables. The expectation of Bias of log p(x) evidence approximations can be decomposed. The 1/K term in (62) is cancelled by the delta method correction. The experiment in FIG5 with the DVI estimator shows bias reduction, while JVI is superior for bias reduction in challenging cases. The complexity bound for log-sum-exp operation in S(K, m) sets is at most K operations. Higher-order JVI estimators in the P = Gamma(0.1, 1) example demonstrate increasing bias removal. Matrix B is constructed from concatenated log-weights v i in a column vector of K elements. Matrix B is constructed from concatenated log-weights v i in a column vector of K elements. A vector A is also constructed with |S| elements. The estimator can be expressed as A log(B exp(v)), with the log and exp operations being elementwise. To improve numerical robustness, the estimator can be computed in the log domain using logsumexp 2 (I S\u00d71 v + log B) A. This method can be easily implemented in modern neural network frameworks."
