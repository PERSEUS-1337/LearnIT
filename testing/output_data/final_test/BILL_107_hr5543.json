    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Maggie's Law: National Drowsy Driving Act of 2002\". Congress finds that a significant number of motor vehicle crashes are caused by driver drowsiness or fatigue, resulting in deaths, injuries, and economic losses. Scientific research shows that driver inattention and sleep deprivation contribute to these crashes. An insufficient amount of statistical data and documentation on fatigue-related motor vehicle crashes is available. Federal statistics under-report the problem due to reliance on police accident reports, with studies showing that less than half of all crashes are reported to the police. Complicating data collection are factors such as police officers not being trained to detect sleep-related crashes, lack of a test for determining sleepiness like for drunk driving, and some states lacking proper codes for sleepiness on crash report forms. In 2001, a national survey found that 53% of adults drove while drowsy, 19% dozed off while driving, and 1% crashed due to dozing off. Studies confirm that certain population groups are at higher risk for drowsy driving, including young people under 26 who stay up late and drive at night, shift workers with nontraditional schedules, and commercial drivers with long driving schedules. In 1995, a study found that certain roads, like high-speed, long, rural highways, are more dangerous for sleep-deprived drivers. The New York State Police estimated that 40% of fatal crashes on the New York Thruway were due to drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Continuous shoulder rumble strips are effective in preventing drift-off-the-road crashes. Continuous shoulder rumble strips have been effective in reducing accidents caused by drowsy driving. New York State and Pennsylvania both reported significant reductions in crashes after installing rumble strips on highways. An expert panel in 1995 concluded that continuous shoulder rumble strips are effective in preventing drift-off-the-road crashes. The expert panel in 1995 concluded that rumble strips reduce drift-off-the-road crashes by 15 to 70 percent depending on road type and design. SEC. 3. DROWSY DRIVING EDUCATION PROGRAMS. Chapter 4 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by adding a section on drowsy driving education programs. The Secretary may provide funding to State highway offices and drowsy driving safety organizations for national, State, and local education programs on preventing drowsy driving-related accidents. The programs aim to educate the public on the dangers of driving while fatigued or drowsy due to various factors like sleep deprivation, sleep disorders, medications, and alcohol use. The Secretary may fund education programs to prevent drowsy driving accidents, including training professionals to recognize fatigue in drivers and develop a standardized curriculum on drowsy driving risks and prevention. The State transportation department must incorporate a drowsy driving component in driver's education courses and collaborate with health and education departments. State transportation departments should also create a curriculum on drowsy driving for instructor training. Collaboration with national campaigns is encouraged to promote scientifically-based information on drowsy driving and prevent accidents. The State transportation department is urged to adopt policies for the installation of continuous shoulder rumble strips on highways, include codes on accident report forms for fatigue-related crashes, provide training for enforcement personnel on detecting drowsy driving, and offer education programs to law enforcement. The entity applying for funding must submit an application to the Secretary and provide annual reports on program activities. This includes implementing drowsy driving education programs and informing police and courts about available sanctions for such accidents. The entity applying for funding must submit an application to the Secretary and provide annual reports on program activities, including drowsy driving education programs, support materials distribution, and public-private partnerships for non-Federal support. The Secretary will prepare and submit an annual report to Congress on program implementation and materials developed and distributed by funded entities. In this section, definitions for drowsy driver education programs, State, State model programs, and national programs are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for drowsy driving programs, including the definition of continuous shoulder rumble strips. $5,000,000 is authorized for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration annually from 2003 to 2008. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on fatigue-related automobile crashes among the general driving public and submit a report to Congress within 2 years."
