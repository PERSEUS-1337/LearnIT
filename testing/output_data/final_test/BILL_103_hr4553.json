    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fusion Energy Research Authorization Act of 1994\". The Congress acknowledges the need for 2 to 3 times more energy by 2050, requiring a shift from fossil fuels to prevent environmental degradation. Nonfossil fuel energy technologies must be developed, and the Federal Government should fund research in high-risk energy technologies. The Federal Government's investment in energy research has significantly declined in the last 14 years, despite the urgent need for nonfossil fuel technologies. Fusion energy shows promise as a safe, abundant, and environmentally sound energy source, with researchers making significant progress in the last 16 years towards realizing its potential. The Federal Government must provide stable funding for fusion energy research to overcome technical challenges and demonstrate commercial viability. Magnetic fusion is the leading technology, but alternative concepts should also be supported. International collaboration can reduce costs, and the US must show commitment to scientific partnerships. The United States should commit to participating in international scientific programs like ITER to demonstrate commitment to scientific partnerships and provide stable funding for fusion energy research. The purposes of this Act are to provide direction and authorize appropriations for a fusion energy research program at the Department of Energy, accelerate United States participation in ITER, select a host country for ITER, and establish a trust fund for funding fusion energy research facility construction. The Act defines key terms such as \"alternative fusion concepts,\" \"Department,\" \"Fusion Energy Research Program,\" \"international partners,\" \"ITER,\" \"magnetic fusion,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and the term \"Tokamak Physics Experiment\" is a facility designed to replace the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor for conducting experiments on reactions with a pulse length of at least 15 minutes and demonstrating a more compact and efficient magnetic fusion reactor design. The Fusion Energy Research Program is outlined in Section 5. The Fusion Energy Research Program, outlined in Section 5, aims to demonstrate the feasibility of producing safe, environmentally sound, and affordable energy from fusion. The program's goal is to achieve commercial electric power production by 2010 and commercial fusion energy production by 2040 through research, development, and demonstration on magnetic fusion energy technology. The Fusion Energy Research Program focuses on the design, construction, and operation of experimental fusion reactors like the Tokamak Physics Experiment. It also includes the development of special materials, facilities, and components to support these reactors. Additionally, the program involves research, development, and demonstration of alternative fusion concepts through an Assistant Director for Alternative Fusion Research. The Fusion Energy Research Program focuses on developing experimental fusion reactors like the Tokamak Physics Experiment and alternative fusion concepts. It also involves designing, constructing, and testing an Induction Linac Systems Experiment for heavy ion inertial fusion energy development. Additionally, participation in the design, construction, and operation of ITER aims for it to be operational by 2005. Within 6 months of this Act's enactment, the Secretary will contract the National Academy of Sciences to review magnetic fusion technologies and alternative concepts for their potential as future energy sources. The study will identify research goals, costs, and timeframes needed for commercial viability. Additionally, there will be a process for selecting the ITER site. The Secretary will submit a study to Congress comparing the advantages and disadvantages of siting ITER in the United States versus outside the US, including economic costs and benefits. The study will consider the impact on employment, manufacturing of major ITER subsystems, and funding requirements. The Secretary will aim to reach an agreement with international partners for selecting a host country for ITER by October 1995, ensuring equitable distribution of economic benefits. The Secretary will initiate a process to identify candidate sites in the US for ITER construction and propose a site within 90 days of enactment. The goal is to complete site-specific design activities by 1998, ensuring US industry involvement in ITER's design, construction, and operation. The Secretary will propose a site in the US for ITER within 90 days of enactment. A final cost estimate will be provided to Congress after site-specific design activities are completed. SEC. 8. REPORTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. Within 120 days of enactment, the Secretary must report on the feasibility of a backup plan for the Tokamak Physics Experiment. Within 180 days of enactment and biennially after, reports on the Fusion Energy Research Program must be submitted to Congress. Coordination between civilian and defense fusion research programs is required. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense, must submit a report to Congress within 120 days after the enactment of this Act with recommendations for sharing budget and resources to enhance civilian energy applications of the defense Inertial Confinement Fusion Program. Section 2114 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is repealed. The Secretary will establish a new University Radiation Science and Technology Program by combining existing nuclear engineering and research programs. Additionally, a Fusion Energy Facility Fund will be created. The Secretary will establish a fee of 0.1 mills per kilowatt hour for electricity sellers, with collection procedures using federal, state, or local agencies. Funds will be used for ITER-related projects, and the fee authority will expire under certain conditions. The fee authority established by the Secretary for ITER-related projects will expire when the account balance is sufficient to cover obligations or when ITER construction is completed. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Fusion Energy Research Program is authorized to receive $380 million for fiscal year 1995, $425 million for fiscal year 1996, and $475 million for fiscal year 1997. The Alternative Fusion Research Program is allocated $26 million for fiscal year 1995, $31 million for fiscal year 1996, and $31 million for fiscal year 1997. The Tokamak Physics Experiment's budget is capped at $700 million. The University Radiation Science and Technology Program is allocated $25 million for fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, with additional funding as needed. No funds are authorized for the construction of ITER until international agreement requirements are met. Funds are limited to specific magnetic fusion facilities including ITER, related facilities, and the Tokamak Physics Experiment."
