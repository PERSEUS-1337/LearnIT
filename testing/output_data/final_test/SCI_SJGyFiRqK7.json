    "content": "The proposed GaLU networks decouple linear functions and gates in neurons, showing similar performance to ReLU networks on standard datasets. The focus is on simpler models with practical performance close to base models and easier theoretical analysis. The GaLU networks introduce a new type of neuron that separates the roles of filtering and linear weighting, making them easier to analyze. They are shown to be as expressive as ReLU networks and have potential for further research in deep learning theory. GaLU networks are as expressive as ReLU networks but have optimization challenges due to the parameter u being untrainable with gradient-based methods. Despite this, GaLU networks are effective on real-world datasets and easier to analyze and understand. Deep linear networks and training only the readout layer are two proposals closely related to understanding deep learning through simpler models. Linear networks are limited in expressive power as they can only express linear functions, while training only the readout layer involves non-linear constant transformations with the last layer learning a linear function. These approaches have led to impressive theoretical results but have limitations in practical success compared to standard networks. The model discussed in section 3 is a more practical approach compared to deep linear networks and training only the readout layer. It focuses on optimizing the linear part of GaLU neurons while keeping the non-linear gates untrained. GaLU networks with a single hidden layer have constant gate values, but in networks with multiple hidden layers, this is not the case. The output of a GaLU neuron at layer i is \u03c3(x(i-1)u) \u00b7 x(i-1)w, where the gate value can change as x(i-1) changes. An alternative approach is to define a GaLU0 neuron at layer i as \u03c3(x(0)u) \u00b7 x(i-1)w, where the gate value is determined by the original input. This simplifies the optimization dynamics by keeping the gate value fixed. In GaLU networks, GaLU0 neurons have constant gate values, simplifying optimization dynamics. GaLU0 and ReLU networks were tested on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, both achieving similar results. GaLU0 and ReLU outperformed linear networks of the same size. Training only the readout layer of a ReLU network resulted in poorer performance. The GaLU network simplifies optimization dynamics with constant gate values. It can be rewritten to optimize over reparameterized weights without losing expressive power. Training only the first layer is sufficient as the readout layer adds nothing to the network's expressiveness. The GaLU network is essentially a random non-linear transformation followed by a linear function. The expressivity of the model is measured by its ability to fit a random sample, with no optimization gap. Generalizing from the sample to unseen examples is impossible, resulting in a test loss of 1. The GaLU network measures its expressivity by fitting a random sample with no optimization gap, resulting in a test loss of 1. Training involves standard mean-square error regression loss with a closed form solution for optimization. The GaLU network measures its expressivity by fitting a random sample with no optimization gap, resulting in a test loss of 1. Training involves standard mean-square error regression loss with a closed form solution for optimization. The expected squared loss on the training set for weights w is denoted as LS(w). Every vector y can be decomposed into a sum y = a + b, where a is in the span of the columns of X and b is in the null space of X. The minimum value of LS(w) is b^2/m. Empirical experimentation shows that ReLU outperforms GaLU by a small margin. ReLU can outperform GaLU networks, even though it is less expressive, due to better filter training. SGD over ReLU converges to superior filters compared to random initialization. Algorithm 1 improves GaLU network results, making them more competitive with ReLU. Artificial neural networks have low generalization error in real-life problems, enhancing their utility as a learning algorithm. The GaLU algorithm improves network filters through iterative optimization. An experiment showed that training on randomized labels still resulted in low training loss but high test loss. GaLU networks exhibit similar phenomena as ReLU networks but may be easier to analyze. In a similar experiment to BID18, GaLU and ReLU networks were compared using a natural model with cluster centers and random labels. Train and test errors were calculated for different parameters, showing that GaLU and ReLU have similar statistical behavior. As labels become noisier, generalization error increases, aligning with findings in BID18. In a study comparing GaLU and ReLU networks, it was found that as labels become noisier, generalization error increases. The analysis focused on the correlation between the norm of w and the amount of noise in the data, showing a linear relation between w 2 p and the generalization gap for GaLU networks. The linear correlation between w 2 p and the generalization gap is clear in GaLU networks. Training these networks as linear functions shows behavior consistent with theory, unlike when both layers are trained using SGD. This aligns with previous discussions on the correlation between weight norms in ReLU networks and test loss. Various capacity measures have been proposed for studying deep learning generalization. The curr_chunk discusses a different analysis for linear regression using MSE and introduces a lemma related to distribution comparison experiments. It compares two distributions, one for generalization and one for fitting random noise. The analysis focuses on fitting random noise in linear regression, setting the training set size to m = d + 2. The expected training losses on two distributions are analyzed, showing small losses on both. However, a significant gap is observed in the test losses between the distributions, indicating a phenomenon where a sample with random labels achieves a small train loss but a large test loss. This aligns with findings in BID18. The analysis discusses the phenomenon of small train loss but large test loss in linear regression, highlighting the natural property of the least squares solution. Lemma 1 provides a sharp analysis, but its assumptions are too strong. The analysis uses GaLU networks and linear regression to rephrase the problem as a convex one. The analysis uses GaLU networks to rephrase the problem as a convex one, where biconvex optimization algorithms like ACS can be applied instead of SGD for finding optimal weights in the two layers. This approach outperforms SGD for small samples with MSE loss. The algorithm, while not practically useful, is valuable for theoretical bounds in networks. Increasing output dimension makes GaLU and ReLU networks more similar. ReLU slightly outperforms GaLU for i.i.d. N(0,1) variables, but differences vanish with larger d. GaLU needs more neurons than ReLU for d=1, but for larger d, GaLU is slightly better. Both networks exhibit similar behavior. In this article, a new type of neuron is proposed, achieving similar results to standard neurons but easier to analyze. Understanding the behavior of GaLU networks may also explain ReLU networks and other non-linearities. Further research directions are suggested, particularly in the one hidden layer case. The GaLU networks may offer better theoretical analysis than current methods, potentially shedding light on ReLU networks and other non-linearities."
