    "content": "More than a dozen years after independence, Ukraine is transitioning to democracy and a free market economy. It is also searching for its identity as a central European state or a close partner of Russia. Western analysts see a stable, independent Ukraine as crucial for European security due to its size, population, resources, and strategic location. Ukraine's stability and prosperity are seen as crucial for European security, with hopes for its potential role in NATO and the EU. Concerns exist about Russia's influence and the need for Ukraine to maintain independence to prevent Russian domination or tensions with the West. The removal of nuclear weapons in 1996 improved relations with the West, but concerns about instability persist. Ukraine's political system is a mix of democracy, authoritarianism, and oligarchy. It has held multiple elections since gaining independence, with some international observers questioning the fairness of certain elections. Independent media in Ukraine often criticizes those in power but faces harassment from the government. The regional diversity in Ukraine has influenced its political scene, with western Ukrainians being more nationally conscious. Despite differences between regions, there has been no significant ethnic tension. Western Ukraine played a key role in the drive for independence in the 1990s but has since been politically marginalized. Leaders from eastern and southern Ukraine, where most industries are located, have gained power. People in these regions, influenced by centuries of Russification, are more skeptical of the government. People in eastern and southern Ukraine, influenced by centuries of Russification, tend to support economic and/or political union with Russia. President Kuchma wields significant authority over the government, legislative, and judicial branches, using various agencies to suppress political opponents and independent media. He is associated with wealthy businessmen who receive state concessions in exchange for support. Some oligarchs in Ukraine receive concessions from the state in exchange for political and financial support to President Kuchma. The current Prime Minister, Viktor Yanukovych, represents the powerful Donetsk oligarchic \"clan.\" Various oligarchic groups, including one led by Viktor Medvedchuk in Kiev, hold key positions in the government. Despite government efforts to control the media and administrative resources, parliamentary elections in March 2002 saw a victory for the opposition pro-reform bloc, Our Ukraine, led by Viktor Yushchenko. Our Ukraine won the largest share of the vote but fell short of a majority, holding about one-quarter of the parliament seats. The Communist Party suffered a heavy defeat, partly due to alleged fraud in the Donetsk region. Kuchma formed a shaky parliamentary majority of pro-oligarch factions by coopting members with incentives and threats. The pro-government bloc is divided due to conflicting oligarch interests. Kuchma has extremely low public support and a tarnished public image. Kuchma's public image has been tarnished by scandal, including allegations of corruption and involvement in criminal activities. The current political scene in Ukraine is focused on who will succeed Kuchma as President, with concerns about uniting on a viable candidate to defeat Yushchenko in the 2004 election. The current leadership in Ukraine fears that Yushchenko, a popular political figure, could expose corruption and lead to criminal prosecution of Kuchma and other leaders. To prevent a possible Yushchenko victory, Kuchma and his chief of staff have proposed a political reform plan to amend Ukraine's constitution and reduce the powers of the presidency. The proposed political reform plan in Ukraine aims to reduce the powers of the presidency, shorten the presidential term, and change the election process to potentially hinder Yushchenko from being elected in 2004. Despite an amendment removing the election of the president by parliament, the revised bill may still weaken the future president's powers and strengthen the government. It is uncertain if oligarchic groups can secure the necessary majority in parliament to adopt the revised bill. The Communists and Socialists condition their support on proportional representation in parliament, potentially affecting the pro-presidential camp. Despite initial beliefs, Kuchma may run for a third term after a Constitutional Court ruling, but he has stated he will retire at the end of his current term. Ukraine's economic reform efforts continue. Ukraine's economic reform efforts have seen modest successes and periods of inertia. Responsible monetary and fiscal policies have been pursued since 1994, leading to macroeconomic stability. However, this stability was partly achieved through arrears in payments, negatively impacting the budget and living standards. Real wages and GDP have declined significantly, with limited results in restructuring the economy. Privatization of small firms was completed by 1997, but further reforms are needed. Ukraine completed privatization of most small firms by the end of 1997. However, further progress is needed in agricultural reform, energy sector reform, banking sector restructuring, and improving public administration. Privatization of agriculture has advanced since 1999, but has not significantly impacted productivity. Viktor Yushchenko's election as Prime Minister in 2000 boosted economic reforms, as he had previously managed inflation and launched the hryvnya as head of the central bank. Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's leading reformer, implemented ambitious economic reforms including cuts in government spending, tax reform, and privatization of industry. His government aimed to increase transparency in taxation and government spending, leading to GDP growth in 2000 and modest wage increases. Despite being toppled in 2001, Ukraine's economic rebound continued, fueled by these reforms. Ukraine's economic rebound continued after Viktor Yushchenko's reforms, with GDP growth of 9.1% in 2001, 4.8% in 2002, and 8.5% in 2003. The government pursued effective macroeconomic policies, leading to a state budget surplus in 2003. Despite legislative successes, oligarchs' interests hinder more sweeping economic reforms. Foreign policy has seen some success. Ukraine's foreign policy has been successful in establishing good relations with the United States, Western countries, NATO, and the European Union. It has also built ties with neighboring countries and former Soviet states. However, critics point out a lack of depth in Ukraine's foreign policy, with moves lacking necessary political, economic, and military support for long-term stability and prosperity. President Kuchma describes Ukraine's foreign policy as having a \"multivector\" approach, balancing pro-Western and pro-Russian moves. Ukrainian leaders aim to maintain ties with Moscow while also engaging with the West to avoid dependency on Russia. However, scandals and lack of progress in democratization and market reform have lowered Ukraine's international standing among Western countries. Ukraine's foreign policy reflects a lack of consensus among elites on the country's identity and geopolitical orientation, leading to concerns about its relationship with Russia. Analysts worry about President Kuchma seeking support from Putin in exchange for greater Russian influence in Ukraine. Some experts are concerned about the increasing Russian investment in Ukraine, fearing that it could lead to Russian dominance politically and economically. The domestic political and economic situation in Russia may also impact Ukraine's future, with potential negative effects from Russia's shift towards a less democratic system. Gazprom, a partly state-owned natural gas giant, has pressured Ukraine to hand over control. Gazprom, a partly state-owned natural gas giant, is pressuring Ukraine to hand over control of the Ukrainian pipeline system in exchange for energy debts. U.S. policymakers are concerned about a potential Russian-Ukrainian consortium controlling the pipeline system, which could give Russia veto power. Ukraine is working to reduce its dependence on Russian oil by developing alternative supply routes from Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Ukrainian officials explored options for a new supply route from Azerbaijan and Central Asia to Western Europe, bypassing Russia. Transneft, the Russian oil pipeline company, cut off oil shipments to Odesa in response, possibly signaling displeasure with the project. Russia and TNK are pressuring Ukraine to reverse the flow of the Odesa-Brody pipeline to export Russian crude oil. A border dispute between Russia and Ukraine has escalated tensions. In October 2003, Russia began constructing a dike to connect its Taman Peninsula to the island of Tuzla in the Kerch Strait, leading to a border dispute with Ukraine. The two countries agreed to negotiate over the issue, including the use of the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait. Ukraine's oligarchs may play a role in determining the country's stance between Russia and the West. Ukrainian oligarchs are cautious about Russian influence in Ukraine due to fears of domination. EU and NATO enlargement may benefit Ukraine's economy but could lead to visa restrictions for Ukrainian workers and reduced exports to the EU. On the eve of Ukraine's independence and in the early post-independence period, U.S.-Ukrainian relations were difficult. President Bush urged Ukraine to remain within NATO enlargement, which could lead to increased Russian pressure on Ukraine. Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO may be challenged if conservative forces in Moscow gain more power. In 1991, President Bush urged Ukraine to remain within the Soviet Union, but the United States recognized Ukraine's independence after the Soviet Union's collapse. U.S.-Ukrainian ties were troubled by Ukraine's reluctance to withdraw nuclear weapons without security guarantees. A turning point was reached in January 1994 with the signing of a Trilateral Statement committing Ukraine to transfer nuclear weapons in exchange for Russian fuel and security assurances from the United States and Russia. Ukraine's initial reluctance to give up nuclear weapons may have influenced the current U.S. policy consensus on a strong relationship with Ukraine. The current U.S. policy emphasizes a strong relationship with Ukraine for Europe's stability. U.S.-Ukrainian relations faced setbacks from 2000 to 2003, with concerns about media pressure and harassment of journalists. The lowest point was in late 2002 when a conversation implicating Kuchma in a murder was authenticated. In July 2000, a conversation taped by Melychenko revealed Kuchma's approval for the sale of Kolchuga radar systems to Iraq, violating a U.N. arms embargo. A 2002 fact-finding mission found Kiev evasive about the sale, with no clear proof it occurred. Despite setbacks, the U.S. maintained interest in Ukraine's development as a democratic state integrated into Euro-Atlantic institutions. The United States has improved ties with Ukraine through various collaborations, including Ukraine's involvement in the coalition during the Iraq war. Ukraine deployed troops for peacekeeping efforts in Iraq and expressed interest in NATO membership. Cooperation between the US and Ukraine aims to strengthen ties between Ukraine and NATO. The NATO-Ukraine Action Plan, established in November 2002, outlines commitments for Ukraine to achieve political, economic, and military reforms. While not guaranteeing NATO membership, the US supports Ukraine's potential candidacy if reform milestones are met. Analysts predict NATO enlargement may not occur until 2007. Ukraine's armed forces require urgent reforms to meet potential NATO membership criteria. The US is assisting Ukraine in preparing for World Trade Organization membership, facing obstacles from rural parliament members and oligarchs. Ukraine faces obstacles to WTO membership from resistance in parliament and oligarchs. Sanctions were imposed by the FATF in 2003 for money laundering issues, lifted in 2003 after passing anti-money laundering laws. US aid supports democracy, economic reform, and nuclear disarmament in Ukraine. The United States has provided aid to Ukraine for various purposes including destroying nuclear weapons, preventing technology proliferation, dealing with the Chernobyl nuclear accident consequences, promoting nuclear safety, participating in NATO exercises, and supporting Ukrainian forces in Iraq. However, U.S. aid to Ukraine has been reduced in recent years. In FY2005, the Administration proposed $79.5 million in assistance for political and economic reform in Ukraine. In FY2003 and FY2004, the United States provided significant financial support for political and economic reform in Ukraine. The Administration proposed an increase in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) aid for Ukraine in FY2005. Despite reductions in Foreign Support Act (FSA) funding, U.S. aid to Ukraine has shown successes in security and nuclear safety. The rationale for the funding cuts includes Ukraine's progress in reform and competing priorities such as Iraq reconstruction and counterterrorism efforts. U.S. aid to Ukraine has shown successes in security and nuclear safety, including the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, cooperation in preventing the transfer of nuclear technologies, and the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. However, there have been frustrations with Ukraine's slow economic reforms and corruption issues, as well as concerns about democratic development and treatment of independent media and NGOs. The US Congress has consistently supported Ukraine by providing aid for various humanitarian issues such as Chernobyl, HIV/AIDS, and trafficking in women. Ukraine has been a significant recipient of US aid due to its perceived strategic importance. The US Congress has supported Ukraine due to its strategic importance in Europe and the pro-Western foreign policy. Congressional interest is also influenced by Ukrainian-Americans who lobby and have members in Congress, as well as the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus promoting awareness of Ukrainian issues. Congressional attitudes toward Ukraine have been marked by disappointment due to slow progress in economic reform and rampant corruption. Concerns have also been raised about the state of democracy in Ukraine, especially after the Gongadze murder and allegations of corruption and election manipulation. Certification provisions were added to U.S. aid to Ukraine in response to American businessmen being cheated by their Ukrainian partners. The Secretary of State certified progress in resolving issues in Ukraine, but criticized the pace of reform. Certification process was dropped in 1999 as progress was made on individual cases. Congress switched to \"soft\" earmarks for Ukraine in FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002. The FY2002 bill required a report on the progress in investigating the murder of Ukrainian journalists. In FY2003, Congress did not earmark an overall figure for Ukraine, but specified funds for nuclear safety. The FY2004 omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 108-199) allocated $20 million for nuclear safety and $1.5 million for mine safety in Ukraine. Aid to Ukraine was contingent on the Secretary of State certifying no arms deliveries to Iraq since 2000. However, certain exceptions were made for aid related to infectious diseases, nuclear safety, trafficking prevention, and denuclearization. The bill did not specify total aid to Ukraine but included $19 million for nuclear reactor safety and $1.5 million for mine safety. Ukraine's behavior raised concerns for U.S. policy, particularly regarding its role in Iraq and other areas. The United States is concerned about Ukraine's behavior, including the possible involvement of President Kuchma in the Kolchuga affair. There are worries that warming ties between the two countries could legitimize the Kuchma regime. The US could influence the succession process by making it clear that unconstitutional means to keep Kuchma in power would make him illegitimate in the eyes of Western countries. Another issue is how to handle the Ukrainian opposition. The United States is considering how to handle the Ukrainian opposition, whether to support Yushchenko and reach out to oligarchs. Some analysts suggest avoiding direct involvement in political conflicts and emphasizing support for the rule of law and fair elections. Some pro-reform groups in Ukraine are interested in developing the rule of law to protect their property. US policymakers could encourage a smooth transition to a more democratic future post-Kuchma. Experts emphasize that Ukraine's problems are fundamental and not solely due to individual leaders. They recommend focusing on building political, economic, and social infrastructure for long-term democracy, rule of law, and economic reform through support for independent media, think tanks, NGOs, and small businesses. Many pro-reform groups in Ukraine seek aid in the form of direct grants to bolster sovereignty and independence, promote ties with the West, and address economic challenges like energy dependency on Russia. US policymakers face obstacles in achieving these goals due to planned decreases in aid to Ukraine. Solutions could involve diversifying Ukraine's energy sources through new pipelines from the Caspian Sea region. Ukraine aims to diversify energy sources with pipelines from the Caspian Sea region, upgrade current pipelines, and reform the energy sector. Balancing investments from the West and Russia is crucial, but Western firms demand transparency, hindering investment. The US government can encourage transparency and help US firms identify opportunities in Ukraine. Resistance from rural parliament members and oligarchs slows progress on Ukraine's World Trade Organization membership. Ukraine's desire to join NATO and deploy forces to Iraq could lead to increased cooperation in the security sphere. The United States and other NATO countries can provide military aid to help Ukraine address its military reform needs and improve living standards. This assistance could also enhance Ukraine's prestige in society."
