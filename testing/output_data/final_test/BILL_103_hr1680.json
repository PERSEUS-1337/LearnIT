The Congress finds a severe shortage of capital for investment in the US minority business marketplace, hindering entrepreneurship, employment, and economic development. Targeted venture capital resources are needed to stimulate economic growth, but existing federal incentives are insufficient. Fully utilizing federally regulated specialized small business investment companies is crucial to address the capital gap. The Act aims to authorize a Federal tax credit for investment in qualified minority fund interests, increase venture capital availability for minority small businesses, strengthen existing minority venture capital institutions, and support minority enterprises. The Act aims to support minority enterprise and economic development, increase minority entrepreneurship and employment, and enhance opportunities for minority participation in the free enterprise system. The Act introduces incentives for investments in minority venture capital funds through new provisions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
