    "content": "This report summarizes supplemental appropriations legislation enacted since FY2000 for major disasters under the Stafford Act. Funds were provided by Congress for disaster relief, federal facility repair, and hazard mitigation. Assistance for agricultural disasters, counterterrorism, law enforcement, and national security are not included. Specific purposes for the funds may be unclear in some cases. The report summarizes supplemental appropriations legislation enacted since FY2000 for major disasters under the Stafford Act. Federal assistance is contingent on the President issuing an emergency or major disaster declaration, with FEMA providing disaster relief through its Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The DRF is funded annually and used for ongoing recovery projects, current emergency requirements, and future incidents. FEMA also utilizes \"Mission Assignments\" to task and reimburse other federal entities for direct assistance during emergencies and disasters. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded annually and carries over unused funds to the next fiscal year. Congress provides additional funding through annual and supplemental appropriations when the DRF balance is low. The President can request supplemental appropriations from Congress during catastrophic incidents. FEMA receives supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance, including reimbursing Mission Assignments and direct funding to agencies like the Small Business Administration and Department of Agriculture for large-scale incidents like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Congress has initiated supplemental appropriations without a formal request from the Administration, such as providing additional assistance for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2007 and adding DRF supplemental funding in 2008 for the Midwest Flooding and Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. Funding for these appropriations was based on estimates provided to Congress by FEMA and other federal agencies. Supplemental appropriations are based on estimates provided to Congress by FEMA and other federal entities involved in response and recovery efforts. Congress uses emergency designations to exempt provisions from budget enforcement procedures due to concerns over the federal deficit and debt. The Budget Control Act includes measures to limit federal spending, such as placing caps on discretionary spending and implementing sequestration if caps are exceeded. Special accommodations are included in the BCA to address the unpredictable nature of disasters. The Budget Control Act (BCA) redefined \"disaster relief\" as federal government assistance for major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. Funding for disaster relief is adjusted by increasing discretionary spending caps based on a 10-year rolling average of federal spending on disaster relief. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calculates the adjusted average annually to set the allowable cap adjustment for disaster relief. These calculations are included in the final sequestration report. The Budget Control Act (BCA) redefined \"disaster relief\" as federal government assistance for major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. Congress has provided more funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) through annual appropriations in recent years. The BCA's cap adjustments have influenced Congress to rely more on annual appropriations for disaster assistance. The cap is calculated in nominal dollars and does not adjust for inflation, which may become more significant over time. The influence of the BCA on disaster assistance is discussed further in the report. The curr_chunk provides a summary of emergency supplemental appropriations legislation enacted since 2000, focusing on disaster relief and assistance. It excludes funds used for research, oversight, administrative costs, counterterrorism, law enforcement, and national security appropriations. The report does not account for rescissions approved by Congress after funds have been appropriated for disaster assistance. Supplemental appropriations have generally been enacted as stand-alone legislation, with some instances of disaster assistance funding being included. Supplemental appropriations for disaster relief have been enacted since 2000, providing funding for various incidents rather than just major disasters like Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy. These funds are allocated to federal agencies such as FEMA or HUD based on the specific needs of each disaster. Since FY2000, $265 billion has been allocated for disaster relief, with FEMA receiving nearly 50% of the total amount. Eight agencies account for 96% of the total appropriation, with P.L. 113-2 providing $50.3 billion for Hurricane Sandy response and P.L. 112-77 providing an additional $8.1 billion for disaster assistance. During the 111th Congress, P.L. 111-212 allocated $5.5 billion for disaster relief, with $5.1 billion for the DRF. President George W. Bush signed four measures during the 110th Congress, providing $44.0 billion in supplemental appropriations for disaster relief. During the 110th Congress, $44.0 billion was allocated for disaster relief, with specific amounts designated for Hurricane Katrina recovery and other major disasters. An appropriation of $21.6 billion was allocated for emergency and disaster relief in P.L. 110-329, including funds for disasters in 2005 and 2008 such as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, wildfires in California, and Midwest floods. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund received $6.5 billion for disaster relief and long-term recovery. Other funding included $910 million for wildfire suppression and $100 million for the American Red Cross for disaster relief expenses in 2008. Congress has raised concerns about the increasing costs and reliance on disaster relief funding. Some in Congress are questioning the rising costs and reliance on supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance, citing concerns about the federal deficit and debt. The amount of funding provided to states and localities for disaster assistance has drawn increased congressional attention as concerns over the budget deficit and national debt have grown. While funds have been reallocated at times for disaster-related assistance, supplemental funding is not always fully offset, leading to debates about its frequency of use. The number and amount of supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance from FY2000 to FY2013 have varied. The BCA's allowable adjustment provision may have reduced the need for supplemental appropriations by encouraging larger annual appropriations for the DRF. The Administration now uses a 10-year rolling average to formulate the budget request for the DRF, which may provide a more accurate estimate for disaster costs. The number and amount of supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance have varied from FY2000 to FY2013. The Budget Control Act (BCA) may have reduced the need for supplemental appropriations by encouraging larger annual appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Arguments against relying on supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance include the potential for lawmakers to circumvent budgetary enforcement mechanisms. Supplemental appropriations for disasters in Congress are often expedited, limiting time for assessment and scrutiny. High funding levels and unrelated provisions may slow down federal disaster assistance delivery. Arguments for supplemental disaster assistance cite the unpredictability of disasters. The President can unilaterally determine federal disaster assistance after a major incident, but Congress controls spending through supplemental appropriations. Large disaster relief fund balances may be transferred or rescinded for other needs, potentially causing issues if a disaster occurs after funds are moved. Supplemental appropriations for disasters can be sized according to the needs of the actual incident. Some suggest offsetting supplemental funding to reduce the need for additional appropriations. The debate over using offsets for disaster relief has intensified due to the federal budget deficit and national debt. Legislative attempts have been made to offset the costs of disaster assistance due to the federal budget deficit and national debt. For example, a provision in H.R. 2017 proposed transferring $1 billion from the Department of Energy to the Department of Homeland Security for disaster relief. Legislative attempts have been made to offset the costs of disaster assistance by proposing amendments to allocate funds from different departments. Proponents argue that offsets help control spending, while opponents believe they politicize disaster assistance and may delay aid delivery. One argument against relying solely on offsets to limit federal spending on disaster assistance is that it may not fully cover the costs of large-scale disasters like the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 and 2008 and Hurricane Sandy, which cost the government billions. Critics suggest that the size of the offset could negatively impact other parts of the federal budget. The Stafford Act allows the President to issue major disaster declarations, providing federal assistance for infrastructure repair after natural or man-made incidents. The number of major disaster declarations has steadily increased over time, with an average of 54 declarations issued from 1990 to 2013. In 2011 alone, there were 99 incidents declared as major disasters. This increase in declarations has led to a rise in federal spending for disaster assistance. In 2011, there were 99 major disaster declarations, leading to increased federal spending on disaster assistance. Critics suggest reforming the declaration process to reduce the number of declarations for marginal incidents that could be handled by states. Some argue for shifting more responsibility for recovery costs to the state or private sector, while others believe federal relief for disaster victims is essential. Providing disaster assistance is crucial for the federal government despite concerns over costs. Advocates argue that the number of declarations and associated costs are justified to help states and regions recover economically. They also point out that the increasing costs of disasters are expected due to severe weather patterns and population growth. Proposed changes to the Stafford Act aim to limit declarations and reduce federal spending on disaster assistance. Repealing Section 320 of the Stafford Act would allow for more predictable criteria for federal assistance eligibility. Amending Section 404 could tie mitigation assistance to state codes, incentivizing mitigation efforts. This could lead to a tiered federal cost-share system based on mitigation standards met by states. The amendment to the Stafford Act may incentivize mitigation work by states, potentially reducing damages and federal assistance needs. It could also establish corollary programs at the state level to increase capacity for handling incidents without federal aid. The amendment could be phased in over time to allow states to adjust to the changes. The Stafford Act could be amended to discontinue snow removal assistance unless directed by Congress, potentially reducing federal disaster costs by shifting more of the financial burden to states. This adjustment could be phased in over time to allow states to adapt. The Stafford Act could be amended to reduce federal disaster costs by shifting more financial burden to states, potentially through a 50% matching requirement for hurricane damages. Federal assistance for emergency declarations could be in the form of loans, such as FEMA's Community Disaster Loan program. States could qualify for larger federal shares or lower interest rates by undertaking preparedness and mitigation measures. Financial assistance for disaster relief from the federal government has increased since the 1950s. The federal government's increased involvement in disaster relief has raised questions about the level of assistance provided to states and localities. Concerns include whether states' fiscal capabilities are considered in federal disaster assistance and whether there should be thresholds and maximums for assistance. Potential changes could include requiring a certain level of costs before federal funding is available and capping the total amount of federal relief for an event. Some question if federal assistance creates a disincentive for states to prepare for disasters, leading to underfunded mitigation measures. Others argue that the federal government's role is to help states in times of crisis. The federal government's role is to assist states and localities in times of crisis by providing necessary funding. Limiting or withholding funding could lead to economic hardships for the region and state, with potential negative consequences for the national economy."
