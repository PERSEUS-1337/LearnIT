    "content": "President Obama's FY2015 budget includes a proposal to add a $602 million per year \"Pathways to Jobs\" fund to the TANF block grant. This fund would finance subsidized employment programs for low-income individuals, including parents, guardians, and youth. Eligible individuals must be TANF cash assistance recipients or have incomes below 200% of the poverty line. The program would subsidize up to 100% of employment costs for the first 90 days and partially thereafter. To fund this initiative, the budget suggests ending the current TANF contingency fund. The \"Pathways to Jobs\" proposal aims to create subsidized employment programs for low-income individuals, funded by a $602 million per year addition to the TANF block grant. These programs would pay all or part of the wages for participants, reducing the cost for employers. The proposal would target TANF cash assistance recipients or those with incomes below 200% of the poverty line. Subsidized employment programs historically provided public service jobs during times of high unemployment, such as the Great Depression and recessions. These programs, like the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conversation Corps, aimed to offer work and income. Public service jobs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act addressed cyclical unemployment and helped the economically disadvantaged. The program ended in 1981, and subsidized employment was mainly focused on summer youth employment until the 2007-2009 recession. During the 2007-2009 recession, subsidized employment focused on summer youth employment and transitional jobs for \"hard-to-serve\" adults. Transitional jobs are typically in state or local governments or the nonprofit sector, with limited funding available. In FY2011, $40 million was allocated for the Department of Labor's enhanced transitional jobs program. Wage subsidies, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit, have been crucial in supporting low-income families since the 1990s. The curr_chunk discusses refundable tax credits designed to incentivize low-wage parents to work, with limited focus on reducing costs for employers hiring from low-income families. The Department of Health and Human Services is conducting an experiment on subsidized jobs programs, while the Department of Labor is evaluating \"enhanced\" programs. The Department of Labor is evaluating \"enhanced\" transitional jobs programs and states can operate pilot work programs in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with subsidized employment. TANF block grants finance cash assistance for needy families and a wide range of services to address child poverty, including subsidizing employment for certain populations. States have the authority to use TANF funds for employment subsidies as long as it aligns with TANF goals. States have broad latitude in designing their TANF programs, including subsidized employment. However, they must address potential displacement of regular workers by TANF assistance recipients. Prohibited actions include placing a TANF recipient in a job where someone is on layoff or has been fired for the purpose of replacement. States must have procedures to handle complaints of violations. Subsidized employment has been underutilized in TANF until FY2010. Expenditures on wage subsidies for TANF spiked to over $1 billion in FY2010 in response to the 2007-2009 recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created the Emergency Contingency Fund within TANF to finance subsidized employment programs. Unlike other TANF grants, the ECF funded only basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term aid, and subsidized employment. The Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) provided $5 billion in extra funds for TANF activities, with $1.3 billion allocated to subsidized employment. This funding supported 280,000 job slots, mainly for needy parents and youth. The ECF was a response to the 2007-2009 recession, allowing states to quickly implement subsidized employment programs without evaluation provisions. States rapidly implemented subsidized employment programs in response to ECF funding, financing jobs in the private sector. The ECF served a broader population than just those eligible for TANF cash assistance, with individuals in subsidized jobs instead of receiving cash assistance. To attract private sector employers, states selected \"work-ready\" individuals for subsidized jobs to meet work participation standards under TANF. The percentage of TANF cash assistance adults engaged in subsidized employment has been relatively low, with a spike in FY2010 reaching only 1.6%. This indicates that many of these jobs went to individuals not on the cash assistance rolls. The Administration's proposal to create a TANF fund for subsidized employment raises policy considerations regarding the program's ability to achieve goals like job creation, income support, and long-term employability. Research is available to assess the initiative's potential success. Additionally, there are concerns about potential trade-offs in ending the current law contingency fund to offset costs. The subsidized employment program aims to create jobs during economic downturns by offsetting costs through ending the current TANF contingency fund. Research suggests that some new jobs are created, but it is unclear if these jobs would have existed without the program. The impact of public service employment funds on state and local employment is uncertain. Employer tax credits for hiring disadvantaged workers have low participation rates among employers, but less targeted programs may generate more interest. The 1996 welfare reform law aimed to have assistance recipients work and end long-term dependency on public benefits. Subsidized jobs offer income opportunities to further this goal, with evaluations of past programs showing positive outcomes. The evaluations of subsidized employment programs show that they raise the earned income of participants and are effective in employing those who would otherwise not be employed. While there is mixed evidence on whether these programs increase long-term employability, past research suggests that subsidized employment can be an effective strategy for providing income support through work. The President's FY2015 budget proposal aims to create the \"Pathways to Jobs\" fund by eliminating the current TANF contingency fund, established in response to the 1996 welfare law. Concerns arose due to the fixed basic TANF block grant, which led to the creation of a separate $2 billion fund to provide extra TANF funding during economic downturns. The TANF contingency fund, established in response to the 1996 welfare law, provided extra funding during economic downturns. However, the fund was not often used before FY2008 and grants did not increase with the unemployment rate during the 2001 recession. Beginning in 2008, grants did increase with the more severe recession of 2007-2009, leading to the exhaustion of the $2 billion fund in early FY2010. The TANF contingency fund, established in response to the 1996 welfare law, provided extra funding during economic downturns. The ECF provided the bulk of extra TANF funding in response to the recent severe recession, but expired in FY2010. Congress has provided new appropriations for the regular contingency fund from FY2011 to FY2014. Despite declining unemployment rates, the CBO baseline assumes that TANF contingency fund grants will remain at their current level. In FY2014, 20 states drew funds from the TANF contingency fund, but its use for subsidized employment could leave TANF without a potential source in the future. The TANF contingency fund provided extra funding during economic downturns, with the ECF being the main source during the recent recession. States maintained TANF benefits when the ECF was active, but reduced benefits when it expired in FY2010. Congress could redesign the fund to be more responsive to economic changes, providing higher funding during recessions. This would help TANF better respond to future economic challenges. The TANF program could benefit from a fund to provide extra grants during recessions, but developing such a fund poses challenges. Subsidized employment programs historically focused on public sector jobs for the economically disadvantaged, but large-scale public service employment ended in 1981. The TANF ECF-funded subsidized jobs have renewed interest in government funds for employing the economically disadvantaged. The TANF ECF-funded subsidized jobs program aimed to help economically disadvantaged parents work, but research on its long-term impacts is mixed. Comparisons with other policies like education and training have not been done yet. Dan Bloom. Transitional Jobs: Background, Program Models, and Evaluation Evidence. MDRC. February 2010."
