    "content": "The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) consists of three parts. The first part, Title III, prohibits unauthorized interception of communications and allows for interceptions for law enforcement purposes. The second part, the Stored Communications Act, focuses on privacy of stored electronic communications. The third part establishes procedures for governmental use of pen registers and trap and trace devices for law enforcement and foreign intelligence investigations. The common law prohibition of eavesdropping was not heavily enforced in early American law but resurfaced with the invention of the telegraph and telephone. State laws outlawed wiretapping to preserve privacy, and Congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute during World War I. By the time of the Olmstead Supreme Court decision, most states had banned wiretapping. At least forty-one states had banned wiretapping or disclosing telephone and telegraph messages. Olmstead, a bootlegger, challenged his Prohibition Act conviction due to a federal wiretap. The Supreme Court rejected his Fourth Amendment challenge, stating there was no official search or seizure. Chief Justice Taft highlighted that Congress could provide protection beyond what the Constitution did, as seen in the 1934 Communications Act expanding on the Radio Act's restrictions. The Federal Communications Act prohibited wiretapping but did not address the use of machines for recording face-to-face conversations. This led to an increase in cases using Fourth Amendment arguments, gradually eroding the principles established in the Olmstead case. Initially, the Court applied Olmstead's principles to electronic eavesdropping cases, such as using a dictaphone to secretly overhear conversations. The Fourth Amendment did not cover situations where there was no physical trespass, such as secretly recording a conversation in a public area. However, it did apply when there was a physical intrusion onto private property, like driving a \"spike mike\" into a wall to listen to a conversation. The Court faced a technical issue in determining if the spike mike had crossed the property line. The Court found that the government's intrusion into the defendant's townhouse violated the Fourth Amendment by invading the privacy of the home. The cases focused on warrantless trespass onto private property for searches, including the overhearing of conversations, expanding the Fourth Amendment's protection beyond traditional tangible items to include intangible conversations. In Katz v. United States, the Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment protects against electronic surveillance without a warrant, expanding privacy rights beyond physical trespass. The Court rejected the constitutional adequacy of a state statutory scheme for wiretapping in Berger v. New York, citing deficiencies such as lack of specific descriptions, limitations on searches, and prompt execution of orders. Berger helped persuade Congress to enact Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, a wiretapping statute with strict limitations. Another Supreme Court case led Congress to add a judicially supervised procedure for wiretapping in foreign intelligence gathering. Congress had questioned the President's inherent powers to authorize wiretaps without judicial approval in national security cases, which was then excluded from the Title III scheme. After the Court's ruling on warrantless electronic eavesdropping, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Security Act of 1978 (FISA) to enhance foreign intelligence gathering authority. The FISA allows judicial review and authorization of surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Supreme Court cases like United States v. Miller and Smith v. Maryland also influenced federal law development in this area. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was enacted in 1986, consisting of three parts: a revised Title III, the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and provisions for pen registers and trap and trace devices. Congress has made adjustments to ECPA and the Foreign Intelligence Security Act (FISA) over the years, sometimes in the interest of greater privacy and sometimes for more effective surveillance. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was enacted in 1986 to regulate wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping. It has been amended over the years to balance privacy concerns with law enforcement and intelligence gathering needs. Key enactments include the USA PATRIOT Act, the Intelligence Authorization Act, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act of 2008. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits illegal wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, covering interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications without authorization. This ban applies to individuals, employees, or agents of the United States or any State, with exceptions such as consent from one party or interception in compliance with authorized laws. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits illegal wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, covering interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications without authorization. Conduct violating Title III must be intentional, with specific jurisdictional circumstances outlined. Congress included interception bars to ensure a connection to interstate or foreign commerce. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits illegal wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, covering interception of various communications. The Justice Department uses specific provisions to prosecute different types of interceptions, with interception defined as acquiring communication contents through electronic devices. Interception is not limited to where the communication is captured but also includes where it begins, is transmitted, or received. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) expanded the definition of \"interception\" to include any form of acquiring communication, not just aural acquisitions. This complicates determining which ECPA provisions govern the legality of capturing communication information. There is debate over when an interception occurs, whether it involves surreptitious acquisition during transmission or at any point before. The USA PATRIOT Act clarified the legal uncertainty surrounding voice mail by excluding it from wiretap coverage and adding it to stored communications coverage. Title III interceptions now focus on capturing the content of communication, including post-cut-through dialed digits. Contemporary telephone communications now transmit both non-content and content, requiring authorities to rely on a Title III wiretap order rather than a pen register/trap and trace order. The term \"interceptions\" includes computers but not hearing aids or extension telephones in normal use. The question of whether a device still constitutes an interception device for Title III and state laws when used in the ordinary course of business or law enforcement duties is complex. The exemption for business purposes requires a legitimate reason, routine monitoring, and employee notification. Law enforcement officials have an exception for routine phone line recording. Title III exempts certain monitoring for administrative purposes, not investigative ones, which must be justified by a valid law enforcement concern. Interception is only a violation if it involves protected communication types like telephone, face-to-face, or electronic. Silent video surveillance is covered, but not all wire, oral, or electronic communications. \"Oral communications\" are face-to-face conversations with privacy expectations, \"wire communications\" involve voice, and \"electronic communications\" include radio and data, excluding some radio transmissions. Title III covers radio and data transmissions, excluding some easily captured radio transmissions. The statute condemns attempted wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, but consent interceptions have a long history and have been upheld by the Supreme Court against Fourth Amendment challenges. The argument for consent interceptions is based on the idea that a speaker takes the risk of being overheard by others, regardless of whether the conversation is recorded or transmitted. Wiretapping with consent of at least one party is not illegal under federal law, but states may have different regulations. Consent can be explicit or implicit, such as using someone else's phone with their permission. Using someone else's phone with their permission implies implicit consent to interception, but subscriber consent alone is not enough to protect privacy. Consent must be freely given, not coerced, and not for criminal or tortious purposes. Some state laws do not recognize one-party consent exceptions, but federal law allows interception as long as it is not for criminal or tortious purposes. ECPA dropped the reference to injurious purposes for fear of threatening First Amendment values. Radio communications intended for public hearing are exempt, including commercial broadcasts and distress signals. Government officials have exemptions for executing eavesdropping orders and emergency situations. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for interception of communications under various authorities, including Title III, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices. It also mentions exemptions for communication service providers to improve service, prevent fraud, assist officials with interception orders, and for regulatory activities. Some courts recognize a \"vicarious consent\" exception for custodial parents to record conversations of their minor children for protection. Title III allows exemptions for interception of communications, with some federal courts allowing one spouse to wiretap the other. The law prohibits disclosing unlawfully intercepted information, subjecting violators to sanctions. The defendant must have known about the unlawful interception of information, with exceptions for matters of public concern under the First Amendment. Congress did not intend to punish the disclosure of intercepted information that is public knowledge. Information obtained through authorized electronic eavesdropping under Title III can be used for law enforcement and testimonial purposes. Title III of the federal law prohibits the disclosure of intercepted communications derived from lawful police wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping. It is a crime to disclose such information with the intent to obstruct criminal justice, knowing that it was obtained through interception. The disclosure of intercepted communications from lawful wiretapping for criminal investigation purposes is prohibited under federal law. Offenders who disclose such information with the intent to obstruct justice face criminal and civil liability similar to illegal wiretapping. This prohibition applies to information obtained from both federal and state court-ordered wiretaps. The courts may find that Congress would have been clearer if it intended to criminalize obstructing state criminal prosecutions by disclosing information from state wiretaps. A prohibition on disclosing electronic communications in transmission has exemptions for consent, court-approved interceptions, transmission necessity, and inadvertent discovery of crime-related information. Violators could face criminal and civil liability under federal law. The prohibition on using information obtained from illegal wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping is subject to civil liability under federal law. Case law on this prohibition is limited, and it is often invoked alongside the prohibition on disclosing such information. The two prohibitions are parallel, treated similarly for law enforcement purposes. The criminal and civil liability for unlawful use of intercepted communications is the same as for unlawful disclosure or interception. Possession and trafficking of wiretapping devices have stricter regulations than the actual offense. Exemptions exist for service providers and government officials, but not for private individuals using equipment for surreptitious purposes. Section 2512 prohibits the use of equipment designed for surreptitious interception of communications. Inoperable equipment cannot be considered for conviction under this section. The prohibitions include sending or carrying devices for interception purposes, as well as manufacturing, assembling, possessing, or selling such devices. Section 2512 prohibits the use of devices designed for covert interception of communications, including advertising such devices in publications or electronically. Section 2512 prohibits the use of devices designed for covert interception of communications, including advertising such devices in publications or electronically. Violators can face imprisonment for up to five years and/or fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). The legislative history mentions various items considered primarily useful for surreptitious interception, such as martini olive transmitters and disguised microphones. The legality of equipment for unauthorized reception of scrambled satellite TV signals under \u00a72512 has been settled, with possession not leading to a private cause of action. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows government access to communications under judicial supervision. Title III exempts law enforcement from interception prohibitions in certain circumstances. A senior Justice Department official must approve wiretap applications for federal criminal investigations based on probable cause. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows government access to communications under judicial supervision, with wiretap applications for federal criminal investigations requiring approval based on probable cause. The procedure for wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping at the federal level is available for a long list of federal crimes, while at the state level, it is based on probable cause to produce evidence of state felony offenses. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows government access to communications under judicial supervision for federal criminal investigations involving serious crimes. State applications for wiretapping must meet federal requirements and include detailed information about the crime, location, communications to be intercepted, and alternative investigative techniques. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows government access to communications under judicial supervision for federal criminal investigations involving serious crimes. State applications for wiretapping must meet federal requirements and include detailed information about the crime, location, communications to be intercepted, and alternative investigative techniques. Before issuing an order authorizing interception, the court must find probable cause and require specific information such as the period of interception, history of previous applications, and results to date. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows government access to communications under judicial supervision for federal criminal investigations involving serious crimes. State applications for wiretapping must meet federal requirements and include detailed information about the crime, location, communications to be intercepted, and alternative investigative techniques. Subsections 2518(4) and (5) of the ECPA demand that any interception order include specific details such as the identity of persons involved, nature and location of facilities, type of communication to be intercepted, and the period of interception. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows government access to communications under judicial supervision for federal criminal investigations involving serious crimes. State applications for wiretapping must meet federal requirements and include detailed information about the crime, location, communications to be intercepted, and alternative investigative techniques. The interception order must include specific details such as the identity of persons involved, nature and location of facilities, type of communication to be intercepted, and the period of interception. The court orders for interception remain in effect for up to 30 days, with the possibility of extensions granted by the court. Compliance with procedures may be postponed briefly in emergency cases involving organized crime or national security threats. Title III of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows for intercepted communications to be recorded and evidence secured under seal. Those whose communications are intercepted must be notified within 90 days of the order expiration. Information derived from court-ordered interceptions can be disclosed for official purposes by law enforcement officials, federal intelligence officers, and government officials for matters involving foreign intelligence or hostile acts. Title III of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows for intercepted communications to be recorded and evidence secured under seal. It permits witnesses in federal or state proceedings to disclose the results of a Title III tap, as long as the communication is not privileged. Authorities can intercept communications with the consent of one party, either explicitly or implicitly given. For example, using a recorded telephone with the subscriber's knowledge implies consent. Subscriber consent alone is not enough, as it is the parties to the conversation whose privacy is protected. The \"computer trespasser\" justification in paragraph 2511(2)(i) allows for governmental interception of electronic communications to track intruders using others' computer systems. Violation of Title III can result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. The penalties for unlawful interception of electronic communications under Title III can result in fines of up to $500,000 for organizations. Unauthorized interceptions are broadly prohibited, with exceptions for unscrambled transmissions. Equipment used for wiretapping can be confiscated by the United States. Title III provides defenses to criminal liability based on good faith and allows victims to seek equitable relief, damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs. Federal courts have varying opinions on awarding damages and fees, with some considering them mandatory. Government entities other than the United States can be held liable for violations, and law enforcement officers have qualified immunity. The good faith defense under section 2520 is typically unsuccessful for non-government officials. The 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act limits legal action against those assisting the government with electronic surveillance. The USA PATRIOT Act allows lawsuits against the United States for violations, with damages of $10,000 or actual damages awarded to successful plaintiffs. Disciplinary action can be taken for intentional misconduct by federal officers. The federal agency or department may face disciplinary action for not explaining to the Inspector General's office if it declines to take action. The American Bar Association previously considered it unethical for attorneys to intercept or record conversations without consent from all parties involved. State regulatory authorities have varied reactions to this issue, with some agreeing with the ABA's former stance and others expanding the circumstances under which recording is permissible. The ABA has since changed its position on this matter. Attorneys who engage in unlawful wiretapping or electronic eavesdropping are still subject to professional discipline in all jurisdictions. Courts and bar associations have different responses to lawful wiretapping by lawyers following the ABA's change in stance. The federal wiretap statute prohibits disclosure, making information inadmissible in court if obtained through unlawful interception or improper court orders. Individuals can challenge evidence obtained through illegal interceptions using the exclusionary rule under 18 U.S.C. 2518(10)(a), which bars admission if the interception was unlawful or not authorized properly. Technical noncompliance is insufficient; the defect must significantly undermine court-supervised interception. The admissibility of intercepted conversations raises questions regarding legality, with some courts allowing the use of unlawfully obtained evidence for impeachment. Privately recorded conversations are less likely to be admissible compared to those recorded by government officials. Admissibility requires showing that the tapes meet certain prerequisites. The admissibility of intercepted conversations requires showing that the tapes are accurate, authentic, and trustworthy. This includes proving the recording device's capability, operator competence, authenticity, preservation, speaker identification, and voluntary conversation. Title III was originally inadequate in protecting the privacy of modern communications vulnerable to intrusion. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, providing some protection similar to that for telephone conversations. It includes general and specific prohibitions on accessing electronic communication services without authorization. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, similar to protection for telephone conversations. It includes prohibitions on accessing electronic communication services without authorization, specifically addressing intentional violations involving obtaining, altering, or preventing access to wire or electronic communications in electronic storage. The offense requires unauthorized or excessive access to a service facility and consequences such as acquisition, alteration, or denial of access to electronic communications. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, similar to telephone conversation protection. It includes prohibitions on accessing electronic communication services without authorization, specifically addressing intentional violations involving obtaining, altering, or preventing access to wire or electronic communications in electronic storage. The section only protects communications while \"in electronic storage\" in a facility through which electronic communications service is provided. \"Electronic storage\" is defined to encompass temporary, intermediate storage incidental to transmission as well as backup storage. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, specifically addressing intentional violations involving obtaining, altering, or preventing access to wire or electronic communications in electronic storage. Section 2701's prohibitions have exceptions and defenses, including conduct authorized by service providers or users, and good faith reliance on court warrants or orders. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, with exceptions and defenses including conduct authorized by service providers or users, and good faith reliance on court warrants or orders. Section 2707(e) provides immunity from civil or criminal action for service providers who preserve evidence, respond to investigative requests, or act in accordance with court orders or statutory authorization. The Stored Communications Act prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications, with exceptions and defenses including conduct authorized by service providers or users, and good faith reliance on court warrants or orders. Section 2707(e) provides immunity from civil or criminal action for service providers who preserve evidence, respond to investigative requests, or act in accordance with court orders or statutory authorization. Section 2702 of the Act bans the disclosure of electronic communication content and related records by service providers, requiring them to keep such information confidential. Section 2702 of the Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and related records, requiring them to keep such information confidential. Exceptions allow disclosure to addressees, intended recipients, or agents, but providers must maintain confidentiality to government entities. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and related records, except in specific circumstances such as with lawful consent or for protection of provider property. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and related records, except in specific circumstances such as with lawful consent or for protection of provider property. Exceptions include disclosure to law enforcement agencies if the content appears to pertain to a crime, and to government entities in emergencies involving danger of death or serious injury. The Ninth Circuit noted that RCS providers have more leeway in disclosure compared to ECS providers. The Stored Communications Act prohibits service providers from disclosing electronic communication content and related records, except in specific circumstances. The service provider violated the Act by supplying the Ontario Police Department with Sergeant Quon's pager messages. Law enforcement access to stored communications and transactional records is less demanding than under Title III. The Stored Communications Act provides two primary avenues for law enforcement access: permissible provider disclosure and required provider access. The Stored Communications Act allows ECS and RCS providers to disclose customer communication content to law enforcement in case of inadvertent discovery of crime-related information or in emergency situations. Government entities, including federal, state, and local agencies, qualify for disclosure. Section 2702 authorizes voluntary disclosure, while section 2703 outlines when providers may be required to disclose communication content and records. The Stored Communications Act requires government entities to obtain a search warrant to access electronic communications stored for more than 180 days. For communications stored less than 180 days, a warrant, subpoena, or court order can be used. Notice is typically given to the individual whose communication is disclosed, unless delayed notification is authorized by the court. The Stored Communications Act mandates a search warrant for accessing electronic communications stored over 180 days. For communications under 180 days, a warrant, subpoena, or court order suffices. Delayed notification is allowed in cases of endangerment, flight from prosecution, evidence tampering, witness intimidation, or investigation jeopardy. Subsection 2703(d) permits an order with specific facts for ongoing criminal investigations, with some courts questioning the constitutionality of the \"reasonable grounds\" standard for government access to provider-held email. The Sixth Circuit panel ruled that the Fourth Amendment prohibits government access to stored email content without a warrant, subscriber consent, or indication of privacy waiver. The Stored Communications Act requires providers to preserve customer communications upon government request, subject to Fourth Amendment rules and exceptions. Subsection 2703(f) mandates providers to save records pending a warrant, court order, or subpoena. The Stored Communications Act requires providers to preserve customer communications upon government request, subject to Fourth Amendment rules and exceptions. Section 2703 provides greater protection to communication content than to provider records relating to those communications. The Stored Communications Act allows ECS or RCS providers to disclose customer information under a warrant, court order, or with consent. Subpoenas can be used for limited information without notifying the customer. District courts are divided on the standard for obtaining cell phone location information. In United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court suggested a driver's privacy rights. In United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court ruled that attaching a tracking device to a car and capturing long-term information violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court agreed unanimously that this constituted a search, with some Justices citing physical intrusion and others citing breach of privacy expectations. It is uncertain how this decision will impact future cases. Violations of unauthorized access prohibitions under section 2701 can result in criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions. Offenders can face imprisonment for up to five years (up to 10 years for subsequent convictions) and/or fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Victims have the right to seek equitable relief, attorneys' fees, costs, and damages equal to offender profits plus victim losses (minimum $1,000). Violations by the United States may lead to legal action and disciplinary measures. States may give rise to a cause of action and disciplinary action against officials or employees for violations of the Stored Communications Act (SCA). Unlike Title III violations, there is no statutory prohibition on disclosure or use of information under SCA, but violations trigger Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. Violations of SCA may result in civil damages, costs, and attorneys' fees for ECS and RCS providers. A trap and trace device and pen register do not intercept phone conversation contents but identify call sources and numbers dialed. Congress expanded interception definitions under ECPA, regulating these devices separately from Title III. However, if they capture communication content due to telecom advances, Title III wiretap provisions apply. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened coverage to include sender/addressee information. The Act expanded coverage to include sender/addressee information for electronic communications. It prohibits the installation or use of pen registers or trap and trace devices without court order, consent, or in emergency situations. Court orders are required for law enforcement to use these devices in criminal investigations. An order authorizing installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device must specify the person, telephone number, location, and geographical range, as well as the crime being investigated. It must involve carrier assistance, terminate within 60 days, include a report of execution in Internet cases, and impose nondisclosure requirements. The order may be issued by a judge of competent jurisdiction or approved by senior Justice Department or state prosecutors. Federal authorities have sought court orders under the Stored Communications Act and trap and trace authority to track cell phone users in criminal investigations. Unauthorized use of pen registers or trap and trace devices is a federal crime. Unauthorized use of pen registers or trap and trace devices is a federal crime, punishable by imprisonment and fines. There is a good faith defense for reliance on court orders or emergency requests. Violations do not lead to suppression of evidence, and there is no requirement to notify targets upon order expiration. Permanent gag orders on providers are not allowed to avoid First Amendment concerns. Providers can be subject to permanent gag orders but are not required to disclose them to targets. Some states have criminalized unlawful use of pen registers or trap and trace devices, following federal guidelines. There is no separate private cause of action for unlawful installation or use of these devices. \"Wire communication\" refers to aural transfers through wire, cable, or similar connections operated by providers of interstate or foreign communications. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions related to interception of wire, electronic, or oral communications, including the definition of \"oral communication\" and \"intercept.\" It also defines \"State\" and \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\" in the context of communication interception. The curr_chunk defines \"person\" as any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, or corporation. It also defines \"Investigative or law enforcement officer\" as any officer of the United States. The curr_chunk further defines key terms such as \"contents\" in relation to wire, oral, or electronic communication, and \"Judge of competent jurisdiction\" as a judge authorized to issue interception orders. It also clarifies the term \"communication common carrier\" as defined in the Communications Act of 1934. The curr_chunk defines terms like \"common carrier\" as per the Communications Act of 1934, \"aggrieved person\" as someone involved in intercepted communication, and \"electronic communication\" as data transmitted via various systems affecting commerce. The curr_chunk defines terms related to electronic communication services, including the definition of \"user\" and \"electronic communication service.\" It also explains what constitutes an \"electronic communications system\" and what it means to be \"readily accessible to the general public.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to electronic communication services, including the definition of \"electronic storage\" and \"aural transfer.\" The curr_chunk defines \"foreign intelligence information\" as information related to the United States' ability to protect against attacks or hostile acts by foreign powers, sabotage, terrorism, or clandestine intelligence activities. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"protected computer\" and \"computer trespasser\" in relation to unauthorized access. It also outlines the prohibition of intercepting wire, oral, or electronic communications without authorization. The curr_chunk discusses the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications using electronic devices without authorization, especially in cases involving businesses or commercial establishments affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The curr_chunk discusses the intentional disclosure or use of intercepted wire, oral, or electronic communications, knowing that the information was obtained unlawfully. The intentional disclosure or use of intercepted wire, oral, or electronic communications in connection with a criminal investigation, with the intent to obstruct or interfere with the investigation, is punishable under the law. Providers of wire or electronic communication services are authorized to intercept, disclose, or use communications in the course of their employment for service-related activities or protection of rights. They can also provide assistance to lawfully authorized individuals for intercepting communications or conducting electronic surveillance. Providers of wire or electronic communication services can assist in intercepting communications or conducting electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, with court orders providing direction and protection from liability. Providers of wire or electronic communication services can assist in intercepting communications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, with court orders providing direction and protection from liability. Section 2511(2)(a)(ii)(A) of title 18, United States Code, as amended by section 101(c)(1), shall continue to apply to an order issued pursuant to section 704 of the Act, or a certification in writing by specified individuals that no warrant is required by law, all statutory requirements have been met, and the specified assistance is necessary. No disclosure of interception or surveillance is allowed. The person must disclose any interception or surveillance authorized by a court order, with notification to the Attorney General or prosecuting attorney. Failure to disclose may result in civil damages. Providers of communication services are protected from liability when complying with court orders or certifications under the law. Under this chapter, certifications for assistance in obtaining foreign intelligence information must identify specific statutory provisions and certify compliance. It is not unlawful for FCC officers to intercept communications in the course of their duties. Similarly, individuals acting under the law can intercept communications if they are a party to the communication. Under this chapter, individuals can intercept communications if they are a party to the communication or have consent. It is not unlawful for officers, employees, or agents of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of their official duty as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 authorizes the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international communications using means other than electronic surveillance. This chapter and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 are the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance and intercepting domestic communications. It is not unlawful to intercept electronic communications that are readily accessible to the general public or radio communications transmitted by stations for public use, government, law enforcement, or emergency services. The Communications Act of 1934 allows interception of wire or electronic communications causing harmful interference, and interception of radio communications on the same frequency if not scrambled or encrypted. It is not unlawful to use pen registers or trap and trace devices. Under chapter 206, interception of wire or electronic communications is allowed for lawful investigations or to protect against fraudulent or abusive use of services. It is not illegal for authorized individuals to intercept communications of computer trespassers on protected computers if engaged in a lawful investigation. Under chapter 206, interception of wire or electronic communications is allowed for lawful investigations or to protect against fraudulent or abusive use of services. It is not illegal for authorized individuals to intercept communications of computer trespassers on protected computers if engaged in a lawful investigation, provided that the interception is relevant to the investigation and does not acquire communications other than those transmitted to or from the computer trespasser. Additionally, a person or entity providing electronic communication service to the public shall not intentionally divulge the contents of any communication in transmission to any unauthorized person or entity, unless otherwise authorized by law. The interception of wire or electronic communications is allowed for lawful investigations or to protect against fraudulent use. Unauthorized interception is punishable by fines or imprisonment up to five years. Exceptions include lawful consent, forwarding communications, or divulging information to law enforcement in cases of potential crimes. Unauthorized interception of wire or electronic communications for retransmission to the public or redistribution to public facilities is not an offense unless done for commercial advantage. Private viewing of unscrambled satellite or radio communications not for illegal purposes is also exempt. If wire or electronic communications are intercepted without encryption for non-tortious or illegal purposes, the individual may be sued by the Federal Government. In such cases, the government can seek injunctive relief for a first offense or impose a $500 civil fine for subsequent offenses. The court has the authority to enforce any injunction issued. The court may enforce an injunction with a civil fine of at least $500 for each violation related to the surreptitious interception of communications through specific devices. The court may enforce an injunction with a civil fine of at least $500 for each violation related to the surreptitious interception of communications through specific devices. Any individual who advertises devices primarily used for intercepting communications, knowing they will be transported in commerce, may face fines or imprisonment up to five years. It is not unlawful for certain providers or government officials to possess or sell devices designed for intercepting communications, as long as it is in the normal course of their business or activities. The law allows for the possession and sale of devices for intercepting communications by specific providers or government officials, as long as it is within their normal business or activities. It is not illegal to advertise such devices to authorized entities, and any violation can result in seizure and forfeiture to the United States. The provisions of title 19 of the United States Code regarding the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles, merchandise, and baggage also apply to electronic, mechanical, or other intercepting devices under this section. The Attorney General or authorized officers can intercept wire or oral communications, but any information obtained cannot be used in court if it violates the law. The Attorney General or designated officials can authorize applications for interception. The Security Division authorized by the Attorney General can request a Federal judge for an order to intercept wire or oral communications for investigations related to specific offenses punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under certain sections of the United States Code. The Security Division authorized by the Attorney General can request a Federal judge for an order to intercept wire or oral communications for investigations related to specific offenses punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under certain sections of the United States Code, including offenses related to biological weapons, espionage, kidnapping, protection of trade secrets, sabotage, treason, riots, malicious mischief, destruction of vessels, piracy, restrictions on payments and loans to labor organizations, murder, robbery, extortion, violence at international airports, animal enterprise terrorism, arson within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction, and bribery of public officials and witnesses. The Security Division authorized by the Attorney General can request a Federal judge for an order to intercept wire or oral communications for investigations related to specific offenses punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year under certain sections of the United States Code, including offenses related to bribery of public officials and witnesses, transmission of wagering information, escape, nuclear and weapons of mass destruction threats, possession of weapons in Federal facilities, loans and credit applications, protection of foreign officials, and obstruction of criminal investigations. The curr_chunk lists various sections of the United States Code related to criminal offenses, including obstruction of criminal investigations, sex trafficking of children, assassination of Presidential staff, interference with commerce, interstate travel in aid of racketeering, murder for hire, violent crimes, money laundering, and engaging in monetary transactions from unlawful activity. The curr_chunk lists various sections of the United States Code related to criminal offenses, including theft, embezzlement, fraud, bank fraud, terrorist attacks, sexual exploitation of children, child pornography, trafficking, and interstate transportation of stolen property.
