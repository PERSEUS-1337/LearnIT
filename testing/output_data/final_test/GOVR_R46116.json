    "content": "Surprise billing refers to situations where a consumer is treated by a provider outside of their health insurance network, resulting in a larger unexpected bill. It is commonly discussed in emergency and nonemergency situations, as well as in other scenarios like ambulance services. Surprise billing is rooted in private insurers' use of provider networks. The report discusses the relationship between provider network status and private health insurance billing, federal and state requirements, and policy issues for Congress to consider. Topics include plan types, services, consumer protections, financial requirements, enforcement, and the role of the state. The report discusses surprise billing proposals and potential impacts, comparing two federal proposals in an appendix. It highlights the importance of contractual relationships in determining charges and payments for health care services under private insurance. Private health insurance involves contractual relationships between consumers, insurers, and providers for a given health plan. Providers set charges for services, but actual payment amounts can vary based on negotiations, out-of-network coverage, cost-sharing, and other factors. Private health insurance involves contractual relationships between consumers, insurers, and providers. Insurers negotiate separate contracts with hospitals, physicians, and other providers, determining in-network coverage. The contents of these contracts vary based on negotiations between providers and insurers. Negotiated amounts between providers and insurers specify payment for in-network services. Consumers share payment responsibility based on health plan cost-sharing requirements. In-network providers offer lower cost-sharing for covered services compared to out-of-network providers. Out-of-network providers may bill consumers more than in-network providers. Plans like PPOs cover out-of-network services, while HMOs typically do not. Consumers and insurers share costs for out-of-network services if the insurer provides partial coverage. The consumer and insurer share costs for out-of-network services, with the consumer's amount determined by the plan's cost-sharing requirements. Cost-sharing requirements for out-of-network providers are typically larger than for in-network providers, with different deductibles. Insurers need to determine the total amount based on cost-sharing requirements, as there are no negotiated amounts with out-of-network providers. Insurers determine the total allowed amount for out-of-network services, which may not match negotiated rates. Consumer payments could be higher due to increased cost sharing based on the plan's terms. Insurers use methodologies like usual, customary, and reasonable rates to calculate the total allowed amount. Providers in the area typically charge for medical services, and if an out-of-network provider's total charge exceeds the allowed amount, they may balance bill the consumer. Collecting balance bill amounts is more challenging than payments from insurers, and providers may settle for less than the total balance bill. There are no federal restrictions on balance billing consumers with private health coverage. The report discusses how providers balance bill consumers with private health coverage for out-of-network services. These costs, referred to as other consumer costs, are not technically cost sharing. Currently, federal requirements do not address surprise billing, but they do address related issues. The Affordable Care Act established requirements for consumer cost sharing and plan coverage of out-of-network emergency services. Insurers are required to cover emergency services in hospital emergency departments, regardless of the provider's contractual status with the plan. This ensures that providers furnishing out-of-network emergency services receive some contribution from the insurer. Insurers must recognize the highest of three payment standards for emergency services: negotiated in-network rate, out-of-network usual amount, or Medicare rate. After determining the total allowed amount, insurer and consumer split payment based on plan cost-sharing. The ACA limits a consumer's cost sharing for out-of-network emergency care to the in-network amount or rate of the consumer's health plan, regardless of the coinsurance rate. This requirement does not address plan deductibles or out-of-pocket limits. The ACA limits consumer cost sharing for out-of-network emergency services to the in-network amount. However, consumer payments may still be applied to out-of-network amounts, resulting in higher cost sharing. Providers can still balance bill consumers. Plans must meet network adequacy standards to be sold on an exchange, including counting consumer cost sharing for out-of-network services towards the in-network out-of-pocket maximum. As of July 2019, 26 states had addressed surprise billing for emergency department services and 19 states had addressed surprise billing for nonemergency care at in-network hospitals. State policies vary, creating different requirements for insurers and providers to protect consumers. State surprise billing laws do not apply to self-insured plans. The National Academy of State Health Policy (NASHP) examined differences in surprise billing laws among eight states, including payment standards based on benchmark rates. Some states set payment standards based on benchmark rates or regulatory authority, while others use a dispute-resolution process for surprise balance bills. States have also tried to regulate ground and air ambulance surprise billing, but face limitations due to federal laws. Federal proposals aim to address surprise billing issues. Surprise billing proposals aim to regulate financial relationships between insurers, providers, and consumers for certain services. They establish new requirements on insurers and providers in billing situations to protect consumers. This includes addressing how insurers pay for services, consumer cost-sharing, balance billing by providers, and participation in dispute resolution processes. Policymakers may consider various approaches to address surprise billing issues. Surprise billing proposals aim to regulate financial relationships between insurers, providers, and consumers for certain services. Policymakers may want to consider different approaches when evaluating these proposals. The policy discussions in this section do not specifically reference federal proposals but provide examples and context from state surprise billing laws. The report concludes with an Appendix that summarizes federal policies. The report includes an Appendix with summaries of two surprise billing proposals from the 116th Congress. These proposals were part of larger bills and went through committee markups in the Senate and House. Federal private health insurance requirements vary based on the market segment in which the plan is sold. State regulations can impact health insurance plans in different market segments. While plans in individual and small-group markets must cover essential health benefits, plans in the large-group market and self-insured plans are not required to do so. States can regulate fully insured plans in various markets but cannot directly apply surprise billing requirements to self-insured plans. Some states, like New Jersey, allow self-insuring entities to opt into surprise billing requirements. Additionally, state requirements on providers may affect consumers with self-insured coverage, such as New York's arbitration process for surprise billing situations. The arbitration process for surprise billing situations applied to providers and fully insured plans, not self-insured plans. However, a study suggests that the policy affected consumers with both types of plans. Providers may need to determine a consumer's plan type to comply with federal requirements. Federal surprise billing proposals from the 116th Congress aim to address consumers enrolled in all types of health plans to minimize the risk of surprise bills. These proposals focus on emergency services from out-of-network providers and services provided by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities. A recent study estimated that 20% of hospital inpatient admissions result in surprise billing. A recent study estimated that 20% of hospital inpatient admissions from an emergency department, 14% of outpatient visits to an emergency department, and 9% of elective inpatient admissions in 2014 were likely to result in surprise medical bills. Another study found an increase in surprise out-of-network billing for emergency department visits and inpatient admissions between 2010 and 2016, attributed to unique market forces. Many providers join insurer networks to steer enrollees towards in-network providers, reducing cost sharing. Consumers may not have a choice in emergency situations, leading to potential surprise medical bills. Certain emergency and ancillary providers may have fewer incentives to join the network of a health insurer, as they are more likely to receive constant demand for their services regardless of network status. Instead, these providers may choose to stay out of network to charge more for their services. Surprise billing can occur in various situations, such as ambulance services or when an in-network physician sends lab tests to an out-of-network lab. Some federal proposals address air ambulance services, which are similar to emergency services in that consumers often cannot choose an in-network provider due to the urgency of the situation. The high prices charged by air ambulance providers reduce incentives for contracts with agreed-upon payment rates. Surprise billing proposals aim to address various situations, including air ambulance transports for privately insured consumers. These proposals typically include provisions to establish consumer protections and tie consumer cost sharing to agreed-upon payment rates. Some federal proposals aim to inform consumers about in-network and out-of-network providers, tying consumer cost sharing to in-network rates and limiting balance billing. Consumer notification requirements are included to help consumers make informed choices about their healthcare options. The financial protections and notification requirements for privately insured consumers include cost sharing, balance bills, and other consumer costs. In out-of-network situations, consumers may be responsible for cost sharing and balance bills if their plan covers out-of-network benefits, or for other consumer costs if it does not. Surprise billing requirements address these consumer financial responsibilities. Surprise billing requirements may address consumer financial responsibilities such as cost sharing, balance billing, and other costs for out-of-network services. These requirements impact the total amount consumers pay and providers receive for services. Cost-sharing rates for out-of-network services could be limited by federal proposals. Cost-sharing requirements for out-of-network services are often tied to in-network requirements. State-level surprise billing laws also include similar cost-sharing requirements. Cost sharing can be tied to any rate or amount, but it typically applies to co-payment or coinsurance rates. When receiving emergency care from an out-of-network provider, cost-sharing is limited to the in-network amount. Cost sharing for out-of-network services may not align with in-network requirements, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers. Insurers can apply out-of-network deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for emergency services, increasing the amount owed by the consumer. Cost-sharing does not specify the total dollar amount paid for out-of-network services, as it is often based on a percentage of the total cost of care recognized by the insurer. The total cost-sharing amount paid by the consumer can also be influenced by methodologies for determining the total cost of care in surprise billing situations. Requirements may be placed on providers or insurers to protect consumers from balance billing in surprise billing situations. Policymakers may need to include language defining the extent to which a provider can balance bill a consumer. Insurers may be required to pay the provider their billed charges or a lower acceptable amount to protect consumers. Both types of requirements would have similar effects in preventing balance billing. Surprise billing laws in 28 states protect consumers from balance bills by imposing requirements on insurers or providers. Differentiating between consumers with plans that cover out-of-network services and those that do not, these laws aim to reduce financial liabilities in surprise billing situations. Proposals to address surprise billing situations could define financial liabilities for consumers enrolled in plans without out-of-network benefits. This may include requiring insurers to cover a portion of the total cost of care, reducing the consumer's financial responsibility. Many federal surprise billing proposals aim to limit consumer costs by requiring insurers to cover a specified amount in surprise billing situations, regardless of whether the service is covered by the plan. This is important as surprise billing can occur when a consumer unknowingly receives treatment from an out-of-network provider. Proposals aim to provide consumers with more information about their network providers and care received to make informed decisions. While these requirements may not eliminate surprise billing, they could reduce unexpected out-of-network use and, in turn, decrease surprise billing prevalence. Consumer notifications are discussed as a way to provide information about provider network status and financial responsibilities before receiving services. Consumer notification requirements aim to provide information about provider network status and financial responsibilities to consumers before receiving services. Policymakers may need to determine what information should be included in the notification, who is responsible for providing it, when it should be given, and if consumer consent is required. Consumer notification requirements aim to provide information about provider network status and financial responsibilities to consumers before receiving services. The notice should consider limitations on services, consumer consent, and access to required information. Notification requirements may include consumer financial liability protections, such as in surprise billing situations. Provider directories offer information on plan network providers and facilities. Provider directories in a plan network are typically maintained by insurers, using information from providers. Policymakers should consider what information is included, how it is accessed by consumers, and how often it is updated. Financial liability protections for consumers may be linked to provider directory requirements. Surprise billing proposals aim to protect consumers from unexpected large bills from out-of-network providers. Methods include setting payment standards and creating network requirements to reduce out-of-network treatment at in-network facilities. Payment for out-of-network services depends on whether the plan covers out-of-network benefits. If an insurer provides out-of-network benefits, they determine the payment amount and providers can balance bill consumers. If no out-of-network benefits are provided, the insurer will not pay for out-of-network services, subject to state and federal laws. Most federal proposals in the 116th Congress aim to address surprise billing by establishing payment methodologies for insurers in out-of-network situations. Two main methods include using a benchmark payment rate or an alternative dispute resolution process like arbitration. The final payment amount may impact consumer cost sharing based on their plan. The curr_chunk discusses the possibility of using a coinsurance model for consumer cost sharing in healthcare services, as opposed to a co-payment. It also mentions the use of bundled payments and network requirements to address surprise billing situations. Policymakers should consider various factors when determining payment rates, including the financial impact on providers and health insurers. The curr_chunk discusses the financial impact of different payment models on providers and health insurers, which can affect insurance premiums. Policymakers need to consider the implications of setting payment rates uniformly for all plans and services. Various options have trade-offs, and the effects on providers and insurers may vary by the local healthcare market. Setting out-of-network payment rates in surprise billing situations could change the leverage between insurers and providers. Setting out-of-network payment rates in surprise billing situations could change the leverage between insurers and providers, impacting in-network rates and potentially leading to higher premiums in the market. Conversely, lowering out-of-network payment rates below in-network rates may increase insurers' negotiating leverage with providers, putting downward pressure on in-network payment rates. Federal surprise billing proposals play a crucial role in determining the balance of power between insurers and providers in network inclusion negotiations. Federal surprise billing proposals aim to address the issue of surprise medical bills by tying payment to a reference price, such as Medicare rates or market-based private health insurer rates. Some proposals suggest insurers pay out-of-network providers based on Medicare rates, which are generally lower than commercial rates. Policymakers may consider structuring payment as a percentage of Medicare rates to account for differences. Some surprise billing state laws structure payment as a percentage of Medicare rates or market-based private health insurance rates. Determining the appropriate reference price for out-of-network payment is crucial, as it can impact negotiation leverage between providers and insurers. The leverage in negotiations between providers and insurers may shift based on the out-of-network payment rates. Policymakers must decide whether to use provider charges or insurer payment rates as a benchmark. Provider charges are typically higher than negotiated amounts. Federal proposals lean towards using private insurer in-network payment rates as a benchmark. Policymakers must decide whether to use provider charges or insurer payment rates as a benchmark for proposals. Insurer payment rates can be specified as usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) rates or in-network contracted rates. UCR rates are used for out-of-network services, while in-network rates are determined through negotiation or fee schedules. Once the payment rate method is chosen, a methodology for determining the final rate can be specified in the policy proposal. The appropriate metric for determining the final payment rate in a policy proposal depends on the underlying distribution of benchmark data and comparison with current in-network and out-of-network rates. Policymakers may need to consider limiting benchmark rates to specific geographic areas to account for variations in healthcare costs, balancing between too large regions that overlook market discrepancies and too small regions that may favor specific providers or insurers. When setting a benchmark for payment rates in a policy proposal, policymakers should consider using historical payment data or rates combined with an inflation factor to mitigate fluctuations in in-network rates. However, historical rates may not account for changes in the local healthcare market. In cases where an insurer lacks data to determine payment rates, they may need to rely on external databases. When setting a benchmark for payment rates, policymakers should consider using historical payment data or rates combined with an inflation factor to mitigate fluctuations. Insurers may need to rely on public or private databases to determine average in-network rates for providers in a specific area. The quality and breadth of data can impact the accuracy of reference prices. Currently, there is no universal source of data for all market types and insurers. Some states have all-payer claims databases, but not all insurers may participate. State APCDs cannot collect data from self-insured group health plans. Proposals may include multiple benchmarks to establish guardrails in surprise billing situations. Different methodologies determine which benchmark to use, such as choosing the greatest or least among specified benchmarks for payment rates. Insurers may be responsible for paying providers based on the benchmark resulting in the highest or lowest payment rate. Some federal surprise billing proposals consider an arbitration model where a neutral third party determines payment amounts between providers and insurers, impacting consumer costs. The arbitration model for surprise billing proposals involves a third party determining payment amounts between providers and insurers, potentially affecting consumer costs. Criteria for arbitrators and standards for when arbitration can be elected may need to be established by policymakers. Providers and insurers may seek arbitration to settle payment disputes, allowing negotiation of payment rates. Policymakers could establish a threshold requirement to limit resources spent on arbitration, preventing disputes below a certain dollar amount. The threshold amount could be adjusted annually for inflation or determined by agencies. If parties are restricted from arbitration below a certain dollar amount, policymakers may need to address payment for amounts under the threshold. Insurers could be required to pay charges under the threshold, or a benchmark could be used for amounts below it. Policymakers should also consider structuring the arbitration process, such as implementing a baseball-style arbitration where parties submit final offers for the arbitrator to decide on the payment rate. Some states and a federal proposal combine benchmark and arbitration methods for determining final payment rates. This hybrid approach allows the arbitrator to choose from a list of benchmarks to establish the payment rate. Researchers have also suggested a bundled payment approach as an alternative. Researchers have proposed a bundled payment approach as an alternative to regulating the relationship between an insurer and out-of-network providers. This approach would shift the responsibility to the facility to negotiate with the insurer for a bundled rate and then negotiate with providers for payment of services. Currently, no federal proposals or state laws use a bundled payment approach to address surprise billing. An alternative to addressing surprise billing is to focus on reducing the likelihood of consumers receiving care from out-of-network providers by setting stricter network adequacy standards. Network adequacy measures a plan's ability to provide access to a sufficient number of in-network providers, including primary care and specialists. States and the federal government have network adequacy standards, but self-insured plans are not subject to them. Increasing network adequacy requirements may not solve all issues related to surprise billing. Some researchers propose a network matching approach to address surprise billing by ensuring that facilities and providers contract with the same insurers to be included in the same networks, reducing the likelihood of consumers receiving care from out-of-network providers. An in-network guarantee could be structured in a few ways to address surprise billing when consumers do not have the option to choose an in-network facility, especially when traveling outside their health plan's service area. One approach is to prohibit insurers from contracting with a facility unless all providers practicing there agree to be in the same networks. Another option is to prevent insurers from paying out-of-network providers for services provided at an in-network facility, paired with a ban on balance billing. This could incentivize providers to negotiate to be in-network. Enforcement mechanisms for surprise billing legislation may involve the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Labor bringing enforcement actions, allowing private entities to seek legal action against regulated entities, and attaching statutory penalties to violations. Enforcement mechanisms for surprise billing legislation may involve attaching specified statutory penalties to violations of the statute, especially in federal proposals that would amend provisions under Part A of Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act. These enforcement mechanisms currently apply only to insurers and not providers. The enforcement provisions for Title XXVII of the PHSA apply to health insurance issuers in group and individual markets. States are the primary enforcers, but the HHS Secretary can step in if needed, imposing a maximum penalty of $100 per day for non-compliance. The maximum penalty under PHSA is $100 per day for non-compliance, with the Secretary having discretion to waive part or all of the penalty for reasonable cause. ERISA enforces requirements for group health plans and health insurance issuers, allowing civil actions by the Secretary of Labor or participants/beneficiaries. Under the IRC, group health plans can face a tax penalty of $100 per day for noncompliance with plan requirements. This penalty does not apply to governmental plans or health insurance issuers. Plan beneficiaries have the right to take civil actions against group health plans to recover or clarify their benefits. Failure to pay excise tax may lead to penalties, with disputes resolved in court. Federal laws do not typically enforce regulations on medical providers, as states traditionally regulate them. Any federal requirements on providers are enforced through specific regulatory frameworks. The enforcement provisions for federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, allow the HHS Secretary to take action against individuals, including health care providers, for certain violations like improper claims and payments. Violators may face civil penalties or exclusion from federal health programs. Policymakers should consider specific enforcement provisions for surprise billing proposals that directly impact providers. Many federal surprise billing proposals include enforcement provisions tailored to providers in this context. The proposals for surprise billing enforcement provisions would apply to providers who have not faced state enforcement actions. Policymakers need to consider how federal and state laws on surprise billing should interact. Many federal proposals aim to maintain state surprise billing laws and apply federal law only where states lack such laws. Considerations include how federal law would defer to state laws, especially in cases involving ambulances. State surprise billing laws vary in their scope, with some states only applying protections to specific situations or providers. Missouri, New Hampshire, and Oregon only apply state laws for emergency services from out-of-network providers at in-network hospitals, potentially excluding them from federal ambulance surprise billing laws. A federal law may fill gaps left by state laws, leading to varying protections for different types of insurance plans and enrollees. In 2017, Hawaii had the lowest percentage (31.2%) and Wyoming had the highest percentage (72.4%) of private sector employees enrolled in self-insured plans. The national average was 59.4%. Differences in state laws for surprise billing protections in Arizona, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Oregon highlight the need for a federal policy that provides deference to state laws for emergency services. A federal surprise billing law may impact insurers and providers, potentially changing their incentives to enter network agreements. The law could be uniformly applicable to all states, overriding previous state legislation. Policymakers may consider allowing states to tailor the federal proposal to their needs. States could tailor a federal proposal by selecting benchmark parameters for plan payments and determining notification requirements. This flexibility allows states to incorporate federal policies based on their unique relationships between insurers, providers, and consumers. Policy decisions impact the billing process, influencing how specific actors respond. For example, a federal policy establishing a lower benchmark reimbursement rate may affect insurers. A federal policy establishes a benchmark reimbursement rate lower than what insurers currently pay out-of-network providers, prohibiting balance billing. Insurers may adjust premiums for plans covering out-of-network benefits based on net payments to providers. Providers may see reduced revenue and administrative costs due to lower payment rates and balance billing prohibition. The federal policy on surprise billing may lead to reduced administrative costs for out-of-network providers. Providers may adjust prices or services in response. Another surprise billing policy involving arbitration could increase administrative costs for insurers and providers, impacting premium prices or provider charges. These policies could also change relationships between insurers, providers, and consumers. The surprise billing policy may impact contract negotiations between insurers and providers, leading to changes in payment rates and network participation. Providers may demand higher payment rates or consider dropping out of the network, while insurers may be incentivized to reduce rates for certain providers. This could result in providers being paid at a plan's median rate if they are considered out of network. The surprise billing policy could lead to providers being paid at a plan's median rate, whether in-network or out-of-network. An arbitration model may result in specialized providers demanding higher payment rates based on their expertise and case complexity. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the impact of these policies on insurance premiums and the federal budget. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed the impact of surprise billing policies on insurance premiums and the federal budget. Different policies could affect national health expenditures, with one proposal potentially reducing private health insurance spending on out-of-network care. Future health expenditures could grow slower if a benchmark is indexed to a smaller inflationary rate. The potential impact of arbitration model policies on national health expenditures is contingent upon the percentage of expenditures affected by federal policies. Providers may gain increased leverage during negotiations, but the overall effect on health expenditures remains uncertain. The impacts of state surprise billing laws are evident through anecdotal evidence. For example, in California, insurers were required to pay certain out-of-network providers either the average contracted rate or 125% of the Medicare fee-for-service rate. Insurers in Colorado had to pay in-network rates for services by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities. Insurers' responses to these laws varied. The state survey of insurers on the surprise billing law revealed that some insurers believed out-of-network providers were incentivized to stay out of networks, while hospital-based physicians had more negotiating power. Out of 52 insurers surveyed, 7 reported a positive impact on network adequacy, 20 saw no change, 21 reported a negative effect, and 4 had insufficient data. New York implemented an arbitration-type law for surprise billing. The IDR process for emergency physician services and non-emergency services involved different provider types from 2015 to 2018. Colorado and New York examples show how a federal surprise billing policy can impact individual actors within a market differently due to existing dynamics between insurers and providers. State regulations and existing surprise billing laws also play a role in how federal proposals will affect insurers. The appendix compares surprise billing provisions in two federal bills, S. 1895 and H.R. 2328, addressing various medical billing situations. The effects of federal surprise billing proposals vary across states and impact insurers and providers differently. The appendix compares surprise billing provisions in federal bills S. 1895 and H.R. 2328, addressing different medical billing scenarios. Each bill addresses multiple situations, referred to as scenarios, with specific requirements that may apply differently across scenarios. For example, Title I of S. 1895 includes provisions for emergency services provided by out-of-network providers and ancillary services. The Title I of S. 1895 (Alexander) column discusses scenarios involving emergency services by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities. Consumer costs for these services are also addressed in the proposal. The curr_chunk discusses whether a plan covers services from out-of-network providers that would be covered in-network and if a service is considered a covered benefit regardless of provider network status. Differences in bill language may exist despite similarities in wording. The curr_chunk provides an appendix table focusing on language included and defined in bills, without comparing differences or analyzing underlying statutory differences. It does not address drafting errors, technical issues, policy implications, or unintended consequences."
