They go to great lengths to conceal their identities and often lie to their families about their jobs. The Afghan interpreter faced threats from the Taliban in his native province. Legislation in 2006 allowed Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. Armed Forces as translators to obtain special immigrant visas for permanent residency in the U.S. The need for special immigrant status for Iraqi and Afghan translators working with the U.S. Armed Forces was highlighted in the 109th Congress. The danger faced by these translators and their families will increase after U.S. forces withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress expanded special immigrant classifications for translators and authorized a second classification for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked for the U.S. government in those countries. The special immigrant category for Iraqi and Afghan translators working with the U.S. Armed Forces was expanded by Congress in the 109th Congress. The term special immigrant is defined in Section 101(a)(27) of the INA, with most classifications subject to an annual numerical limitation. The special immigrant category was added to the INA by a 1965 immigration law. The Immigration Act of 1990 amended special immigrant provisions in the INA, placing them under a revised section on permanent employment-based immigration. It imposed an annual numerical limitation of 10,000 special immigrants, with exemptions for certain classifications. The 1991 immigration act changed the overall annual limitation on special immigrants to 7.1% of the worldwide level. The special immigrant category was amended by the Immigration Act of 1990, reducing the annual limitation to 7.1% of employment-based immigration. It includes various classifications with humanitarian or public service elements, such as religious workers and U.S. government employees. The special immigrant category includes classifications for 15-year employees or former employees of the U.S. government abroad, nationals of Panama who worked in the former Canal Zone, and individuals who served in the U.S. Armed Forces for 12 years. Some classifications are for individuals in danger due to their work, such as employees of the Panama Canal Company or Canal Zone Government. The special immigrant classifications for Iraqis and Afghans are for individuals who performed U.S. government-related service, with one requiring a serious threat to the individual. There are two classifications specifically for nationals of Iraq and Afghanistan: one for translators or interpreters and one for those employed by the U.S. government in Iraq or Afghanistan. These classifications were established through legislative enactments and require a petition for classification. A prospective Iraqi or Afghan special immigrant must submit a petition for classification and be otherwise eligible and admissible to the United States under the INA. The public charge ground does not apply to these applicants. Section 1059 of the FY2006 NDAA made certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with U.S. Armed Forces eligible as special immigrants. Section 1059 of the FY2006 NDAA allowed certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked with U.S. Armed Forces to be eligible as special immigrants. The provision was later amended in 2007 to expand eligibility to include those who worked as translators or interpreters. The 2007 legislation temporarily increased the numerical limit on this special immigrant program and exempted it from overall numerical limits on special immigrants. The special immigrant program for Iraqi and Afghan nationals working with the U.S. government was expanded in 2007 to include translators and interpreters. The program was exempt from overall numerical limits on special immigrants, and any unused numbers would carry over to the next year. A separate classification was established for Iraqi and Afghan nationals employed by the U.S. government, with eligibility criteria further expanded in the FY2015 NDAA. The special immigrant program for Iraqi and Afghan nationals working with the U.S. government requires a recommendation from a senior supervisor and approval from the Chief of Mission. Applicants must have faced an ongoing serious threat due to their employment. The Iraqi program initially had a cap of 5,000 principal aliens annually for five years, with the provision to carry forward unused numbers. The program expired for principal aliens at the end of FY2013 but was expanded in FY2014. In FY2014, the 113th Congress approved a short-term extension of the special immigrant program for Iraqi and Afghan nationals. The extension allowed for the approval of pending cases and 2,000 new cases, with a deadline for application submission. The NDAA for FY2014 revised the extension to issue a maximum of 2,500 visas to principal applicants after January 1, 2014, extending the application deadline to September 30, 2014. No changes have been made to the numerical cap or application deadline since then. The SIV program for Afghans employed by the U.S. government had a cap of 1,500 principal aliens annually from FY2009 to FY2013. Laws passed by the 113th Congress increased the cap to 3,000 for FY2014. The program required a one-year employment period ending by December 31, 2014, with applications filed with the Chief of Mission. The Emergency Afghan Allies Extension Act of 2014 allowed an additional 1,000 principal aliens to apply for special immigrant status by December 31, 2014. The FY2015 NDAA further increased the cap to 4,000 principal aliens who could obtain special immigrant status from December 19, 2014, through September 30, 2016. The law set deadlines for the required one-year employment period, application to the Chief of Mission, and expiration date. In 2015, the Afghan SIV program deadline was extended to December 31, 2015, with visa issuance authority expiring on March 31, 2017. The NDAA for FY2016 increased special immigrant visas from 4,000 to 7,000, with modified employment requirements. The act also extended the application deadline to December 31, 2016 and included provisions for regular assessment by the Committee on Armed Services. The NDAA for FY2017 increased special immigrant visas to 8,500 for Afghans employed in Afghanistan as interpreters and translators, with extended employment eligibility and application deadline to December 31, 2020. Restrictions were placed on qualifying employment for U.S. government visa issuance for applications filed after December 23, 2016. In the 115th Congress, the number of additional visas under the SIV program for Afghans employed by the U.S. government was increased to 11,000. The NDAA for FY2018 added 3,500 more visas, bringing the total to 14,500 available after December 19, 2014. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act in the 116th Congress made an additional 4,000 visas available for Afghans employed by the U.S. government. The employment termination date and application deadline remained unchanged at December 31, 2020. The SIV program for Afghans employed by the U.S. government has a total of 18,500 visas available after December 19, 2014. The employment termination date and application deadline are set at December 31, 2020. Additional funding for 4,000 visas is conditional on the development of a prioritization system for processing Afghan SIV applications. The annual numerical limit for translators and interpreters under the program has been 50 since FY2009. The process of applying for an Iraqi or Afghan special immigrant visa has multiple steps, with the first step being for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for or on behalf of the United States. The first step for Iraqis and Afghans applying for special immigrant visas is to seek Chief of Mission approval by submitting required documentation to the Department of State. If approved, they receive a Chief of Mission approval letter and then proceed to file a petition with the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The DHS/USCIS requires specific documents for different programs, such as Chief of Mission approval letter and recommendation letters for those who worked for the U.S. or translators/interpreters. Approved petitions are sent to DOS's NVC for further processing and applicants must collect necessary documents for all family members. The NVC requires applicants to submit forms and documents for all family members applying for visas, including passport copies, birth certificates, and police certificates. An in-person visa interview is scheduled at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad to determine eligibility. Applicants must also undergo a medical examination at their own expense. After the visa interview, the consular office informs applicants about missing documentation and any issues that may prevent visa issuance. Some cases require additional administrative processing. Visa recipients in the resettlement program have travel arranged by the International Organization for Migration. SIV recipients obtain LPR status upon admission to the US. Special immigrant classifications allow for specific populations to permanently immigrate to the US. Special immigrants, unlike refugees, are not admitted for employment purposes but are granted permanent residency in the US. Refugees are accepted based on humanitarian grounds due to persecution fears. Refugees can be accompanied by family members, and their admissions process differs from immigrants. After one year, refugees must apply to adjust to LPR status, while special immigrants obtain LPR status upon admission. The special immigrant category grants LPR status upon admission to the US, unlike refugees who must apply after one year. There is overlap between the refugee and special immigrant categories, particularly for Iraqis and Afghans. Eligible aliens for the special immigrant programs must have experienced a serious threat due to their employment by the US Government. The special immigrant category grants LPR status upon admission to the US for aliens who have experienced a serious threat due to their employment by the US Government. A US connection is also a factor for access to the US refugee admissions program, with priorities 2 and 3 providing more direct access for resettlement consideration. Priority 2 and 3 of the U.S. refugee admissions program provide direct access for resettlement consideration. Priority 2 covers specific groups of humanitarian concern with a U.S. connection, like Iraqis associated with the United States. Priority 3 is limited to designated nationalities and covers family reunification cases. Iraqi and Afghan special immigrants receive federal public benefits like refugees. Certain inadmissibility grounds, such as public charge, do not apply to refugees. Needy refugees are eligible for resettlement assistance through programs administered by DOS and the Department of State. Under DOS's Reception and Placement program, public and private entities provide resettlement services to refugees. ORR's programs offer transitional assistance to refugees and other designated groups, including Iraqi and Afghan special immigrants who now receive federal public benefits. Special rules apply to refugees for federal public benefits like Medicaid and SSI. The original law for Iraqi and Afghan translators did not address eligibility for resettlement support. Special immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan, including Amerasian children, are eligible for refugee assistance and benefits under the NDAA for FY2010. Amerasian children are admitted to the U.S. under family-based immigration provisions, not as a category of humanitarian admissions. The INA was amended in 1982 to allow family-based immigration of individuals born in Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Kampuchea (Cambodia), or Thailand between 1950 and 1982 with U.S. citizen fathers. The 1987 law further eased restrictions on the immigration of Amerasian children born in Vietnam between 1962 and 1976 and fathered by a U.S. citizen. The 1987 law eased restrictions on immigration for Amerasian children born in Vietnam between 1962 and 1976 with U.S. citizen fathers, allowing them to be accompanied by family members and be eligible for benefits similar to refugees. Over 79,000 individuals have been issued special immigrant visas or adjusted to LPR status under special immigrant classifications for Iraqi and Afghan nationals by the end of FY2018. The special immigrant classification for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters saw a significant drop in visa issuances from FY2017 to FY2018. There is a tension in administering the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs between issuing visas promptly and conducting necessary security screenings due to concerns about the safety of those who assisted the United States. The Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs face criticism for their complex and slow application processes, putting applicants' lives at risk. Critics describe the visa application process as opaque and difficult to navigate without legal assistance. The Afghan SIV application process has faced long waits, bureaucracy, and denials, but changes have been made to improve efficiency. Key bottleneck at the start of the process has been addressed by increasing the number of committees handling cases, allowing for reviews within two weeks of filing. Other changes to decrease processing times were implemented by DOS for the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs. The Department of State has made improvements to the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs by reducing redundant documentation, streamlining paperwork submission, and addressing obstacles faced by applicants in preparing their applications. These changes aim to expedite the processing times and alleviate delays in the application process. The Department of Homeland Security reported processing delays for Iraqi and Afghan SIV petitions, taking 3 to 10 days on average. The 113th Congress enacted legislation to address concerns and establish a review process for denial of Chief of Mission approval. The FY2014 NDAA mandated changes to the processing of applications for Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, was required to ensure that all necessary steps for visa issuance, including screenings and background checks, were completed within 9 months of application submission. Exceptions were allowed for high-risk cases. Reporting requirements were also established for the implementation of improvements to the SIV application processing. The FY2014 NDAA mandated changes to the processing of applications for Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government. The FY2019 NDAA required a report on the implementation of SIV application processing improvements under the Afghan program, citing concerns about delays and inefficiencies in the process. Quarterly reports were also mandated to describe improvements in efficiency in SIV application processing. The quarterly reports on the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs, starting from April 2014, highlight efforts by the U.S. government to reduce processing time. The reports include data on average processing time, excluding applicant responsibilities. Initial reports in April 2014 showed 239 business days for the Iraqi program and 287 business days for the Afghan program. The U.S. government has been working to reduce processing time for Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs. Average processing time has decreased to 252 calendar days for Iraq and 692 calendar days for Afghanistan. A lawsuit challenging delays in processing SIV applications is pending in federal court. National security concerns remain high, with applicants undergoing security checks by DHS and DOS. The security review process for Iraqi and Afghan SIV applicants involves coordination with other agencies and multiple layers of review. Secretary of State John Kerry identified security screening as a major obstacle to quick processing, with efforts to streamline the process ongoing. Increased scrutiny followed the arrest of two Iraqi individuals on terrorism charges in 2011. The security risks posed by refugees and special immigrants from Iraq and elsewhere were discussed at a House hearing in December 2012. DHS Deputy Under Secretary Dawn Scalici highlighted concerns about potential terrorist exploitation of the refugee program and emphasized enhanced security and vetting procedures. Intelligence-driven processes are in place to identify and address threats across all immigration programs. The United States is actively reviewing intelligence and sharing it with partners to identify individuals of concern. Quarterly reports on application processing for Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs mention thorough security screening. Iraq and Afghanistan are not subject to entry restrictions under President Trump's proclamation, but additional scrutiny is recommended for Iraqi nationals entering the US. The SIV program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters is ongoing, with temporary programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for the U.S. government. The temporary Afghan and Iraqi programs are set to end when all visas are issued, with statutory numerical limitations in place. Unused visas can be carried over to the next fiscal year. The SIV program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and interpreters allows for the issuance of visas to those who worked for the U.S. government. Unused visas can be carried over to the next fiscal year, with a limit on the number of visas available annually. The Iraqi program ended in FY2013 but was later revived, with 2,500 visas authorized under P.L. 113-66 after January 1, 2014. The Afghan program initially provided 1,500 visas annually for FY2009 through... Authorized 1,500 visas annually for principal aliens for FY2009 through FY2013 were carried forward to the next fiscal year. P.L. 113-76 provided 3,000 visas for FY2014, with unused visas lost if not used in the second fiscal year. Additional visas were made available by subsequent Afghan special immigrant visa provisions enacted by the 113th Congress, with some laws extending employment termination dates and application deadlines. Additional visas were also made available by the 114th, 115th, and 116th Congresses, remaining available until used. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides for the issuance of 18,500 visas to principal aliens under the Afghan program. The SIV program for translators and interpreters is capped at 50 visas per year, except for FY2007 and FY2008 when the cap was 500. Carryover provisions were later added by amendment, and unused visas are lost if not used in the next fiscal year. The SIV programs for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for the U.S. government have faced challenges in issuing visas despite no set deadlines. There is a consensus to admit these individuals for permanent residence if they do not pose security risks. The U.S. government faces challenges in assisting Iraqi and Afghan employees. Congress debates the sufficiency of existing SIV provisions for visa issuance. Data on visa issuances for translators and interpreters are provided separately for Iraqis and Afghans. Table A-1 and Table A-2 provide data on visa issuances for Iraqi and Afghan nationals under special immigrant programs for translators and interpreters. The significant decreases in visa issuances after FY2008 reflect changes in numerical limitations on this classification. Table 3 in the report presents data on visa issuances for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for the U.S. government under special immigrant programs. Table A-3 and Table A-4 present visa issuance data for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked for the U.S. government under special immigrant programs. These tables exclude certain dependents born in a third country who received special immigrant visas or adjusted status."
