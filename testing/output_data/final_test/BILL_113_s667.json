    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fire-Damaged Home Rebuilding Act of 2013\" and includes requirements for state and local land use controls. Section 1315(a) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow local variances for residential structures in covered areas with special flood hazards protected by a levee system meeting specific requirements. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow variances for residential structures in areas protected by a levee system meeting specific requirements and subject to significant base flood elevations. The term 'eligible structure' refers to a residential structure in a covered area substantially damaged by a fire or disaster, excluding floods. 'Substantially damaged' means a structure incurring substantial damage as defined in federal regulations. Authorization for variances is granted for land in protected areas meeting specific requirements. A variance described in subparagraph (C) allows for the repair and restoration of an eligible structure to its predamaged condition without elevation, granted by an appropriate State or local authority. The authority determines that the repaired and restored structure must be located on the same site as the original structure, with the same footprint and number of floors. The elevation of the repaired structure should be consistent with existing construction in the neighborhood. The authority may grant up to 10 variances per year for repairs and restoration of structures in the neighborhood, as long as no flood insurance claims have been made, the owner has owned the structure continuously, and the purpose is for owner occupancy. The Administrator cannot find land use measures inadequate for granting variances under the national flood insurance program. The area has adopted land use measures allowing variances under the national flood insurance program. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to prohibit lowering premium rates for structures rebuilt after a disaster under certain variances."
