    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act\". The Congress recognizes the need for timely placement of children in foster care across state lines through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC), aiming to ensure children are placed in the best setting regardless of state boundaries. The ICPC process can be burdensome and outdated, causing delays in placement for children awaiting adoption or foster care. The National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise (NEICE) was launched to streamline the process of placing children in foster care across state lines, reducing administrative costs and staff time. Since its inception, placement time has decreased by 30 percent for interstate foster care placements. The National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise (NEICE) has reduced placement time by 30% for interstate foster care placements. States using this system have decreased the time to identify a family for a child and start the ICPC process from 24 to 13 business days. The State Plan Requirement is outlined in Section 3. The Social Security Act is amended to include an electronic interstate case-processing system by October 1, 2026. The amendments will take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter after the enactment of the Act, applying to payments under part E of title IV for calendar quarters after that date. Legislation is required for a State plan under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet additional requirements imposed by amendments. The plan will not be considered failing to meet the requirements until after the first regular session of the State legislature following the enactment of the Act. If the State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. \"Grants for developing an electronic interstate case-processing system to expedite placement of children in foster care, guardianship, or adoption.\" Section 437 of the Social Security Act is amended to include grants for the development of an electronic interstate case-processing system to expedite the placement of children in foster care, guardianship, or adoption across state lines. States seeking a grant must submit an application outlining their goals and outcomes for the grant period. The grant application must outline goals and outcomes focused on reducing time for interstate placements, improving administrative processes, and facilitating real-time exchange of case files for foster care systems. It should also describe the activities to be funded. The grant application must outline activities funded with grant funds, strategies for integrating programs for children across State lines, and other required information. The Secretary may grant funds to compliant States for connecting with the electronic interstate case-processing system. The Secretary must report to Congress and the public on the impact of the electronic interstate case-processing system on the time it takes to place children across State lines. The report should also include the number of cases processed through the system and those processed outside of it by each State. The Secretary must report to Congress on the progress and impact of the electronic interstate case-processing system on child safety, well-being, administrative costs, and caseworker time spent on placing children across State lines. The assessment will include data integration with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children and States. The electronic interstate case-processing system aims to better protect children in the child welfare system by connecting with other data systems, simplifying reporting on sex trafficking victims and missing children, and enhancing States' ability to respond quickly. Improving States' ability to comply with background check requirements, including checks of child abuse and neglect registries. Section 437(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to change the year from 2016 to 2017. Section 437(b) is also amended to reserve $5,000,000 for improving the interstate placement of children, with the funds available through fiscal year 2021. Passed by the House of Representatives on March 22, 2016."
