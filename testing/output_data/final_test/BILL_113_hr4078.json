    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ITIN Reform Act of 2014\" and outlines requirements for the issuance of ITINs. The \"ITIN Reform Act of 2014\" amends Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code to include special rules for issuing individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs), requiring in-person application with specific documentation at an IRS taxpayer assistance center or submission for applicants residing outside the United States. The applicant submits the application in person to an IRS employee at a US diplomatic mission or consular post with required documentation. Initial on-site verification of documentation is conducted by an IRS employee at a taxpayer assistance center. Required documentation includes specific items. The applicant must provide required documentation to prove identity and foreign status, with only original documents accepted. Exceptions include military spouses and nonresident aliens claiming treaty benefits. An individual taxpayer identification number issued after the enactment of this subsection is valid for 5 years, renewable for an additional 5-year period through an application process. Existing ITINs issued before this subsection's enactment have special rules. The enactment of this subsection sets a 3-year validity period for individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) issued after the enactment date. Additionally, there are specific rules for ITINs issued before this subsection's enactment. The new subsection (h) states that no interest will be paid on overpayments until 45 days after an individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN) is issued. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will conduct audits of the ITIN issuance program every two years. The amendment made by subsection (b) applies to returns, claims, and refunds after the enactment of this Act for individual taxpayer identification numbers."
