    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1000 of the Penal Code in California is amended. This chapter applies to cases involving violations of specific sections of the Health and Safety Code, Vehicle Code, Penal Code, and Business and Professions Code, related to controlled substances, marijuana, narcotic drugs, and solicitation for personal use. The defendant must meet specific criteria under the Business and Professions Code for the prosecuting attorney to proceed with the case. The defendant must meet certain criteria for the prosecuting attorney to proceed with the case, including no prior convictions for controlled substances or violent offenses within five years prior to the alleged offense. The prosecuting attorney reviews the defendant's file to determine eligibility for pretrial diversion. If eligible, a declaration is filed with the court, and the hearing is set at arraignment. If ineligible, the grounds are stated, and the only remedy is a postconviction appeal. (c) Referrals for pretrial diversion must be made to certified programs or those providing free services deemed credible and effective by the court and county drug program administrator. Defendants can request referral to a program in any county meeting specified criteria. Pretrial diversion for a violation of Section 11368 of the Health and Safety Code does not prevent disciplinary action by administrative agencies or license denial. Any defendant in a program under this section may undergo urine analysis for drug testing, but results cannot be used for new criminal proceedings. The Penal Code is amended to include procedures for pretrial diversion and roles of involved parties. The court may grant pretrial diversion for specified crimes under Section 1000 if the defendant pleads not guilty, completes a program successfully, and receives a positive recommendation. The charge will be dismissed within six months to one year from the referral date. Upon any failure of treatment or condition, the prosecuting attorney, probation department, or court may motion to terminate pretrial diversion. Explanation of criminal record retention and rights post-completion are provided. The court may refer the case to the probation department or grant pretrial diversion if the defendant consents and waives their right to a speedy trial. The probation department will assess the defendant's background and recommend education, treatment, or rehabilitation programs, with the court making the final decision. The court has the final say on education, treatment, or rehabilitation for the defendant. Pretrial diversion may be granted if the defendant pleads not guilty, waives the right to a speedy trial, and the court deems it appropriate. No statements made by the defendant to probation officers or drug treatment workers during investigations are admissible in subsequent actions. Participation in pretrial diversion does not constitute a conviction or admission of guilt. Section 1000.2 of the Penal Code is amended to allow for a hearing to determine if the defendant consents to pretrial diversion. If consent is given, any bail bond on file will be exonerated. The period for pretrial diversion is between six months and one year, with the possibility of extension for good cause. Progress reports must be filed with the court. If the defendant performs unsatisfactorily or is convicted of a violent offense or felony, termination from pretrial diversion may be requested by the prosecuting attorney, court, or probation department. After notice, a hearing is held to determine if pretrial diversion should be terminated. If unsatisfactory performance or a conviction occurs, further proceedings are scheduled. Upon completion of pretrial diversion, the charges are dismissed. Prior to dismissing the charge or terminating pretrial diversion, the court considers the defendant's ability to pay and compliance with financial obligations. The defendant must reimburse the probation department for program investigation costs as directed. Section 1000.4 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 1000.4 of the Penal Code is amended to allow for the successful completion of a pretrial diversion program to result in the arrest being deemed to have never occurred. This record cannot be used against the defendant without consent for employment, benefits, licenses, or certificates. The defendant must be informed that the arrest may still be disclosed by the Department of Justice to law enforcement agencies, even after completing the pretrial diversion program. This disclosure requirement applies to any application for a position as a peace officer. The presiding judge, district attorney, and public defender may establish a preguilty plea drug court program with therapy, testing, monitoring, and counseling for designated defendants. If no agreement is reached, the program operates as a pretrial diversion program. The program shall be operated as a pretrial diversion program as provided in this chapter. Section 1000.3 and Section 1000.4 provisions apply to preguilty plea programs. If defendant doesn't perform satisfactorily, charges are reinstated. If defendant performs well, charges are dismissed. Section 1000.6 of the Penal Code allows participants in pretrial diversion or preguilty plea programs to use medications like methadone, buprenorphine, or LAAM for substance use disorders under the supervision of a licensed health care practitioner. Medical records may be released to the court to ensure compliance with program rules. If the conditions are met, using medications for substance use disorders won't exclude a person from pretrial diversion or preguilty plea programs. Participants must follow all court rules and provide a declaration from their healthcare practitioner stating they are under their care. Urinalysis results showing prescribed medication or substance use disorder treatment will not violate pretrial diversion terms. This section does not change diversion program provisions. Section 1000.7 clarifies that this chapter does not impact pretrial diversion programs under Section 1001."
