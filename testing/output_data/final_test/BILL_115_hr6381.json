In 2002, the Guam War Claims Review Commission was established to review the facts surrounding the implementation and administration of the Guam War Claims. The Guam Meritorious Claims Act of 1945 advised on compensation for victims of Japanese military forces during WWII. The Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act provided war claim payments to victims and survivors of the occupation of Guam. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission started reviewing war claims for victims and their families in June 2018.

The Secretary may use funds for this purpose if grant recipients are not available. Congress emphasizes the importance of employing and training residents of Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands for the War in the Pacific National Historical Park. Efforts should be made to recruit, hire, and train Guam residents as employees at the park. Additionally, the Secretary is granted direct hire authority. SEC. 6. DIRECT HIRE AUTHORITY. The Secretary of the Interior can appoint a qualified candidate directly to any future vacant position at the War in the Pacific National Historical Park without following certain provisions of title 5. SEC. 7. LAND CONVEYANCE TO GOVERNMENT OF GUAM. The Secretary must convey approximately 1 acre of Federal land to the Government of Guam for public benefit within 6 months of receiving a request from the Guam Waterworks Authority. The map of the land will be available for public inspection, and minor errors can be corrected by the Secretary. The Federal land to be conveyed to the Government of Guam must be surveyed and described accurately. The conveyance will have additional terms set by the Secretary to protect U.S. interests. The land can only be used by Guam Waterworks Authority for the public drinking water system, and if not used as specified, it will revert back to the U.S. If the parcel conveyed to Guam is not used as specified, it may revert back to the United States. Technical amendments are made to Section 6 of the Act regarding insular areas, including correcting a spelling error and clarifying a subsection reference."
