    "content": "The Act titled \"Pirate Fishing Vessel Disposal Act of 2011\" is referred to as the short title. It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that stateless vessels forfeited to the United States for engaging in illegal fishing have little economic value and pose environmental harm. The Navy and Coast Guard need to be prepared for maritime threats involving asymmetrical warfare. Using forfeited vessels for live-fire sinking exercises is crucial for preparing the Armed Forces for asymmetrical maritime warfare. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund can be utilized to prevent pollution and cover decontamination costs for these abandoned assets carrying hazardous substances. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the context of forfeited vessels and maritime warfare preparation. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Maritime Administration, and the term \"Commandant\" refers to the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard. A \"forfeited vessel\" is a foreign or stateless vessel forfeited to the United States for illegal fishing. \"Illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing\" refers to fishing activities conducted in waters without proper authorization. Illegal fishing refers to activities conducted in waters without permission or in violation of laws and regulations, including unreported or misreported activities by vessels flying the flag of a nation that is a member of a regional fisheries management organization. Illegal fishing can also include activities conducted by vessels flying the flag of a nation that is a cooperating non-member of a regional fisheries management organization, which are inconsistent with their commitments. It can also involve activities conducted by vessels without nationality or by vessels flying the flag of a nation that is not a member or cooperating non-member of that organization, undermining conservation and management measures. The term \"Under Secretary\" refers to the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere of the Department of Commerce. SEC. 4. USE OF FORFEITED VESSELS. The Commandant is authorized to use vessels for live-fire sinking exercises if deemed useful. Vessels can be transferred or under the Commandant's control as forfeited vessels. Agencies must transfer forfeited vessels to the Commandant for such exercises. If a forfeited vessel is not used for sinking exercises, it can be scrapped, recycled, sold, donated to a developing nation for fisheries enforcement, or donated for education and research purposes. The vessel must not be used for illegal fishing activities. Sinking exercises have specific location restrictions to protect marine habitats. The Commandant may invite the Armed Forces to participate. The Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force can participate in sinking exercises authorized by the Commandant. SEC. 5. DECONTAMINATION OF FORFEITED VESSELS. Before sinking a forfeited vessel in authorized exercises, the Commandant must remove any materials harmful to the marine environment to the fullest extent possible, following specific regulations and permits. The Commandant must consult with relevant agencies on decontamination procedures and remove any materials posing a threat to marine life before sinking a forfeited vessel. The Toxic Substances Control Act does not apply to sinking forfeited vessels in authorized exercises under this Act. SEC. 6. FUNDING. The Commandant is authorized to sink, scrap, or recycle forfeited vessels using funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for associated costs. The Pirate Fishing Vessel Disposal Act of 2011 allows for the payment of costs from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include provisions for the sale or donation of forfeited vessels. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to allow for expenses related to the sale or donation of vessels under the Pirate Fishing Vessel Disposal Act of 2011 to be reimbursed from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. This Act applies to forfeited vessels surrendered or seized after September 1, 2011."
