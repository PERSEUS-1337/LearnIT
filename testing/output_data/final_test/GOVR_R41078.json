    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created an Emergency Contingency Fund within the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant to help states, tribes, and territories provide economic aid during the 2009-2010 downturn. The TANF block grant offers federal funding for benefits and services to alleviate economic disadvantage for families with children, with a basic block grant of $16.5 billion. Each state receives a fixed amount since the 1996 welfare reform law, and states collectively must contribute at least $10.4 billion to TANF programs. The TANF block grant provides federal funding for programs to help low-income families with children. States must contribute a minimum of $10.4 billion to TANF-funded programs. Only 28% of TANF funds were spent on cash welfare in FY2009, with the rest used for various programs like child care, child abuse prevention, and youth programs. The number of families receiving cash welfare has decreased significantly since 1994. The TANF block grant provides federal funding for programs to help low-income families with children, including prevention programs, youth programs, and early childhood development. States bear the full cost of increased expenses without additional TANF funds. The 1996 welfare reform law created a Contingency Fund to assist states during recessions. The national cash assistance caseload increased by 13% from March 2008 to March 2010, with some states experiencing faster growth. The regular TANF contingency fund provided additional funding to 19 states in FY2009 and early FY2010. The ARRA included provisions to offset declines in family income due to recession, establishing a $5 billion ECF within TANF for FY2009 and FY2010. The ECF provided additional funding to states, tribes, and territories to address economic downturn costs. States like California and Florida met economic need criteria for contingency funds but did not draw them due to increased state spending requirements. The ECF within TANF reimbursed states, tribes, and territories for increased costs in three categories of expenditures: basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term aid, and subsidized employment. This funding focused on providing direct aid to families in need, such as cash welfare for low-income families. States had to show an increase in both the number of families receiving assistance and expenditures to qualify for increased basic assistance grants. The ECF grants reimbursed states, tribes, and territories for increased costs in basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term aid, and subsidized employment. Short-term aid was flexible and limited to a four-month timeframe, provided to families on and off cash assistance rolls. The ECF funding for non-recurrent short-term aid was based solely on increased expenditures in a current quarter compared to a base year. Families receiving only short-term aid were not subject to TANF cash welfare rules. The ECF reimbursed 80% of these expenditures. The ECF reimbursed 80% of increased expenditures on short-term non-recurrent aid from the base year to the current quarter, which included work subsidies for job subsidies in the private or public sector. States could subsidize jobs for those on cash assistance rolls and others without being subject to TANF rules. States only needed to show increased expenditures for subsidized employment to draw ECF grants. The ECF reimbursed 80% of increased expenditures on subsidized employment from the base year to the current quarter. States were limited in drawing funds from the ECF and TANF regular contingency fund, with a maximum of 50% of the basic block grant over FY2009 and FY2010. The ECF did not cover the full increase in expenditures for basic assistance. The ECF provided an 80% reimbursement for increased costs in basic assistance, short-term aid, and subsidized employment. States could use reallocated funds from TANF block grants or MOE monies to cover the remaining 20%. In-kind third party payments could also count towards the 20%, with a limit of 25% of an employee's wage for supervisory time. At the end of FY2010, $5 billion from the ECF was awarded to states, tribes, and territories. TANF ECF grant awards included funding for basic assistance, short-term aid, and subsidized employment. A total of 49 states and territories received ECF funds, with most funds allocated for basic assistance caseload increases. Wyoming and Guam did not receive ECF grants. In FY2010, $5 billion from the Emergency Contingency Fund (ECF) was awarded to states, tribes, and territories for basic assistance, short-term aid, and subsidized employment. 44 jurisdictions received funds for short-term aid, 42 for subsidized employment, and 25 tribes received ECF grants totaling $14.2 million. Some states reached their maximum contingency fund allotment, with limits set at 50% of their basic TANF block grant over FY2009 and FY2010. In FY2010, states received awards from the regular TANF contingency fund and the ECF to provide economic support during the recession. Despite economic growth, high unemployment persisted. Welfare caseloads have not always followed economic trends. President Obama proposed a new Emergency Fund for FY2011. President Obama's FY2011 budget proposed a $2.5 billion Emergency Fund, but the Senate did not approve it. The House tried to extend the fund in 2010, but it was not successful. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 extended the basic TANF program through FY2011 without the Emergency Fund."
