    "content": "Federal advisory committees are established by Congress, Presidents, and executive branch agencies to gather expertise and policy advice from individuals outside the federal government. These committees bring together experts with diverse opinions to make recommendations on various policy actions. They provide a formalized mechanism for private-sector citizens to participate in federal policymaking. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was enacted in 1972 to regulate the operations of these committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 defines operational requirements for federal advisory committees, excluding committees composed of full-time government employees or created by certain organizations. It is sometimes unclear if FACA should apply to specific committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) of 1972 defines operational requirements for federal advisory committees. It is sometimes unclear if FACA should apply to specific committees, depending on how committee members are appointed and to which branch they report. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains guidelines for federal advisory committees, with 1,009 active committees in FY2015 reporting total operating costs of $367,568,370 and 72,200 members across 49 departments and agencies. In the 114th Congress, a bill (H.R. 2347) was introduced to amend the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) by requiring non-partisan selection of committee members and ensuring compliance for subcommittees and privately contracted committees. H.R. 2347 aims to clarify ethics requirements for committee members and increase federal advisory committee records access. The bill passed the House on March 1, 2016, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on March 2, 2016. It seeks to enhance transparency and public participation in federal advisory committees, but may also raise time and cost concerns. The report provides a history of FACA, analyzes committee operations and costs, with a focus on FY2015. George Washington initiated the tradition of utilizing outside expertise to advise the president in 1794. Congress has legislated control over federal advisory bodies since the 1840s by limiting funding and committee member pay. Laws enacted in 1842 and 1909 prohibited payment and appropriation to unauthorized commissions. By the 20th century, some Members of Congress were involved in overseeing advisory bodies. In the 20th century, some Members of Congress believed executive branch advisory bodies were inefficient and not accessible to the public, leading to concerns about duplication of federal efforts. This prompted the enactment of FACA in 1972, requiring advisory bodies to report information annually to GSA for oversight. FACA, enacted in 1972, addresses concerns about federal advisory committees by establishing statutory requirements for their management and oversight. The law mandates that advisory committees are advisory only and their recommendations are determined by the relevant official or agency. FACA assigns oversight and management responsibilities to Congress, OMB (now transferred to GSA), agency heads, and the President. It also sets requirements for the formation and oversight of federal advisory committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires congressional committees to review the necessity and balance of federal advisory committees under their jurisdiction. Committees must have autonomy to avoid undue influence, clear reporting requirements, and adequate funding. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees advisory committees, with the Director tasked to review existing entities for potential abolition and provide guidance. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) mandates the creation of operating policies for advisory committees to improve performance. Guidelines include pay rates, overall costs, and budget recommendations to Congress. Agency heads must ensure proper implementation and maintain information on committee operations. In 1977, OMB's duties were reassigned to GSA. FACA committee recommendations are advisory and cannot mandate policy action, but presidential advisory committees require the President to submit proposals to Congress within a year of receiving a public report. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires the President to report annually to Congress on advisory committees' activities and composition changes. FACA mandates that only Congress, the President, or an agency head can create advisory committees, which must file a charter outlining their mission, duties, and operating costs. Committee meetings must be advertised in the Federal Register and open to the public. FACA defines an \"advisory committee\" as any group established by statute, the President, or agencies for obtaining advice. FACA applies when an advisory committee is established or utilized by an agency. Advisory committees established by federal agencies may be exempt from FACA regulations if they consist solely of federal employees or are created by specific entities like the National Academy of Sciences. The FACA criteria govern advisory committees created by the executive branch. Advisory committees created by statute may not always be required to follow FACA regulations, depending on which branch appoints members and to whom they report. The hosting agency typically determines FACA applicability, and Congress may clarify FACA status in committee-establishing legislation. FACA regulations may enhance government transparency but also impose burdensome requirements on advisory committees, potentially hindering their ability to focus on substantive issues. Some argue that FACA's openness requirements could stifle candid discussion within committees. Congress may exempt statutorily established advisory committees from FACA to operate more efficiently. In FY2015, 1,009 FACA committees reported a total of 72,200 members and a cost of $367,568,370 to the federal government. The number of committees has remained consistent over the past five years, with a 3.5% increase in committee members. The number of active FACA committees varied from FY2011 to FY2015, with FY2011 having the highest at 1,029 and FY2014 the lowest at 989. Majority of the committees were required by statute, with 53.4% established by Congress in FY2015. The number of committee members increased inconsistently from 69,750 in FY2011 to 72,220 in FY2015, marking a 5.9% increase from FY2014. Operating costs for FACA committees were also reported from FY2011 to FY2015. The costs of operating FACA committees decreased from FY2011 to FY2014, with the highest cost in FY2011 at $416,398,354. In FY2015, costs increased to $367,568,370 with 2,450 additional members joining. FACA requires committee recommendations to be accessible to the public, with some exceptions under the Government in the Sunshine Act. Committee meetings addressing classified information, proprietary data, and personnel privacy may be closed to the public. Adequate notice must be published in advance, and all papers and records must be available for public inspection. Membership must be balanced, and the committee should not be influenced by special interests. Most committee meetings are closed to the public despite FACA requirements for openness. In FY2015, 71.1% of committee meetings were closed to the public due to specified exceptions like grant-making advice. Advisory committees under FACA must submit a charter every two years with details on mandate, meetings, and membership. GSA annually reviews committee accomplishments and maintains a public database of FACA bodies. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires agencies to maintain an online database of FACA bodies with detailed information. Committees have a two-year lifespan unless Congress specifies otherwise in statute. Executive-branch advisory committees with non-federal members are subject to FACA. Each agency must have a committee management officer (CMO) to oversee advisory committees and maintain related records. According to FACA, agencies must maintain records related to committee proceedings and adhere to the Sunshine Act. A designated federal official (DFO) must be present at meetings, and committees must be essential to the executive branch's duties. Agencies should review and eliminate obsolete or duplicative committees, and all committees created since FACA's enactment must sunset after two years unless specified otherwise. H.R. 2347, introduced by Representative William Lacy Clay, aims to amend the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) to increase transparency in committee establishment and member selection. It seeks to enhance public access to federal advisory committees, clarify ethics requirements for members, and extend FACA regulations to federally contracted advisory committees. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Committee on Ways and Means. H.R. 2347, introduced by Representative William Lacy Clay, passed the House and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The bill aims to modify the committee-member appointment process by requiring agencies to publish a request for public comments on appointments in the Federal Register. Public recommendations would be considered in the selection process without regard to their. H.R. 2347 would require nonpartisan selection of committee members and designate them as representatives or special government employees. It mandates adherence to ethics requirements for all federal advisory committee members and subcommittees. Agency heads must ensure independent participation and expression of views by committee members. H.R. 2347 mandates nonpartisan selection of committee members, designates them as representatives or special government employees, and requires agencies to provide transparency in the process of establishing advisory committees. This includes posting meeting minutes, transcripts, and descriptions of the selection process on agency websites. The agency must justify the need for representative members and provide a list of current members, including details on nominations and designations. SGE members with conflict of interest certifications must have their certifications and reasons for them posted online. The bill outlines requirements for advisory committees, including recusal agreements, decision-making processes, meeting minutes, meeting accessibility efforts, meeting closure determinations, future meeting notices, and additional relevant information. It also specifies information needed in a FACA committee charter. The Administrative Conference of the United States released recommendations to improve FACA, including inviting public comment on committee members, explicit ethics requirements, posting waivers online, removing the cap on committees, webcasting meetings, posting documents online, and specifying mission, duration, membership balance, and budget in statutes creating FACA committees. Congress has used FACA to gain control and oversight of committees created by the President or executive branch. FACA has increased transparency and recordkeeping for advisory committees. Some parts of FACA are unclear, such as whether advisory committees should adhere to it. Congress may enact legislation to clarify which bodies are subject to FACA. The applicability of FACA is clearest when established by the President or an agency head. FACA applies when a committee is established by the President or an agency head, performs advisory duties, includes a non-federal member, and reports to an executive branch agency or the President. If a committee is created by statute and reports to Congress and the President, its FACA status is uncertain. FACA aims to provide transparency for federal advisory committees, and Congress may pass legislation to require all statutorily established committees to follow FACA's transparency provisions. This could potentially limit Congress's ability to establish committees with flexibility. Congress could clarify whether committees created by or reporting to Congress should follow FACA's transparency requirements. Members of Congress could include transparency provisions in a committee's statutory authority to balance flexibility and oversight. Concerns about government transparency may arise if statutorily established committees are exempted from FACA. Ongoing confusion may persist if Congress does not amend FACA. There is confusion regarding whether statutorily required committees that report to both Congress and the executive are subject to FACA's requirements, which could lead to legal challenges. Congress may need to clarify if federal advisory committee members must follow certain ethics requirements. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring committee members' interests and affiliations comply with conflict of interest statutes and federal ethics rules. Not all committee members are required to adhere to all federal ethics codes, according to the Code of Federal Regulations. If a committee member is designated as an SGE, they are subject to federal ethics regulations. H.R. 2347 aims to clarify the ethical responsibilities of advisory committee members by requiring explicit designation as SGEs or representatives. This legislation may be seen as redundant with existing federal ethics laws, and Congress may also seek to make the selection process for FACA committee members more transparent and participatory. The Federal Register requested comments and appointment recommendations for agency membership appointments. The Administrative Conference of the United States suggested inviting public nominations for committee members. Congress may consider requiring public comment on advisory committee appointments to bring in new ideas. However, this could slow down the process of establishing a federal advisory committee. The enactment of FACA involved debates and hearings in Congress and actions by the executive branch. In the 1940s and 1950s, private sector advisory committees influenced federal operations with guidelines from the Department of Justice. Concerns arose about their authority, leading to the need for FACA. In the 1940s and 1950s, private sector advisory committees faced concerns about overstepping their authority. The Department of Justice released legal opinions on the creation and oversight of these committees, setting limits on their ability to offer unsolicited policy advice to the government. Guidelines were established for the formation of valid federal advisory committees, requiring statutory authority or administrative findings for their use. The Department of Justice set guidelines for the formation of federal advisory committees in the 1940s and 1950s, requiring statutory authority or administrative findings for their use. A bill introduced in 1957 aimed to make DOJ's advisory committee requirements law, emphasizing the need for uniform regulations to protect the public interest. The bill introduced in 1957 aimed to make DOJ's advisory committee requirements law, requiring annual reports on committee membership and compliance with standards. President Kennedy later reinforced these requirements with an executive order in 1962. The formation and guidelines for federal advisory committees were established by Executive Order 11007 and Circular No. A-63 in the early 1960s and 1970s. The lifespan of these committees was limited to two years unless extended by agency heads. The circular outlined policies for creating, maintaining, and terminating advisory committees, including discouraging dual chairmanships and requiring annual status reports. In the early 1960s and early 1970s, Congress debated the need for oversight of advisory committees, while the executive branch argued against legislation citing Circular No. A-63. President Nixon issued E.O. 11671 in June 1972, setting new standards for advisory entities. This order included elements later seen in the Federal Advisory Committee Act, giving oversight responsibilities to the Office of Management and Budget. Congress reacted by holding hearings on the executive branch's use of advisory committees. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Senate Committee on Government Operations' Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations held hearings to examine the rights of people to access information and take action. Over 30 witnesses testified, leading to the conclusion that while advisory committees were useful for providing expert advice, many were duplicative, ineffective, and costly. Effective mechanisms for oversight were lacking in Federal agencies, the Executive Office of the President, and Congress. In December 1970, the House Committee on Government Operations' Special Studies Subcommittee issued a report on the role and effectiveness of Federal Advisory Committees. Representative John Mongan introduced the Federal Advisory Committee Standards Act in February 1971 to address the responsibilities of Congress, the Director of OMB, the President, and agency heads in controlling and maintaining federal advisory bodies. The congressional committees were tasked with reviewing and eliminating duplicative advisory bodies, clarifying missions, and ensuring adequate resources. The Director of OMB was to conduct a comprehensive review and recommend elimination or merger of advisory bodies. Senator William V. Roth, Jr. introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Senator Roth introduced a bill to authorize the Office of Management and Budget to govern advisory committees in the Federal Government due to a lack of oversight. With over 2,600 advisory committees currently in operation, the complexity of government functions has led to an increase in advisory committees advising decision-makers. Congress has neglected to provide adequate controls to supervise the large number of advisory committees, leading to criticism in the media. H.R. 4383, with \"openness provisions\" under the FOIA, was passed by the House, while S. 3529 aimed to merge the goals of various committees. S. 3529, introduced in 1972, aimed to streamline advisory committees by strengthening Congress and the executive branch's authority to limit their use to essential purposes. It also focused on providing uniform standards for their creation, operation, and management, ensuring transparency, and making committees advisory only. The Senate debated on mandating public participation and transparency in committee meetings and recordkeeping. S. 3529 aimed to streamline advisory committees by strengthening Congress and the executive branch's authority. The bill required public information requests for committee records under FOIA but did not specify membership or participation requirements. Amendments exempting certain committees were added before the bill passed the Senate. The final bill included reporting requirements for advisory committees. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was signed into law on October 6, 1972, by President Nixon, replacing E.O. 11671. Amendments and efforts have been made to clarify and streamline FACA committees, including the incorporation of the Sunshine Act in 1977. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) was signed into law in 1972, incorporating the Sunshine Act to increase transparency in government agency meetings. In 1977, oversight duties were transferred to the Administrator of General Services. Various executive orders have been issued to abolish or extend federal advisory committees. Efforts to strengthen management controls and establish new requirements for committee members were introduced in Congress from 1983 to 1989, but none were enacted. President Clinton issued E.O. 12838 in 1993, mandating each executive department to terminate a third of their committees. E.O. 12838 required executive departments to terminate one-third of advisory committees subject to FACA by the end of fiscal year 1993. Agency heads had to justify the need for committees or eliminate them. Vice President Albert Gore later mandated a 5% reduction in advisory committee costs. President Clinton would not support new legislation establishing or exempting advisory committees from FACA. Alice M. Rivlin released a circular in 1994 detailing management policy for remaining FACA committees. In 1995, two FACA-related laws were enacted, exempting intergovernmental advisory actions and eliminating GSA's annual reporting requirements to Congress. GSA stopped creating its Annual Report to Congress in 1998 but continues to publish the Annual Comprehensive Review to assess advisory bodies' missions. The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997 expanded public participation in advisory bodies within the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration."
