The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include qualified non-redeemable ground rents as interest on an indebtedness secured by a mortgage. Amendments are made to section 1055 of the Code by removing \"redeemable\" from the heading. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, with respect to taxable years ending after such date. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a credit for transaction costs on the transfer of land subject to certain ground rents. This amendment is added after section 30 in Subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The Internal Revenue Code now includes a credit for transaction costs related to the sale or exchange of land subject to ground rents. This credit is allowed to both the transferor and transferee, with limitations per dwelling unit. The credit allowed for transaction costs related to the sale or exchange of land is limited to $5,000 per dwelling unit or 10% of the sale price of the land. Additionally, the credit is further limited based on taxable income, not exceeding 20% of the regular tax for the year reduced by certain credits and the alternative minimum tax. The term \"transaction costs\" refers to expenses directly related to conveying land subject to ground rents, including closing costs, attorney fees, surveys, and travel expenses. It does not cover lost rents from terminating a lease prematurely. A dwelling unit is defined as a structure serving as the lessee's principal residence. The basis of property acquired in a transaction under this section is reduced by the credit allowed. Taxpayers must elect for this section to apply for the taxable year. Any excess credit can be carried over to the following 5 years. The unused credit for an unused credit year can be carried over to the earliest of the 5 taxable years. Any remaining unused credit can then be carried over to the next 4 taxable years. This section does not apply to transaction costs incurred after December 31, 1999. The table of sections for subpart B is amended by inserting a new item after section 30 in 1999. The amendments made by section 30A provide a credit for transaction costs on land transfers with certain ground rents, effective for expenditures after December 31, 1994."
