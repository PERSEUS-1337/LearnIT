    "content": "The Act titled \"Children and Firefighters Protection Act of 2014\" prohibits the sale of certain products containing specified flame retardants. The Children and Firefighters Protection Act of 2014 prohibits the sale of children's products or upholstered furniture containing specified flame retardants exceeding 1,000 parts per million total chemical content by weight. The specified flame retardant mentioned is Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP). The following chemicals are prohibited in children's products or upholstered furniture under the Children and Firefighters Protection Act of 2014:\n- Tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate\n- Tetrabromobisphenol A\n- Decabromodiphenyl ether\n- Antimony trioxide\n- Hexabromocyclododecane\n- Bis(2-Ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromophthalate\n- 2-Ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate\n- Chlorinated paraffins\n- Tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate The Commission appoints a chronic hazard advisory panel to study the health effects of chemical flame retardants in children's products and furniture within a specified timeframe. The Commission appoints a panel to study potential health effects of chemical flame retardants in children's products and furniture, including developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, genetic damage, reproductive toxicity, endocrine disruption, and systemic toxicity. The Commission appoints a panel to study potential health effects of chemical flame retardants in children's products and furniture, including developmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, genetic damage, reproductive toxicity, endocrine disruption, and systemic toxicity. The panel will assess the persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of the flame retardants, as well as their potential health effects in isolation and in combination with other flame retardants. Biomonitoring studies will be conducted to determine existing and future levels of these chemicals in children, pregnant women, firefighters, and others. The panel appointed by the Commission will review data on chemical flame retardants in household environments, considering cumulative exposure from various sources like children's products, furniture, food, and electronics. They will analyze the most recent scientific studies on these flame retardants to assess potential health effects. The panel appointed by the Commission will review data on chemical flame retardants in household environments, considering cumulative exposure from various sources like children's products, furniture, food, and electronics. They will analyze the most recent scientific studies on these flame retardants to assess potential health effects. The panel's examinations will be conducted de novo, reviewing previous findings but not considering them determinative. Considerations include objective data collection practices, amounts of flame retardants used, and possible health effects in children's products and upholstered furniture. The panel appointed by the Commission will submit a report with recommendations on chemical flame retardants to be prohibited. The Commission will evaluate the findings and recommendations within 180 days. The Commission will evaluate recommendations from the chronic hazard advisory panel on chemical flame retardants, and promulgate a final rule specifying prohibited chemicals that may cause harm, such as developmental disabilities, cancer, and endocrine disruption. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will treat violations of the prohibition on harmful chemicals as violations of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Products under this section are exempt from certain testing requirements. The Commission will issue rules to implement this section. Section 553 of title 5, United States Code exempts rulemaking under this section from certain requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act. State laws regarding chemical flame retardants in children's products or upholstered furniture are not affected unless they conflict with this section. The Act will take effect on the specified date. The Act will take effect on the date of enactment, with subsection (b) taking effect one year later. Subsection (b) applies to children's products and upholstered furniture manufactured after the one-year mark."
