    "content": "The modern congressional budget process began with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which established the current budget process. Significant revisions and additions were made with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and other laws. The process involves the annual adoption of a multiyear budget plan in the form of a concurrent resolution, serving as an internal blueprint for congressional budgetary legislation. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 established the modern congressional budget process, including House and Senate Budget Committees and the Congressional Budget Office. The budget resolution sets policies for revenue, spending, deficit/surplus, and debt, enforced during consideration of budget legislation. The emergence of large deficits in the 1980s led to revisions in the budget process. The emergence of large deficits in the 1980s motivated Congress to strengthen budget enforcement procedures through the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. This act set declining annual deficit targets to move towards a balanced budget by FY1991, enforced through sequestration with across-the-board spending cuts in nonexempt programs. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 set deficit targets to achieve a balanced budget by FY1991, enforced through sequestration with spending cuts in nonexempt programs. The act was modified in 1987 to give the authority to trigger a sequester to the director of the Office of Management and Budget and extend the goal of a balanced budget to FY1993. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 set deficit targets to achieve a balanced budget by FY1991, enforced through sequestration with spending cuts in nonexempt programs. The act was modified in 1987, extending the goal of a balanced budget to FY1993. The sequestration process relied on executive actions, with three deficit sequesters occurring for FY1986, FY1988, and FY1990, resulting in substantial initial outlay savings. In FY1990, across-the-board spending cuts ranged from 4.3% to 10.5%, but savings were rescinded or reduced in subsequent years. Despite sequesters, deficits exceeded targets by an average of $60 billion. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 revised procedures under the Balanced Budget Act due to ongoing deficit difficulties. The OMB director estimated a $147.3 billion deficit for FY1991, $83.3 billion over the target of $64 billion. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 extended deficit targets through FY1995, replacing them with statutory limits on discretionary spending and the PAYGO process. Sequestration was retained as the means of enforcing the new procedures, which were revised and extended by budget reconciliation legislation in 1993 and 1997. The PAYGO rules were enacted in 1993 and 1997, with the Senate establishing its own rule in 1993 and the House in 2007. The rules differ from the statutory PAYGO process and are currently in effect through September 30, 2017. The statutory PAYGO process originated in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 and was terminated by P.L. 107-312. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, reduced the deficit by $482 billion over five years. Title XIII of the act, known as the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) of 1990, made amendments to various budget laws and rules. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established deficit-reduction procedures for FY1991-FY1995 and made permanent changes in the budget process to promote fiscal responsibility. This fulfilled commitments made during negotiations for a bipartisan budget agreement. The President emphasized the need for budget process reform in order to bring the deficit under responsible control. H.R. 5835, passed under a special rule in the 101st Congress, was approved by the House and Senate with budget process titles added through amendments. The Senate passed its version of the reconciliation legislation by a vote of 54-46. House and Senate conferees filed a conference report on H.R. 5835 on October 26. The BEA of 1990 established a PAYGO process to impose deficit neutrality on direct spending and revenue legislation. Legislation proposing new direct spending or decreasing revenues could not result in a net cost for a fiscal year. The PAYGO process aimed to preserve deficit reduction achieved in OBRA of 1990 by maintaining on-budget deficit levels. In the 1990s, discretionary spending limits were extended through budget reconciliation acts resulting from agreements between the President and Congress. The enforcement procedures were modified in 1993 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, extending them through FY1998 to preserve deficit reduction. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 further modified the enforcement procedures. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, implemented deficit reduction and tax relief policies. Title X of the act extended enforcement procedures through FY2002 and made adjustments, including extending the PAYGO process. The PAYGO requirement, enacted through FY2002, was terminated by P.L. 107-312 in December 2002. OMB indicated a balance exceeding $110 billion for FY2003 and over $130 billion for FY2004-FY2006. Congress and the President were expected to prevent a PAYGO sequester through procedural means. The PAYGO requirement was terminated in December 2002 by P.L. 107-312. Congress and the President took steps to prevent a PAYGO sequester for FY2003 by passing H.R. 5708, signed into law by President George W. Bush. This legislation eliminated the threat of a sequester by reducing the PAYGO balance to zero for FY2003 and subsequent years. The PAYGO process was intended to operate with zero balances for FY2004-FY2006. It analyzed final determinations made by the OMB director and the use of emergency designations. The process involved directed scorekeeping and major legislation enacted under PAYGO procedures, with actions scheduled under a fixed timetable to prevent a sequester at the end of the session. The sequestration process was modified over the years, with actions under the PAYGO process synchronized with discretionary spending limits. Enforcement procedures for PAYGO and discretionary spending were separated by a \"firewall,\" with violations corrected by reductions in the respective programs. Savings on one side of the firewall could not benefit programs on the other side. The PAYGO process, outlined in the 1985 Balanced Budget Act, included enforcement procedures for discretionary spending limits and deficit targets. It also covered definitions, sequestration reports, exempt programs, general rules, and budget baseline construction. The requirement applied to direct spending and prevented savings on one side of the \"firewall\" from benefiting programs on the other side. The PAYGO requirement applied to outlay levels rather than budget authority, with OMB required to provide cost estimates for budgetary measures within seven days of enactment. Cost estimates had to be based on the President's budget assumptions and include CBO estimates, recorded on a rolling PAYGO \"scorecard\" by the OMB director. The PAYGO sequestration process involved the OMB director issuing sequestration reports at different stages of the congressional session based on how legislation affected the net cost for a fiscal year on the PAYGO scorecard. The CBO director also issued advisory sequestration reports. The OMB director's final sequestration report triggers automatic spending cuts if there is a net cost on the PAYGO scorecard. The sequester must occur within 15 days after Congress adjourns and eliminate any positive balance on the scorecard from legislation enacted in the current and prior fiscal years. The impact of direct spending and revenue legislation enacted after the OMB director's final sequestration report was recorded on the PAYGO scorecard in the following session. Emergency legislation designated by the President and in statute was not subject to PAYGO sequestration. Social Security and many other programs were exempt from sequestration, with limited reductions in Medicare spending and special rules for selected programs. Section 258 of the 1985 Balanced Budget Act allowed for the suspension of budget enforcement procedures in cases of low economic growth or war. The suspension of selected budget enforcement procedures due to low economic growth was triggered by a \"low-growth report\" issued by CBO. Congress and the President could enact a \"suspension resolution\" to suspend these procedures. This provision was utilized only twice during periods of sustained low economic growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Despite CBO issuing low-growth reports in 1991, measures to suspend enforcement procedures were defeated in the Senate. The Senate defeated suspension resolutions on enforcement procedures in response to CBO's low-growth reports. The suspension procedure expired in 2006, and despite military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, a declaration of war was not enacted to trigger the suspension. Confusion arose in the late 1990s regarding the PAYGO requirement as the budget shifted from deficit to surplus. The PAYGO requirement caused confusion in the late 1990s as the budget moved from deficit to surplus. OMB clarified that PAYGO still applies even with an on-budget surplus, based on how legislation affects the PAYGO scorecard. The OMB director issued sequestration reports annually to determine if a PAYGO sequester was needed, but only 12 reports were issued over a 15-year period. The PAYGO requirement was effectively terminated in late 2002, with the final sequestration report for FY2003 being the last one. The OMB director had to combine the balances of the budget year and the preceding year to determine if a PAYGO sequester was necessary. The purpose of adding the balance for the current year was to capture budgetary effects of legislation enacted after the final sequestration report but before the next congressional session. Positive balances on the PAYGO scorecard reflected greater spending increases/revenue reductions than reductions/increases. A zero or negative combined balance for the current year and fiscal year meant no sequester was needed. OMB director's final sequestration reports for FY1992-FY2003 showed no sequesters were required. During FY1992-FY2006, no PAYGO sequester was required as the final combined balances were either negative or zero. The average combined balance for the first nine fiscal years was -$2.130 billion, with only one year showing a positive balance offset by a negative balance. For the remaining six fiscal years, the final combined balances were all zero, indicating compliance with the PAYGO requirement. Adjustments were made in some cases due to emergency requirements or directed scorekeeping provisions in law. During FY1992-FY2006, no PAYGO sequester was required as the final combined balances were either negative or zero. Adjustments were made in some cases due to emergency requirements or directed scorekeeping provisions in law. Table 2 shows the 5-year total balances on the PAYGO scorecard as scored by the OMB director in each final sequestration report. The balances ranged from -$3.003 billion to $1.188 billion in different fiscal years. During FY1992-FY2006, no PAYGO sequester was required as final combined balances were negative or zero. In FY2000-FY2002, balances changed significantly from -$3.014 billion to $371.122 billion. Final PAYGO balances for FY2003-FY2006 were reduced to zero in compliance with P.L. 107-312. The OMB director provided multi-year balances on the PAYGO scorecard in Table 3. The 1985 Balanced Budget Act allowed for emergency designations of direct spending or revenue legislation, exempting them from the PAYGO scorecard. This designation was rarely used for direct spending or revenue provisions, but was significant in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act (P.L. 107-147). Under the PAYGO process, the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act (P.L. 107-147) was signed into law on March 9, 2002. Section 502 of the act designated certain amounts as emergency requirements, including reductions in federal revenues and new budget authority for fiscal years 2002 through 2011. The Committee on Finance of the Senate designated emergency requirements for fiscal years 2002 through 2011. The OMB director's final sequestration report for FY2003 removed net costs of $88.723 billion from the PAYGO scorecard over FY2002-FY2006. Another emergency designation was made for the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (P.L. 107-42) totaling $8.000 billion over three years. The provisions in the act amounted to $8.000 billion over three years. Additionally, there were direct spending and revenue provisions expected to yield costs of $6.130 billion over FY2001-FY2004. CBO estimated costs for provisions in other measures at $5.7 billion for FY1993-FY1994 and $0.130 billion for FY1998-FY2003. In response to budgetary impacts, Congress and the President utilized emergency requirements and modified the PAYGO process through legislative interventions. This included directing the OMB director on how to treat budgetary effects in legislation. These actions were taken to address deficit-reduction measures and other financial challenges. The PAYGO process faced challenges due to unintended negative balances and significant reductions in revenues coupled with direct spending increases. The barrier between PAYGO and discretionary spending limits led to threats of triggering a PAYGO sequester in some years. The PAYGO process faced challenges due to unintended negative balances and significant reductions in revenues coupled with direct spending increases. Congress and the President enacted provisions in multiple laws to intervene in the normal operation of the PAYGO requirement, including scorekeeping directions to the OMB director and reclassifying spending provisions in appropriations acts. The PAYGO process faced challenges due to unintended negative balances and significant reductions in revenues coupled with direct spending increases. Congress and the President enacted provisions in multiple laws to intervene in the normal operation of the PAYGO requirement, including scorekeeping directions to the OMB director and reclassifying spending provisions in appropriations acts. Directed scorekeeping provisions prevented the Appropriations Committees from being held responsible for budgetary provisions that were the responsibility of other House and Senate committees. Statutory interventions in the PAYGO process involving directed scorekeeping and their implications for sequesters are detailed in tables provided. The OMB director was instructed to remove savings from legislation on the scorecard, totaling $504.763 billion from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and $6.301 billion from the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY1997. Additionally, $41.144 billion in prior savings were removed, and $73.700 billion in savings from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 were not counted. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 prohibited counting net costs of $15.193 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 prohibited counting net costs of $15.193 billion on the scorecard, set balances to zero for FY2000-FY2004, and removed savings and costs from the scorecard. Directed scorekeeping also removed costs that would have led to sequesters in subsequent years. The legislative vehicles for directed scorekeeping provisions did not make adjustments in the FY1991-FY1993 balances on the PAYGO scorecard. From FY1994-FY2000, adjustments removed savings balances or did not count savings provisions, totaling $628.980 billion through FY2006. For FY2001-FY2006, adjustments removed cost balances or did not count cost provisions, ranging from $9.214 billion to $140.221 billion. The cumulative effect of directed scorekeeping provisions from FY1991-FY2006 was to remove savings balances or not count savings provisions, totaling $628.980 billion. For FY2001-FY2006, adjustments removed cost balances or did not count cost provisions, ranging from $9.214 billion to $150.790 billion. In FY2000, the Consolidated Appropriations Act prohibited scoring changes on the PAYGO scorecard, preventing costs of $1.552 billion for that year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 prevented costs of $1.552 billion from being added to the PAYGO scorecard. Additionally, Section 1001 of the act instructed the OMB director to change any balances on the scorecard to zero on January 3, 2000, removing savings and costs that could have triggered PAYGO sequesters in subsequent years. Congress and the President concluded the 2000 session by enacting the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001, P.L. 106-554, enacted appropriations and direct spending/revenue legislation. It prohibited scoring changes under discretionary spending limits but required them on the PAYGO scorecard. Costs of $7.170 billion for FY2001 were added to the scorecard, preventing a PAYGO sequester. Further actions by the OMB director zeroed out balances on the scorecard, avoiding sequesters for FY2002-FY2005. Total costs on the PAYGO scorecard amounted to $74.527 billion for those years. The Defense Appropriations Act for FY2002 prevented a PAYGO sequester by setting the balances on the PAYGO scorecard to zero, avoiding a $130.279 billion cost for FY2001-FY2002. The OMB director's report noted a potential $33.3 billion savings from a PAYGO sequester for FY2002. The OMB indicated in a sequestration report for FY2003 that the PAYGO scorecard balance was $110.694 billion. The balances for FY2004-FY2006 were $130 billion, $131 billion, and $135 billion, respectively. Despite the lack of agreement on a budget resolution for FY2003, it was clear that a sequester was not necessary. During the 2002 budget resolution, Congress and the President did not agree on policies to eliminate the FY2003 balance on the PAYGO scorecard. Instead, they used procedural means to prevent a PAYGO sequester. The OMB reported a combined balance of $125.6 billion for FY2002 and FY2003, with only $31.1 billion eligible for cuts under a PAYGO sequester. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act (P.L. 107-147) had a significant budgetary impact, with estimated costs of $46.538 billion for FY2002, $36.878 billion for FY2003, and $88.723 billion over FY2002-FY2006. To prevent a PAYGO sequester for FY2003, H.R. 5708 was passed to reduce preexisting PAYGO balances. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act (P.L. 107-147) had a significant budgetary impact, with estimated costs for FY2002, FY2003, and FY2002-FY2006. To prevent a PAYGO sequester for FY2003, H.R. 5708 was passed to reduce preexisting PAYGO balances to zero. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on December 2, 2002, as P.L. 107-312. The House passed the bill on November 14 by a vote of 366-19, and the Senate passed it the next day without amendment by unanimous consent. In the final sequestration report for FY2003, issued on December 6, 2002, the OMB director indicated a combined balance of $127.386 billion for legislation enacted through September 30, 2002. Balances for FY2002 and FY2003 were $2.320 billion and $125.066 billion respectively. Balances for FY2002-FY2006 totaled $559.693 billion. The OMB director set final balances for all fiscal years on the PAYGO scorecard to zero as required by P.L. 107-312. Various unsuccessful efforts were made to intervene in the PAYGO process, including instructions to reset balances or not to score direct spending and revenue changes. The House passed a measure in 1998 to prevent estimates of changes in receipts on the PAYGO scorecard due to a bill enactment, avoiding a sequester for FY1999. Legislation changing the budget process required a waiver, which was granted by adopting a special rule. During the 106th Congress, a directed scorekeeping provision was included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 but was dropped in the Senate. President Clinton vetoed the measure in part due to the absence of the provision leading to a sequester. Congressional leadership attempted to use a House-passed bill amending the Small Business Investment Act as a vehicle for various issues, including revenue reductions. The bill would have enacted five other measures, including the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2000, which aimed to prevent a PAYGO sequester.

President Clinton vetoed the measure in part due to the absence of the provision leading to a sequester. Congressional leadership attempted to use a House-passed bill amending the Small Business Investment Act as a vehicle for various issues, including revenue reductions. The bill would have enacted five other measures, including the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2000, which aimed to prevent a PAYGO sequester introduced on October 25, 2000. Section 731(a) of H.R. 5542 would have prevented a PAYGO sequester for FY2001 by instructing the OMB director to reset the PAYGO balance for that year to zero when preparing the final sequestration report. Final congressional action on the measure faltered at the end of October 2000. During the 12 calendar years that the PAYGO process operated, from 1991 through 2002, the OMB director issued separate cost estimates on nearly 600 direct spending and revenue measures. In addition, hundreds of other direct spending and revenue measures\u2014each with an impact of less than $500 thousand\u2014were identified by the OMB director, but separate cost estimates were not prepared for them. Of these hundreds of PAYGO measures, 65 may be considered to be \"major\" PAYGO legislation on the basis that the OMB director determined that they had an impact of $100 million or more in at least one of the first five fiscal years scored (including the current year, the budget year, and. Table 7 displays the net budgetary impact of 65 major PAYGO measures on a calendar year basis for 1991-2002. The balances reflect the 5-year impact of all PAYGO measures enacted each year, excluding prior year legislation or directed scorekeeping provisions. Emergency requirements totaling $96.723 billion over five years are included, while other PAYGO spending with emergency requirements is not counted due to missing information. During 1991-2002, the net budgetary impact of 65 major PAYGO measures varied. In the first eight years, total balances were mostly negative or less than $5 billion. However, in the last four years, all balances were positive, ranging from $29.066 billion to $434.720 billion. Most measures had a 5-year total balance of less than $5 billion, with an average annual impact of less than $1 billion. 17 measures had a balance greater than $5 billion. During 1991-2002, the net budgetary impact of 65 major PAYGO measures varied. Five measures had negative five-year total balances, while the other twelve had positive balances. The acts with negative balances were enacted before or during the 1998 session, while those with positive balances were enacted during or after the 1999 session. Table 9 provides detailed information on the 65 major PAYGO measures. In the 108th and 110th Congress, proposals were made to restore the PAYGO requirement, with disagreements on whether it should apply to both direct spending and revenue legislation or only to direct spending legislation. President George W. Bush submitted draft legislation in 2004 to restore the PAYGO process for direct spending legislation only, but it failed to pass in the House. Interest was renewed in the 110th Congress to restore a comprehensive PAYGO requirement. In the 110th Congress, there was a renewed interest in restoring a comprehensive PAYGO requirement. President Obama announced a PAYGO proposal in 2009, which was introduced as H.R. 2920 by House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. The proposal aimed to apply to both direct spending and revenue legislation. On July 22, 2009, the House passed H.R. 2920 after considering a special rule, H.Res. 665. A substitute amendment by Representative Paul Ryan was defeated, and the bill was passed by a vote of 265-166. Section 421 of the budget resolution for FY2010 exempted certain legislation from budget enforcement procedures in the House. The House passed H.R. 3961, the Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act of 2009, on November 19, 2009, by a vote of 243-183. The bill included the text of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009. Additionally, H.R. 2920 was appended to another measure at the end of the 2009 session under a similar procedure. The text of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 was added to H.R. 2847 in an exchange of amendments with the Senate. The \"Jobs for Main Street Act, 2010\" was incorporated into H.R. 2847 as a substitute, along with the statutory PAYGO act. The Senate's consideration of H.R. 2920 or another bill reinstating the statutory PAYGO process is uncertain. On December 22, 2009, the Senate agreed to consider H.J.Res. 45, a long-term increase in the debt limit, on January 20, 2010, with amendments related to budget enforcement issues, including \"pay go.\" The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 was added to H.R. 2847 through amendments with the Senate. The purpose of this section is to ensure that any legislation affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration. Sequestration to offset deficit increases caused by direct spending and receipts legislation enacted before October 1, 2002, will be calculated by the OMB. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 ensures that any legislation increasing the deficit triggers an offsetting sequestration. Sequestration is calculated by the OMB based on estimates for direct spending and receipts legislation. Sequestration in a fiscal year is obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts, with reductions in automatic spending increases made first. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 mandates sequestration to offset deficit-increasing legislation. Sequestration involves reductions in direct spending accounts, with automatic spending increases addressed first. Additional reductions may be required in specific direct spending accounts to achieve the necessary budget cuts. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 mandates sequestration to offset deficit-increasing legislation by making reductions in direct spending accounts. Outlay reductions resulting from sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in one fiscal year are credited in that year. Estimates from CBO and OMB are required for direct spending or receipts legislation. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 mandates sequestration to offset deficit-increasing legislation by making reductions in direct spending accounts. Estimates from CBO and OMB are required for direct spending or receipts legislation, including an explanation of any differences between the two estimates. If significant differences are found, OMB must consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate before issuing the report. The estimates should include changes in outlays or receipts for the current year, budget year, and each outyear, excluding certain amounts. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2009 requires sequestration to offset deficit-increasing legislation by making cuts in direct spending accounts. OMB and CBO must provide estimates for direct spending or receipts legislation, with common scorekeeping guidelines. Emergency provisions designated by the President and Congress will be treated as emergency requirements in budget reports. The subsection does not apply to direct spending provisions for agricultural crop disaster assistance."
