    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California supports the dignity, independence, and choice of seniors and persons with disabilities to live in integrated settings, free from unnecessary institutionalization. The American population is rapidly aging, with individuals 65 years and older expected to make up 20 percent of the population by 2030. Many of these older adults will face disability and chronic conditions. The number of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease is projected to increase to 16 million by 2050, with the cost of care rising to $1.2 trillion by mid-century. According to the United States Census, California has the largest older adult population in the country, with over four million seniors residing in the state. One in every five Californians is 60 years or older, and 40 percent of them have a disability. The state's older adult population is diverse, with a significant number identifying as Latino, Asian, African American, Native American, Pacific Islander, or multiracial. Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) in California, established in 1974, provides integrated services for older adults and adults with disabilities in community settings. ADHC centers serve individuals with chronic conditions like Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and mental health diagnoses, offering caregiver support to prevent nursing facility placement and abuse or neglect risks. ADHC services in California include health, therapeutic, and social services such as transportation, skilled nursing care, therapy, and brain-stimulating activities. Participants at risk of institutionalization receive services at the center and return home at night. A study found that ADHC costs significantly less than nursing home care for Medi-Cal/Medicare recipients in California. ADHC centers in California are licensed by the State Department of Public Health and overseen by the California Department of Aging and the State Department of Health Care Services. In 1977, Senator Henry Mello highlighted the need for 600 ADHC centers statewide to cater to the elder population. By 2013, there were 270 ADHC centers in California, serving over 28,000 Medi-Cal recipients. In 2015, 32 California counties lack adult day health centers, including Alpine, Amador, Calaveras, Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn, Inyo, Kings, Lake, Lassen, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Benito, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, Sierra, Siskiyou, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Tulare, Tuolumne, and Yuba. ADHC was a Medi-Cal optional benefit but was eliminated in 2011 due to budget cuts, causing instability in adult day services in California. The class action lawsuit Esther Darling, et al. v. Toby Douglas, et al. challenged the elimination of ADHC as a violation of the Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. The state settled, agreeing to replace ADHC with CBAS, a new program effective April 1, 2012, to provide medical and social services to individuals with intensive health care needs. CBAS is a managed care benefit under California's Medi-Cal Managed Care Organizations, also available as a fee-for-service benefit for certain individuals. The State Department of Health Care Services amended the Section 1115 Waiver to include the CBAS program, approved by CMS in 2012 and renewed in 2014. CBAS provides skilled nursing, therapeutic services, personal care, and caregiver support for the aging population. A well-regulated system of CBAS programs is essential to meet the needs of California's diverse and aging population. The CBAS program is crucial for disabled and frail Californians, providing services to help them remain independent and avoid institutionalization. State law codifying key elements of the program ensures stability and eligibility for current and future participants. CBAS is a Medi-Cal benefit available to beneficiaries aged 18 or older who qualify for Medicaid through the state plan and are aged, blind, or disabled, including Medicare recipients. The CBAS benefit is available to Medi-Cal managed care plan members who meet medical necessity criteria, including Nursing Facility Level of Care A criteria or other specified criteria. The CBAS benefit is available to Medi-Cal managed care plan members who have a diagnosed brain injury or chronic mental disorder, including specific disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The CBAS benefit is available to Medi-Cal managed care plan members with diagnosed brain injury or chronic mental disorder, including specific disorders. Beneficiaries must require assistance with activities like bathing, dressing, self-feeding, toileting, ambulating, transferring, medication management, hygiene, money management, accessing community and health resources, meal preparation, and transportation. The CBAS benefit is available to Medi-Cal managed care plan members with diagnosed brain injury or chronic mental disorder. Beneficiaries must require assistance with activities like bathing, dressing, self-feeding, toileting, ambulating, transferring, medication management, hygiene, money management, accessing community and health resources, meal preparation, and transportation. The beneficiary's cognitive disorder can range from moderate to severe dementia, including Alzheimer's type, or mild dementia requiring assistance with specific activities. The CBAS benefit is available to Medi-Cal managed care plan members with diagnosed brain injury or chronic mental disorder. Beneficiaries must require assistance with activities like toileting, ambulating, transferring, medication management, hygiene, and have a developmental disability. CBAS providers must be licensed as adult day health care centers and certified by the California Department of Aging. CBAS providers must meet licensing and Medi-Cal standards, including provisions in the Health and Safety Code and California Code of Regulations. They also need to comply with California's Bridge to Reform Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration and any successor federal authorities. In counties with Medi-Cal managed care, CBAS is available as a benefit. For those not eligible for managed care, CBAS is provided as a fee-for-service Medi-Cal benefit. CBAS is an outpatient program providing various services like nutrition, nursing care, therapy, social services, and more. Implementation depends on federal approvals and financial participation."
