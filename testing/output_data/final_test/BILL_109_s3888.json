Congress found that the Medicare sustainable growth rate formula led to significant payment cuts for physicians and healthcare professionals in 2002 and would continue to do so in subsequent years without intervention. The formula was projected to result in a 5 percent payment cut effective January 1, 2007, according to MedPAC and the Board of Trustees. The Medicare SGR formula will lead to payment cuts for physicians and healthcare professionals through 2015. MedPAC opposes these cuts, fearing they will impact access to primary care services. Concerns have been raised that current payment policies may deter medical students from pursuing primary care. A survey showed that 45 percent of physicians plan to make changes if payment cuts go into effect. The Medicare SGR formula will lead to payment cuts for physicians and healthcare professionals through 2015. MedPAC opposes these cuts, fearing they will impact access to primary care services. Concerns have been raised that current payment policies may deter medical students from pursuing primary care. A survey showed that if the program goes into effect, 45 percent of physicians plan to decrease the number of new Medicare patients they accept, 50 percent plan to defer the purchase of information technology, 37 percent who treat patients in rural communities will discontinue rural outreach services, and 43 percent will decrease the number of new TRICARE patients they accept. MedPAC has consistently recommended repealing the Medicare SGR formula due to its flaws, and annual actions by Congress to override the formula result in instability and unpredictability for healthcare providers and patients. The Medicare SGR formula poses long-term problems by imposing drastic cuts in future years, affecting physicians' ability to invest in health information technology and quality improvement programs. Stable payment systems are crucial to maintain Medicare beneficiaries' access to high-quality healthcare. MedPAC's recommendation to update payments is essential for addressing these issues. Updating payments for physicians' services under the Medicare program is necessary to ensure access to high-quality care for all beneficiaries. The purpose of this Act is to replace the Medicare sustainable growth rate formula with a new physician payment system that accurately reflects the costs of providing care. The Act aims to update payments for physicians under Medicare to reflect the costs of care and support medical practice sustainability.
