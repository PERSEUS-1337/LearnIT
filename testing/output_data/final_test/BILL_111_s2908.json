    "content": "The Water Heater Rating Improvement Act of 2009 may be cited as the Act. It establishes a uniform efficiency descriptor for covered water heaters. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include a uniform efficiency descriptor for covered water heaters, defining terms like covered water heater and final rule. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to establish a uniform efficiency descriptor and test methods for covered water heaters. The final rule must be published within 270 days if enacted before March 31, 2010, or within 180 days if enacted after that date. The purpose is to replace the energy factor descriptor with a uniform efficiency descriptor. The final rule establishes efficiency descriptors for covered water heaters, replacing the energy factor descriptor. Effective immediately upon final rule enactment. The final rule for covered water heaters will take effect 1 year after publication. The Secretary will develop a conversion factor to convert efficiency measurements to the new energy descriptor. The final rule for covered water heaters will take effect 1 year after publication. A conversion factor will be developed by the Secretary to convert efficiency measurements to the new energy descriptor. Manufacturers can apply the conversion factor to rerate existing models of covered water heaters to comply with the new efficiency requirements. The conversion factor for covered water heaters will be in effect from the establishment date until March 31, 2010, as required by a consent decree. The final rule may exclude a specific category of covered water heaters from the uniform efficiency descriptor if the Secretary determines that the category does not have residential use and can be effectively rated using existing descriptors. The final rule for water heater efficiency descriptors may include a revised version of existing descriptors, a hybrid of descriptors, or a new approach. The rule should apply to all water heating technologies in use as of the date of enactment. The final rule for water heater efficiency descriptors may include revised, hybrid, or new approaches for all water heating technologies. The Secretary will invite stakeholders to participate in the rulemaking process and conduct testing of alternative descriptors through the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Covered water heaters must comply with the final rule on the effective date. Covered water heaters must comply with the final rule on the effective date, including any revised labeling requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission."
