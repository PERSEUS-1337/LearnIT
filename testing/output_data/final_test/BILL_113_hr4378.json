In 2012, US health care spending was $8,233 per resident, accounting for 17.6% of GDP, one of the highest among industrialized countries. Expenditures surpassed $2.6 trillion in 2011, over three times the amount in 1990. Chronic diseases attribute to over 75% of national health expenditures. Diet was identified as a major cause of chronic diseases by the World Health Organization in 2003. Seven out of 10 deaths in the US are due to chronic diseases. Approximately 81.1 million American adults have cardiovascular disease, with 2,300 dying daily. In 2010, the disease cost taxpayers $189.4 billion, projected to triple by 2030. A healthful diet can reduce symptoms and reverse artery damage. Two-thirds of US adults are overweight, with half being obese. In the United States, one in three children are overweight, with one-fifth being obese. Direct medical costs related to obesity in 2008 totaled $147 billion. Additionally, 25.8 million Americans have diabetes, and 79 million have prediabetes. The estimated costs of diagnosed diabetes increased to $245 billion in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007. Research suggests that reducing fat in the diet can reverse type 2 diabetes symptoms. Cancer is a leading cause of death in the US, with 570,000 deaths annually. Direct costs of cancer were $102.8 billion in 2010, expected to rise to $172 billion by 2020. Physicians feel inadequately trained to provide nutrition advice, with only 14% feeling adequately trained. In 2004, only 38% of medical schools met the recommended 25 hours of nutrition education. In 2004, 30% of US medical schools required a nutrition course, which decreased to 25% by 2010. A 2009 survey found that over half of graduating medical students felt their nutrition education was inadequate. The Department of Health and Human Services guidelines and federal agencies' annual reports focus on primary care federal health professionals completing continuing medical education on nutrition. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue guidelines for federal agencies to ensure full-time primary care health professionals have at least 6 credits of nutrition-related continuing medical education. Each year, agencies must report to Congress on the adoption and enforcement of these guidelines. The Act requires federal agencies to ensure primary care health professionals complete 6 credits of nutrition-related continuing medical education. Courses should cover nutrition's role in preventing obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. The term \"primary care health professional\" refers to a physician or nurse practitioner providing primary care services. A nurse practitioner is defined in the Social Security Act, as is a physician. Primary care services include those provided by a nurse practitioner that would typically be offered by a physician."
