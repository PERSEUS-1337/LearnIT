The program involves retailers passing through the tax on disposable bags to customers and tracking the number of bags purchased. Each bag must be labeled with \"PLEASE RETURN TO A\" for recycling. The retailer must provide recyclable bags with a minimum of 40% post-consumer recycled content and marked with specific resin identification codes. They must also have visible and easily accessible collection bins for carryout bags at their place of business.

The amendments add new sections for disposable carryout bag recycling program and trust fund to the existing codes, effective January 1, 2011."
