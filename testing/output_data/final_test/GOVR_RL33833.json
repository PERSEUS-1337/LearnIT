It also permits the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices in federal investigations related to foreign intelligence or terrorism. FISA prohibits investigations of U.S. persons based solely on First Amendment activities and authorizes the FBI Director to seek court orders for the production of tangible items. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows the government to conduct surveillance for foreign intelligence information and terrorism investigations. It prohibits investigations of U.S. persons based solely on First Amendment activities and authorizes court orders for the production of tangible items, with nondisclosure restrictions. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows surveillance for foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. Disclosure must comply with orders from the Director of the FBI. Surveillance can be conducted under FISA court orders for electronic and physical searches, and installation of pen registers and trap and trace devices. Tangible items can be produced under FISA with court orders. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires obtaining orders from FISC judges or U.S. Magistrate Judges for electronic surveillance, physical search, or production of tangible things. Appeals can be made to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Court of Review if applications are denied. The creation and structure of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the Foreign Intelligence Court of Review are discussed in this report. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is made up of 11 U.S. district court judges designated by the Chief Justice of the United States. Only one opinion has been published since its establishment in 1978. Publication of opinions is rare and requires approval from the Presiding Judge and the Executive Branch. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) consists of 11 U.S. district court judges designated by the Chief Justice. Three FISC judges within 20 miles of DC, or designated by the presiding judge, review petitions challenging production orders for intelligence investigations. The Court of Review has three judges designated by the Chief Justice from district courts or courts of appeals. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) is comprised of 11 U.S. district court judges designated by the Chief Justice. The FISC has jurisdiction to approve electronic surveillance or physical searches in the U.S. for foreign intelligence under FISA. Each FISC judge serves for a maximum of seven years and cannot be reappointed. Applications for surveillance are either granted, modified, or denied by the FISC judges. When a judge denies an application for electronic surveillance under FISA, they must provide a written statement of reasons for the decision. The record is then transmitted to the Court of Review under seal for expedited proceedings. Security measures for maintaining records are established by the Chief Justice in consultation with the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. Applications for pen registers and trap and trace devices can be heard and approved by either a FISC judge or a designated U.S. Magistrate Judge. The FISC judge or a designated U.S. Magistrate Judge can approve the installation and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices for foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations, as long as it does not solely target activities protected by the First Amendment. The FISC judge or a designated U.S. Magistrate Judge can approve the installation and use of pen registers and trap and trace devices for foreign intelligence or terrorism investigations, as long as it does not solely target activities protected by the First Amendment. A person who receives a production order may challenge it by filing a petition with the petition review pool. The recipient must wait at least a year before challenging a nondisclosure order imposed with the production order. If a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order is denied, the recipient must wait another year before filing another petition. Any order not modified or set aside remains in effect. Petitions filed under Section 501(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are reviewed expeditiously and maintained under security measures. The court can review government submissions containing classified information ex parte and in camera. The procedure for challenging production or nondisclosure orders before the FISC petition review pool differs from motions to suppress information obtained from electronic sources. The FISA allows challenges to information obtained through electronic surveillance, physical search, or pen register/trap and trace devices. Challenges must be made in the U.S. district court where the motion is filed. Challenges to information obtained through FISA electronic surveillance, physical search, or pen register/trap and trace devices can be made by an \"aggrieved person\" in U.S. district court proceedings to suppress evidence or information derived from such investigative techniques. The Attorney General can request ex parte and in camera proceedings if disclosure would harm national security. The court must suppress unlawfully obtained evidence or grant the motion of the aggrieved person if surveillance was not authorized. If surveillance was lawful, the court will deny the motion except for due process considerations. The court shall deny the motion of the aggrieved person except to the extent that due process requires discovery or disclosure. Final orders granting motions or requests, decisions deeming surveillance unauthorized, and orders requiring disclosure of related materials are binding on all courts except the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court. The government can seek review of a denial of an application for FISA authorization before the Court of Review and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court of Review has jurisdiction over petitions for review of decisions under FISA to affirm, modify, or set aside production or nondisclosure orders. The U.S. Supreme Court can review decisions of the Court of Review on a petition for certiorari. The Court of Review has jurisdiction over decisions under FISA for electronic surveillance, physical searches, production orders, or nondisclosure orders. The U.S. Supreme Court can review these decisions on a petition for certiorari."
