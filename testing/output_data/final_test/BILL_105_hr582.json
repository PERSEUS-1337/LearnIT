The system requires the development of a classification system to reflect the services provided.

The Medicare Hospital Outpatient Reform Act of 1997 implements a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services, with adjustments for wage levels and reduced payments for multiple procedures. The Act also includes measures to control unnecessary increases in service volume and specifies payment amounts based on the Medicare OPD fee schedule. The Secretary is required to estimate total projected Medicare payments to hospitals for outpatient services in 1998. The Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for determining Medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each group for 1998 based on weights and frequencies of utilization, taking into account adjustments. The Secretary determines Medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each group based on utilization, with adjustments, and establishes a conversion factor for subsequent years. The Secretary calculates Medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each group by multiplying the conversion factor with the relative payment weights. Periodic reviews and adjustments to group prices may be conducted by the Secretary. The Secretary periodically reviews and revises group payment weights, taking into account changes in medical practice, technology, new procedures, and cost data. Adjustments must maintain budget neutrality to prevent expenditure increases or decreases. (b) Coinsurance for items and services under part B will now be based on the applicable Medicare OPD fee schedule amount. Conforming amendments ensure that previous payment provisions do not apply to services determined under subsection (t). The amendments made by this section, effective January 1, 1998, state that previous provisions do not apply to items and services with payment determined under subsection (t)."
