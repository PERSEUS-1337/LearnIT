    "content": "The Act titled \"Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act\" includes special transfers to state accounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund from 2008 through 2012. The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act includes provisions for incentive payments to state accounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund, with a maximum payment determined based on a specific formula. The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act provides incentive payments to state accounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund based on specific criteria. One-third of the payment is transferred upon meeting requirements of paragraph (2), and the remainder is transferred upon meeting requirements of paragraph (3). The State law must use a base period for determining eligibility for unemployment compensation. The State law must use a base period that includes the most recently completed calendar quarter before the start of the benefit year for determining eligibility for unemployment compensation. Additionally, the State law must include provisions related to availability for work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work, allowing individuals to seek part-time work without being denied compensation solely for that reason. An individual may not be disqualified from unemployment compensation for separating from work due to compelling family reasons, such as domestic violence, illness, or disability of a family member. Verification may be required by the State. Weekly unemployment compensation is payable to individuals who are unemployed, have exhausted all regular and extended benefits, and are enrolled in a State-approved training program or a job training program authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 due to accompanying a spouse to a place where commuting is impractical or due to a change in the spouse's employment location. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 prepares individuals for high-demand occupations after being separated from declining or reduced employment. Unemployment compensation is based on the individual's average weekly benefit amount for at least 26 weeks. The maximum amount of compensation payable to an individual during a benefit year is equal to at least 26 times the individual's weekly benefit amount. Dependents' allowances are provided to all. Dependents' allowances are provided to individuals with a dependent, equal to at least $15 per dependent per week, subject to state-defined limitations. States seeking incentive payments must submit an application detailing how the funds will improve their unemployment compensation program. The Secretary of Labor reviews state applications for incentive payments under the unemployment compensation program. If the state law provisions meet requirements and claimants qualify for benefits, the Secretary of Labor certifies the findings to the Secretary of the Treasury for the transfer of incentive payments to the state account. The Secretary of Labor certifies state compliance with unemployment compensation program requirements to the Secretary of the Treasury for incentive payment transfers. State laws must meet specific criteria for certification, and applications must adhere to submission deadlines. The Secretary of Labor determines allocation of incentive payments to states based on compliance with unemployment program requirements. 10 percent of unclaimed funds are transferred to state accounts, with additional payments made to qualifying states. The Secretary of Labor determines additional incentive payments to states based on compliance with unemployment program requirements. The amount transferred to a state cannot exceed 2 times the total amount of the incentive payment transferred under paragraph (1)(C). The Secretary of Labor certifies the amount for transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury based on compliance with unemployment program requirements. The Secretary of the Treasury then transfers the additional incentive payment to the State within 30 days. The Secretary of Labor certifies the amount for transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment of cash benefits to individuals with respect to their unemployment. States can also use transferred amounts for administration of unemployment compensation laws. $7,000,000,000 is reserved from the Federal unemployment account for this purpose. The net balance in the Federal unemployment account at any time is the amount in the account reduced by the total reserved amount minus the incentive payments transferred under this subsection. \"Special Transfers in Fiscal Years 2008 Through 2012\" In fiscal years 2008 through 2012, an additional $100,000,000 is available for transfer to States' accounts, with each State's share determined and computed in the same manner as described in subsection (a)(2) and subject to limitations on transfers as described in subsection (b). In fiscal years 2008 through 2012, an additional $100,000,000 is available for transfer to States' accounts, with each State's share determined and computed in the same manner as described in subsection (a)(2) and subject to limitations on transfers as described in subsection (b). The transferred amount to a State can be used for expenses related to the administration of state laws and outreach efforts. The additional amount made available in fiscal years 2008 through 2012 can be used for improved outreach, unemployment benefit operations, and reemployment services for unemployment insurance claimants. This amount is excluded from certain application requirements and is taken from the employment security administration account. The Secretary of Labor may prescribe regulations to carry out the amendment made regarding the transfer of funds from the employment security administration account in fiscal years. SEC. 3. Extension of FUTA tax, amending the Internal Revenue Code to change tax rates from 2007 to 2012 and from 2008 to 2013."
