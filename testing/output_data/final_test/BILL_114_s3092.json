The safe harbor conditions on whether the broker's or dealer's publication or distribution of a covered investment fund research report constitutes their initiation or reinitiation of research coverage on the fund or its securities. It does not require the fund to have been registered as an investment company or subject to reporting requirements for any period exceeding the specified time.
