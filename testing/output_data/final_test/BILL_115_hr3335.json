Congress finds that 11 to 20 percent of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom have post-traumatic stress, which can lead to depression and suicide. Service dogs help veterans by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, allowing for reintegration. Waiting lists for service dogs are currently long. Currently, waiting lists for service dogs for veterans average 18-24 months, with training costing $25,000 per dog. The estimated annual cost of owning a service dog is $1,200 to $1,600 for food, supplies, and veterinary care. The pilot program is introduced. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program to provide service dogs to eligible veterans. Eligible veterans are those who served on active duty in the Armed Forces after September 11, 2001, and have been diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury. The pilot program provides service dogs to eligible veterans diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury. Veterans must have received evidence-based treatment, commit to regular evaluations, and the service dog is in addition to other benefits.

The Secretary's authority to enter into contracts for the program will terminate five years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR SELECTION, TRAINING, AND ASSESSMENT OF SERVICE DOGS. The National Association of Veteran-Serving Organizations formed a scientific advisory committee to develop national standards for the selection, training, and assessment of service dogs. These standards are publicly available and can be revised annually. Service dogs should not be restricted by breed or size to meet the varying needs of individual veterans. Service dogs for veterans should be carefully selected and maintained for a long service life. This includes thorough health examinations, regular wellness checks, vaccinations, parasite control, and a stable temperament. Service dogs for veterans should be able to perform tasks related to the veteran's disability, use appropriate training methods and equipment, and have handlers educated on dog care and humane treatment. Service dog assessments involve observing dogs and veterans in public settings with distractions like food, noise, crowds, and other animals. Assessors should support veterans in partnering with their service dogs, have a background in dog training, and be experienced in evaluation. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will issue a national service dog credential to eligible veterans who have completed a suitable assessment and provided a diagnosis from a Department doctor or clinical social worker. To obtain a national service dog credential, eligible veterans must provide a recommendation from a Department doctor or clinical social worker, vaccination records, a note from the treating veterinarian confirming the dog's health, and a list of tasks the service dog can perform related to the veteran's diagnosis."
