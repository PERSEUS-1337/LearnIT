    "content": "The \"Environmental Justice Act of 2007\" is also known as the \"Environmental Justice Act\". It codifies Executive Order 12898. The President is authorized to enforce Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice, ensuring fair treatment for all regardless of race, color, or income in environmental laws. The text discusses the importance of ensuring that minority and low-income communities have access to public information on human health and environmental planning, regulations, and enforcement. It also emphasizes the need to prevent these communities from bearing a disproportionate burden of negative health and environmental impacts. Additionally, it defines \"fair treatment\" as policies that prevent any group, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups, from experiencing disproportionately high adverse effects from federal agency programs. The provisions of Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice are mentioned in relation to judicial review and rights of action. Section 6-609 of Executive Order 12898 is exempted for this Act. SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must promptly implement Inspector General recommendations from report #2006-P-00034 on conducting environmental justice reviews of programs, policies, and activities. This includes identifying areas needing reviews, establishing review plans, and assessing potential adverse impacts on minority and low-income populations. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency should develop specific environmental justice review guidance for programs and regional offices, designate a responsible office to compile review results, and implement GAO recommendations for developing rules under EPA-administered laws. The Administrator should ensure workgroups focus on environmental justice in rule development, enhance their ability to identify issues, improve assessments of environmental justice impacts in economic reviews, and involve environmental justice coordinators when appropriate. The Administrator should direct agency officers to respond fully to public comments on environmental justice, improve explanations for conclusions, and support data. The Inspector General recommends clearly defining the mission of the Office of Environmental Justice and providing staff with understanding of roles and responsibilities. The recommendation includes establishing specific time frames for developing definitions, goals, and measurements for environmental justice, providing standard definitions for minority and low-income communities, and ensuring comprehensive training programs include key environmental justice concepts. The Administrator will submit an initial report to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment on the strategy for implementing recommendations. Semi-annual reports will follow on progress in implementing recommendations and modifying emergency management procedures to include environmental justice in the agency's Incident Command Structure."
