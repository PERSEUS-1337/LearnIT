    "content": "House and Senate conferees reached agreement on an omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6, H.Rept.108-375) on November 17, 2003, marking the first comprehensive energy legislation in over a decade. The House approved the conference report on November 18, but a cloture motion in the Senate failed on November 21. A revised version of the bill (S. 2095) was introduced by Senator Domenici on February 12, 2004, with a lower estimated cost and without the controversial provision on the fuel additive MTBE. The bill is estimated to cost less than $14 billion, compared to the $31 billion estimated for the H.R. 6 conference report. Both bills include provisions to change regulatory requirements for the wholesale electric market, such as repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA). The omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6, H.Rept.108-375) included provisions such as repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA), increasing ethanol production, banning MTBE as a gasoline additive by 2014, granting protection to MTBE and renewable fuel producers from product liability lawsuits, providing loan guarantees for a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to Alberta, and royalty reductions for oil and gas wells on federal lands. It also aimed to increase access for energy projects on federal lands. The omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) included provisions to increase access for energy projects on federal lands. New efficiency standards would be established for consumer and commercial products, with funding authorized for setting Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) levels for motor vehicles. The House version included opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration, but the Senate version did not. The conference report and S. 2095 would leave ANWR off-limits to drilling. The omnibus energy bill (H.R. 6) includes provisions for energy projects on federal lands, new efficiency standards for products, and funding for CAFE levels. S. 2095 lists annual funding authorizations totaling $71 billion over 10 years. The likely cost has not been estimated yet. The bill also addresses tax provisions and compares to previous energy bills like S. 14. Electric utilities have historically been seen as natural monopolies. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 removed regulatory barriers for electricity generation, aiming to increase supply and introduce competition. Legislation is being debated to address transmission, reliability, and restructuring concerns. Proposed changes include repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act and establishing mandatory reliability standards. Standard market design would be remanded to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, with no rule allowed before FY2006. The Department of Energy would identify transmission corridors needing new infrastructure. The Department of Energy would identify transmission corridors requiring new construction or upgrading. Eminent domain authority would be granted to the federal government for interstate power line construction on these corridors if states do not act in time. The bills would also amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate the requirement for reformulated gasoline to contain 2% oxygen, which led to the use of MTBE and ethanol. The bills propose increasing the use of renewable fuels like ethanol in gasoline, with requirements set to reach 5.0 billion gallons by 2012. Concerns over MTBE contamination have led to a ban on its use in motor vehicle fuel by December 31, 2014, with some exceptions allowed. The bills propose authorizing $2.0 billion for converting MTBE production facilities and preserving emission reductions. A controversial provision includes a \"safe harbor\" from product liability lawsuits for MTBE and renewable fuel producers. The safe harbor provision would retroactively protect refiners from liability for MTBE cleanup, leading to a significant increase in lawsuits filed after September 5, 2003. This legislation is part of broader efforts to address oil demand, including the corporate average fuel economy standards implemented in 1975. The CAFE standards for light-duty trucks were mandated in 2003 by the NHTSA, with ongoing congressional interest. Proposed bills would require a CAFE study, considerations for fuel economy, funding for NHTSA rulemakings, and extension of fuel economy credits for alternative-fueled vehicles. Reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act for nuclear liability is a key energy agenda item. The Price-Anderson Act for nuclear liability is a top energy agenda item, providing a liability system for commercial reactor accident damages. The system combines private-sector insurance and nuclear industry self-insurance, with a cap of $10.9 billion. The H.R. 6 conference agreement and S. 2095 propose a 20-year extension of Price-Anderson until 2023. The nuclear industry supports the system, while opponents argue it provides an unwarranted subsidy to nuclear power. The conference report includes provisions for nuclear power security regulations, a nuclear-hydrogen cogeneration project, and a tax credit for new nuclear power plants. Additionally, new energy efficiency standards for consumer and commercial products are legislated. The bills empower DOE to set new standards for products and appliances, increase funding for the weatherization program, and establish a voluntary energy efficiency program in industry. However, they do not include a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) favored by environmental groups. The Senate version of H.R. 6 proposed an RPS starting at 1% in 2005, increasing every two years, and reaching 10% in 2019. The congressional debate over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas leasing has been ongoing for over 30 years. The House passed a bill authorizing exploration and production in ANWR with limitations, but the Senate bill did not include ANWR provisions. Despite the Administration's support, ANWR was ultimately left out of the final conference bill due to insufficient Senate votes. Proponents highlight technological advancements reducing surface disturbance, while opponents acknowledge this. Opponents argue that the bill lacks adequate requirements for addressing surface disturbance caused by oil and gas activities in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). They believe that surface disturbance is just one of many environmental impacts and that there is still considerable risk to the environment during all phases of development. Some opponents argue that ANWR's pristine ecology and habitat should not be disturbed under any circumstances. The Department of the Interior estimates that only a fraction of oil and gas resources on Indian lands have been developed, and proposed legislation would allow Indian tribes to enter into business agreements for energy production. The H.R. 6 conference report and S. 2095 would allow Indian tribes to enter into business agreements with energy developers without prior approval from the Department of the Interior if the tribe's regulations are approved. Royalty reductions for marginal oil and gas wells on public lands and the outer continental shelf are included to encourage production. Provisions are also included to increase access to federal lands for energy projects like drilling activities, electric transmission lines, and gas pipelines. The bills would provide $18 billion in loans for the Alaska Gas Pipeline to develop the North Slope's 30 trillion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves. The H.R. 6 conference bill and S. 2095 propose $18 billion in loan guarantees for an Alaska gas pipeline and a tax credit for gas producers. They also authorize $2.1 billion for President Bush's hydrogen initiative, aiming for hydrogen vehicles by 2020. Critics argue the hydrogen program may hinder raising vehicle standards, while others see government involvement as necessary for environmental and energy goals. The H.R. 6 conference bill and S. 2095 propose $18 billion in loan guarantees for an Alaska gas pipeline and a tax credit for gas producers. They also authorize $2.1 billion for President Bush's hydrogen initiative, aiming for hydrogen vehicles by 2020. Critics argue the hydrogen program may hinder raising vehicle standards, while others see government involvement as necessary for environmental and energy goals. Several new provisions in the H.R. 6 conference report include Hydropower and Energy on Federal Lands. The Secretary of the Interior could reduce or eliminate oil and gas royalty or net profit shares in planning areas of offshore Alaska. Competitive leasing system for oil and gas in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska would be modified to allow royalty reductions in the public interest. For deepwater port applications, the Secretary of Transportation could use environmental impact statements from other federal agencies. A five-year plan would be prepared to encourage renewable energy development on federal lands. All federal land within Finger Lakes National Forest in New York would be withdrawn. Within Finger Lakes National Forest in New York, federal land would be withdrawn from public entry and disposal under land laws. Section 358 focuses on Federal Coalbed Methane Regulation, encouraging states to reduce impediments to coalbed methane development. Section 634 addresses the disposal of DOE-managed material at the Fernald uranium processing facility. Section 635 involves the safe disposal of Greater-than-Class-C Radioactive Waste, with DOE tasked to develop a plan for permanent disposal. Section 637 requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a final decision on a license for uranium enrichment facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must issue a final decision on a license for a uranium enrichment facility within two years of application submission. The Secretary of Energy can create a national low-enriched uranium stockpile. Individuals with unescorted access to radioactive material must undergo fingerprinting for criminal background checks. NRC homeland security costs, excluding background checks and security inspections, will not be recovered through fees on nuclear power plants. Security of reactor designs is addressed in Section 928. Section 928 requires DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy to conduct an R&D program on technology for enhancing reactor design safety and security. Section 929 mandates DOE to establish an R&D program on alternatives to large industrial radioactive sources. Section 703 allows vehicle fleets to claim extra credits for purchasing medium- and heavy-duty vehicles running on alternative fuels. Section 915 authorizes DOE to provide financial assistance for distributed energy technology demonstrations. DOE would provide financial assistance for distributed energy technology demonstrations, fuelsystem optimization for industrial reciprocating engines, concentrating solar power R&D for hydrogen production, and Western Hemisphere energy cooperation. Section 1222 allows WAPA and SWPA to develop transmission facilities. Section 1227 establishes the DOE Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution. Section 1275 requires FERC to review cost allocations for non-power goods. Section 1412 allocates federal revenues from offshore energy activities to coastal states. Revenues from offshore energy activities would be allocated to coastal states for specified activities. Changes to the Tennessee Valley Authority include expanding the Board of Directors and hiring a chief operating officer. Clean Air Act deadlines may be extended for areas with ozone nonattainment if upwind areas significantly contribute. The EPA Administrator would establish criteria for the safe use of lead and zinc mine tailings in northeastern Oklahoma for construction projects. The conference report authorizes grants for ethanol plants producing from cellulosic biomass, waste, or agricultural byproducts. $750 million authorized for FY2004-FY2006. Retailers can blend compliant reformulated gasoline with or without ethanol in summer months. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 6 did not include a provision requiring retailers to drain their tanks before switching between ethanol-blended RFG and non-ethanol RFG. The report provides a summary of the non-tax provisions of the conference version of H.R. 6, with sections listed in numerical order and changes made by S. 2095 shown in parentheses. Funding authorizations are detailed in Table 1 at the end of the report. The curr_chunk lists various individuals involved in different energy-related topics such as electric utilities, energy security, hydropower, nuclear energy, and Clean Air Act. It also mentions specific legislation and programs related to energy conservation, renewable energy, and motor fuels. The Architect of the Capitol would be required to plan and implement energy and water-saving measures in Congressional buildings. The Architect of the Capitol is mandated to develop an energy and water conservation strategy for congressional buildings, aligning with federal requirements. An annual report is necessary, with up to $2 million authorized. The baseline for federal energy savings would be updated to FY2001, with a 20% reduction goal set for FY2013. DOE would assess progress and set new goals for FY2023. Executive Order 13123 sets a 35% reduction target in energy use per square foot by FY2010. Federal buildings are required to be metered or sub-metered by late 2010 to reduce energy costs and promote energy savings. Statutory authority would be created to require federal agencies to purchase energy-efficient products. Federal agencies can continue using energy savings performance contracts indefinitely. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 95-619) allows federal agencies to use Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) until the end of FY2002. It includes provisions for a pilot program for non-building applications, voluntary commitments to reduce industrial energy intensity, and the creation of an Advanced Building Efficiency Testbed program by the Department of Energy. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 allows federal agencies to use Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) until the end of FY2002. It includes provisions for a pilot program for non-building applications, voluntary commitments to reduce industrial energy intensity, and the creation of an Advanced Building Efficiency Testbed program by the Department of Energy. The Act also mandates stricter energy efficiency standards for new federal buildings, increased use of recovered materials in federally funded construction projects, and increased funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for FY2004 through FY2006. Increased funding and new requirements are proposed for various energy programs in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, including weatherization assistance, state energy programs, energy-efficient appliance rebate programs, and energy-efficient public buildings. Funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is also authorized through FY2006. Section 126 proposes a Low Income Community Energy Efficiency Pilot Program for local governments and private entities. Section 131 gives statutory authority for the Energy Star Program. Section 132 requires a public education program on HVAC maintenance. Section 133 directs DOE to establish energy conservation standards for additional products. Energy Conservation Standards for Additional Products would be set by statute for various items such as battery chargers, exit signs, torchieres, and distribution transformers. Efficiency standards would also be prescribed for ceiling fans, vending machines, commercial refrigerators, unit heaters, and compact fluorescent lamps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) would be required to consider improvements in energy labels for consumer products. DOE or FTC would be directed to establish labeling requirements for products added by this section of the bill. The bill includes provisions for energy efficiency labels on consumer products, capacity building for energy-efficient housing, increasing funding for energy conservation activities, and incentives for solar energy equipment in FHA mortgage insurance. The curr_chunk discusses modifications to the Public Housing Capital Fund for energy and water efficiency improvements, grants for energy-conserving improvements in assisted housing, and the provision for energy conservation projects in multifamily housing projects. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the National Housing Act for energy conservation projects in public housing, financing energy efficiency projects by the North American Development Bank, purchasing Energy Star appliances for public housing agencies, updating energy efficiency standards, and implementing an energy strategy for HUD. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development would implement an energy conservation strategy for public and assisted housing, focusing on cost-effective energy-efficient design and construction. The Department of Energy would report annually on renewable energy resource potential, including solar, wind, biomass, ocean, geothermal, and hydroelectric energy resources. Eligibility for renewable energy production incentives would be extended through 2023. Eligibility for the existing incentive would be extended through 2023 and expanded to include electric cooperatives and tribal governments, with landfill gas as a qualifying resource. The incentive, funded by appropriations to DOE, encourages public agencies to produce power from wind and biomass. The Senate version aimed to add incremental hydro and ocean energy. Federal agencies would be required to purchase renewable energy where economically feasible. Federal agencies would be required to purchase power produced from renewables, starting at 3% in FY2005 and increasing to 7.5% in 2011 and beyond. Renewable energy produced on federal or Indian lands would receive double credit. A report to Congress would be mandated every two years. Additionally, Section 204 focuses on improving energy security in insular areas by assessing energy production, consumption, and infrastructure vulnerabilities. The federal government mandates the purchase of renewable energy by federal agencies, with a focus on increasing energy security in insular areas by reducing reliance on imported energy and maximizing indigenous resources. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other officials, is required to update energy plans for insular areas to reflect renewable energy potential and seek to reduce energy imports through conservation and efficiency measures. Annual appropriations would support projects to protect electric power transmission lines from hurricane damage, and the use of photovoltaic energy in public buildings would be promoted. The General Services Administration would be authorized to encourage the use of solar photovoltaic energy systems in new and existing buildings to reduce costs and stimulate the market for photovoltaic equipment. Grants of up to $20 per green ton would be provided to individuals, businesses, communities, and Indian tribes for the commercial use of biomass for fuel, heat, or electric power, with a focus on improving the value of forest biomass. Preference is given to small towns, rural areas, and areas at risk of damage to the biomass resource to address the increasing risk of wildfires. Section 207 amends federal procurement requirements to include degradable six-pack rings. Sections 211-227 focus on geothermal energy leasing amendments on federal lands to increase production, with potential environmental impacts. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 charges a royalty of 10%-15% on geothermal production from federal lands. The Secretary of the Interior can adjust terms of geothermal leases, with annual rental fees of at least $1 per acre. The primary lease term is 10 years and continues as long as geothermal steam is produced commercially. Amendments to federal procurement requirements include degradable six-pack rings, while geothermal energy leasing on federal lands is being amended to increase production. Amendments to the Geothermal Steam Act would change lease procedures for competitive and non-competitive lease sales. Competitive lease sales would be held every two years, with lands available for non-competitive process if no bids. A fee schedule would be established for low-temperature geothermal resources, and existing leases may be converted for direct utilization. Royalties from geothermal leases would be 3.5% of gross proceeds from electricity sales and 0.75% from direct use items. The amendments to the Geothermal Steam Act include provisions for identifying geothermal areas on public lands, reviewing areas under moratoria, reimbursing lessees for environmental analysis costs, assessing current geothermal resources, and promoting cooperative development plans. The amendments to the Geothermal Steam Act promote cooperative development plans for geothermal resources, establish royalty payments for minerals produced as byproducts, repeal certain sections related to rental and royalty rate adjustments, credit annual rentals towards royalties, allow lease extensions for meeting work commitments, and require advance royalty payments if production is suspended. The agreement establishes rental rates for lease sales, a joint report will detail differences between military and civilian geothermal programs, technical amendments are included, and federal agencies have a role in hydropower relicensing applications. The FPA allows federal agencies to impose conditions on FERC licenses, such as building fish passageways, scheduling water releases, and controlling erosion. These conditions can provide benefits but also increase costs and limit operational flexibility. H.R. 6 includes provisions to change federal agencies' license-conditioning authority. The conference bill includes new requirements for federal agencies setting conditions for hydroelectric licenses under the Federal Power Act. License applicants could request a hearing on factual issues, propose alternative conditions, and agencies must justify their decisions. Additionally, the bill establishes a review system for rejected alternatives and introduces Hydroelectric Production Incentives under Section 241. The Secretary of Energy would provide incentive payments to non-federal owners or operators of hydroelectric facilities for power produced within 10 years. Payments of 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour may be made for up to 10 years. Another provision offers incentives for efficiency improvements on existing facilities, with payments not exceeding 10% of the improvement cost. Additionally, a provision would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 for small hydroelectric power projects. Amendments to the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 include changing the qualifying date for existing dams and increasing hydroelectric generation at federal facilities. The Secretary of the Interior would review and adjust water pumping schedules to reduce power consumption during peak demand periods. Incentive payments are offered for power production and efficiency improvements on hydroelectric facilities. Section 246 authorizes federal power marketing administrations to transfer receipts to the Corps for operations and maintenance activities. Section 247 limits charges for using federal land for the Flint Creek hydroelectric facility. Section 248 reinstates and transfers the license for the Stuyvesant Falls Hydroelectric Project to the Town of Stuyvesant, NY. The Falls Hydroelectric Project license would be reinstated and transferred to the Town of Stuyvesant, NY. Congress authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to prevent economic dislocation from events like the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The SPR comprises underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana, while the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) holds two million barrels of heating oil. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act authorizes the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) through FY2008. The conference bill aims to permanently reauthorize NHOR and the National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA). NORA, established by the Energy Policy Act of 2000, funds research on improving furnace efficiency and provides education and training resources. The conference bill extends the authorization for NORA until 2010. It includes provisions for the Program on Oil and Gas Royalties-In-Kind, allowing the government to receive physical quantities of oil and gas as royalty payments if market value is met. Small refineries would receive preferential treatment if market supplies were insufficient. Section 313 of the bill grants the Secretary of the Interior the authority to reduce or terminate royalties for independent producers under certain conditions, with the ability to prescribe different standards for marginal properties. Section 314 provides royalty reductions for shallow water deep gas production in the Gulf of Mexico. Section 315: Royalty reductions for deep water production and Section 316: Alaska offshore royalty suspension are included in the bill. Section 317 addresses oil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. These sections outline royalty reductions and leasing systems for oil and gas production in specific areas. The leasing system for oil and gas in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska would be modified to issue leases for successive 10-year terms if specific criteria are met. Active participation from the state of Alaska and Regional Corporations defined under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act would be sought. The Secretary of the Interior could grant royalty reductions in the public interest. A program would be established to assist in remediating and closing abandoned or idled wells on federal land over a 10-year period. A program would be established for reimbursing the private sector with credits against federal royalties for reclaiming, remediating, and closing orphaned wells. The Mineral Leasing Act would be amended to allow separate leases for tar sands and for oil and gas in the same area, with a minimum bid requirement of $2 per acre for tar sands. The Natural Gas Act would be amended to limit FERC's criteria for rejecting LNG projects, ensuring that FERC cannot deny a certificate solely based on the project sponsor's natural gas importation. Proposals, including those for natural gas importation, are evaluated by the Commission to determine public need. Various criteria are used for this assessment, and projects can be rejected for reasons such as impacting the competitiveness of U.S. natural gas markets. The growing demand for natural gas in the U.S. has led to interest in importing LNG from abundant reserves abroad. With numerous projects being considered, FERC may need to select which ones to certify. Additionally, there are provisions for granting rights-of-way on the Outer Continental Shelf for energy-related activities and preserving geological and geophysical data. The proposed \"National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program Act of 2003\" would establish a program to archive geologic, geophysical, and engineering data, maps, well logs, and samples. State agencies participating in the data archive system would receive 50% financial assistance. Appropriations of $30 million per year from FY2004 through FY2008 would be authorized. The conference bill includes a study to assess Hawaii's reliance on oil for electricity and transportation, exploring the feasibility of using renewables and natural gas. Additionally, a deadline for appeals under the Coastal Zone Management Act would be established. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) was amended in 1996 to include Section 319, which established a timeline for appeals to the Secretary of Commerce on consistency determinations. This provision requires federal activities in the coastal zone to be consistent with federally approved and state-administered coastal zone management plans. A proposed rule in 2003 aimed to modify the appeals timeline, but a final rule has not been issued yet. This provision allows states to halt federal activities that do not align with coastal zone management plans. The consistency provision in the Coastal Zone Management Act allows states to stop federal actions that are incompatible with state interests. This requirement has encouraged states to develop coastal plans, with the majority of eligible states now administering federally approved programs. The provision guides state consideration of proposed federal activities in relation to coastal management plans, leading to ongoing friction between states and federal agencies over its scope. The Coastal Zone Management Act's consistency provision allows states to halt federal actions that conflict with state interests. Disagreements between states and federal agencies over the extent of this provision have led to legal battles, including cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. Resolving disagreements involves a detailed process outlined in the law and regulations. The Coastal Zone Management Act's consistency provision allows states to resolve disagreements with federal agencies through a detailed process, including an appeal to the Secretary of Commerce. Appeals to the Secretary are rare, with only 38 cases between 1984 and 1999. The appeals process is covered under a final rule issued by NOAA in 2000. Section 319 in current law has less detail than the proposed amendment. The conference agreement would replace the current Section 319 of the CZMA with new provisions, setting three sequential deadlines to limit the appeals process to 270 days. The first deadline is for the Secretary of Commerce to publish an initial notice of appeal within 30 days, followed by a 120-day period for the administrative record to be open for filings related to the appeal. The conference agreement would establish three deadlines to limit the appeals process to 270 days under the new provisions replacing Section 319 of the CZMA. The first deadline is for the Secretary of Commerce to publish an initial notice of appeal within 30 days, followed by a 120-day period for the administrative record to be open for filings related to the appeal. The final deadline would give the Secretary up to 120 days to issue a decision after the administrative record had been closed, with the second and third deadlines applying to all pending appeals not resolved prior to the date of enactment. The appeals process has been contentious due to delays, and some seek additional statutory language to define deadlines in law. The Minerals Leasing Act would be amended to provide reimbursement for costs of NEPA-related studies under certain circumstances, effective October 1, 2008. Section 327 of the Safe Drinking Water Act would exclude hydraulic fracturing operations from EPA regulation, adopting language from the House bill. The House bill exempts hydraulic fracturing from underground injection regulation. The Senate bill requires EPA to study the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources and coalbed methane production on water resources. The Safe Drinking Water Act mandates EPA to regulate state underground injection control programs to protect drinking water sources. Before 1997, EPA did not regulate hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas development under the Safe Drinking Water Act's Underground Injection Control program. However, a court ruling in 1997 required regulation of hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane wells in Alabama. EPA approved Alabama's UIC program revision to include regulations for hydraulic fracturing. EPA then sought more information before making further regulatory decisions. EPA conducted a study on hydraulic fracturing's impact on drinking water sources in coalbed methane production. A draft report in 2002 highlighted water quality issues in several states but suggested the overall impact was small. The National Drinking Water Advisory Council recommended eliminating diesel fuel in fracturing fluids, studying health and environmental risks, and defending EPA's authority. EPA is expected to release a final report in early 2004. The curr_chunk discusses a proposed amendment to the Clean Water Act that would provide a permanent exemption for oil and gas companies from stormwater runoff rules during the construction of exploration and production facilities. This amendment aims to align construction activities with the existing exemption for operational facilities in the oil and gas industry. The curr_chunk discusses the statutory exemption from stormwater rules for small construction sites and municipal separate storm sewer systems under Phase II of the Clean Water Act stormwater program. EPA issued rules in 1999, effective March 10, 2003, requiring permits for sites disturbing one to five acres and systems serving populations up to 100,000. Compliance deadline was March 2003, with EPA proposing a two-year extension. EPA proposed a two-year extension of Phase II rules for small oil and gas construction sites to assess economic impact. The delay was to comply with Executive Order 13211 and recent data showed thousands of new sites per year would be subject to the rule. The provision in the conference bill made the two-year delay permanent for all oil and gas construction activities. The EPA's two-year delay becomes permanent for all oil and gas construction activities, regardless of size. Industry officials argued that the stormwater rule imposed costly permitting requirements, while supporters believed it clarified existing CWA language. Despite opposition, the provision remained in the energy legislation after House and conference deliberations. The House defeated a motion to remove the oil and gas exemption provision from the bill. The Secretary of Transportation could use environmental impact statements from other federal agencies for deepwater port applications. Appeals for natural gas pipelines and offshore energy projects would be based on records compiled by FERC or permitting agencies. The sense of Congress is for appeals regarding natural gas pipeline construction to be coordinated within FERC's timeframes. Bilateral international oil supply agreements with Israel would be made permanent and have the force of law. Sections addressing natural gas market reform would tackle price reporting issues post-Enron scandal. Section 332 and Section 333 of the Commodity Exchange Act aim to address false reporting in the natural gas market and improve transparency by imposing penalties for knowingly false reports and directing FERC to issue rules for timely reporting of prices and availability. These measures are in response to price-reporting schemes that artificially inflated gas prices, impacting unrelated transactions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and FERC have authority to regulate public trading in natural gas to prevent market manipulation. Order 644 was issued to establish rules against market abuse and ensure a stable marketplace. NYMEX also has authority to prevent trading abuses on its platform. NYMEX formulated a proposal in November 2003 to address trading abuses on its platform, including strict record keeping and price disclosure. Sections 341-348 focus on leasing and permitting processes for oil and gas development, with concerns over delays and environmental protections. The federal oil and gas leasing program is governed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, with Bureau of Land Management procedures for permit applications outlined in 43 CFR 3162.3-1. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) processes permit applications for oil and gas development within a 35-day period. The Bush Administration has taken action to streamline the permitting process, including conducting environmental analyses and implementing development planning. An Office of Federal Energy Project Coordination (FEPC) would be established to review and report on more efficient federal permitting practices. The federal government is conducting an internal review of the oil and gas leasing process to address environmental concerns and conflicts over resource use. The Secretary is tasked with expediting environmental reviews and implementing best management practices for timely action on leases and permits. An MOU will be signed to streamline the processing of lease applications and ensure consistency in applying lease stipulations. The U.S. Geological Survey and Department of Energy will assess onshore oil and gas resources and economic reserves. The Secretary of Energy will assess economic reserves and compliance with Executive Order No. 13211 is required for regulations affecting domestic energy supply. A pilot program for energy development on federal land will be established, with Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico invited to participate. The Secretary of the Interior will have specific timelines for processing permit applications for drilling. Section 348 outlines the permit issuance process by the Secretary based on meeting criteria within a two-year period. Section 349 addresses fair market rental value determinations for public land rights-of-way. Section 350 requires a report on existing rights-of-way on federal land for energy facilities. Section 351 mandates consultation on energy rights-of-way on public land. Section 351 mandates consultation on energy rights-of-way on public land, requiring the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to coordinate environmental compliance and processing of rights-of-way applications within six months of enactment. Section 352 involves preparing a five-year plan for renewable energy development on federal lands, including an analysis of rights of way and projected benefits. Additionally, a National Academy of Sciences study will assess renewable energy on the outer continental shelf within two years. Section 353 designates the Bureau of Land Management as the lead agency for environmental reviews for a high-voltage electricity transmission line in Cleveland National Forest and adjacent public land. Section 354: Sense of Congress Regarding Development of Minerals Under Padre Island National Seashore. Congress recognizes split estate on Padre Island National Seashore, with federal government owning surface rights and mineral rights held privately and by Texas. Section 355: Encouraging Prohibition of Offshore Drilling in the Great Lakes. States near Great Lakes urged to ban offshore drilling. Section 356: Finger Lakes National Forest Withdrawal. Federal land in Finger Lakes National Forest in New York to be withdrawn from entry, appropriation, or disposal. Section 357: Study on Lease Exchanges in the Rocky Mountain Front. The Secretary of the Interior would consider opportunities for domestic oil and gas production through the exchange of non-producing leases in defined areas of the Rocky Mountain Front. This section was not included in the House and Senate bills. Section 358: Federal Coalbed Methane Regulation. States on the list of \"affected states\" under the Energy Policy Act would be subject to federal regulation. States on the list of \"affected states\" under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 may be removed if they take specified actions within three years of H.R. 6 enactment or had previously taken action. The list includes West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana, and Illinois due to coalbed methane ownership disputes and lack of regulatory framework. States can be removed from the list through a petitioning process initiated by the governor. This provision was not included in the House and Senate bills. Section 359 amends the Livingston Parish Mineral Rights Transfer. The \"Conveyance of Lands\" provision in Section 102 of P.L. 102-562 is amended to maintain the reservation of mineral rights in specific areas of Livingston Parish, Louisiana. The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act, Subtitle D, aims to facilitate the construction of a pipeline to transport natural gas from the Alaskan North Slope to the lower 48 states. It includes definitions for ANS natural gas and the Transportation Project, as well as directives for FERC to issue a certificate of convenience and necessity for the pipeline project. The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act aims to expedite the approval process for building a pipeline from the Alaskan North Slope to the lower 48 states. It includes provisions for FERC to issue a certificate within 60 days, prohibits a northerly route under the Beaufort Sea, and requires an \"open season\" to gauge public demand for the project. Section 374 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act aims to fast-track environmental reviews for the proposed Alaska gas pipeline. FERC would lead the NEPA compliance process, coordinating with other federal agencies to consolidate environmental reviews into one impact statement. Deadlines are set for issuing draft and final EIS to prevent delays. Section 375 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act grants FERC the authority to order project capacity expansion after a hearing based on requests for additional capacity. The applicant must commit to transport services, and the expansion must not discriminate against other shippers or impact downstream facilities. Section 376 establishes an independent Office of the Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, headed by a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate. The Secretary of Energy holds these authorities temporarily until a coordinator is appointed. The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act grants FERC the authority to order project capacity expansion. Section 376 establishes an independent Office of the Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, with the coordinator responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of the bill. The coordinator would not have authority to override FERC decisions and would monitor construction in partnership with the state. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would have jurisdiction over disputes, with claims needing to be brought within 60 days for expedited consideration. Section 378 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act grants the state jurisdiction over in-state distribution pipelines connected to the project, ensuring they do not fall under FERC jurisdiction. Section 379 mandates a study of alternative construction approaches if no project application is filed within 18 months. The bill calls for a study of alternative construction approaches, including federal corporation ownership and financing options. The Secretary would report findings to Congress. Section 380 clarifies ANGTA status and allows for updates to meet current project requirements. Section 381 urges the use of North American steel and negotiation of a project labor agreement. The bill emphasizes the use of North American steel and project labor agreements. It also encourages small business participation and proposes a training program for adult workers in Alaska for the gas transport project. The bill emphasizes the use of North American steel and project labor agreements, encourages small business participation, and proposes a training program for adult workers in Alaska for the gas transport project. Constructions work was expected to begin within two years. Congress is concerned about the demand for natural gas outstripping supplies and believes Alaskan and Canadian resources are needed. Congress also supports local ownership of the pipeline in Alaska and grants loan guarantees for the project. The bill would authorize the Secretary of Energy to issue loan guarantees to pipeline certificate holders, with a limit of $18 billion for debt obligations. The guarantees would expire two years after the certificate is issued, and could cover all components of the transport system. The Secretary could also extend guarantees to the Canadian segment of the Alaska gas transportation project. The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 gives FERC authority to certificate pipelines, ensuring just and reasonable rates. ANGTA paved the way for the project in H.R. 6, specifying the pipeline route. Significant ANS gas reserves in Prudhoe Bay remain untapped due to lack of transportation system. Demand for natural gas in lower 48 states has increased, leading to high prices and volatility. Construction of Alaskan gas pipeline is years away, exacerbating supply-demand imbalance. Construction began today on the Alaska pipeline, with concerns about the supply-demand situation. Proponents argue that loan guarantees are necessary due to the high risk and $20 billion cost. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is a 10-year, $2 billion program supporting projects to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is a 10-year, $2 billion program that collaborates with the private sector to demonstrate new technologies for coal-fired power plants. The program is funded through the annual Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill and authorizes $200 million annually from FY2004-FY2012. The federal share of financing for clean coal projects would not exceed 50%, with a report on project status and technical milestones submitted every two years to congressional committees. The Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) is a program funded through the annual Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to demonstrate new technologies for coal-fired power plants. President Bush's National Energy Policy aims to use coal more efficiently and reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants. The program includes grants to universities to establish Centers of Excellence for energy systems of the future and authorizes loans and guarantees for clean power projects. Loan guarantees are available for power plants using IGCC technology in taconite-producing regions of the US. Projects involving co-production of electricity and fuels, low-Btu coal with renewable energy sources, carbon dioxide sequestration, and hydrogen production are eligible. Additionally, funds are allocated for a project demonstrating high-energy electron scrubbing technology for coal emissions. The curr_chunk discusses modifications to federal coal leasing procedures to increase coal production on federal lands, including issues related to regional competition and returns to the U.S. Treasury. Current law limits modifications to existing coal leases and requires diligent development, with the option to suspend conditions with advance royalties. Financial assurance is also required for payment guarantees. The conference agreement under the Leasing Act would repeal the 160 acre limitation on coal lease modifications, allowing up to 1,280 acres to be added. Criteria would be set for extending the mine-out period beyond 40 years, and advance royalties could be paid to suspend continuous operation requirements. The three-year deadline for submitting a coal lease operation and reclamation plan would be eliminated. The bill would repeal the requirement for a financial surety bond for a coal lease bid and mandate an assessment of coal resources on public lands. It also includes a provision for a clean air coal program with funding for pollution control projects. The bill includes funding for pollution control projects to reduce emissions from coal-based electrical generation equipment. Project selection criteria prioritize improving air quality, replacing inefficient units, and enhancing thermal efficiency. Up to 25% of projects would focus on cogeneration or gasification, with a minimum of 25% solely for electrical generation. Federal loans or guarantees would not exceed 30% of total funds per fiscal year, with the federal share capped at 50%. The \"Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2003\" would create the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs at the Department of Energy. It outlines procedures for Indian tribes to develop and manage energy resources on tribal land. Regulations on tribal energy resource approval would be issued by the Department of the Interior within a year of the bill's enactment. The DOI would issue regulations for approval of tribal energy resource agreements, allowing Indian tribes to enter into leases or business agreements for energy development on tribal land. Assistance for tribal energy development would be provided through grants and low-interest loans from DOI and DOE. Federal agencies could give preference to Indian energy products. DOI would review tribal opportunities under the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982. Bonneville Power Administration and Western Area Power Administration would assist in developing distribution systems for power to Indian tribes. The DOE, Army, and DOI would study the feasibility of obtaining steady electricity from wind energy on tribal lands connected with hydropower from Missouri River power plants. The Dine Power Authority could receive grants to develop a transmission line from the Four Corners Area to southern Nevada. HUD would promote energy efficiency in federally assisted housing. The provision would expand current law for affordable housing development for Native Americans to include energy-efficient technologies. The Price-Anderson Act, addressing liability for damages from nuclear incidents, would be extended through 2023. Secretaries of Energy and Interior would consult with Indian tribes. The Price-Anderson Act extends liability coverage for existing reactors but not for new ones. Owners of commercial reactors must assume liability for nuclear damages and carry financial protection up to $300 million. Damages exceeding that amount are to be shared equally among covered reactors, up to $95.8 million per reactor. The Price-Anderson Act requires commercial reactors to pay retrospective premiums of up to $95.8 million per reactor annually, totaling $10.4 billion from 105 covered reactors. In the event of a major nuclear incident, compensation could reach $10.9 billion per incident with a 5% surcharge. The Price-Anderson Act caps the nuclear industry's liability for an incident at $10.9 billion, with payment above that limit requiring congressional approval. The liability limit for DOE contractors is currently $10.4 billion, the same as commercial reactors minus a 5% surcharge. Price-Anderson Act authorizes DOE to indemnify contractors for up to $10.4 billion for nuclear incidents, with payments coming from the U.S. Treasury. Contractors can be fined for safety violations, and individuals can face criminal penalties for violations. Some non-profit contractors are exempt from penalties. Liability coverage extended through 2023 for commercial reactors and DOE contractors. Total retrospective premium set for each reactor. The Price-Anderson Act authorizes DOE to indemnify contractors for up to $10.4 billion for nuclear incidents, with payments from the U.S. Treasury. Liability coverage extended through 2023 for commercial reactors and DOE contractors. Total retrospective premium set for each reactor at $95.8 million, with annual payments raised to $15 million and adjusted for inflation every five years. Liability limit on DOE contractors set at $10 billion per accident, with maximum indemnification for incidents outside the U.S. raised to $500 million. The Price-Anderson Act would raise liability limits from $100 million to $500 million for nuclear incidents. Indemnification would be prohibited for contracts related to nuclear facilities in countries sponsoring terrorism. The NRC and DOE must report to Congress on the need for further Price-Anderson extensions. Civil penalty exemptions for safety violations by non-profit contractors would be eliminated, with penalties limited to management fees received under the contract. The conference agreement on the Price-Anderson Act does not include provisions for the federal government to sue DOE contractors for compensation in case of accidents caused by misconduct. The Act's liability limits would be raised to $500 million for nuclear incidents, with penalties for safety violations limited to management fees received under the contract. Opponents argue that Price-Anderson subsidizes the nuclear power industry by protecting it from financial consequences of severe accidents. Missing the deadline for extension would have little short-term effect on the industry, but new DOE contracts would need alternate indemnification authority. The initial 40-year period for a commercial nuclear reactor license begins when authorized by the NRC, even before construction starts. The conference provision from the House bill was included in the Senate version, with sections on NRC training, cost recovery from government agencies, and elimination of pension offset for key NRC personnel. The NRC would be authorized to charge cost-based fees for services to federal agencies and hire retired employees as contractors without annuity reductions. Section 625: Antitrust Review Suspension. NRC would no longer have to submit nuclear reactor license applications to the Attorney General for antitrust reviews, as currently required by Atomic Energy Act, Section 105 c. Section 626: Decommissioning Fund Protection. NRC would be explicitly authorized to issue regulations ensuring that funds collected to decommission nuclear power plants would not be used for other purposes. Section 627: Limitation on Liability for Certain Nuclear Incidents. Owners of nuclear power plants would be provided with liability protection for incidents involving nuclear material transported offsite for disposal. Section 627 prohibits DOE from reimbursing contractors for legal expenses related to whistleblower complaints. Section 628 establishes a program to decommission a test reactor in Arkansas. Section 629 requires a feasibility study for commercial reactors at DOE sites. Section 630 restricts DOE uranium sales to 3 million pounds per year. Section 630 restricts DOE uranium sales to specific annual limits and allows for transfers to USEC Inc. Section 631 authorizes funding for research on in-situ leaching mining technologies. Section 632 extends whistleblower protections to NRC contractors. Section 632 of the bill extends whistleblower protections to NRC contractors, allowing employees to take their complaints to federal court if a final decision is not reached within 540 days. The House bill proposed further extending protections to DOE and NRC employees with a 180-day decision deadline for the Secretary of Labor, while the Senate bill did not include this provision. Additionally, Section 633 allows for the export of highly enriched uranium to certain countries for medical isotope production, exempting them from requirements to switch to low-enriched uranium fuel immediately. The conference bill includes an exemption for certain countries to continue using highly enriched uranium (HEU) for medical isotope production, with the termination of the exemption upon certification that U.S. demand can be met with low-enriched uranium (LEU). This provision aims to promote cooperation in converting HEU reactors to LEU, but some argue that the restrictions could disrupt the supply of medical isotopes. Additionally, DOE-managed material at the Fernald uranium processing facility would be classified as byproduct material. The conference bill includes provisions for safe disposal of greater-than-Class-C radioactive waste, prohibiting nuclear exports to terrorism sponsors, and designating an office for developing a plan for disposal of low-level radioactive waste exceeding NRC limits. The conference bill includes provisions to block a 1994 agreement with North Korea and expedite the licensing process for uranium enrichment facilities. DOE would take possession of depleted uranium hexafluoride, with costs limited to those assessed to USEC Inc. The conference bill includes provisions for a proposed uranium enrichment plant in New Mexico, a national low-enriched uranium stockpile, and the authorization for an advanced hydrogen-producing nuclear reactor in Idaho. The project must begin producing hydrogen or electricity by 2010 unless deemed infeasible by the Secretary of Energy. The bill authorizes funding for a nuclear facility security program, requiring the President to identify security threats and take necessary actions. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) would conduct security exercises and protect information about nuclear facility security. Section 662 of the bill extends fingerprinting requirements for criminal background checks to individuals with unescorted access to radioactive materials. Section 663 authorizes the use of firearms by security personnel at nuclear facilities regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Section 663 of the bill allows NRC employees and contractors to use firearms, extending existing control on dangerous weapons to commercial nuclear power plants. Penalties for sabotage of nuclear facilities would increase to $1 million and life imprisonment without parole. Section 663 of the bill increases penalties for sabotage of nuclear facilities to $1 million and life imprisonment without parole. The provision also includes requirements for secure transfer of nuclear materials and consultation with the Department of Homeland Security before issuing a license for a nuclear power plant. The conference report includes a provision for increased penalties for sabotage of nuclear facilities to $1 million and life imprisonment without parole. It also addresses the secure transfer of nuclear materials and consultation with the Department of Homeland Security before licensing a nuclear power plant. Additionally, the report introduces a new section authorizing appropriation of necessary funds for implementing alternative fuel and vehicle purchase requirements under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This includes mandates for federal vehicle fleets, state fleets, and fleets operated by alternative fuel providers to use alternative fuels in dual-fueled vehicles. The provision allows agencies to be exempt from the requirement for dual-fuel vehicles to operate on alternative fuel. It also includes a provision for neighborhood electric vehicles to qualify as alternative fuel vehicles. Section 703 of the bill allows vehicle fleets to claim extra credits for purchasing dedicated medium- and heavy-duty vehicles operating solely on alternative fuels. A dedicated medium-duty vehicle counts as two light-duty vehicles, and a heavy-duty vehicle counts as three. Currently, federal fleets receive three credits for a dedicated medium-duty vehicle and four credits for a dedicated heavy-duty vehicle. The House and Senate versions of the bill do not contain a similar provision. The conference report on EPAct allows federal agencies to allocate the incremental cost of alternative fuel vehicles across the whole fleet. It also introduces new ways for fleets to comply with vehicle purchase requirements, including the option to petition for a waiver if certain criteria are met. The conference report on EPAct introduces new ways for fleets to comply with vehicle purchase requirements, including generating vehicle purchase credits for alternative fuel vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles. Subsection (b) allows fleets to earn credits based on hybrid system performance and investments in alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure. Subsection (c) expands the definition of alternative fuel to include lease condensate and fuels derived from it. The conference report on EPAct introduces new ways for fleets to comply with vehicle purchase requirements by generating vehicle purchase credits for alternative fuel vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles. Fleets could earn credits for the use of lease condensate fuel in medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The Secretary of Energy would conduct a study on the effectiveness of alternative fuel vehicle programs under EPAct. The Secretary would assess the effects on vehicle technology, availability, and cost. Federal agencies must report annually on compliance with EPAct vehicle purchase requirements. The requirement would be extended through 2018. Research on hybrid vehicle technologies would be accelerated. Grants would be provided for the purchase of alternative fuel, hybrid, fuel cell, and ultra-low sulfur diesel vehicles, administered through the Clean Cities Program. Grants capped at $20. The CleanCities Program would administer a grant program with a $20 million cap per applicant. 20-25% of funds would go towards ultra-low sulfur diesel vehicles. The Secretary must report to Congress on grant recipients and program effectiveness. $200 million total would be authorized for the grant program. Additionally, a program to demonstrate up to 25 fuel cell transit buses would be established with $10 million annually authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. The Senate version did not include a provision for a pilot program to provide grants for clean school buses, including alternative fuel and advanced diesel buses.

The EPA Administrator must report on the trading of emission credits within 180 days. The legislation aims to promote fuel conservation measures and reduce emissions from aircraft and diesel vehicles to meet Tier 2 standards by 2010. Section 755 directs the Department of Transportation to conduct pilot bicycling projects to conserve energy, with a minimum of 20% of costs provided by state or local sources. It also requires a study on converting motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips. Section 756 mandates EPA to study emissions from idling vehicles and establish a program to reduce engine idling of heavy-duty vehicles. Section 757 of the conference report authorizes $95 million for a deployment program to support idle-reduction technologies, differing from the House and Senate versions. Section 758 requires the Secretary of Energy to study the effects of biodiesel on emissions control technologies, with $5 million authorized annually. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21, P.L. 105-178) would be amended to allow states to exempt hybrid and dedicated alternative fuel vehicles from high occupancy vehicle (HOV) restrictions. States currently do not have the authority to exempt any type of alternative fuel vehicle from HOV restrictions. The conference bill would authorize $2 million annually during FY2004-FY2008 for fuel economy standards. The legislation would authorize $2 million annually for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to carry out fuel economy rulemakings and expand criteria for setting maximum feasible fuel economy for cars and light trucks.

The Secretary of Energy is directed to increase participation of minority-serving institutions in research and training activities. A National Power Plant Operations Technology and Education Center would be established for training certified operators. International energy training efforts would be coordinated for countries with developing economies. Annual appropriations of $1.5 million for FY2004-FY2007 are allocated for these initiatives. Title XII of the H.R. 6 conference report focuses on electric power issues, including the creation of an electric reliability organization (ERO) to enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk-power system. The ERO can impose penalties for violations, address transmission infrastructure issues, and allow for the acquisition of rights-of-way for transmission line construction through eminent domain. The H.R. 6 conference report addresses electric power issues, including the right of eminent domain for transmission line construction. It proposes remanding FERC's Standard Market Design rulemaking, clarifying native load service obligations, allowing federal utilities in regional transmission organizations, repealing PURPA provisions, PUHCA, and granting FERC access to utility records for establishing an electronic system for wholesale electric energy information. The Electric Reliability Act of 2003 would amend the Federal Power Act to give FERC review authority for asset transfers over $10 million. It also includes provisions for increased penalties for unjust wholesale electric rates and requires FERC to create electric reliability standards within 180 days of enactment. The Electric Reliability Act of 2003 mandates FERC to establish an ERO to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system. FERC can impose penalties for violations of approved standards and order compliance. Additionally, FERC may establish a regional advisory body upon request from two-thirds of states in a region with over half of their electric load served within that region. The Electric Reliability Act of 2003 mandates FERC to establish an ERO to develop and enforce reliability standards for the bulk-power system. FERC can impose penalties for violations and order compliance. A regional advisory body may be formed with one member from each participating state, providing advice on reliability standards, proposed entities, fees, and other responsibilities. The provision does not apply to Alaska or Hawaii. Section 1221 focuses on siting interstate electric transmission facilities, allowing the Secretary of Energy to designate congested areas for potential construction permits. Interested parties would have the opportunity to present their views. Indian tribes, property owners, and other interested parties can present their views on proposed construction permits. Permit holders can petition in U.S. District Court for rights-of-way through eminent domain, with compensation due. It is unclear if property owners must reimburse compensation if rights-of-way are transferred back. Applicants for federal authorization to site transmission facilities on federal lands can request the Department of Energy as the lead agency. The Department of Energy could be the lead agency for coordinating environmental reviews and federal authorizations for transmission facilities on federal lands. It would have new authority to prepare environmental documents and make decisions on rights-of-way. Denials of authorizations could be appealed to the Secretary of Energy. The denial of authorizations for transmission facilities on federal lands could be appealed to the Secretary of Energy within 90 days. States could form interstate compacts for siting transmission facilities, and the Secretary of Energy could offer technical assistance. This provision does not apply to ERCOT. WAPA and SWPA could continue to develop transmission facilities in their regions or collaborate with other entities if designated as National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors. The project aims to reduce congestion and accommodate increased demand for transmission capacity. It must align with regional transmission organization needs. A study is required to create a transmission monitoring system for Eastern and Western interconnections, providing real-time information to system owners and organizations. Section 1224 of the bill directs FERC to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies. Section 1225 requires the Secretary of Energy to implement a program promoting reliability and efficiency of the electric transmission system, with progress reports due to Congress within one and two years of enactment. The Secretary of Energy would establish a research initiative on high-temperature superconductivity with appropriations authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. Another program would provide incentive payments for advanced power generation systems, with $140 million authorized for FY2004 through FY2008. Section 1227 authorizes the establishment of an Office of Electric Transmission and Distribution to improve electric transmission, oversee research, and develop workforce training programs. Section 1231 grants FERC the authority to require unregulated utilities to transmit electricity. The proposed legislation would allow certain entities to transmit electricity for others at comparable rates, with exemptions for smaller utilities and those not essential for a nationwide transmission system. FERC could remand transmission rates to unregulated utilities if they do not comply with the requirements. The proposed legislation allows certain entities to transmit electricity at comparable rates, with exemptions for smaller utilities. FERC cannot force unregulated utilities to join a regional transmission organization. Section 1232 establishes a sense of Congress for utilities to voluntarily join regional transmission organizations. Section 1233 requires FERC to report on the status of all regional transmission organization applications within 120 days. Section 1234 of the proposed legislation authorizes federal utilities to participate in regional transmission organizations, while repealing a law allowing them to study the formation and operation of such organizations. Section 1235 remands FERC's proposed rulemaking on standard market design for reconsideration. Section 1236 of the legislation clarifies that load-serving entities can use their transmission facilities for existing customers before making capacity available for other uses. FERC cannot change approved transmission rights allocations by RTOs or ISOs before September 15, 2003. Section 1237 mandates a study on the benefits of economic dispatch by the Secretary of Energy. Section 1237 of H.R. 6 mandates a study on the benefits of economic dispatch by the Secretary of Energy. The study aims to report on the current status of economic dispatch, defined as operating generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost while ensuring reliability. This section is part of the House-passed H.R. 6 and focuses on promoting reliable and economically efficient electric transmission and generation. The House-passed H.R. 6 includes provisions for increased transfer capacity of transmission facilities, recovery of incurred costs for reliability standards, and incentive rate-making for utilities joining regional organizations. Section 1242 allows transmission providers to allocate costs of new facilities, with participant funding for transmission expansion benefiting specific parties. Participant funding, as included in the House-passed H.R. 6, protects native load customers from paying for transmission upgrades for new generator interconnection not required by the native load. Section 1251 of the bill mandates states to consider implementing net metering standards within three years, defining net metering service as using on-site generated energy to offset energy provided by the utility. The House- and Senate-passed H.R. 6 includes provisions for net metering and smart metering. Section 1252 mandates states to investigate and decide on implementing time-based meters and communication devices for electric utility customers, allowing participation in pricing rate schedules. The amendment to PURPA requires consumer education on advanced metering technologies and addressing barriers to demand response programs. The Secretary of Energy would provide technical assistance to regional organizations to identify demand response potential and develop programs. FERC would issue an annual report to assess demand response resources. Section 1253 of H.R. 6 would repeal the mandatory purchase requirement under PURPA for new contracts in competitive electricity markets. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2003 would repeal ownership limitations under PURPA and provide definitions for various terms related to utilities and energy markets. This includes access to transmission services and non-discriminatory treatment for all customers. Section 1263 of the bill repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Section 1264 provides federal access to books and records of holding companies and their affiliates, with confidentiality maintained. Section 1265 allows state commissions to request access to specific books and records from holding companies, which must be kept confidential and compliance is mandatory. Section 1266 of the bill directs FERC to create rules exempting certain entities from federal access to books and records. Section 1267 ensures FERC's authority to prevent cross-subsidization and maintain just and reasonable rates. Section 1268: Applicability of the provision to certain entities, excluding the U.S. government and foreign governmental authorities. Section 1269: Ensures that FERC and state commissions can still protect utility customers under existing laws. Section 1270: Grants FERC enforcement authority under the Federal Power Act. Section 1271: Allows individuals to continue engaging in certain activities. Section 1271 of H.R. 6 allows individuals to continue legal activities they were engaged in before the Act, without limiting FERC's authority. Section 1272 requires FERC to implement regulations within 12 months and recommend any necessary amendments to federal law. Section 1273 mandates the transfer of applicable books and records from the Securities and Exchange Commission to FERC. Section 1274 of H.R. 6 states that twelve months after enactment, this subtitle would take effect. Section 1275 requires FERC to review and authorize cost allocations for non-power goods or services provided by an associate company. FERC must issue rules within six months to exempt certain companies from this requirement. Section 1276 authorizes certain actions. Section 1276 of H.R. 6 authorizes necessary funds to be appropriated for carrying out the subtitle. Section 1277 amends the Federal Power Act to reflect changes to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Section 1281 requires FERC to establish market transparency rules within 180 days, ensuring protection for consumers in competitive markets. Section 1282 of H.R. 6 addresses market manipulation, making it unlawful to file false reports on electricity prices or transmission capacity with the intent to fraudulently affect data compiled by a federal agency. This section aims to prevent anti-competitive behaviors resulting from untimely public disclosure of transaction-specific information. FERC is not allowed to compete with or regulate price publishers under this provision. Market transparency rules were included in the House- and Senate-passed H.R. 6. Section 1283 of H.R. 6 focuses on enforcement measures related to market manipulation in electricity trading. It prohibits round-trip trading to distort reported revenues, trading volumes, or prices. The amendment allows electric utilities to file complaints with FERC and increases criminal and civil penalties, with fines up to $1 million and/or five years imprisonment for criminal violations. Civil penalties could reach $1 million per day per violation. Section 1284 of H.R. 6 amends Section 206(b) of the Federal Power Act to allow refunds to begin at the time of a complaint filing with FERC, not later than five months after. FERC must provide reasons for any delays in decision-making. Section 1285 grants FERC refund authority for short-term electricity sales by non-public utility entities, lasting 31 days or less. Section 1285 of H.R. 6 grants FERC refund authority for short-term electricity sales lasting 31 days or less, excluding electric cooperatives and entities selling less than 8 million megawatthours per year. FERC can order refunds for unjust rates from power marketing administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority. FERC is authorized to modify or abrogate contracts if it is in the public interest, but cannot do so for contracts with a different standard of review. Section 1287 of H.R. 6 authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules against slamming and cramming by electric utilities. If state regulations offer equal or better protection, they would take precedence over FTC regulations. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 6 required rules to prevent slamming and cramming. Section 1291 of the bill focuses on Merger Review Reform and Accountability, requiring the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on FERC's merger review authority within 180 days of enactment. FERC must issue an annual report to Congress on merger conditions and whether they could have been imposed under other provisions of the Federal Power Act. Section 1292 amends the Federal Power Act to give FERC review authority for asset transfers over $10 million, with requirements for notifying state utility commissions and governors. Section 1295 amends definitions under the Federal Power Act, adding terms like electric cooperative and commission. Section 1297 makes conforming amendments to the Act. Sections 1300-1366 are not covered in this report. Section 1401 establishes the Denali Commission as a federal-state partnership. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, is a federal-state partnership providing utilities and economic support in Alaska. Funding of up to $5 million annually for the Power Cost Equalization Program and up to $50 million annually for energy development from federal royalties in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Section 1402 encourages grants and loans for rural communities with high electricity costs. Section 1411 allows lessees in Louisiana to withhold federal royalties by paying the state 44 cents per dollar withheld, with relief ending once certain drainage claims are settled. Section 1412 proposes returning a portion of federal revenues from offshore energy activities to coastal states for specified activities. Representatives of coastal states with offshore energy development seek to allocate federal revenues to areas affected by onshore and near-shore activities. Louisiana faces significant coastal destruction, losing wetlands to the ocean annually. The Coastal Energy Impact Assistance Program was established in the late 1970s to address the impacts of coastal energy development. The conference agreement would establish a new Domestic Offshore Energy Reinvestment Program funded by a Secure Energy Reinvestment Fund. This fund would receive qualified revenues from energy activities on the outer continental shelf, including royalty income, bonus bid income, and interest income. Spending from the fund would be subject to appropriation, with authorized appropriations of up to $500 million annually. The new Domestic Offshore Energy Reinvestment Program would receive qualified revenues from energy activities on the outer continental shelf, including royalty income. The fund could total about $1 billion, with Louisiana potentially receiving almost 50% of the amount. Coastal states and political subdivisions in those states would be eligible to receive money from the fund, with allocations determined by a formula accounting for energy revenues generated offshore in federal waters. The new program would allocate 35% of energy revenues from federal waters to coastal political subdivisions based on a formula considering population, coastline length, distance from leased tracts, and support activities. States can use funds to improve environmental quality and address offshore energy impacts, with approved plans required for funding. States with approved plans would receive at least 5% of funds annually for authorized uses. The new program allocates 35% of energy revenues from federal waters to coastal political subdivisions based on a formula. States can use funds for environmental quality and offshore energy impacts, with at least 5% allocated annually for authorized uses. A coastal restoration program would be established using 2% of funds each year for various purposes. The program allocates 35% of energy revenues from federal waters to coastal political subdivisions. States can use funds for environmental quality and offshore energy impacts, with at least 5% allocated annually for authorized uses. A coastal restoration program would be established using 2% of funds each year for various purposes, with an additional $10 million annually authorized. This is part of ongoing efforts to allocate federal offshore oil and gas revenues to assist coastal states in addressing the impacts of these activities. The appropriations legislation (P.L. 106-553) supported coastal impact assistance and CARA proposals for federal natural resource protection programs. Interest in funding coastal resource protection and restoration efforts has grown, but support for broad legislation like CARA has declined. Efforts remain to return a portion of money from offshore leasing to affected areas. Sections 1431-1434 focus on changes to Board of Directors and Staff Appointments. Changes to the TVA Board of Directors include expanding the number of presidential appointments to nine members with five-year terms. A Chief Operating Officer would be established to offer competitive salaries to top executives. The board members would meet quarterly for oversight functions, and the chairman would be designated by the board. Additionally, a transmission security order for the Cross Sound Cable between Connecticut and Long Island would be continued. The conference bill would require the transmission of electric power from Connecticut and Long Island to continue unless rescinded by federal statute. Section 1442 would give the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving delays in natural gas pipeline projects certified by FERC. This measure aims to address delays in obtaining environmental permits after FERC approval. Section 1443 of the conference bill extends Clean Air Act deadlines for ozone nonattainment areas based on upwind contributions. Areas with higher pollutant concentrations have more time to reach attainment but must implement stricter emission controls. Failure to meet deadlines results in reclassification to a higher nonattainment category. The Clean Air Act extends deadlines for ozone nonattainment areas based on upwind contributions. Failure to reach attainment results in reclassification to a higher category with stricter controls. EPA has generally not reclassified areas for missing deadlines due to external pollution sources. EPA was sued for not reclassifying areas like Dallas-Fort Worth, which faced reclassification to a Severe category with a new deadline of 2005. EPA lost lawsuits for failing to reclassify areas like Washington, D.C., St. Louis, and Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas. The conference bill aims to roll back EPA reclassifications in areas affected by upwind pollution and extend attainment deadlines. It would set deadlines based on the last reductions needed for attainment in the downwind area, potentially extending beyond 2004, 2005, or 2007. The bill also applies to the new standard for average ozone levels over an eight-hour period, with flexibility for EPA to further extend deadlines. Energy Production Incentives: Congress can regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. States cannot burden interstate commerce excessively, but Congress can authorize states to offer tax incentives for in-state energy production. The incentives can be for electricity from clean coal technology, renewable sources, and ethanol. Section 1445 allows the use of granular mine tailings. The conference bill would direct the EPA Administrator to establish criteria for the safe and environmentally protective use of granular mine tailings from the Tar Creek Mining District for cement or concrete, which is a hazardous waste cleanup site with lead and other heavy metals contamination. The conference bill directs the EPA Administrator to establish criteria for the safe use of granular mine tailings for cement or concrete projects and federally funded highway construction. It also requires the use of renewable fuel in gasoline, with specific volume targets for ethanol, biodiesel, and natural gas produced from landfills and sewage treatment plants. The Environmental Protection Agency would be required to establish regulations for the generation and trading of credits between entities to ensure the percentage of renewable fuel in gasoline equals that of 2012. This provision aligns with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which established the Reformulated Gasoline program. The oxygen requirement in reformulated gasoline (RFG) can be met through the use of MTBE or ethanol. Concerns about groundwater contamination from MTBE have led to interest in banning the substance. Some states have limited MTBE use, prompting discussions about eliminating the oxygen standard. The ethanol industry benefits from the oxygen requirement, but there are concerns about its future without it. Proponents of ethanol view it as a way to reduce petroleum consumption and foreign oil dependence, leading to discussions about establishing a renewable fuels standard. Opponents argue that ethanol is costly, inefficient, and poses a risk of groundwater contamination. The section provides a \"safe harbor\" for renewable fuels and fuels containing MTBE, protecting against liability for cleanup or damages. It shifts the burden of proof to plaintiffs to demonstrate negligence in handling such fuels for liability. The conference version of the bill includes a safe harbor for renewable fuels and fuels containing MTBE, with an effective date of September 5, 2003. This provision would protect oil and chemical industry defendants from defective product claims in about 150 lawsuits filed in 15 states after that date. Additionally, there is a section for MTBE Transition Assistance, authorizing $2 billion for grants to assist U.S. producers of MTBE in converting to other fuel additives. The bill authorizes a smaller program for fuel additives endangering public health or the environment. It includes a ban on the use of MTBE in motor vehicle fuel after December 31, 2014, with exceptions for states that authorize its use. EPA could allow MTBE in fuel up to 0.5% in certain cases. The President could delay the restrictions on MTBE, pending a review by the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences will review MTBE's effects on the environment and public health by May 31, 2014. A provision in the bill eliminates the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline, which has been a driver for MTBE use. Refineries must maintain emissions reductions achieved in 1999 and 2000 to prevent backsliding. A credit trading program among refiners and importers for toxic air pollutants emissions would be established. EPA must regulate hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles and fuels by July 1, 2004. Stricter VOC standards would apply to reformulated gasoline in northern states. EPA and DOE would conduct analyses and data collection on the effects of the Clean Air Act provisions. DOE would collect and publish monthly survey data on renewable fuels production, blending, importing, demand, and price nationally and regionally. The conference report would restrict EPA approval of state fuel standards unless it's determined they won't disrupt fuel supply or production. EPA and DOE must study federal, state, and local motor fuels requirements and their effects on consumer prices. The Secretary of Energy would establish a loan guarantee program for facilities producing fuel ethanol and other byproducts from municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass. Additionally, $4 million annually would be authorized for the Bioconversion Resource Center from FY2004 through FY2006. The Bioconversion Resource Center at the University of Mississippi and the University of Oklahoma would receive $4 million annually for FY2004 through FY2006 for the development of bioconversion technology for ethanol production. Additionally, the Secretary of Energy could provide grants for the construction of ethanol plants using cellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, or agricultural byproducts, with a total authorization of $750 million for FY2004 through FY2006. Section 1513 (1514) allows RFG retailers to blend batches with and without ethanol as long as both are compliant with the Clean Air Act. Retailers can blend batches over two 10-day periods in the summer months. Sections 1521-1533 focus on underground storage tank provisions to enhance leak prevention and enforcement. The conference report incorporates provisions from the Underground Storage Tank Compliance Act of 2003 to enhance leak prevention and enforcement. It includes new tank inspection and operator training requirements, prohibits fuel delivery to ineligible tanks, expands compliance requirements for federal facilities, and authorizes states to use funds from the LUST Trust Fund to help UST owners pay for remediation costs in cases where cleanup expenses would significantly impact their business. EPA and states are also required to develop a strategy to address releases on tribal lands. The LUST Trust Fund would be authorized to remediate oxygenated fuel contamination, enforce UST release prevention requirements, and appropriate $200 million annually for tank leak remediation and response to leaks containing MTBE or other oxygenated fuel additives. The House version of H.R. 6 proposed using $850 million from the LUST Trust Fund for cleaning up underground storage tank leaks of fuels containing oxygenates. The Senate version of H.R. 6 proposed authorizing $200 million from the Trust Fund for cleaning up MTBE and other ether fuel contamination. It also included provisions for using LUST funds for enforcing UST leak prevention programs, new research, and technical assistance. Additionally, Section 1601 called for a study on the inventory of petroleum and natural gas storage capacity to understand its impact on price volatility in the marketplace. The Senate version of H.R. 6 proposed authorizing $200 million from the Trust Fund for cleaning up MTBE and other ether fuel contamination. It also included provisions for using LUST funds for enforcing UST leak prevention programs, new research, and technical assistance. Section 1602 focuses on a Natural Gas Supply Shortage Report, while Section 1603 addresses Split-Estate Federal Oil and Gas Leasing and Development Practices. The report aims to maintain supply-demand balance, encourage energy conservation, reduce pollution, and improve access to domestic natural gas supplies. Section 1604 of the bill addresses conflicts between coal and coalbed methane development in the Powder River Basin, requiring the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on resolution plans. Section 1605 directs the DOE to study energy efficiency standards focusing on site or source measurement. This relates to a previous Executive Order on energy efficiency goals. Section 1606 directs the DOE to study the energy conservation potential of telecommuting by federal employees. Section 1607 requires a report on using the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program more effectively. Section 1608 mandates a joint study by DOE and EPA on oil bypass filtration technology benefits. Section 1610: University Collaboration. DOE would study promoting collaboration between large and small colleges for energy projects. Incentives may be provided for small colleges to participate in grants and agreements. Section 1611 of the House bill requires FERC to assess the impact of electric cooperative and government-owned utilities' exemption from FERC ratemaking regulation every five years. If adverse effects are found, FERC must make recommendations to Congress. The table in the text shows authorized funding in H.R. 6, including loans but not loan guarantees. The curr_chunk provides details on the agreement for H.R. 6, including the location of authorizing language in the bill, five-year subtotals for each line, and changes in S. 2095. It also includes information on funds allocation and endnotes with dropped and new details. The curr_chunk details funds allocation for various agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It mentions dropped provisions for funding from federal oil and gas leases and highlights funding for the Denali Commission and the Secure Energy Reinvestment Fund. Funding for Coastal Restoration and Enhancement would receive 2% of deposits into the Secure Energy Reinvestment Fund per fiscal year, requiring an appropriation before funds can be accessed."
