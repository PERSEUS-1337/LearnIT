Appraisals for the land values will be determined by the Secretary, following specific standards, and the encumbrance on the Federal land granted before its conveyance will not be considered in the appraisal. If the value of the non-Federal lands exceeds the final appraised value of the Federal land, equalization can be achieved by reducing acreage, making a cash payment to the District, or a combination of both.
