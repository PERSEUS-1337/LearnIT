    "content": "This report reviews congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC) since the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) post-9-11 Commission recommendations. It explores reform options and poses questions for Congress to evaluate oversight effectiveness in enabling the IC to conduct intelligence operations for national security while ensuring legality, ethics, and civil liberties. Congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC) aims to ensure legality, ethics, and civil liberties in intelligence operations. Different perspectives exist on the purpose of this oversight, including providing strategic direction for intelligence programs and counterbalancing the power of the executive branch. The role of congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community (IC) is to ensure independence and integrity in intelligence operations, serving as a check on potential biases and unethical practices within the IC. Members of congressional intelligence committees may hold different perspectives on oversight, with some emphasizing the need for the IC to speak truth to power without political influence. Some Members believe in the importance of bipartisanship and objectivity for effective intelligence oversight, while others focus on weaknesses in the structure and authority of congressional intelligence committees. Despite significant IC reforms in the past forty years, there are calls for Congress to change committee rules for better oversight. Critics argue that the current committee structure dilutes the authority of the HPSCI and SSCI in overseeing intelligence matters. Despite the growth of the IC, Congress lacks the expertise and time to effectively influence intelligence programs. The Hughes-Ryan amendment in 1974 provided the first statutory basis for congressional oversight of covert action operations. The Hughes-Ryan legislation in 1974 established congressional oversight of covert actions by requiring the President to inform Congress of the necessity for such actions. This was prompted by concerns over CIA activities in Chile and Southeast Asia, as well as reports of illegal domestic surveillance. Congress then formed select committees on intelligence to investigate these issues further. In the 1970s, Congress established committees to investigate legal and ethical abuses by intelligence agencies, leading to the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in 1976. This marked the first formal effort to hold the intelligence community accountable for their actions and spending. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) was established following the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in the 1970s. Various committees in Congress share oversight of intelligence programs, including those for Foreign Affairs/Relations, Armed Services, Appropriations, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. This overlapping jurisdiction has led to concerns about the effectiveness and authority of congressional intelligence committees. President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order 12036 on January 24, 1978, to ensure that foreign intelligence activities comply with US laws and national security policies. Critics argue that intelligence committees lack authority and focus too much on tactical rather than strategic intelligence issues. President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order 12036 in 1978 to keep intelligence activities in line with US laws. The order mandates that heads of intelligence agencies inform congressional committees about ongoing and planned activities, strengthening oversight. Congressional committees authorize intelligence activities through annual acts, as outlined in the National Security Act of 1947. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1981 codified requirements for prior notification of Congress regarding intelligence activities, including reporting illegal activities or intelligence failures. In cases of covert actions requiring urgent action, the President must notify congressional intelligence committees promptly. The CIA Inspector General Act of 1989 established a statutory IG responsible for overseeing CIA activities and informing congressional intelligence committees. The IG must provide semiannual reports and other reports upon request to ensure oversight. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations have influenced congressional oversight of intelligence. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations have influenced congressional oversight of intelligence, highlighting the need for substantial reform to address widespread dissatisfaction with current oversight practices. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations led to changes in Congress's oversight of intelligence, including implementing some recommendations for the Senate. Suggestions for further reform based on the Commission's recommendations continue to be cited, such as replacing the HPSCI and SSCI with a joint committee on intelligence. The 9/11 Commission recommended consolidating authorizations and appropriations in the HPSCI and SSCI, separating the NIP appropriation from the Defense appropriation, ensuring bipartisan representation in committees, and abolishing term limits for committee members. In 2004, the Senate adopted S.Res. 445 to change committee rules in line with some of the Commission's recommendations. The resolution S.Res. 445 aimed to increase the SSCI's authority as a select committee, giving it jurisdiction over reviewing presidential nominations for IC positions. It also limited standing committees' ability to change proposed legislation from the SSCI. Changes included reducing committee membership to 15, with funding divided between majority and minority members for hiring staff. Additionally, funds were allocated to hire a professional staff member for each SSCI member on intelligence matters. S.Res. 445 expanded the SSCI's authority, removed term limits, and established closer ties with the SASC. It also created a Subcommittee on Oversight and called for a Subcommittee on Intelligence in the Senate Committee on Appropriations. A memorandum of agreement was reached in February 2007 between the SSCI, Senate Appropriations Committee, and SAC Subcommittee on Defense. The memorandum of agreement (MOA) in 2007 allowed for closer ties between the SSCI, Senate Appropriations Committee, and SAC Subcommittee on Defense, enabling staff to attend each other's hearings and review intelligence appropriations legislation. Senator Christopher Bond criticized the MOA as weak, while the House of Representatives established a Select Intelligence Oversight Panel (SIOP) in response. The Select Intelligence Oversight Panel (SIOP) was established by the House of Representatives to review and study budget requests for intelligence activities, make recommendations to appropriations subcommittees, and provide oversight observations and recommendations for the Defense appropriations bill. The panel had 13 members, including key members from relevant committees, but the House Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense had the authority to report a bill to the House Appropriations Committee. The SIOP was abolished in 2011, replaced by an agreement between HPSCI and HAC for three HAC members to participate in hearings. The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2010 strengthened oversight with IGs in various intelligence agencies, sharing classified reports with congressional committees. The Intelligence Authorization Act of 2010 strengthened oversight by sharing classified reports with congressional committees and reaffirmed the GAO's authority to conduct audits of IC elements. The DNI issued ICD 114 to specify policy on working with the GAO. The directive ICD 114 outlines cooperation with the GAO, except for matters related to intelligence capabilities and activities. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing a Joint Committee on Intelligence, modeled after the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) fostered expertise, influenced executive branch policy, and provided efficient oversight. It had the authority to report legislation to Congress but was terminated in 1977 due to perceived conflicts of interest. The idea of a joint intelligence oversight committee was first proposed in 1955 by the Second Hoover Commission and Senator Mike Mansfield. Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana proposed a joint committee in 1955 and 1956 to provide oversight of the CIA, aiming to address concerns about the agency's activities. The committee would have had six members from each chamber and aimed to promote bipartisan and efficient congressional oversight of intelligence agencies. The 9/11 Commission recommended a similar committee modeled on the JCAE, with subpoena power and no term limits. A joint committee with authority to report legislation, subpoena power, and no term limits is proposed for oversight of intelligence programs. Advocates believe it would provide a more focused perspective and strengthen accountability. Opponents argue that the existing committee structure is more effective for oversight. Critics argue that concentrating oversight of intelligence among a smaller number in Congress could limit perspective and effectiveness. They believe a weak joint committee may not have the same influence as separate committees, leading to jurisdictional issues and increased risk of leaks. The current overlapping committee assignments allow members to develop expertise in assessing intelligence programs in the context of national security priorities and defense programs they support. The 9/11 Commission recommended giving the HPSCI and SSCI both authorizations and appropriations authority to enhance congressional oversight of intelligence. Supporters believe this would increase the committees' power and influence, improve integration of IC agencies, and enhance accountability of intelligence programs to Congress. Representative Lee Hamilton emphasized the importance of budget authority in making agencies responsive to congressional interests. The HPSCI and SSCI currently have jurisdiction over authorizations of the National Intelligence Program (NIP), with only the HPSCI having authority over the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). Senate rules allow the SSCI to provide informal recommendations on MIP authorizations to the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC). House and Senate Appropriations, not the intelligence committees, have jurisdiction over intelligence appropriations. Some argue that transferring appropriations authority to the HPSCI and SSCI would strengthen their understanding of intelligence programs and influence over intelligence policy. Transferring appropriations authority to the intelligence committees could enhance their oversight of intelligence programs and policy, currently hindered by focus on defense appropriations. Supporters argue that the Defense Subcommittees lack the capacity to adequately address the intelligence budget, which is a significant portion of the national defense budget. However, opponents fear political impracticality, a disconnect between intelligence and defense programs, and excessive power concentration in the intelligence committees. Consolidating authorizations and appropriations authority under the HPSCI and SSCI may weaken oversight by reducing checks and balances within Congress. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations for consolidation were achieved without rule changes. A Senate resolution during the 111th Congress aimed to transfer appropriations authority from the SAC to the SSCI but was not acted upon. The Senate introduced a proposal to establish intelligence appropriations subcommittees within the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, transferring jurisdiction over intelligence programs. A Senate resolution aimed to create an Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence but faced opposition. The Senate proposed establishing intelligence appropriations subcommittees within the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, transferring jurisdiction over intelligence programs. However, this measure faced opposition from the Subcommittee on Defense and has not been implemented. In the House, H.R. 334 was introduced to establish a Subcommittee on Intelligence in the appropriations committees of both chambers. Additionally, S.Res. 655 was introduced in the Senate to improve Congressional oversight of intelligence activities, but it never received a vote. Critics argue that these proposals fulfill the spirit of the 9/11 Commission's recommendation for consolidating appropriations and authorizations authority. Critics and proponents debate the establishment of an appropriations subcommittee dedicated to the intelligence budget, arguing over its political viability and potential impact on congressional oversight. Critics raise concerns about complicating appropriations for intelligence systems with defense applications or those supporting combat forces. Since 1947, the intelligence budget has been placed within the defense appropriation to protect it from budget cuts and maintain secrecy. Critics and proponents debate the establishment of a Subcommittee on Intelligence for oversight, with concerns about limiting perspectives and complicating appropriations for intelligence programs with defense applications. Since 2007, the DNI has been required to publish the NIP top line figure, following a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. There is a suggestion to establish a stand-alone NIP appropriation separate from the defense appropriation, separating the NIP from the DOD budget. Advocates believe this would improve long-term planning for intelligence programs and provide better oversight, while critics argue that the NIP is already included as a separate title in the Defense Appropriations Act. Some within the intelligence community believe that including intelligence programs in the annual DOD appropriation has allowed the budget to grow unnoticed. An independent intelligence appropriation could lead to more scrutiny and focus on programs. Senate rules have been amended to improve oversight and promote bipartisanship. The proposed changes aim to provide funding for a professional staff member to represent each Member of the SSCI on the committee, allowing for better representation of their priorities. This measure is suggested as a feasible next step for the HPSCI to address the shortage of experienced staff. Term limits for SSCI members were abolished by the Senate, but HPSCI rules still limit members' terms to eight years to prevent them from becoming too close to the agencies they oversee. Critics argue that term limits have reduced the experience necessary for effective oversight among committee members overseeing intelligence agencies. There are differing perspectives on the need for reform in congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community, with one emphasizing bipartisanship and member selection, and the other focusing on the relationship between committees and the IC. The second perspective on congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community emphasizes the importance of the organization and jurisdiction of relevant committees, such as the intelligence, armed services, and appropriations committees. It highlights the challenges of inertia, turf issues, and politics in bringing about change. Leadership and public engagement are seen as crucial in driving change within a resistant system. The text discusses the historical pattern of change-resistant congressional oversight of the Intelligence Community, noting that lawmakers only become energetic after a scandal or intelligence failure. The text highlights past instances where investigations were conducted following such shocks, but expresses concern about the lack of action in between these events. Critics view this approach as \"tinkering,\" a warning echoed by the 9/11 Commission. The text questions whether additional changes to congressional oversight of intelligence could enhance funding, policy influence, and national security. It raises concerns about the current oversight system's effectiveness and suggests improvements to measure the Intelligence Community's effectiveness more accurately. The text raises questions about the effectiveness of oversight reform measures in promoting an apolitical Intelligence Community, committee experience, workload capacity, and relations with the IC. It also questions the appropriateness of the JCAE model for a joint congressional intelligence committee and suggests hiring additional professional staff for select intelligence committees. Additionally, it considers the impact of parallel intelligence structures, term limits, and consolidation of authorizations and appropriations authority on congressional oversight."
