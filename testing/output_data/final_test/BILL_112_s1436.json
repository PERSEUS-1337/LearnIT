    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transportation and Regional Infrastructure Project Bonds Act of 2011\" or \"TRIP Bonds Act.\" References to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are applicable unless otherwise stated. The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that the national transportation network is vital for the economy, infrastructure construction requires various skills, and investing in transportation infrastructure is beneficial. Investing in transportation infrastructure creates long-term capital assets for the Nation, addressing infrastructure needs and improving economic productivity. It also creates jobs, stimulates economic activity, and has the potential to create up to 30,000 jobs for every billion dollars invested. Additionally, every dollar invested yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits due to reduced delays, improved safety, and lower vehicle operating costs. Maintaining and improving the Nation's critical transportation infrastructure is crucial as the estimated cost significantly exceeds current levels. The Act aims to provide financing for additional transportation infrastructure capital investments as the cost of critical transportation infrastructure significantly exceeds current government provisions. The Act aims to provide financing for transportation infrastructure investments. Section 3 introduces credit for holders of TRIP bonds under SEC. 54G. The TRIP bond is defined as a bond issued by a State infrastructure bank for qualified projects with proceeds used after the enactment of the section. Bond terms should not exceed 30 years and meet specific requirements. The State infrastructure bank certifies State contributions for qualified transportation projects, excluding operational costs. The applicable credit rate is determined based on market averages. The TRIP bond limitation amount for State infrastructure banks is determined based on market yields of long-term corporate debt obligations. Each bank's maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated under this section is subject to annual national limitation amounts ranging from $5,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000. The TRIP bond limitation amount for State infrastructure banks is allocated among states with each state receiving 2 percent. Any excess amount not used in a calendar year can be carried over to future years. Special rules apply to expenditures. Special rules apply to expenditures from State infrastructure banks, requiring at least 100% of project proceeds to be spent on qualified projects within a 5-year period, a commitment to spend 10% within 12 months, and due diligence to complete projects. The State infrastructure bank must redeem nonqualified bonds if less than 100% of project proceeds are spent within 5 years. If a TRIP bond ceases to comply, the bank must pay the US an amount determined by the Secretary. The State infrastructure bank must redeem nonqualified bonds if less than 100% of project proceeds are spent within 5 years. If a TRIP bond ceases to comply, the bank must pay the US an amount equal to the sum of credits allowable under section 54A and interest at the underpayment rate on the determined amount. Amounts from the sale of bonds issued under this section are held in a TRIP Bonds Trust Account. The TRIP Bonds Trust Account receives investment earnings from bond proceeds, appropriations from fees or a set amount, and can only be used for qualified project costs. The TRIP Bonds Trust Account can only be used to pay for qualified project costs and redeem TRIP bonds. Any remaining funds in the account after all bonds are redeemed can be used for project costs. Federal laws applicable to projects funded with federal funds also apply to projects funded through the TRIP Bonds Trust Account. The TRIP Bonds Trust Account funds can be used for qualified projects and investments in infrastructure. State contributions are required for certain projects funded through the account. State contributions of at least 20 percent are required for qualified projects funded through the TRIP Bonds Trust Account, and these contributions cannot include federal funds. Projects meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(7) must utilize updated construction technologies. A State infrastructure bank, as defined under section 610 of title 23, United States Code, can include joint ventures among multiple banks and is authorized to perform necessary functions for this section. To carry out the purposes of this section, direct grants can be made to qualified projects using TRIP bond proceeds. The transferability of credits or bonds allowed by this section is not limited. Funds from the Highway Trust Fund cannot be used to pay for credits under this section. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the use of funds for qualified projects. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the use of TRIP bonds for qualified projects. Subparagraphs are added and amended to specify the purposes of TRIP bonds.
