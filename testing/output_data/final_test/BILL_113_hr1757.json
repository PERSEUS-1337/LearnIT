    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vaccine Safety Study Act\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of securing the health of the Nation's children through the vaccine program, which has significantly reduced human suffering from infectious diseases. Childhood immunizations play a crucial role in protecting children, and the number of immunizations administered has increased in recent years. The incidence of chronic, unexplained diseases like autism and neurological disorders has increased in recent years. Little safety testing has been done for the interaction effects of multiple vaccines. The strategy of early childhood immunization against numerous infectious diseases has not been fully tested for safety or total health outcomes. Childhood immunizations are mandated by States for all citizens to participate in civic society. Public confidence in public health management relies on State government-mandated mass vaccination programs. No comparative studies have been conducted on the total health outcomes of vaccination programs, despite the rising concern over childhood neurodevelopmental disorders. There are populations in the United States that do not follow vaccination practices, providing a natural comparison group for such studies. A study will be conducted on health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated American populations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to compare health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in the United States, specifically looking at the incidence of autism and other conditions related to vaccines. The study will not promote remaining unvaccinated. The Secretary will ensure that investigators for the study are objective, qualified, not affiliated with public health agencies or involved in immunization policy, have no strong stance on thimerosal or vaccine safety, and are not funded by pharmaceutical companies or the CDC. The Secretary will include unvaccinated populations in the US for a study, such as the Old Order Amish and those who choose alternative medical practices. A request for proposals will be issued within 120 days of the Act's enactment, with approval or disapproval provided within the same timeframe. The Secretary will ensure data preservation for research purposes, including all data sets collected for the study under this section."
