President Truman transferred the administration of American Samoa from the Secretary of the Navy to the Secretary of the Interior in 1951. Congress authorizes additional jurisdiction for the High Court of American Samoa under the Act of February 20, 1929. The High Court of American Samoa has federal jurisdiction and administrative duties. The High Court of American Samoa has jurisdiction over criminal cases under US law in American Samoa.
