    "content": "The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is the largest source of federal financial assistance for postsecondary education. In FY2020, 15.9 million new loans totaling $100.2 billion will be made to students and parents. Additionally, $46.4 billion in Direct Consolidation Loans will be made. As of the second quarter of FY2019, $1.2 trillion in loans remained outstanding. The report provides an overview of federal student loans through the Direct Loan program, including borrower eligibility, loan amounts, interest rates, repayment procedures, relief options, discharge, and forgiveness benefits. The report serves as a resource for Members of Congress regarding federal student loan policy, covering repayment, relief options, discharge, forgiveness benefits, and borrower obligations. It includes methods to inform borrowers about loan terms and conditions, but is not meant for individual eligibility validation. Appendix A provides additional resources for more information on Direct Loans. The Direct Loan program, authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965, provides federal student loans using government funds. Loans made through this program are assets of the federal government and have borrowing limits, interest rates, and fees. The program was established in 1994 and offers various repayment, relief, and forgiveness options for borrowers. The Direct Loan program, administered by ED's Office of Federal Student Aid, allows the federal government to assume the risk for borrower defaults and covers loan discharges in cases of death or disability. It also covers loans that can be discharged under forgiveness programs. The program is classified as a direct loan program for federal budgeting purposes. When the Direct Loan program was established, it aimed to gradually replace the Federal Family Education Loan program, which provided guaranteed student loans through private lenders. The FFEL program originated from the Guaranteed Student Loan program in 1965, offering low-interest federal student loans to low- and middle-income families. Loan capital in the FFEL program was provided by private lenders, with the government guaranteeing lenders against losses from borrower default. The federal government guaranteed lenders against loss from borrower default, death, disability, and bankruptcy. State and nonprofit agencies managed the federal guarantee. The Direct Loan program aimed to streamline student loan delivery and save costs, replacing the FFEL program. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 repealed provisions for the Direct Loan program to succeed the FFEL program. Both programs operated from 1994 to 2010, allowing institutions to choose their preferred program. During the period from 1994 to 2010, institutions could choose to participate in either the FFEL or Direct Loan program for federal student loans. The terms and conditions of loans offered through both programs were similar for borrowers, with some differences in repayment plans and eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The FFEL program was terminated in 2010 by the SAFRA Act. The FFEL program was terminated in 2010 by the SAFRA Act, with $271.6 billion in outstanding loans borrowed by 12.8 million students. Congress has made changes to loan terms and conditions over the history of the Direct Loan program, and may consider future changes. Various types of loans are currently available through the Direct Loan program. The Direct Loan program offers two main types of loans: Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduate students with financial need, and Direct Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students regardless of financial need. Direct Subsidized Loans have an interest subsidy during specific periods, while Direct Unsubsidized Loans generally do not have an interest subsidy. Both types of loans have a fixed interest rate that remains constant for the duration of the loan. Direct Unsubsidized Loans have a fixed interest rate that remains constant. Loans for graduate and professional students have a higher interest rate than those for undergraduate students. Direct PLUS Loans are available to graduate, professional students, and parents of dependent undergraduate students. They do not consider financial need and have a fixed interest rate higher than Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. Direct Consolidation Loans allow individuals to refinance federal student loan debt. Direct Consolidation Loans allow individuals to refinance their federal student loan debt by borrowing a new loan with fixed interest rates. The loan amount and eligibility are determined by provisions in the Higher Education Act. The Direct Loan program, governed by the Higher Education Act, offers various loan types without considering the borrower's ability to repay, except for Direct PLUS Loans which require creditworthiness. Eligibility for borrowing and loan amounts are determined by specific factors and procedures outlined by the program. Eligibility requirements must be met by student or parent borrowers, with general criteria applying to those seeking Direct Subsidized Loans. Eligibility criteria for different types of Direct Loans vary based on factors such as dependency status, program level, financial need, cost of attendance, and estimated financial assistance. Specific requirements apply to applicants for Direct PLUS Loans and Direct Consolidation Loans. To borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, the student must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program at a participating IHE, maintain satisfactory academic progress, not be in default on a federal student loan, and meet citizenship and Selective Service registration requirements. Dependency status determines federal student aid eligibility. Dependency status is crucial for federal student aid eligibility. It determines if a student is dependent on parental support or independent. Factors like age, marital status, military service, veteran status, legal dependents, and past circumstances can make a student independent. Dependency status is crucial for federal student aid eligibility. It determines if a student is dependent on parental support or independent. An independent student is one who meets specific criteria such as being an emancipated minor, homeless, or self-supporting. This status affects the types and amounts of loans available for borrowing. Dependency status is crucial for federal student aid eligibility, determining if a student is dependent or independent. Independent undergraduates have higher borrowing limits than dependent students. Dependency status also affects whose income and assets are considered in need analysis calculations. The dependency status determines federal student aid eligibility, impacting borrowing limits and need analysis calculations. Dependent students' aid is based on both student and parent income/assets, while independent students' aid considers student (and spouse if applicable) income/assets. Academic level affects loan options, with undergraduates eligible for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, and parents of dependent undergraduates able to borrow Direct PLUS Loans. Graduate/professional students can borrow Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS Loans. To borrow as a graduate or professional student, one must be enrolled in a program above the baccalaureate level, have completed at least three years of full-time study, and not be receiving Title IV aid as an undergraduate student. Graduate students have higher borrowing limits than undergraduates based on their class level. Progression to a higher grade level for undergraduates does not always mean a new academic year. A student can borrow a Direct Loan through the program more than once as a first-year student if they do not progress to the next grade level due to insufficient credits. Direct Subsidized Loans are need-based and require a need test to determine financial need. Once a student accrues enough credits to progress to the next grade level, they become eligible for higher borrowing limits. The student's eligibility for financial aid is determined based on available resources. The student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and estimated financial assistance are subtracted from the cost of attendance to determine need-based aid. Additional procedures are followed to determine federal student aid package composition, including eligibility for Federal Pell Grant and Direct Subsidized Loan. Since July 1, 2012, only undergraduate students have been eligible to borrow Direct Subsidized Loans. A student's borrowing amount is limited to their unmet financial need after receiving other forms of need-based federal student aid. Additionally, first-time borrowers are restricted to borrowing for a period not exceeding 150% of the published length of their academic program, known as the Direct Subsidized Loan maximum eligibility period. The Direct Subsidized Loan maximum eligibility period for undergraduates is limited to three years for a two-year associate degree program and six years for a four-year bachelor's degree program. Subsidized usage periods measure progress towards this limit by dividing the loan period by the academic year, adjusted for enrollment intensity. The Direct Subsidized Loan maximum eligibility period for undergraduates is limited to three years for a two-year associate degree program and six years for a four-year bachelor's degree program. Borrowers may lose interest subsidy if they exceed this period and remain enrolled in the same or a shorter program. Additional eligibility criteria apply to Direct PLUS loans. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of undergraduate dependent students who meet specific eligibility criteria. Eligible parents include biological, adoptive, and stepparents. Legal guardians cannot borrow on behalf of a student. Parent borrowers must meet citizenship, residency requirements, not be in default on federal loans, owe no refunds on Title IV loans, and not be incarcerated. The student must have completed a FAFSA for the parent to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan. To borrow a Direct PLUS Loan, a parent must have completed a FAFSA. Noncustodial parents can borrow regardless of their financial information on the student's FAFSA. Eligibility depends on creditworthiness, with no adverse credit history allowed. Creditworthiness criteria apply to both parent and graduate/professional student borrowers. Adverse credit history includes debts over $2,085 that are 90 days or more overdue. An applicant for a Direct PLUS Loan must not have an adverse credit history, which includes debts over $2,085 that are 90 days or more delinquent, placed in collection, charged off, or have had default determinations, bankruptcy discharge, foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage garnishment, or debt write-off under HEA, Title IV within the specified time frames. If an adverse credit history is determined, the applicant must either obtain an endorser or demonstrate extenuating circumstances, such as making satisfactory repayment arrangements on derogatory debts. To obtain a Direct PLUS Loan, an applicant with an adverse credit history must complete credit counseling. A dependent undergraduate student may borrow a Direct Unsubsidized Loan if parents are unable to get a PLUS Loan due to credit history. To qualify for a Direct Consolidation Loan, a borrower must have an outstanding balance on a loan from the Direct Loan or FFEL program. To qualify for a Direct Consolidation Loan, the applicant must have a loan from the Direct Loan or FFEL program in grace period, repayment status, or have made satisfactory repayment arrangements for defaulted loans. Defaulted borrowers must have made three consecutive full monthly payments or be on an Income-Driven Repayment plan. Loans can generally only be consolidated once, but exceptions may apply. Borrowers with court judgments or wage garnishments are ineligible. A Direct Consolidation Loan may be used to repay a previously obtained Direct Consolidation Loan or a FFEL Consolidation Loan. Borrowers can add loans made within 180 days before or after obtaining a Direct Consolidation Loan to that loan. Borrowers with existing Direct Consolidation Loans can consolidate other eligible loans to obtain a new Direct Consolidation Loan. Borrowers with FFEL Consolidation Loans in default can consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan for repayment under an IDR plan. Borrowers with existing FFEL Consolidation Loans can also consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Borrowers with an existing FFEL Consolidation Loan can consolidate it into a Direct Consolidation Loan for loan forgiveness through the PSLF Program or to receive benefits exclusive to Direct Loan borrowers. The Direct Consolidation Loan must include at least one eligible loan from either program and may include other federal student loans. Eligible loans include Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and PLUS Loans, as well as FFEL Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Federal student loans outside of Direct Loan and FFEL programs include various types such as Federal Perkins Loans, Guaranteed Student Loans, and Health Education Assistance Loans. Borrowing limits are determined by annual and aggregate limits, need analysis, and borrower characteristics. Loan limits vary by type, program level, and class level. Loans have annual limits for undergraduate students based on class level and dependency status. Graduate and professional students have annual limits for Direct Unsubsidized Loans, with exceptions for certain health professions programs. There is no specified limit for Direct PLUS Loans for parents. There is no specified limit to the amount that may be borrowed in Direct PLUS Loans by either parent borrowers or by graduate and professional students. The annual loan limits apply to the maximum principal amount that may be borrowed in an academic year, with borrowing limits prorated for students enrolled for less than one year. Aggregate loan limits cap the total cumulative amount of outstanding loans. Aggregate loan limits cap the total cumulative amount of outstanding loans that a student may borrow through certain loan types. One limit applies to Direct Subsidized Loans, another to Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. No limits on Direct PLUS Loan borrowing. Limits apply only to the outstanding principal balance of loans, not accrued interest. Annual and aggregate limits for Direct Loans since July 1, 2012, are shown in Table 1. Additional historical limits are in Appendix C. The process of awarding federal student aid to a student is known as packaging. Financial aid administrators have discretion in determining how aid is packaged, which can impact loan amounts. The Cost of Attendance (COA) is an institution-determined amount representing a student's educational expenses. The Cost of Attendance (COA) includes tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and personal expenses. It serves as the maximum aid limit for a student in the Direct Loan program. The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is the amount a student and their family are expected to contribute towards education expenses. The EFC is calculated based on various factors like income, assets, family size, and enrollment status. Estimated Financial Assistance (EFA) is also considered in the financial aid packaging process. Financial Assistance (EFA) is the aid available to students from various sources for enrollment. It includes grants, scholarships, loans, and employment assistance. Two relevant variations are EFA not received under HEA, Title IV programs, and EFA from all sources. Financial Need is determined by subtracting EFC and EFA not received under HEA from the Cost of Attendance. Unmet Financial Need is the difference between EFC and EFA from the Cost of Attendance. When packaging Title IV aid, need-based aid awarded to a student cannot exceed their financial need. Need-based aid like Pell Grants and FSEOG are awarded first, followed by loans. Direct Subsidized Loans are need-based, while Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS Loans can fill unmet financial need. Non-need-based aid like Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS Loans can replace a student's EFC once their financial need is met. When packaging Title IV aid, the total amount awarded must not exceed the student's Cost of Attendance (COA) minus Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Direct Subsidized Loans are need-based and can cover unmet financial need up to a certain limit. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are non-need-based and can fill gaps after meeting financial need. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available regardless of the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC), with borrowing limits based on the Cost of Attendance (COA) and other loans received. Direct PLUS Loans are also non-need-based, allowing graduate/professional students and parents of dependent undergraduates to borrow, with limits based on the EFC. The Direct PLUS Loan amount is determined by subtracting the student's Expected Family Contribution from the Cost of Attendance. Parents can borrow the total amount or divide it among multiple parents. Interest is charged on loans, calculated based on specified formulas in the Higher Education Act. Interest accrual on student loans is calculated using a daily formula specified in the Higher Education Act. The federal government offers interest subsidies to limit accrued interest. Borrowers may defer interest payments, which can be capitalized if not paid. Direct Loan program interest rates are set by statute and have been fixed since 1994. Since 1994, interest rates on student loans made through the Direct Loan program have been fixed. These rates are indexed to 10-year U.S. Treasury notes for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. Direct Consolidation Loans have fixed rates based on the weighted average of included loans' interest rates since 1999. Previous procedures for setting interest rates on Direct Loans differ from the current method. The Direct Loan program sets interest rates on loans through various methods: variable rates tied to short-term U.S. Treasury securities, fixed rates based on loan averages or statutory specifications, and fixed rates linked to long-term Treasury securities. Outstanding loans have rates determined by these categories. Appendix C provides a detailed history of interest rate setting procedures. At the inception of the Direct Loan program in 1994, all loan types had variable interest rates adjusted annually on July 1 based on the bond equivalent rate of 91-day U.S. Treasury bills. An interest rate add-on increased the rate. An interest rate add-on increases the rate above the index rate for different types of Direct Loans. Variable rate Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have an interest rate cap of 8.25%, while Direct PLUS Loans have a cap of 9.0%. Direct Consolidation Loans had variable rates until January 31, 1999, and have been fixed since then. Since February 1, 1999, Direct Consolidation Loans have fixed interest rates determined by the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. The maximum interest rate was capped at 8.25% until June 30, 2013, with no cap after July 1, 2013. Direct Consolidation Loans made on or after July 1, 2013 have market-indexed fixed interest rates, while loans made through the Direct Loan program before that date had fixed rates determined by Congress. The interest rate for loans made before July 1, 2013 remains the same throughout the loan term, while for loans made after that date, the interest rate is set according to a specified formula. The interest rates for Direct Consolidation Loans made after July 1, 2013 are market-indexed and remain fixed for the loan duration. New loans have an interest rate indexed to the bond equivalent rate of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, with different add-ons and caps depending on the type of loan and borrower. In AY2019-2020, interest rates for Direct PLUS Loans are capped at 10.5%. Interest accrual in the Direct Loan program uses a simple daily interest formula, where interest accumulates only on the outstanding principal balance. Accrued interest may be capitalized in certain situations, adding to the loan balance. In the Direct Loan program, interest accrues on the outstanding principal balance using a daily interest formula. The accrued interest is calculated based on the number of days since the last payment, the loan amount, and the interest rate factor. Interest begins accruing once the first loan installment is disbursed and continues throughout the loan period, unless subsidized. The federal government subsidizes interest on loans through the Direct Loan program, relieving borrowers from paying accrued interest. Factors affecting the availability of an interest subsidy include loan type, eligibility for deferment, repayment plan, and military status. Interest subsidies are provided on Direct Subsidized Loans and during certain periods. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 amended the Higher Education Act to limit interest subsidies on Direct Subsidized Loans disbursed between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014. Borrowers must be enrolled at least half-time during grace periods and deferment to qualify for the subsidy. Borrowers subject to the Direct Subsidized Loan Limitations for Post-July 1, 2013, First-Time Borrowers can only receive the subsidy for up to 150% of the program length. If enrolled beyond this period, borrowers lose the subsidy and must pay accruing interest. The Secretary offers a 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction for automatic debit repayment on Direct Subsidized Loans. This incentive helps borrowers make timely loan payments, but does not apply during certain periods like in-school, grace, deferment, or forbearance. Interest subsidies are provided on loans repaid through specific repayment plans like IBR, PAYE, and REPAYE. The IDR plans, including IBR, PAYE, and REPAYE, offer interest subsidies on Direct Subsidized Loans and subsidized components of Direct Consolidation Loans for up to three years. REPAYE also provides a partial interest subsidy on all eligible loan types. Monthly payments may not cover all accrued interest in certain situations. The Secretary does not charge the borrower for accrued interest in excess of the monthly payment amount for up to three years on Direct Subsidized Loans or subsidized components of Direct Consolidation Loans under IDR plans. Borrowers are limited to a cumulative three-year interest subsidy when switching repayment plans. Economic hardship deferment periods with interest subsidies are excluded. The REPAYE plan includes a 50% subsidy on accrued interest for all loans, with no time limit. If a borrower's monthly payment is insufficient to cover all interest, the Secretary charges only 50% of the remaining accrued interest. For Direct Loans disbursed on or after October 1, 2008, no interest accrues during up to 60 months of active duty in the Armed Forces or qualifying National Guard duty in hostilities. The SCRA caps interest at 6% for loans taken out before military service, with the government forgiving interest above this rate. Borrowers under the SCRA must forgive interest above the 6% rate and loan servicers must regularly check with the DMDC to determine eligibility for the 6% interest rate cap. Borrowers can submit an SCRA Interest Rate Limitation Request to document their eligibility. If a borrower repays loans with a Direct Consolidation Loan, the 6% interest rate is used for determining the weighted average interest rate. The 6% interest rate is fixed and remains in effect beyond the borrower's military service. A Cancer Treatment Deferment is available for borrowers receiving cancer treatment and for six months after. No interest accrues on qualifying loans during this deferment. The deferment is applicable to Direct Loan program loans made on or after September 28, 2018. During deferment periods, borrowers do not need to make payments on their Direct Loan program loans. Interest continues to accrue on the loans, and negative amortization may occur when the interest accrued exceeds the payments made. During deferment periods, borrowers do not need to make payments on their Direct Loan program loans. Negative amortization may occur when the accumulation of unpaid accrued interest leads to the outstanding balance of the loan increasing over time. Interest capitalization can also increase the total amount a borrower is required to repay. During repayment, any unpaid interest on a borrower's loans is capitalized, including during loan consolidation, in income-contingent repayment plans, and when exiting partial financial hardship. Unpaid interest on a borrower's loan is capitalized when exiting from IBR, PAYE, or REPAYE repayment plans, at the end of deferment or forbearance, and in case of default. Unpaid interest on a borrower's loan is capitalized at the time of default, with a cap on the amount for borrowers on certain repayment plans. Loan origination fees are charged for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. Loan origination fees are charged to borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. The fees help offset federal loan subsidy costs by passing some costs to borrowers. The fees are calculated as a proportion of the loan principal borrowed and deducted from each loan disbursement. The fee amount is specified in statute, with a 1% fee for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans made after July 1, 2010, and a 4% fee for Direct PLUS Loans since the inception of the program. During budget sequestration periods, loan origination fees for Direct Loan program loans are increased by a uniform percentage. Borrowers must make payments during a repayment period that starts upon full loan disbursement. Loan origination fee history is detailed in Table C-5 in Appendix C. Borrowers have various repayment plan options for Direct Loans, with the chosen plan affecting the repayment period. Prepayment of loans is allowed without penalties. A grace period of six months follows the borrower's completion of an eligible program. During a grace period, a borrower in the Armed Forces can pause loan repayment for up to three years if called to active duty for more than 30 days. The grace period is separate from the repayment period, allowing borrowers to consolidate loans and enter repayment after completing school. The repayment period for Direct Loans begins after the grace period ends, with the first payment due within 60 days. Repayment periods vary for different types of loans, excluding periods of deferment and forbearance. Borrowers can choose from various repayment plans for their Direct Loans, including standard, extended, graduated, income-driven, and alternative plans. The specific options available depend on the borrower's loan types and repayment status. Periods of deferment or forbearance may be considered part of the repayment period, with the next payment due within 60 days after the deferment or forbearance ends. Borrowers with loans from the Direct Loan program must repay all loans together under the same plan. If some loans are eligible for income-driven repayment (IDR) and others are not, borrowers can split repayment accordingly. Failure to choose a plan results in placement in the standard plan. Borrowers can switch between eligible plans but cannot choose a plan with a shorter repayment period than their current one. Under IDR plans, repayment period starts from specific criteria satisfaction. Negative amortization allowed in IDR plans and some alternative plans. Variable interest rate loans may have adjusted payment amounts or repayment period length under certain plans. The repayment period for various loan repayment plans can be adjusted to account for changes in the variable interest rate. Standard repayment plans offer predictable payments over a set period, with a maximum repayment period of 10 years. Borrowers make fixed monthly payments of at least $50 under this plan. Borrowers of Direct Consolidation Loans made on or after July 1, 2006, can choose a standard repayment plan lasting between 10 and 30 years. Monthly payments must be at least $50, based on the combined loan balances. Repayment periods are determined by the total loan balances, with a maximum of 10 years for small balances. The extended repayment plans allow borrowers with large loan balances to make lower monthly payments by extending the repayment duration, resulting in more interest paid compared to a standard 10-year repayment plan. Eligibility for extended repayment plans is based on when loans entered repayment and the total outstanding balance. The Extended Fixed Repayment Plan allows borrowers with more than $30,000 in Direct Loans to make equal monthly payments over 25 years, resulting in lower payments than a standard 10-year plan. The Extended Graduated Repayment Plan offers a similar option for new borrowers after October 7, 1998, with loans entering repayment after July 1, 2006. The Extended Graduated Repayment Plan under the Direct Loan program allows borrowers to make initially low monthly payments that increase every two years over a 25-year repayment period. Monthly payments start at $50 and can increase up to three times the initial amount. This plan is available to borrowers who entered repayment before July 1, 2006, with repayment terms ranging from 12 to 30 years based on the outstanding loan balance. The Extended Graduated Repayment Plan allows borrowers to make low monthly payments that increase every two years over a 25-year repayment period. Monthly payments may be less than $50 but not less than the accrued interest. There are three graduated repayment plans available. Borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans that entered repayment after July 1, 2006, may choose a graduated repayment plan with a maximum 10-year repayment period. Monthly payments increase every two years from an initial amount, potentially less than $50, to a maximum of three times the initial amount. Borrowers of Direct Consolidation Loans made on or after July 1, 2006, can opt for a graduated repayment plan with a 10 to 30-year repayment period, following a similar payment increase structure. The Graduated Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans allows borrowers to increase their monthly payments incrementally every two years, with a repayment period ranging from 12 to 30 years. The combined balance of other education loans cannot exceed the balance of the Consolidation Loan for determining the repayment period. The Graduated Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans allows borrowers to increase their monthly payments incrementally every two years, with a repayment period ranging from 12 to 30 years. The repayment term is based on the total outstanding principal balance of the borrower's loans made through the Direct Loan program, with payment amounts varying according to the borrower's income. An Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan and other repayment plans collectively known as income-driven repayment (IDR) plans are available to borrowers. These include the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan. Borrowers can make monthly payments based on a specified share of their discretionary income over a set repayment period. The discretionary income is the portion of a borrower's adjusted gross income that exceeds a specified multiple of the federal poverty guidelines for the borrower's family size. This income is used to determine payments in Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, such as Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE). The multiples of the federal poverty guidelines for different family sizes are shown in Table 7. The IDR plans are distinguished by the multiple of the federal poverty guidelines used to define discretionary income, the percentage of discretionary income assessed for loan payments, and the maximum repayment term. Common characteristics include income and family size certification, updating income/family size, and potential negative amortization. The IDR plans offer potential loan forgiveness if a borrower is unable to fully repay their student loan debt by the end of the maximum repayment term. Payments made on defaulted loans under IDR plans do not count towards loan forgiveness eligibility. Each IDR plan is described in detail below. The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan allows borrowers to make payments based on their income and family size. Any remaining loan balance after 25 years of repayment will be forgiven. The plan is available to borrowers of Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students, and Direct Consolidation Loans. Parent borrowers of Direct PLUS Loans can qualify by consolidating into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Under the ICR plan, borrowers can consolidate loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and make monthly payments based on factors like loan balance, interest rates, income, and family size. Married borrowers may use joint or separate AGI for calculations. Monthly payments are determined by a 12-year amortization schedule. Monthly payments under the ICR plan are calculated based on a 12-year amortization schedule and the borrower's income percentage factor. Payments can range from $0 to an amount enough to repay loans in 12 years. For borrowers with payments between $0 and $5, a minimum payment of $5 is required. Payments are recalculated annually to reflect changes in income and accrued interest. Married borrowers can choose to use joint or separate AGI for calculations. Joint ICR Plan Repayment allows married borrowers in the Direct Loan program to repay their loans jointly by filing a joint federal tax return. The combined monthly payment is based on the total outstanding loan balances of each borrower. Payments are applied proportionally to each borrower's loans. No special interest subsidies are provided under this plan. Under the ICR plan, monthly payments may be less than accrued interest, leading to interest capitalization into the principal balance. Unpaid accrued interest can only be capitalized until the outstanding principal balance reaches 110% of the original balance. Failure to certify income and family size can affect eligibility for the ICR plan. To remain eligible for the ICR plan, borrowers must annually certify their income and family size to ED. If income certification is not provided, monthly payments will be recalculated based on the Standard Repayment Plan. Failure to certify family size will assume a family size of one. The ICR plan has a maximum repayment period of 25 years. The ICR plan allows for a maximum repayment period of 25 years. After 25 years of repayment, any remaining unpaid balance will be forgiven. This forgiveness includes periods of making monthly payments according to the ICR plan or other eligible repayment plans. The borrower made monthly payments according to various repayment plans, including IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, and Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term. This also includes payments on Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and PLUS Loans, as well as Direct Consolidation Loans. The borrower made payments on a Direct Consolidation Loan according to various repayment plans, including IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, and Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term. The Income-Based Repayment plans allow borrowers to repay student loans based on their income, family size, and monthly payment amount. Any remaining loan balance after the maximum repayment period will be forgiven. There are two versions of the IBR plan differentiated by the date used to delimit borrower. The Income-Based Repayment plans have two versions based on borrower eligibility criteria such as income percentage, repayment period, and eligibility date. The Original IBR plan was established in 2008 and became available in 2009, while amendments in 2010 introduced a revised version. The IBR plan has two versions: the Original IBR plan established in 2008 and a revised version for new borrowers after July 1, 2014. Eligible loans for repayment under the Original IBR plan include federal student loans from both the Direct Loan and FFEL programs, while only Direct Loan program loans are eligible for the revised IBR plan. Exceptions apply to loans made to parent borrowers. Loans made to parent borrowers are ineligible for repayment under IBR plans. Borrowers must have a partial financial hardship to qualify for an IBR plan, based on factors like income, family size, and monthly payment amounts. Based on the borrower's total annual payments for eligible loans, determined by discretionary income and marital status, a partial financial hardship is required to qualify for an IBR plan. The borrower's eligibility for an IBR plan is based on the applicable percentage of discretionary income, which is the portion exceeding 150% of the poverty guideline for the borrower's family size. If total annual payments do not exceed 15% or 10% of discretionary income, the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship. Monthly payments under an IBR plan can range from $0 to a maximum based on the specified percentage of discretionary income. In the IBR plan, the borrower's eligibility is based on a percentage of discretionary income exceeding 150% of the poverty guideline. For example, a borrower with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 would have a partial financial hardship if annual student loan payments exceed $3,189.75 in the Original IBR plan or $2,126.50 in the post-July 1, 2014, IBR plan for New Borrowers. Monthly payments can range from $0 to a maximum based on the specified percentage of discretionary income. Monthly payments under the IBR plan are determined based on a borrower's calculated amount, with a minimum of $0 for payments less than $5 and $10 for payments between $5 and $10. Payments are recalculated annually. If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship or wants to change payment based on income, they can stay in the IBR plan but the maximum required monthly payment will be based on a standard 10-year repayment period. The IBR plan allows for joint repayment by married borrowers with eligible loans and a joint federal tax return. Individual payments are based on each spouse's loan balances and AGI. An interest subsidy is available on subsidized loans for the first three years of repayment under IBR if the monthly payment doesn't cover all accrued interest. Under the IBR plan, the Secretary subsidizes accrued interest not covered by the borrower's monthly payment. Interest subsidies received under the PAYE or REPAYE plans count towards a three-year period, excluding subsidies during economic hardship deferment. Payments are applied to interest, fees, and then principal. If the monthly payment is less than accruing interest, it is first applied to interest. If a borrower remains in the IBR plan and has a partial financial hardship, unpaid accrued interest on subsidized loans will accumulate but not be capitalized. Any excess principal due will be postponed until the borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship or leaves the IBR plan. Upon leaving the IBR plan, any unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized. If a borrower chooses to leave an IBR plan, they must switch to a Standard Repayment Plan with a 10 to 30-year term. The monthly payment amount will be calculated based on the remaining time in the repayment period and the outstanding balance. At least one monthly payment must be made according to the new plan. Borrowers must make at least one monthly payment on the Standard Repayment Plan before switching to another eligible plan. They need to provide annual income and family size certification to qualify for IBR plans. Failure to certify income will result in capitalized interest and recalculated monthly payments. The maximum repayment period for the IBR plan is 25 years for the Original IBR plan and 20 years for post-July 1, 2014, New Borrowers. If a borrower obtains additional loans eligible for IBR repayment, a new repayment period will begin for those loans. A borrower who has participated in an IBR plan can have any remaining balance forgiven after meeting specific conditions during the repayment period. This includes making reduced monthly payments, transitioning to the Standard Repayment Plan, or making payments on specific types of loans. The Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan allows borrowers to make monthly payments based on their AGI, similar to the IBR plan for post-July 1, 2014, New Borrowers. Borrowers can also transition to the Standard Repayment Plan, make payments on specific types of loans, or receive an economic hardship deferment for loan forgiveness. The PAYE repayment plan, established by the Obama Administration, limits monthly payments based on a borrower's AGI, family size, and monthly payment amount. Any remaining loan balance after 20 years of repayment will be forgiven. The plan became available on December 21, 2012, offering benefits similar to the IBR Plan for post-July 1, 2014, New Borrowers. The PAYE repayment plan, established by the Obama Administration, limits monthly payments based on a borrower's AGI, family size, and monthly payment amount. Eligible borrowers may use the plan to repay loans made through the Direct Loan program, with exceptions for certain types of loans. A borrower is considered to have a partial financial hardship if their annual payments on eligible loans exceed 10% of their AGI above 150% of the poverty line for their family size. A borrower is determined to have a partial financial hardship if their annual payments on eligible loans exceed 10% of their discretionary income. Repayment under the PAYE plan can range from $0 to a maximum based on income levels. The PAYE repayment plan calculates monthly payments based on the borrower's AGI exceeding 150% of the poverty line. If the borrower no longer has a financial hardship or wants to change payment based on income, the amount will be recalculated. The maximum monthly payment cannot exceed the Standard Repayment Plan amount with a 10-year term. If the calculated payment is between $5 and $10, it is set at $10, and if less than $5, it is $0. Monthly payments are recalculated annually. The PAYE repayment plan allows for joint repayment by married borrowers with eligible loans, where individual payments are based on each spouse's share of loan balances and AGI. An interest subsidy is available on subsidized loans for the first three years of repayment if the monthly payment is insufficient to cover accrued interest. The PAYE repayment plan offers an interest subsidy on subsidized loans for up to three years if the monthly payment does not cover accrued interest. Payments are applied to interest first, then fees, and finally to principal. Unpaid accrued interest will accumulate but not be capitalized as long as the borrower remains in the plan and has a partial financial hardship. If a borrower no longer has a partial financial hardship in the PAYE repayment plan, accrued interest is capitalized into the principal balance, limited to 10% of the outstanding balance. Any interest beyond the limit remains due but not capitalized while in the plan. Borrowers can switch to another eligible repayment plan if they leave PAYE. If a borrower no longer qualifies for the PAYE repayment plan due to financial hardship, any unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized. To remain eligible for the plan, borrowers must annually certify their income and family size. Failure to provide certification will result in capitalized interest and possible changes to monthly payments. In the PAYE repayment plan, any unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized, and the monthly payment amount will be recalculated based on the Standard Repayment Plan with a Maximum 10-Year Term. The maximum repayment period is 20 years, and borrowers may be eligible for loan forgiveness if they meet specific criteria within the 20-year repayment period. The Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan allows borrowers to repay eligible loans through the Direct Loan program based on AGI and family size. The maximum repayment period is 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for loans including graduate education amounts. The REPAYE repayment plan, available since December 17, 2015, offers loan forgiveness after 25 years. It is similar to other IDR plans but includes an enhanced interest subsidy. Eligible borrowers must have loans through the Direct Loan program, excluding certain types of loans. The REPAYE repayment plan, available since December 17, 2015, offers loan forgiveness after 25 years. Borrowers can repay regardless of when they became a borrower, and eligibility is not based on financial hardship. Monthly payments range from $0 to a maximum of 10% of income exceeding 150% of the poverty line. The REPAYE repayment plan offers loan forgiveness after 25 years with monthly payments recalculated annually based on income. For married borrowers, the AGI of both spouses is used unless certain exceptions apply. Under the REPAYE repayment plan, married borrowers can jointly repay loans based on individual shares of loan balances and AGI. An interest subsidy is available for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans during negative amortization periods. During economic hardship deferment, borrowers receive an interest subsidy. Subsidized loans have a three-year period where 50% of accrued interest not covered by monthly payments is subsidized. Graduate students with Direct PLUS Loans may qualify for the 50% interest subsidy while in school instead of an in-school deferment. Repayment for Direct PLUS Loans begins when fully disbursed, with an in-school deferment available for half-time enrollment. During in-school deferment, student borrowers accrue interest but do not make payments. They can cancel the deferment and opt for a 50% interest subsidy if their income is low enough to result in insufficient monthly payments to cover all accrued interest. Payments under the REPAYE repayment plan are credited accordingly. Payments made by borrowers under the REPAYE repayment plan are first applied to interest, then fees, and finally to principal. If the monthly payment is less than the accruing interest, the unpaid interest will accumulate without being capitalized. If the payment covers the interest but not the principal, the excess principal payment will be postponed. Borrowers can switch to another eligible repayment plan if they choose to leave REPAYE. Upon choosing to switch from the REPAYE repayment plan, borrowers must certify their income and family size annually. Failure to provide certification will result in accrued interest being capitalized and placement in the REPAYE Alternative plan. Unpaid accrued interest will be capitalized and borrower placed in REPAYE Alternative Repayment plan if income certification is not provided. Monthly payments under this plan are calculated to repay loans within 10 years or maximum repayment period. Payments count as qualifying payments for loan forgiveness under IDR plans. In the REPAYE repayment plan, the maximum repayment period is 20 years for undergraduate loans and 25 years for loans that include graduate education. Borrowers can have remaining balances forgiven if they meet eligibility criteria after 20 or 25 years. If a borrower returns to the REPAYE repayment plan after repaying under another plan, they must provide income documentation for that period. If they paid less under the other plan, their monthly payments will be adjusted upward to make up the difference before the new repayment period begins for any additional loans. Alternative repayment plans are available for borrowers who demonstrate exceptional circumstances. Loan servicers have discretion in determining what qualifies as exceptional circumstances. Borrowers can choose from four variations of alternative repayment plans, including Alternative Fixed Payment Repayment and Alternative Fixed Term Repayment. The alternative repayment plans available include Alternative Fixed Payment Repayment, Alternative Fixed Term Repayment, Alternative Graduated Payment Repayment, and Alternative Negative Amortization Repayment. Borrowers may be provided up to 30 years to repay, with a minimum monthly payment of $5 and payments cannot vary by more than three times the smallest payment. The Alternative Negative Amortization Repayment plan allows for one year of making payments less than the accruing interest, with any unpaid interest capitalized. Unpaid interest may be capitalized, but not exceeding 110% of the original principal amount. Additional interest from capitalization must be paid by the borrower. Payments under alternative repayment plans do not count towards loan forgiveness eligibility. Borrowers can prepay Direct Loans without penalty and should contact their servicer for instructions on prepayment. Regulations specify procedures for applying prepayments to loan accounts. When prepaying a Direct Loan, borrowers must specify which loan to apply the prepayment to if they have multiple loans. Otherwise, the prepayment will be applied according to HEA regulations. Prepayments are typically applied to charges, accrued interest, and outstanding principal in that order if the amount is less than the next scheduled monthly payment. When prepaying a Direct Loan, borrowers must specify which loan to apply the prepayment to if they have multiple loans. Otherwise, the prepayment will be applied according to HEA regulations. If the prepayment amount is less than the next scheduled monthly payment and the borrower is on IBR, PAYE, or REPAYE plans with a $0.00 monthly payment, the prepayment is applied to accrued interest, collection costs, late charges, and then outstanding principal. For example, a borrower with a $200 monthly payment who makes a $300 prepayment would have $100 applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance. When prepaying a Direct Loan, borrowers must specify which loan to apply the prepayment to if they have multiple loans. If the prepayment amount is equal to or greater than the next scheduled monthly payment, it is applied towards the next payments due, advancing the due date accordingly. For example, a borrower making a $600 payment on a $200 monthly payment would result in a $400 prepayment applied to the next two payments due. When a borrower prepayments a Direct Loan, they can choose to apply it towards reducing the outstanding balance or advance the due date for the next payment. Delinquent loans occur when payments are not made on time, but can be restored to current status by paying past due amounts. Payments on delinquent loans are credited to the oldest past due amounts first. The borrower's scheduled monthly payment of $225 is due on the 14th of the month. If the borrower only paid $200 for January, the loan would become delinquent. However, if $250 is paid in February, $25 would be applied to the past due amount for January and $225 to the February payment. Deferment and forbearance offer temporary relief from monthly payments, with interest subsidies available only during deferment. IDR plans may include up to three years of repayment exclusion for deferment or forbearance periods. During deferment, borrowers on IDR plans can have up to three years of repayment exclusion. Deferment is a temporary suspension of monthly payments with interest subsidies available. Various deferment options are available for borrowers, such as pursuing education, unemployment, military service, or receiving cancer treatment. Borrowers must apply for deferment and it is not available for defaulted loans. During deferment, borrowers must proactively apply and meet eligibility criteria. Some deferment types have no maximum period, while others are initially granted for a limited time and can be renewed. Eligibility is specific to the borrower, not the loans. Interest accrues unless an interest subsidy applies. During deferment, borrowers have the option to pay accruing interest or defer it. If interest is not paid, it may be capitalized at the end of the deferment period. However, if a borrower has a partial financial hardship during deferment, accrued interest may not be capitalized. Various deferment options are available for Direct Loan program borrowers, including in-school deferment. Graduate student borrowers of Direct PLUS Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2008, are eligible for an in-school deferment while enrolled at least half-time. During this deferment, an interest subsidy is provided on certain types of loans. There is no maximum period for this deferment, and eligible borrowers are typically placed in it automatically. Borrowers can also request an in-school deferment if needed. Borrowers of Direct PLUS Loans can request an in-school deferment or cancel it if automatically placed in one. Parent borrowers are eligible for a deferment if the student qualifies for an in-school deferment or during the grace period after the student stops being enrolled. Borrowers can also receive a deferment while pursuing a graduate fellowship program. During a graduate fellowship program deferment, borrowers with a bachelor's degree can receive financial support for at least six months. They must submit a statement of objectives and progress reports. Interest subsidy is provided on certain loans. Borrowers can also defer while in a rehabilitation training program for individuals with disabilities. During a rehabilitation training program deferment, borrowers must commit to a written plan for at least three months to be eligible for deferment. Interest subsidy is provided on certain loans during this period. Borrowers seeking full-time employment can also apply for an unemployment deferment if they are not employed or are employed less than full-time. During an unemployment deferment, borrowers can receive a deferment for up to three years, including multiple episodes of unemployment. They are not required to have been employed previously to qualify. The deferment can start up to six months before the request date and can be extended in six-month increments. Interest subsidy is provided on certain loans during this period. A borrower may qualify for a deferment during economic hardship or Peace Corps service. To qualify, the borrower must meet criteria such as receiving public assistance, working full-time with income below 150% of the poverty line. During an economic hardship deferment, borrowers can receive an interest subsidy on certain loans. Military service deferment is available for active duty or National Guard duty during a war or national emergency, lasting the entire service period plus an additional 180 days. During military service deferment, an interest subsidy is provided on certain loans for borrowers serving in the military. A post-active duty student deferment is available for National Guard or reserve members called to active duty, lasting up to 13 months following completion of service. During a post-active duty student deferment, an interest subsidy is provided on Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Consolidation Loans. A borrower may also receive a cancer treatment deferment on eligible loans while undergoing cancer treatment and for six months after, with certification from a physician. During cancer treatment deferment, no interest accrues on qualifying loans including Direct Subsidized, Unsubsidized, PLUS, and Consolidation Loans made on or after September 28, 2018. Loans not in repayment status on that date due to school enrollment or grace period are not eligible. Borrowers with ineligible loans may consolidate to qualify. Forbearance allows temporary cessation of student loan payments. Forbearance allows borrowers to temporarily pause or reduce student loan payments, with the option to pay accrued interest during the forbearance period or have it added to the principal balance. Borrowers must apply for forbearance, provide documentation for certain types, and can be granted for up to 12 months initially, with some types limited to 36 months. Interest subsidies are not provided during forbearance, and borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest. Forbearance can be granted for various reasons, including general, administrative, and mandatory forbearance. General forbearance may be requested for temporary hardships like financial difficulties or medical expenses, with a maximum initial period of 12 months. Loan servicers have discretion in granting forbearance and may limit the duration. Administrative forbearance can be granted for up to 60 days for processing requests related to deferment, forbearance, repayment plan changes, and loan consolidation. It is also provided during periods to determine eligibility for student loan discharge or forgiveness programs. It can last up to three years for certain changes. Administrative forbearance can be granted for up to three years if changes to variable interest rates affect the borrower's ability to repay loans in 10 years. It can also be authorized during periods of deferment, forbearance, or in response to national emergencies. Mandatory forbearance is available for medical or dental interns/residents who no longer qualify for deferment. Mandatory forbearance can be granted for postgraduate training or national service positions, with the possibility of extensions. Borrowers may receive assistance with interest payments if they have earned a Segal AmeriCorps Education Award. A borrower serving in a qualifying position for Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program may receive mandatory forbearance if they are a full-time teacher at a school serving low-income families. The forbearance is granted based on expected forgiveness amount and can be extended for up to five years of teaching service. A borrower may receive mandatory forbearance if their federal student loan debt burden equals or exceeds 20% of their monthly income. This forbearance can be granted for up to 36 months and is available to National Guard members engaged in active state duty service. Mandatory forbearance is available for National Guard members engaged in active state duty service for 30 or more consecutive days. It can be granted for up to 12 months initially and extended in 12-month increments. This forbearance is also available for borrowers qualifying for partial repayment under a Department of Defense student loan program. Interest accrued during forbearance is not capitalized. Federal student loan borrowers through the Direct Loan program may have their loans discharged or forgiven in certain circumstances. Loan discharge and forgiveness benefits are available for borrowers in various circumstances. These benefits fall into three categories: discharge for borrower hardship, forgiveness after IDR plan repayment, and forgiveness for public service. Borrowers may have their loans discharged in cases of hardship or death. Administrative forbearance is granted during the eligibility determination process. In cases of borrower hardship or death, loans may be discharged. A borrower's liability to repay a loan is discharged upon being determined to have a total and permanent disability. This determination can be based on a physician's certification of the borrower's inability to engage in substantial gainful activity. The borrower's loan liability may be discharged if they are unable to work due to a physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or lasting at least 60 months. Documentation from SSA or VA is required for disability determination. A borrower may qualify for a Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) discharge if they are totally disabled based on an individual unemployability rating. The Department of Education (ED) contacts borrowers who might qualify for a TPD discharge and informs them of their potential eligibility. Borrowers can apply for a TPD discharge by submitting an application with required documentation. Veterans with a VA service-connected disability or unemployability determination will be granted a TPD discharge without needing to apply, unless they opt out within 60 days. If approved, the borrower will be considered totally and permanently disabled as of the date of the physician's certification or the date ED received an SSA notice of award for SSDI. Upon determination of total and permanent disability, borrower's obligation to make loan payments will be discharged. Payments made after specified dates will be returned. Discharge based on physician's certification or SSA disability determination is conditional for three years. Borrower may have loans reinstated if annual earnings exceed 100% of federal poverty guideline for a family of two during this period. After determination of total and permanent disability, borrower's obligation to make loan payments will be discharged. Discharge may be conditional for three years if borrower's earnings exceed 100% of federal poverty guideline for a family of two, obtains a new loan, fails to return disbursements, or receives notice from SSA. Permanent discharge granted for VA service connected disability or unemployability. The Direct PLUS Loan is discharged if the parent borrower does not complete the program due to school closure. Borrowers before July 1, 2020, must apply and certify school closure within 120 days of withdrawal. Discharge is possible for schools closed after November 1, 2013, if the borrower qualifies. For loans made on or after July 1, 2020, borrowers must apply for a closed school discharge and certify that the school closed while they were enrolled or within 180 days of withdrawal. They must also confirm they did not complete the program through a teach-out agreement or transfer credits to another school, and did not accept the opportunity to complete a similar program elsewhere. Upon being granted a closed school discharge, a borrower is reimbursed for any amounts repaid on the loan, eligibility for additional federal student aid is restored, adverse credit history related to the loan is deleted, discharged loans do not count against loan limits, and liability to repay the loan is discharged. If a borrower's eligibility for a loan was falsely certified by the school or if the loan was disbursed without authorization, the borrower can have their liability discharged. They will be reimbursed for any amounts already repaid and their eligibility for additional federal student aid will be restored. Additionally, consumer reporting agencies will be instructed to delete any adverse credit history related to the loan. The borrower's liability for a loan can be discharged if falsely certified by the school or disbursed without authorization. Reimbursement for amounts repaid, restoration of federal student aid eligibility, and deletion of adverse credit history by consumer reporting agencies will be provided. Refunds for unpaid amounts owed by the borrower will also be discharged under certain circumstances. A borrower may assert a defense to repayment for loans based on school actions or omissions. There are specific procedures for different loan periods. For loans disbursed before July 1, 2017, the defense refers to school acts that could lead to legal action. For loans disbursed after July 1, 2017, and before July 1, 2020, it refers to nondefault, contested situations. For loans disbursed before July 1, 2017, a borrower defense to repayment involves school actions that may result in legal action. For loans disbursed between July 1, 2017, and July 1, 2020, the defense includes nondefault, contested judgments, breaches of contract, or substantial misrepresentations by the school that the borrower relied on to their detriment. Loans disbursed after July 1, 2020, require a defense within three years of leaving the institution, based on a misrepresentation about enrollment or educational services causing financial harm to the borrower. If a borrower previously defaulted on a loan, a defense to repayment discharge will restore eligibility for additional federal student aid and instruct consumer reporting agencies to delete adverse credit history. Student loans are generally not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless undue hardship is proven. Repayment of Direct Loan program debt in bankruptcy requires a separate lawsuit and proof of undue hardship. The Direct Loan program offers discharge of liability in bankruptcy, ceasing borrower payments. Repayment under Income-Driven Repayment plans for a specified period relieves borrowers of remaining principal and interest balance. Maximum repayment periods vary by plan: Income-Contingent Repayment Plan: 25 years; Original IBR Plan: 25 years; IBR Plan for Post-July 1, 2014, New Borrowers: 20 years; PAYE Repayment Plan: 20 years; REPAYE Repayment Plan for undergraduate debt: 20 years; REPAYE Repayment Plan for any debt. The Direct Loan program offers loan forgiveness benefits for borrowers who engage in public service for a specified period. For example, teachers in low-income schools may qualify for up to $5,000 or $17,500 in loan forgiveness. Teacher Loan Forgiveness benefits are available to special education teachers or secondary school teachers of mathematics or science who had no outstanding balance on federal student loans through the Direct Loan program after October 1, 1998. Forgiveness applies to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans. Loans must be obtained before the end of the fifth year of qualifying service and not be in default. Borrowers may receive Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program Forbearance during the five years of teaching service required for benefits. Upon completion of the fifth year of qualifying service, borrowers become eligible for loan forgiveness benefits. The forgiveness benefits are applied to Direct Unsubsidized Loans first, then to Direct Subsidized Loans, followed by the unsubsidized component of Direct Consolidation Loans, and finally the subsidized component of Direct Consolidation Loans. Loan forgiveness benefits cannot be provided for the same service used to qualify for benefits under other programs. Borrowers may be relieved of the obligation to repay the remaining balance of principal and interest on eligible loans after making 120 qualifying monthly payments. To qualify for loan forgiveness, borrowers must make 120 on-time monthly payments on eligible loans while employed full-time by a public service organization or serving in AmeriCorps or Peace Corps. Qualifying payments can be made under certain repayment plans, such as Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) or Income-Based Repayment (IBR). Lump sum payments are allowed for certain benefits. Borrowers must make 120 on-time monthly payments while employed full-time by a public service organization to qualify for loan forgiveness. Payment plans such as PAYE, REPAYE, and Standard Repayment with a 10-year term are eligible. Public service organizations include government agencies, tribal colleges, and certain nonprofit entities. Eligible private nonprofit entities providing public services include emergency management, military service, public safety, law enforcement, early childhood education, services for individuals with disabilities and the elderly, public health, education, and library services. Loan forgiveness benefits cannot be received for the same service used to qualify for other forgiveness programs. The TEPSLF program was created to help borrowers who had trouble meeting the requirements for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. Borrowers may be eligible for loan forgiveness if some of their monthly payments did not qualify, as long as they meet certain criteria. Nonqualifying payments must have been made under specific repayment plans. The TEPSLF program offers loan forgiveness to borrowers who did not qualify for PSLF due to missed payments. To be eligible, borrowers must meet specific criteria, including making monthly payments that exceed what would have been calculated under an IDR plan. Funding is limited, and applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. The IRC states that student loan debt may be included in gross income for federal income taxation, but in certain cases, discharged or forgiven student loan debt may be excluded. If not excluded, the individual may be responsible for paying income tax on the benefits received. Discharged student loan debt due to death may be excluded from gross income. Student loan debt can be discharged due to death, total and permanent disability, closed school attendance, false certification, or unauthorized payments between December 31, 2017, and January 1, 2026. Student loan debt can be discharged for various reasons such as false certification, unpaid refund, bankruptcy, insolvency, and public service loan forgiveness. The federal government provides student loans to assist individuals in attending qualified educational institutions. Loan forgiveness programs like Teacher Loan Forgiveness, PSLF, and TEPSLF may exclude student loan debt. Defaulting on a federal student loan can lead to adverse consequences, including the acceleration of the repayment obligation. Defaulting on a federal student loan can have serious consequences, including the acceleration of repayment and loss of borrower benefits. The borrower may face adverse effects on their future economic well-being and may be reported to consumer agencies. Various options exist to bring defaulted loans back into good standing, such as loan rehabilitation, consolidation, or paying off the balance. Upon defaulting on a federal student loan through the Direct Loan program, the borrower faces consequences such as ineligibility for Federal Student Aid, capitalization of interest, acceleration of the full loan balance, and transfer to private collection agencies. To regain eligibility for aid, the borrower can make six consecutive, on-time, full monthly payments voluntarily. The borrower's defaulted federal student loan may be transferred to private collection agencies by the Office of Federal Student Aid's Default Management and Collection System. The agencies may offer options for loan rehabilitation or voluntary repayment. If no agreement is reached, the agencies may pursue collection through wage garnishment, Treasury Offset Program, or litigation, with collection charges imposed on the borrower. Defaulted federal student loan borrowers may face various collection methods, including Administrative Wage Garnishment, Federal Salary Offset, and Treasury Offset Program. These methods allow for up to 15% of disposable pay to be garnished or offset to repay the loan. Borrowers have rights to notice, examination of debt records, hearings, and repayment schedule establishment before garnishment begins. Defaulted federal student loan borrowers may have their tax refunds, Social Security benefits, and other federal benefits offset through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) to repay their loans. Up to 100% of tax refunds can be offset, with Social Security benefits offset up to 15% of the borrower's monthly benefit amount or the amount exceeding $750. Special rules apply for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits, with offsets suspended for recipients with a disability rating of medical improvement not expected (MINE). Litigation may be used as a last resort to collect on defaulted loans, with the U.S. Department of Justice suing on behalf of the Office of Federal Student Aid to compel repayment. Options are available to borrowers to get out of default on federal student loans, including rehabilitating the loan, obtaining a Direct Consolidation Loan, paying the amount owed in full, or entering into a compromise agreement. Repaying the loan in full may be difficult for many borrowers, but outside financing options may be available. Information on student loans is shared with consumer reporting agencies, and upon default, this information will also be reported for seven years. Litigation may be used as a last resort to compel repayment. Options to get out of default on federal student loans include obtaining financing from outside the Direct Loan program, entering into a compromise agreement, or pursuing loan rehabilitation or consolidation. Loan rehabilitation allows borrowers to reinstate their loans by making nine affordable monthly payments within 10 months. To rehabilitate a defaulted loan, borrowers must make reasonable and affordable monthly payments within 20 days of the due date. The payment amount can be determined based on a formula involving the borrower's income and expenses, with documentation required. Upon loan rehabilitation, borrowers must make nine reasonable and affordable payments voluntarily. Involuntary payments may still be collected. Once rehabilitated, borrowers regain full privileges and are transferred to a nondefault loan servicer. They can choose from alternative repayment plans for 90 days before being placed in a standard repayment plan if no other plan is selected. A defaulted loan may be rehabilitated only once, and loans with court judgments cannot be rehabilitated. Borrowers can use a new Direct Consolidation Loan to pay off defaulted loans by making satisfactory repayment arrangements, including three consecutive on-time payments. Late or missed payment records leading to default will not be removed from credit history. Borrowers can use a new Direct Consolidation Loan to pay off defaulted loans by making satisfactory repayment arrangements within 20 days. Repayment can be done through various available plans, including IDR plans for eligible borrowers. Restrictions apply, such as lifting AWG for loan eligibility. If a borrower's loan is subject to AWG, it must be lifted for consolidation eligibility. Court judgment secured loans cannot be consolidated. Defaulted Direct Consolidation Loans require including another eligible loan. FFEL Consolidation Loans can be included without other loans but must follow IDR plans. Collection fees are added to the new Direct Consolidation Loan when repaying a defaulted loan. Repayment restores full borrower eligibility. Repaying a defaulted loan with a Direct Consolidation Loan restores full borrower privileges, but the default record remains on the credit history. Understanding the terms and conditions of federal student loans is crucial for borrowers, as the process can be complex and unfamiliar. Borrowers must comprehend their rights and responsibilities before obtaining a federal student loan. As part of obtaining a federal student loan, borrowers undergo financial counseling for loan information and obligations. First-time borrowers receive entrance counseling for loan details. Borrowers with adverse credit but eligible for Direct PLUS Loans get PLUS Loan credit counseling. Signing a promissory note establishes the legal obligation to repay, accompanied by a rights and responsibilities statement. Exit counseling is provided before a borrower stops being enrolled at least half-time. Entrance counseling is required for first-time borrowers of federal student loans to provide comprehensive information on loan terms, rights, and responsibilities. It can be done in person, through written documents, or online, with an expert available for questions. Entrance counseling for first-time borrowers of federal student loans covers loan terms, borrower's responsibilities, consequences of default, repayment obligations, sample monthly payment amounts, impact on eligibility for other student aid. The entrance counseling for first-time borrowers of federal student loans covers loan terms, borrower's responsibilities, consequences of default, repayment obligations, impact on eligibility for other student aid, interest accrual, capitalization, half-time enrollment, withdrawal procedures, access to NSLDS, contact information for questions, and Direct Subsidized Loan Limitations for Post-July 1, 2013, First-Time Borrowers provision. The Direct Subsidized Loan Limitations for Post-July 1, 2013, First-Time Borrowers provision for Direct Subsidized Loans and its implications; differences between Direct PLUS Loan, Direct Subsidized Loan, and Direct Unsubsidized Loan in terms of interest rates, interest accrual, and repayment start. Special PLUS Loan credit counseling for parent or graduate/professional student borrowers with adverse credit, including entrance counseling information. The terms and conditions of federal student loans made through the Direct Loan program are specified in a promissory note, which establishes the borrower's obligation to repay the loan. A master promissory note (MPN) is used for making Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans. The MPN must be read and signed before loan funds are disbursed, and the borrower may choose between a single-year or multiyear feature. IHEs using a multiyear MPN can make loans for up to 10 academic years, requiring borrower confirmation annually. Affirmative or passive confirmation is accepted, with a Plain Language Disclosure form explaining loan terms provided before each disbursement. Exit counseling is provided to borrowers before each loan disbursement through the Direct Loan program, regardless of the type of MPN used. It must be given before a student borrower stops being enrolled at least half-time and can be done in person, through audiovisual presentations, or online. The counseling aims to inform borrowers about loan terms, rights, and responsibilities, with an expert available to answer questions. Exit counseling for student loan borrowers must inform them about repayment options, including average monthly payments, different repayment plans, prepayment options, loan consolidation, and how to contact their loan servicer.
