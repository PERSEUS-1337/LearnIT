H.R. 1, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, would impact the funding for the program. On August 18, 2009, the Department of Commerce published final rules for the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities (CTAA) grant program. The regulations outline EDA's responsibilities in administering the program, determining community eligibility, providing technical assistance, and evaluating grant applications. On January 11, 2010, EDA solicited applications for CTAA grants with a deadline of April 20, 2010. On September 20, 2010, $36.768 million in CTAA grants were awarded. The CTAA grant program, established under the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities Act of 2009, awarded $36.768 million to 36 recipients on September 20, 2010. This program was part of the larger effort to address the economic recession that began in December 2007. The CTAA program, established under the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities Act of 2009, includes four subchapters within the Department of Commerce. The program aims to provide assistance to communities impacted by trade, with the Economic Development Administration responsible for administering the grants.

A grandfather provision allows communities meeting certain certifications between 2007 and 2009 to apply for CTAA designation. The deadline for submitting a petition for CTAA designation was February 1, 2010, with specific requirements outlined in the regulations. Upon determination of eligibility for CTAA assistance, EDA notifies the state governor and officials of trade-impacted communities about available funds and technical assistance. EDA provides comprehensive technical assistance to help communities develop strategic plans for economic diversification and strengthening. The strategic plan must address trade-related obstacles to economic development, economic adjustment, and worker dislocation. EDA coordinates federal assistance to trade-impacted communities. The EDA coordinates federal assistance to trade-impacted communities by establishing the Interagency Community Assistance Working Group (ICAWG) to provide access to other federal programs. Communities must have an EDA-approved strategic plan to receive CTAA implementation grant funds, involving public and private sector entities, educational institutions, and government entities. Labor organizations are also encouraged to participate in the process. The EDA coordinates federal assistance to trade-impacted communities through the Interagency Community Assistance Working Group (ICAWG). Communities need an EDA-approved strategic plan to receive CTAA implementation grant funds, involving various stakeholders. Program regulations outline elements for evaluating a community's strategic plan, with priority given to small and medium-sized communities. Implementation grants awarded by EDA may not exceed $5 million and must not cover more than 95% of project costs. EDA is required to submit an annual report to Congress. The EDA administers grants to trade-impacted communities, requiring an approved strategic plan for funding. Grants support infrastructure improvements, market research, technical assistance, public services, training, and other activities. Applications must include the strategic plan and project description. Additional evaluation criteria may apply as per the Federal Funding Opportunity announcement. The EDA administers grants to trade-impacted communities, requiring an approved strategic plan for funding. Grants support infrastructure improvements, market research, technical assistance, public services, training, and other activities. Applicants seeking assistance under Subchapter B or Subchapter C must discuss how projects funded with implementation grants will utilize federal grant assistance. The act authorized $337.5 million for implementation and strategic planning grants for FY2009 and FY2010. Congress appropriated $40 million for FY2009, split between CTAA activities and Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms. The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget requests a decrease of $15.8 million in previously appropriated CTAA funds due to high administrative costs and less effective program results compared to other EDA programs. EDA plans to use other programs to fund investments that maximize opportunities for regions to engage in global markets and increase export potential of regional firms. The EDA published a notice for CTAA planning and implementation grants totaling $36.768 million to support small and medium-sized communities and severely trade-impacted areas. Six weighted criteria will be used to evaluate grant applications. The EDA published a notice for CTAA planning and implementation grants totaling $36.768 million to support small and medium-sized communities and severely trade-impacted areas. Grant applications will be evaluated based on six weighted criteria, including job creation, leveraging of funds, regionalism, innovation, global trade support, and promotion of the green economy. The deadline for applications is April 20, 2010. EDA allocated $36.768 million among its six regional offices based on TAA for Workers and TAA Firms program. Funds were limited for strategic planning activities and grant awards. Grants ranged from $75,000 to $3.5 million. Between August 3, 2010, and September 20, 2010, the Department of Commerce (DOC) awarded $36.768 million in CTAA grant funds to 36 entities. $23 million was allocated for infrastructure improvements in industrial and business parks, with the second most funding going towards incubators and innovation centers.

The Department of Labor (DOL) is directed to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education for educational or career training programs for Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAAW) eligible individuals. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers (TAAW) Act limits grant funds for eligible institutions to $1 million. Accredited public and private IHEs in the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico offering short-term education programs can apply for funds individually or in consortia. Applicants can seek technical assistance from DOL. Each CCCT grant application must describe how the grant will be used to develop or improve an educational program for TAAW-eligible individuals in the community served. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for grant proposals related to educational or career training programs for TAAW-eligible individuals in the community. It includes factors such as alignment with the community's strategic plan, previous experience of the institution, compliance with outreach activities, and the impact of the proposed project on addressing job skill gaps. The grant proposal criteria for educational or career training programs for TAAW-eligible individuals include alignment with the community's strategic plan, compliance with outreach activities to IHEs and community partnerships, and employer commitment to hiring program participants. Funds are awarded based on the proposal's merits in developing, offering, or improving educational or career training programs. The grant proposal criteria for educational or career training programs for TAAW-eligible individuals include alignment with the community's strategic plan, compliance with outreach activities to IHEs and community partnerships, and employer commitment to hiring program participants. Priority is given to applicants serving communities eligible for CTAA within the last five years. Grant funds are limited to $1 million per institution, with exceptions for mandatory appropriations from FY2011 through FY2014. Each state must allocate at least 0.5% of total mandatory appropriations to IHEs and consortia annually during this period. The TGAAA authorizes $90 million in grant assistance for FY2009 to FY2010. P.L. 111-152 provides $500 million in funding for FY2011 to FY2014. DOL may postpone awarding FY2011 funds to FY2012 if program administration funding is available. DOL may delay awarding FY2011 funds to FY2012 if program administration funding is available. Annual reports to Senate and House committees are required for each grant awarded under TAAW. The grant application deadline was April 21, 2011, with 36-month awards planned. Funds can be used for various expenses related to program implementation. Applicants for grant funds must ensure project sustainability, with restrictions on fund usage for tuition, wages, construction, or property purchase. Two types of eligible applicants can receive awards exceeding set amounts for replication of effective strategies or development of online courses for diverse students. The Department of Labor (DOL) requires applicants for grant funds to demonstrate evidence-based program strategies and use data for project improvement. The emphasis is on project and program evaluation, with specific outcome measures such as credit attainment, certificate completion, and graduation rates.

Approved activities must be completed within three years and proposals must identify the focus industry, member organizations, goals, projects, organizational capacity, and project completion timeline. Partnership Grants can fund skill assessments, training, and employment gap identification. Funds can be used to link skilled workers with firms, assist firms in finding qualified job applicants, and train new or retrain existing workers. Additionally, funds can improve productivity, information dissemination, and outreach activities. The Department of Labor (DOL) is tasked with providing technical assistance to sector partnership entities for developing and administering sector partnership grants. DOL may award technical assistance grants to national or state organizations and develop performance measures for sector partnerships. The TGAAA authorizes $90 million in grant assistance for FY2009-FY2010. Grantees are prohibited from using grants for matching fund requirements. The TGAAA authorizes $90 million in grant assistance for FY2009-FY2010, with grantees prohibited from using grants to meet matching fund requirements. Congress did not appropriate funds for the program in FY2009 or FY2010, and the Obama Administration did not request funding for FY2011. Additionally, a worker receiving TAAW will not be disqualified from assistance under any trade adjustment assistance provisions. Congress allocated less than the authorized $150 million for the CTAA program in FY2009, with a $40 million appropriation in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010 included $15.8 million for CTAA and Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms programs, with no specific allocation between the two. The $55.8 million appropriation will only fund a modest number of CTAA grant awards, with funds designated for strategic planning and trade adjustment assistance for firms. EDA's implementation of the CTAA program may have been delayed due to vacant politically appointed positions, leading to delays in important agency decisions. The agency's decisions were delayed due to leadership vacancies. John R. Fernandez was confirmed as the new Assistant Secretary for Economic Development. The appointment of a Director of Adjustment Assistance within EDA was also delayed, impacting the creation of the Interagency Community Assistance Working Group (ICAWG). EDA published regulations for trade adjustment assistance, but the Department of Labor has not yet published regulations for community colleges and sector partnership grants, potentially delaying program implementation. Congress did not immediately provide initial appropriations for Subchapter B (CCCT) and Subchapter C (ISPG) grants for FY2009 or FY2010. $500 million was appropriated for CCCT grants for FY2011 through FY2014 in 2010. Funding for ISPG activities has not been appropriated yet. The ICAWG's main role is to provide access to other federal programs for CTAA designated communities undertaking grant activities. The CTAA program encourages coordination with other economic development programs to identify possible grant assistance from other federal agencies. The law requires coordination between EDA and ETA for grant assistance. Educational institutions seeking CCCT grants must align with a community's strategic plan for CTAA assistance. The CCCT grant proposal must align with a community's strategic plan for CTAA assistance. The statute requires entities seeking sector partnership grants to discuss coordination with CTAA, CCCT, and other grant funds. Congress may need to define terms more precisely, such as what constitutes a small or medium size community. The EDA addressed the issue of defining small and medium-sized communities in a Federal Register notice for CTAA grants. Critics argue that the CTAA program may duplicate activities of other federal programs like EDA's EAA program, which provides grant assistance to economically distressed communities. The CTAA grant program aims to fund activities identified in the CEDS to address economic dislocation caused by unfair trade competition. Local officials believe in the effectiveness of dislocated worker training programs linked to local business needs. Trade-impacted communities must involve various partners in developing strategic plans. The CTAA grant program funds activities to address economic dislocation from trade competition. Partners like education institutions, labor organizations, and firms help develop and execute strategic plans. The program supports identifying and fixing deficiencies in education and career training for TAA workers, and promotes public-private partnerships for skills training through grants. Recipients must link their grants to the community's strategic plan developed with CTAA funding."
