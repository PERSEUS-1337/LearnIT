    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Choctaw Code Talkers Recognition Act\". Congress finds that during World War I, members of the Choctaw Nation, who were not recognized as US citizens at the time, enlisted in the Armed Forces to fight for their native land. They were part of the American Expeditionary Force and engaged in hostile actions in France starting in the fall of 1917. During World War I, members of the Choctaw Nation served in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th Division, facing challenges due to German code deciphering. An American commander utilized their native language skills for covert communication. During World War I, American commander recruited 18 Choctaw Indians for covert communication using their native language, which the Germans couldn't decipher. The Choctaw soldiers were strategically placed for effective field telephone communications, aiding in the movement and protection of American soldiers in October 1918. During World War I, Choctaw Indians were recruited for covert communication in their native language, which successfully protected gun emplacements and aided in the assault on German positions in 1918. The Choctaw code was never broken, marking the first use of a Native American language for confusing the enemy in modern warfare. The Choctaw Nation honored 18 Choctaw Code Talkers with a memorial at their tribal complex in Durant, Oklahoma, showcasing their commitment to defending the nation. The President is authorized to present a gold medal to each Choctaw Code Talker or their surviving family member in recognition of their unique communications operation during World War I. The medals will be designed and struck by the Secretary of the Treasury. Additionally, duplicate medals may be issued. The Secretary is authorized to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal under regulations to cover costs. The medals are considered national medals, and funding for them will come from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund."
