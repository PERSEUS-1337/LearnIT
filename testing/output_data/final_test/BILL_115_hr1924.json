    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community-Based Gang Intervention Act\" and includes findings and a sense of Congress. The Congress finds that the United States has a high incarceration rate, with over 2.2 million people in prison and 5 million on probation or parole. The country has 25% of the world's prisoners despite having only 5% of the world's population. Federal spending on police protection and corrections has significantly increased since 1982. This growing prison system is also straining State budgets. State spending on incarceration has increased significantly, reaching $53 billion in 2012 from $10 billion in 1987. This rise in prison costs has led to cuts in vital social programs like education, job creation, housing, and healthcare. Between 1987 and 2007, corrections spending increased by 127%, far surpassing the 21% increase in higher education spending. In California, general fund expenditures for higher education have decreased by 9% while corrections and rehabilitation expenditures have risen by 26%. California has the second largest prison population in the country with 165,062 prisoners. In 2010, there were 165,062 prisoners in the Nation under State or Federal correctional authorities. Los Angeles has seen a significant increase in gangs and gang members since the start of the \"war on gangs.\" The city and county are known as the \"gang capital\" with hundreds of gangs and thousands of members. Allowing one youth to turn to crime and drug abuse costs society millions. In California, the average annual cost per inmate is $47,421 for adults and $218,000 for juveniles. In 1998, States spent nearly $4.2 billion on juvenile justice programs, with 67% going towards residential placements and only 8.4% towards delinquency prevention. Addressing root causes of gang violence and funding community-based programs decreases gang and youth violence. Community-based gang intervention provides cost-effective results for at-risk youth and families. In developing a violence reduction strategy, the United States should address social conditions like poverty, homelessness, inadequate education, and limited economic opportunities that contribute to gang violence, focusing on opportunities for at-risk youth and families.

The community-based gang intervention agencies are tasked with developing a response plan, preventing rumors from escalating tensions between gangs, establishing relationships with stakeholders, serving as intervention representatives in communities, and developing conflict resolution skills to address gang-related concerns. To address community concerns related to gang activity and improve neighborhood quality of life, support services for youth and families affected by gang violence are provided. This includes advocating for assistance, grief counseling, and referrals for treatment and rehabilitation for various types of harm.

DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'community' in this context refers to a local government or an Indian Tribe. A 'community-based gang intervention agency' is an organization that aims to reduce gang-related violence and has experience working with youth involved in gangs.

The term 'evidence-based' in gang activity prevention refers to practices with statistically significant outcomes, including reduced gang-related violence and increased youth participation in job development, recreation, arts, or faith-based activities.
