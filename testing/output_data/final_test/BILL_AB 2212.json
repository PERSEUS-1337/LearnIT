    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 48900 of the Education Code is amended to specify acts that can lead to a student's suspension or expulsion, including causing physical harm to others, using force or violence, and possessing dangerous objects without permission. The Education Code specifies acts that can lead to a student's suspension or expulsion, including possession or use of controlled substances, alcohol, or intoxicants, offering to sell substances as controlled substances, robbery, extortion, property damage, and theft. The Education Code outlines behaviors that can result in a student's suspension or expulsion, such as stealing school or private property, using tobacco products, engaging in obscene acts or profanity, possessing drug paraphernalia, and willfully defying school authority. In kindergarten to grade 3, students cannot be suspended for certain acts, including receiving stolen property or possessing an imitation firearm. This rule does not apply to expulsion recommendations. The definition of an imitation firearm is provided. The student may be expelled if they have committed sexual assault, harassed a witness, or sold the prescription drug Soma unlawfully. The student may face expulsion for engaging in hazing, bullying, or unlawfully selling the prescription drug Soma. The definition of \"bullying\" includes severe or pervasive acts directed towards pupils that can cause fear, harm, detrimental effects on physical or mental health, interference with academic performance, or hindrance in participating in school activities. The definition of \"electronic act\" includes creating or transmitting messages, images, or posts on social media websites using electronic devices like phones or computers, both on and off school grounds. Creating a credible impersonation or false profile of a pupil for the purpose of bullying is prohibited. An electronic act will not be considered pervasive solely because it is transmitted or posted on the Internet. A pupil shall not be suspended or expelled for acts unless they are related to school activities or attendance within school premises. This includes incidents on school grounds, while traveling to or from school, during lunch on or off campus, and during school-sponsored activities. A pupil who aids or abets in causing physical injury during a school-sponsored activity may face suspension but not expulsion. \"School property\" includes electronic files and databases. The Education Code allows for alternatives to suspension or expulsion for students who misbehave, with the intention of addressing specific behaviors. Suspension or expulsion should only be considered if a student has committed certain acts, such as causing physical harm to others. The Education Code outlines specific behaviors that may lead to suspension or expulsion, including causing physical harm to others, possessing dangerous objects without permission, and using controlled substances or alcohol. (d) Unlawfully offered, arranged, or negotiated to sell a controlled substance, alcoholic beverage, or intoxicant, and misrepresented another substance as such.\n(e) Committed or attempted robbery or extortion.\n(f) Caused or attempted damage to school or private property.\n(g) Stole or attempted to steal school or private property.\n(h) Possessed or used tobacco or nicotine products, excluding prescription products. (i) Committed obscene acts, engaged in habitual profanity or vulgarity.\n(j) Unlawfully possessed or offered drug paraphernalia.\n(k) Disrupted school activities or defied authority of school personnel. The curr_chunk describes various prohibited actions by students, including receiving stolen property, possessing an imitation firearm, committing sexual assault or battery, harassing or intimidating witnesses, and unlawfully selling the prescription drug Soma. Students are prohibited from engaging in hazing, bullying, or unlawfully selling the prescription drug Soma. The definition of \"bullying\" includes severe or pervasive physical or verbal acts directed towards one or more pupils, causing fear, harm, detrimental effects on physical or mental health, interference with academic performance, or hindering participation in school services or activities. The definition of \"electronic act\" includes creating or transmitting messages, images, or posts on social media websites using electronic devices like phones or computers, both on and off school grounds. Creating a credible impersonation or false profile of a pupil for the purpose of bullying, as well as engaging in cyber sexual bullying, are considered acts of cyberbullying. Cyber sexual bullying involves disseminating or soliciting sexually explicit photos of a minor through electronic means, with harmful effects. It excludes images with literary, artistic, educational, or other value. An electronic act transmitted or posted on the Internet does not constitute pervasive conduct. A \"reasonable pupil\" is defined as a student who exercises average care, skill, and judgment for their age. A pupil may be suspended or expelled for acts related to school activities or attendance, including those on school grounds, while going to or coming from school, during lunch, or at school-sponsored activities. A pupil who aids or abets in causing physical injury during a school-sponsored activity may face suspension. \"School property\" includes electronic files and databases. The superintendent or principal may offer alternatives to suspension or expulsion for disciplined students, focusing on correcting specific misbehavior. The Legislature intends for these alternatives to be used for truant or tardy students."
