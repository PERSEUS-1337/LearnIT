    "title": "SB 936",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 63089.1 of the Government Code is amended to outline the responsibilities of the program manager under the guidance of the executive director. This includes administering the chapter, entering into contracts with corporations for services, allowing the use of branch offices for program accessibility, requiring annual plans of operation from corporations, and managing the distribution and investment of funds. The program manager is responsible for overseeing programs, acting as a liaison between various entities, and attending meetings to carry out duties effectively. They also have the authority to invest funds and participate in corporation meetings as a nonvoting representative. The program manager oversees programs, acts as a liaison, and invests funds. They assist corporations in applying for funding opportunities and obtaining program support. The California Small Business Expansion Fund is continued in the State Treasury for various purposes like paying loan guarantee losses and funding debt instruments. The expansion fund and trust fund are created to receive government and private funds for loans and financial products. The program manager must notify relevant committees when nonstate funds are deposited in the expansion fund. The program manager can create separate accounts in the expansion fund and trust fund for corporations participating in authorized programs. Holding accounts may also be created for temporary or permanent fund transfers. The guarantee liability in the expansion fund shall not exceed 10 times the funds on deposit plus receivables. Section 63089.5 is repealed, and Section 63089.60 is amended to allow the program manager to recommend leveraging the funds. The guarantee liability in the expansion fund must be backed by a reserve of at least 10 percent, as determined by the program manager. The expansion fund and trust fund accounts are used for guaranteeing obligations, paying administrative costs, and other purposes outlined in the chapter. Section 63089.61 is repealed, and Section 63089.62 is amended to allow for leveraging of funds. The Legislature intends for corporations to maximize their use of statutory authority to guarantee loans and surety bonds with a minimum loan loss reserve of 10 percent, unless a higher leverage ratio is authorized. This is to ensure small businesses' financing needs are met within the limits of corporations' trust fund account balance. Any corporation in a declared state of emergency or disaster area must increase loan guarantees for loans under $100,000 to at least 15% of total guarantees within one year. The executive director may waive this requirement if the corporation shows a good faith effort to comply but couldn't find willing lenders in the region. Section 63089.62 of the Government Code, added in 2013, is repealed."
