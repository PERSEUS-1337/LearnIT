    "content": "The \"Voting Equipment Modernization Act of 2001\" designates income tax payments to the Election Administration Improvement Fund. Individuals with adjusted income tax liability of $1 or more can designate $1 to be paid to the Election Administration Improvement Fund. For joint filers with a liability of $2 or more, each spouse can also designate $1 to the fund. Adjusted income tax liability is the individual's income tax liability minus any designated amounts under section 6096(a). Individuals can designate $1 to be paid to the Election Administration Improvement Fund if their adjusted income tax liability is $1 or more. Joint filers with a liability of $2 or more can also designate $1 each. The designation can be made at the time of filing the tax return or at a later time specified by the Secretary. Designations must be made as per regulations, either on the first page of the return or on the page with the taxpayer's signature. Designations under this section can be made for taxable years between 2002 and 2003. A new section is added for the Election Administration Improvement Fund in the tax code. The Election Administration Improvement Fund is established in the tax code for taxable years between 2002 and 2003. The Election Administration Improvement Fund is created in the Treasury, funded by appropriations and transfers, available for payments to States for election administration purposes. The Election Administration Improvement Fund in the Treasury provides payments to States for election administration activities, including voting equipment and technology, based on criteria set by the Federal Election Commission. The payment amount is determined by the total available funds and the state's population percentage. The term 'State' in this subsection refers to each State and the District of Columbia. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Code. The table of sections for subchapter A of chapter 98 of the Code is amended to add a new item, \"Sec. 9511. Election Administration Improvement Fund.\" These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
