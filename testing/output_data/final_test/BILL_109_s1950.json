    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-India Energy Security Cooperation Act of 2006\". The December 2004 National Intelligence Council report highlights the importance of global economic growth, particularly in China and India, on energy demand. India's current economic growth rate is around 7% of GDP, and it will need to double its energy consumption in the next 15 years to sustain growth. The US and India initiated an energy dialogue in 2005 to enhance energy cooperation and promote trade and investment in the sector. India, as the sixth largest energy consumer globally, satisfies 70 percent of its oil demand through imports and has a robust oil and gas exploration program. The country's focus includes oil, gas, power, energy efficiency, new technologies, renewable energy, coal, clean coal technology, and civil nuclear cooperation. Under Secretary of Energy David Garman emphasized the importance of US-India collaboration for stability in global energy markets during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2005. The largest discoveries of natural gas and oil in the world in 2002 and 2003 occurred in India. External funding and investment are needed to maximize recovery from oil fields, but an improved investment environment is necessary. India is the world's third largest producer of coal and relies on it for energy, but many coal-fired plants lack pollution control equipment. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressed the United States Congress in 2005. Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh emphasized the importance of clean coal technologies and efficient use of hydrocarbon resources. India is a market for US energy technologies. India plans to develop a 5,000,000 ton crude oil reserve by 2009. US energy experts stress the need for increased collaboration with other countries to develop and deploy energy technologies with greater Federal support and investment in international energy research. The curr_chunk discusses the goals of international energy research and expanding global strategic petroleum reserves. The policy of the United States is to cooperate with India on energy challenges, promote dialogue on national energy policies, and collaborate on energy research for global energy security. Assistance is provided to support energy cooperation. The President is authorized to establish programs for energy cooperation between the United States and India, including research on clean coal, alternative fuel sources, energy efficiency, and strategic oil reserves. The Government of India has established a strategic oil reserve to manage short-term disruptions in global oil supplies without impacting India's market or the global market. SEC. 5. REPORT ON ENERGY COOPERATION. The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, must submit a report to relevant Senate and House committees on energy security cooperation between the US and India within 180 days of this Act.
