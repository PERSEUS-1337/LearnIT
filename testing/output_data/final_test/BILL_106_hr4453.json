    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that United States Presidential Decision Directive 71 calls for a stronger response to maintaining order in post-conflict societies. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright highlighted the need for improved international capabilities in deploying civilian police to conflict zones like Kosovo, East Timor, and Sierra Leone. In response to the need for improved international capabilities in peace operations, old models of peacekeeping may not suffice. Peace operations today require a combination of military and police skills to control crowds, deter vigilante actions, prevent looting, and disarm civilian agitators while gaining community trust. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan emphasizes the importance of member nations addressing the structural weaknesses of UN peace operations. The current system for launching peace operations is compared to a volunteer fire department, but it faces delays due to last-minute arrangements and resource constraints. The availability of designated forces is unpredictable, hindering rapid deployment of mission headquarters. The United Nations failed to deploy peacekeepers in Rwanda and Bosnia, leading to genocide and massacres. The United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina had a budget of $165,600,000 from July 1997 to June 1998. NATO intervention in Kosovo cost $37,000,000 per day. In July 1999, 4,700 civilian police officers were requested for Kosovo, but only 2,901 were deployed by April 2000, leading to unrest. In May 2000, Revolutionary United Front rebels in Sierra Leone violated ceasefire and peace accords. Sierra Leone violated ceasefire and peace accords by capturing and holding approximately 500 UNAMSIL peacekeepers, along with their weapons and equipment. The UNAMSIL force was deployed too slowly and was understaffed. The United Nations Security Council approved sending 5,537 troops on an observer mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The United States has the power to veto decisions in the UN Security Council. Deployment of troops in a Republic the size of the US is delayed, risking the Lusaka accords falling apart. Establishment of a United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force. The President directs the US representative to urge the UN to establish a Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force under the authority of the UN Security Council, recruit personnel, and provide funding. The Force should have a mission statement for engaging in operations determined by the Security Council. The United Nations Security Council can deploy forces in response to imminent threats to peace, ongoing human rights violations, or when peace is restored but the rule of law is not reestablished. This deployment can occur when national civilian police or UN member nations personnel are not available. The United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force, consisting of up to 6000 personnel, can train military and civilian police of member nations for international peace operations. Personnel are under the authority of the Security Council, directed by the Secretary General, deployed by resolution, volunteers from member nations, and trained as a single unit. The United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force, organized for international peace operations, will be under the control of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations or the Military Staff Committee. Personnel will be trained as military staff officers and civilian police officers for immediate deployment to conflict areas, with a maximum deployment period of 6 months before being replaced by personnel from member nations. The United Nations Rapid Deployment Police and Security Force will be under the control of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations or the Military Staff Committee. Personnel will be trained for immediate deployment to conflict areas, with a maximum deployment period of 6 months before being replaced by personnel supplied by member nations. Basing and infrastructure services will be leased from existing member nations' institutions. SEC. 5. REPORT ON UNITED NATIONS RAPID DEPLOYMENT POLICE AND SECURITY FORCE. The President must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of this Act's enactment on negotiations progress with the United Nations for creating the force. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"international peace operations\" includes operations under chapter VI or VII of the UN Charter and UN operations with civilian policing. \"Rapidly deployable\" means deploying personnel to conflict regions within 15 days of a UN Security Council resolution."
