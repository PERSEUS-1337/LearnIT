    "content": "The Administration requested the 110th Congress to enact a new performance-based compensation system for the Foreign Service. Provisions were agreed upon by the Administration, AFSA, HIRC, and SFRC for a new compensation system, but it was not brought to the House floor for consideration. The new system would establish performance-based compensation for mid-level Foreign Service personnel and eliminate higher pay for those posted in Washington, DC. In 2005, the pay disparity for Senior Foreign Service personnel was resolved by converting to a performance-based system. Secretary of State Rice supported the Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal in 2006, intending to fund it from the FY 2007 budget. However, the House Republican Leadership omitted provisions from the final bill due to concerns over costs. In December 2006, H.R. 6060 passed the House without new Foreign Service compensation provisions, addressing a pay disparity issue. The Administration requested $34.5 million for a new compensation system in FY 2008. The 110th Congress may address this high-priority personnel issue for the Foreign Service. The House and Senate Committees worked on the Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal to address pay disparity by implementing a pay-for-performance system. However, due to cost concerns among House Republicans, the proposal was not included in the final version of H.R. 6060. The Foreign Service system is separate from the General Service system, with around 13,000 Foreign Service Officers. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-465) governs around 13,000 Foreign Service Officers and Specialists, two-thirds of whom serve abroad at over 250 posts. The remaining third is typically based in Washington, DC. Foreign Service members spend two-thirds of their careers abroad, moving every one to three years. The Senior Foreign Service (SFS) has 5 pay categories, while the regular Foreign Service has nine ranks, with FS-01 being the highest. Officers usually enter at the 05 or 06 levels and serve for four to five years before becoming tenured. The Foreign Service personnel system operates on an \"up-or-out\" basis, with Time-in-Class and Time-in-Service limitations. Most members leave after a distinguished career in their mid-50s. A pay gap exists between those serving in Washington, DC, and abroad, with salaries being 18.59% higher for those in Washington by 2007. The pay gap between Foreign Service personnel serving in Washington, DC, and abroad impacts morale, assignments, and the effectiveness of hardship and danger pay differentials. The American Foreign Service Association is concerned about the disparity, while the Bush Administration opposes changes unless tied to performance and overall modernization of the personnel system. The Administration and AFSA supported the Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal, which aimed to overhaul the pay structure based on performance. Secretary of State Rice urged prompt consideration and passage by the House of Representatives for the proposal to eliminate automatic pay increases and tie salary adjustments to performance. AFSA sought assurances for the move to a new pay-for-performance/global rate of pay system. AFSA sought assurances for the transition to a pay-for-performance system from the traditional automatic salary increases. The 109th Congress Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal had support from the Administration, the Foreign Service union, and Capitol Hill, but not unanimous support due to concerns about the loss of automatic salary increases. The Administration's proposal to link the elimination of pay disparity between service in Washington, DC and abroad to a new performance-based personnel structure at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security is met with skepticism by some Members and congressional staff. They believe the pay disparity issue can be addressed separately from the proposed pay-for-performance system, which is a top legislative issue for the Foreign Service and AFSA. The Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1990 excludes federal employees posted abroad from receiving locality pay adjustments, creating a pay disparity for Foreign Service personnel serving abroad compared to those in Washington, DC. This difference affects morale and assignment decisions, with a 17% pay gap by FY2006. Supporters argue for changing the pay system to address this issue. The pay disparity for Foreign Service personnel serving abroad compared to those in Washington, DC was over 17% by FY2006, creating a disincentive for overseas service. The difference only exists for those at the 01 level and below, as Senior Foreign Service members were brought to DC salary levels in 2005. AFSA estimated that a Foreign Service member hired in 1995 would lose $444,162 in pay and benefits over a 27-year career compared to a Civil Service counterpart in DC. The pay disparity for Foreign Service personnel serving abroad compared to those in Washington, DC was over 17% by FY2006, creating a disincentive for overseas service. A 2006 GAO study highlighted the impact of the lack of locality pay as a deterrent to bidding for hardship assignments. The gap in compensation penalizing overseas employees due to differences in domestic locality pay and overseas service pay rates continues to grow, discouraging overseas employees from bidding on hardship posts. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2601, creating an Overseas Comparability Pay Adjustment for Foreign Service personnel serving abroad. The Administration opposed the proposed pay adjustment system outlined in the bill. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2601, outlining conditions for considering Foreign Service pay adjustments based on performance. The Bush Administration criticizes the current GS pay framework as a \"failure\" and proposes replacing it with a pay-for-performance system by 2010. Congress developed new structures for civilians working for the Departments of Defense at the Administration's request. Congress developed new structures for civilians working for the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, currently challenged in court by federal employee unions. The Administration sought to change the Civil Service system through the \"Working for America Act\" in 2005, including a separate request for the Foreign Service system. Discussions within the Administration regarding a new Foreign Service personnel modernization system took place in 2005. Secretary of State Rice mentioned the President's funding request to modernize the Foreign Service pay system in February 2006. The Department of State's Budget in Brief for Fiscal Year 2007 outlined the transition to a performance-based pay system for Foreign Service personnel. A legislative text was developed after discussions among various agencies, AFSA, and congressional staff, serving as the basis for the new compensation system. The draft bill proposed a new performance-based personnel/compensation system for the Foreign Service, addressing concerns of both the Administration and AFSA. It maintained nine salary classes with the 01 level as the highest, with no intervening steps. The Secretary of State would determine salary rates within each class, considering various factors negotiated with AFSA. Salary adjustments would be based on performance, with no adjustment for those below standards. AFSA advocated for the role of Selection Boards in determining performance and promotion recommendations to the Secretary. The draft bill proposed a new performance-based personnel/compensation system for the Foreign Service, maintaining nine salary classes with the 01 level as the highest. The role of Selection Boards in determining performance and promotion recommendations to the Secretary is recognized, with the current requirement that recommendations be followed in order. The Secretary can temporarily withhold action on recommendations under transparent procedures negotiated with AFSA. A sufficient pool of funds will be allocated for a pay-for-performance system, and a new compensation schedule will be effective in April 2008. The proposal aims to avoid labor-management problems affecting DOD and DHS. The proposal for a new performance-based personnel/compensation system for the Foreign Service aims to avoid labor-management issues seen in DOD and DHS. AFSA seeks assurances that the system will be fair to employees, with performance-based adjustments replacing automatic pay increases. Both labor and management agree that the proposed system is unique and different from other pay-for-performance models. The Foreign Service system could benefit from a pay-for-performance system, as seen in State's experience with Senior FS conversion. AFSA President Holmes views tying pay-for-performance with overseas comparability pay positively, despite concerns from media reports and the administration's Working for America Act. The current FS personnel system is already performance-based, making the transition feasible for a win-win situation. The Foreign Service system is already performance-based, resembling a pay-for-performance system. The transition to a new system should be less dramatic than feared, especially for Senior Foreign Service personnel. The experience with Senior Executive Service conversion in 2005 has been viewed positively. The Foreign Service system is viewed more positively due to its different nature compared to the Civil Service system. Foreign Service personnel receive salary adjustments similar to Civil Service counterparts, carry their rank in person, and may hold a higher rank than their position. Foreign Service (FS) personnel receive salary adjustments similar to Civil Service counterparts and may hold a higher rank than their position. Their performance is reviewed annually by Selection Boards of colleagues based on Employee Evaluation Reports (EER). AFSA negotiates performance criteria with FS personnel a year ahead of the reviewing cycle. Selection Boards make promotion recommendations to the Secretary, who must follow them in the order presented, with the option to temporarily withhold recommendations under negotiated procedure. The Foreign Service (FS) has an up-or-out system with promotions based on \"Time-in-Class\" (TIC) and \"Time-in-Service\" (TIS). Individuals exceeding limits are separated/retired in their mid-50s as an 01 or 02 rank. Selection Boards identify bottom 5% and can refer low-ranked individuals for possible separation. The Selection Board can refer low-ranked individuals for separation from the Foreign Service. The Administration's draft bill served as the basis for bills H.R. 6060 and S. 3925 during the 109th Congress, with similar ideas but important differences. On November 28, 2006, final language for the Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal was agreed upon by SFRC and HIRC leadership. Secretary of State Rice expressed the Administration's support for the proposal on November 30, 2006. State Rice expressed Administration's support for Foreign Service Compensation Reform provisions, intending to fund within FY 2007 budget. Proposed approach to address pay disparity includes establishing a new worldwide Foreign Service schedule with nine classes. Annual review to consider economic measures like ECI changes. The new Foreign Service Compensation Reform provisions include annual salary adjustments based on performance, with recommendations from Selection Boards. AFSA negotiates standards for performance determinations. After conversion to the new system, Foreign Service members will not receive certain salary adjustments like the January ECI adjustment, locality pay, or non-foreign area salary allowances. The Secretary must allocate funds annually to ensure a minimum funding pool for performance-based adjustments that do not disadvantage employees. The allocated funds must cover adjustments that would have been provided under the previous system, including within grade step increases, ECI increases, and locality pay adjustments. Foreign Service members under 5 U.S.C. 5304 may have a special transition rule for areas with higher locality pay. A one-year transition compensation system maintains current pay levels tied to ECI increases and locality pay adjustments. Those in non-locality pay areas may receive a 9% pay increase. Management has certain authorities over performance pay provisions. Management has \"Management Rights\" over performance pay provisions for Senior Foreign Service members, within-grade salary adjustments for those ranked 01 and below, salary adjustments for those not yet reviewed, and funds allocation for the pay-for-performance system. These authorities are not negotiable with labor. The new system expands on these rights but allows for negotiation on procedures and considerations for those affected by management decisions. Certain issues are excluded from the definition of \"grievance,\" including pay determinations and within-grade adjustments. The Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal addressed key differences between H.R. 6060 and S. 3925, with compromises made under a deadline to move the legislation forward. The main distinction was that H.R. 6060 granted the Secretary sole discretion in certain determinations, while S. 3925 did not include that authority. If the issue is revisited in the 110th Congress, some aspects may be reopened for discussion. The Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal addressed differences between H.R. 6060 and S. 3925. Concerns were raised about the phrase \"in the Secretary's sole and exclusive discretion\" potentially limiting bargaining rights and standing in court. The provisions did not include this phrase. The Foreign Service Compensation Reform provisions expanded existing \"Management Rights\" authorities under the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to include salary adjustments and fund allocations. Labor and management could negotiate procedures for salary adjustments, but areas reserved as \"Management Rights\" were not subject to grievance. H.R. 6060 and S. 3925 required the President to establish a new worldwide Foreign Service schedule, with no agreed upon frequency for adjustments. The Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal required the President to establish, review, and adjust a new worldwide Foreign Service schedule annually, consisting of nine classes with no intervening steps. Concerns were raised about the potential for the salary ceiling to fall below inflation-adjusted levels if adjustments were not made frequently enough. Some members of the Foreign Service were worried about the lack of automatic increases in the new system due to the elimination of step adjustments and ties to economic measures like the Economic Cost Index. The Foreign Service Compensation Reform proposal aimed to eliminate step adjustments and ties to economic measures, potentially causing the system to fall behind the Civil Service. Concerns were raised about individuals falling behind without automatic increases, while supporters argued that the old system did not recognize performance. The Administration's budget submission in February 2008 addressed these issues. The Administration requested $34.5 million in its February 2008 budget submission to implement the new Foreign Service Compensation System. The Congressional Budget Office estimated costs of $32 million in 2007, $99 million in 2008, and an average of $141 million a year over the 2009-2011 period, totaling $554 million over five years. The estimate would be higher for the 110th Congress to implement a similar program."
