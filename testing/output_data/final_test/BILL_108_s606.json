    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2003\" and declares its purpose and policy. The policy of the United States emphasizes trust, mutual respect, and open communication in labor-management relationships. Labor-management cooperation aims to serve the public interest and maintain a quality work environment. The Federal Government should promote conciliation, mediation, and voluntary arbitration to facilitate agreements on pay, hours, and working conditions between employers and employees. The absence of cooperation between public safety employers and employees can impact the security of employees, interstate commerce, and the quality of police and fire services in local communities. This lack of labor-management cooperation can also affect the well-being and morale of public safety officers, with potential commercial repercussions. Providing minimal standards for collective bargaining negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent industrial strife between labor and management, avoiding commercial repercussions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Authority\" refers to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. \"Emergency medical services personnel\" includes individuals providing out-of-hospital emergency medical care. \"Employer\" and \"public safety agency\" pertain to entities employing public safety officers. A \"firefighter\" is defined as an employee engaged in fire protection activities. The Fair Labor Standards Act defines \"labor organization\" as a group representing employees before public safety agencies. A \"law enforcement officer\" is defined under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. A \"management employee\" is defined based on applicable State law. A public safety officer is an individual employed by a public safety agency as a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or emergency medical services personnel. The term \"substantially provides\" refers to compliance with the essential requirements of the Act, including the right to form and join a labor organization. The Act guarantees the right to form and join a labor organization, bargain over wages and conditions, sign enforceable contracts, and resolve impasses through arbitration or mediation. A supervisory employee is defined as someone with authority over hiring, directing, and disciplining public safety officers. The Act guarantees the right to form and join a labor organization, bargain over wages and conditions, sign enforceable contracts, and resolve impasses through arbitration or mediation. A supervisory employee is defined as someone with authority over hiring, directing, and disciplining public safety officers, and who devotes a majority of time at work exercising such authority. SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. The Authority must determine if a State meets the rights and responsibilities within 180 days of this Act. The opinion of affected parties will be considered. Once a determination is made, it remains valid until a subsequent determination is issued following specific procedures in case of a material change in State law. If a material change in State law occurs, an employer or labor organization can request a subsequent determination from the Director within 30 days. Judicial review can be sought within 60 days of the Authority's determination. In judicial review of a determination by the Authority, procedures from section 7123 of title 5, United States Code, are followed. The Authority's final determination is conclusive unless found to be arbitrary and capricious by the court. The Authority considers if State law grants public safety officers the right to form or join a labor organization. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for public safety employers to recognize employees' labor organizations, bargain with them, and commit agreements to writing. It also allows bargaining over hours, wages, and terms of employment, and mandates an interest impasse resolution mechanism. Enforcement of rights and protections is through State courts. The curr_chunk outlines the consequences for states failing to meet the requirements for recognizing employees' labor organizations and bargaining agreements. If a state does not comply, it will be subject to regulations and procedures outlined in section 5, effective two years after the enactment of the Act. The curr_chunk outlines the role of the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority will issue regulations for collective bargaining procedures for public safety employers and officers in states lacking such provisions. The Authority will determine labor organization representation units and supervise elections for exclusive representatives. The Authority is responsible for resolving various labor-related issues, including conducting hearings on unfair labor practices, protecting employees' rights to join or refrain from labor organizations, and issuing subpoenas for evidence. The Authority in the United States has the power to conduct hearings on labor-related issues, administer oaths, take depositions, order responses to interrogatories, and enforce final orders through petitions to the Court of Appeals. Private right of action allows any party to file suit in a State court to enforce compliance with regulations issued by the Authority. This right terminates upon the Authority filing a petition seeking the same relief. SEC. 6 prohibits public safety employers, officers, or labor organizations from engaging in actions like strikes or lockouts that disrupt emergency services. SEC. 7 addresses existing collective bargaining units and agreements. SEC. 7 states that any existing certification, recognition, election, collective bargaining agreement, or memorandum of understanding approved before the enactment of this Act will not be invalidated. The Act does not invalidate state laws providing collective bargaining rights for public safety officers equal to or greater than those in the Act, allows states to enforce right-to-work laws, and does not invalidate existing state laws that provide similar rights and responsibilities as the Act. The Act allows states to enforce right-to-work laws and does not invalidate state laws providing collective bargaining rights for public safety officers. It also prohibits a State from exempting political subdivisions with a population of less than 5,000 or less than 25 full-time employees from coverage under the Act. An individual elected or appointed to serve on a board or commission must comply with laws that protect collective bargaining rights for public safety officers. No State can override these laws if they provide equal or greater rights than those outlined in the Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the provisions of this Act."
