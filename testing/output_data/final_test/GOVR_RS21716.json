    "content": "Prior to 1975, the IRC did not address the tax treatment of organizations influencing elections. Contributions to political organizations were treated as gifts, exempting them from taxes. However, by the early 1970s, the IRS required organizations with additional income sources to file tax returns and pay corporate taxes. In 1975, P.L. 93-635 added Section 527 to the IRC, granting tax-exempt status to qualifying political organizations. This section focuses on the tax treatment of political organizations, also imposing a tax on 501(c) organizations making political expenditures. The tax treatment of political organizations under Section 527 of the IRC focuses on taxing 501(c) organizations for political expenditures. An exempt function includes influencing elections without explicitly advocating for or against individuals. When determining if an issue advocacy communication is for an exempt function, the IRS considers factors like candidate identification, timing with elections, and targeting voters. 527 organizations are taxed on political organization taxable income, which is gross income minus deductions and $100. Exempt function income includes contributions, membership dues, and proceeds from political fundraising events. 527 organizations, including political parties and candidate committees, generate income from various sources like political fundraising, entertainment events, and bingo games. The tax rate for these organizations is typically the highest corporate income tax rate, except for the principal campaign committee of a Congressional candidate, which is taxed using a graduated corporate tax rate schedule. There is ongoing debate about the regulation of certain types of 527 organizations by the Federal Election Campaign Act. Prior to 2000, certain political organizations received tax benefits under Section 527 without reporting to the FEC or IRS. This led to an increase in \"stealth PACs\" designed to avoid FEC reporting. In 1996, the IRS began issuing guidance on exempt functions for 527 organizations. In 2000 and 2002, Congress required organizations to report to the IRS, FEC, or state as \"stealth PACs.\" Organizations must notify the IRS of their 527 status by filing Form 8871 within 24 hours of formation, including details like name, address, purpose, employees, and directors. Failure to file timely results in tax on all income. Failure to notify IRS of changes within 30 days leads to loss of 527 status. A 527 organization must notify the IRS of its status by filing Form 8871 within 24 hours of formation. If the organization anticipates gross receipts of less than $25,000, certain notice requirements do not apply. Organizations accepting contributions or making expenditures for an exempt function must file disclosure report Form 8872 periodically with the IRS, with additional requirements for pre-general election, post-general election, and year-end reports. Failure to file a timely or accurate Form 8872 may result in a penalty. An organization failing to file Form 8872 on time or accurately may face a penalty equal to the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the contributions/expenditures. The report must include contributor details for donations over $200 and expenditure details for amounts over $500. Disclosure requirements do not apply to certain political organizations or independent expenditures. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded a district court's decision on disclosure requirements for organizations involved in state and local elections. The district court had found some requirements unconstitutional, citing violations of the Tenth, First, and Fifth Amendments. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a district court's ruling on disclosure requirements for state and local election organizations. The district court deemed some requirements unconstitutional, including the disclosure of expenditures. Section 527 organizations must file Form 990 annually with the IRS, detailing revenue sources and expenses, with contributions of $5,000 or more reported on Schedule B. An organization must report contributions of at least $5,000 on Form 990's Schedule B. Failure to file a timely or accurate return incurs a penalty of $20 per day, up to $10,000 or 5% of gross receipts. For organizations with over $1 million in gross receipts, the penalty is $100 per day, capped at $50,000. Certain 527 organizations are exempt from filing Form 990, such as political party committees or Congressional campaign committees. Tax-exempt organizations with political organization taxable income must file Form 1120-POL with the IRS. Taxable income organizations must file Form 1120-POL with the IRS. Late filing incurs a penalty of 5% of tax due, up to 25%. Late tax payment incurs a penalty of 0.5% of unpaid tax, up to 25%. Penalties can be increased for negligence or fraud. Failure to make Forms 8871, 8872, and 990 publicly available incurs a $20 per day penalty. IRS must post Forms 8871 and 8872 online within 48 hours of filing. The IRS posts Forms 8871 and 8872 online within 48 hours of filing. Some 527 organizations may need to report to both the IRS and FEC. Organizations spending over $10,000 on electioneering communications must report to the FEC. The 527 Transparency Act of 2007 would require monthly reports from all 527 organizations reporting to the IRS. The State and Local Candidate Fairness Act of 2007 would require all 527 organizations to file monthly reports with the IRS, in addition to pre-election, post-election, and year-end reports. Failure to do so would result in penalties and gift tax implications. The organizations must also notify their contributors of any reporting failures. Additionally, the bill would change the tax rate for state and local candidates' campaign committees. H.R. 3771 proposes to tax the principal campaign committees of state and local candidates using the graduated corporate income rate schedule, similar to congressional candidates' committees."
