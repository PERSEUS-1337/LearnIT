    "content": "The Act titled \"Low Income Housing Tax Credit Act of 2009\" allows low income housing credits to offset 100 percent of federal income tax liability. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit Act of 2009 amends section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow low income housing credits to offset 100 percent of federal income tax liability. The excess credit for the taxable year is increased by business credit carryforwards not allowed for that year, solely for determining the amount that can be carried back to a previous year. The limitation on excess credits for a taxable year is increased for years where low income housing credits are carried back, following rules similar to those described in the preceding paragraph. The excess credit described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is treated on a first-in first-out basis for preceding taxable years. Applicable low income housing credits refer to credits from section 42 for buildings placed in service after the enactment date. For taxable years 2008-2010, business credit carryforwards for buildings not covered by section 42 can be used if an agreement is made with a housing credit agency for future investments. For taxable years 2008-2010, business credit carryforwards can be used for future investments in a project specified by a binding agreement with a housing credit agency. The agreement must outline the investment amount and housing credit dollar amount allocated to the project, ensuring that the credits do not exceed the proposed investment. The applicable date for this provision is September 15, 2010. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007, and to carrybacks of credits from those years. SEC. 3. FIVE-YEAR CARRYBACK OF LOW INCOME HOUSING CREDIT. The amendment allows for a 5-year carryback of low income housing credit, separate from other business credits, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
