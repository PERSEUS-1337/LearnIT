    "content": "Neural Tangents is a library for working with infinite-width neural networks, providing a high-level API for specifying complex architectures. It allows training and evaluation at finite-width or infinite-width, performing exact inference via Bayes' rule or gradient descent. The library also generates Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent kernels, and offers tools to study gradient descent training dynamics of wide but finite networks. It runs on CPU, GPU, or TPU, with computations automatically distributed over multiple accelerators. Neural Tangents provides an interactive Colab notebook for working with infinite-width neural networks. The library offers tools for training and evaluating networks at finite or infinite width, exact inference, generating Neural Network Gaussian Process and Neural Tangent kernels, and studying gradient descent training dynamics. It is compatible with CPU, GPU, or TPU, with computations distributed over multiple accelerators."
