    "content": "The natural gas market consists of producers, pipelines, and local distribution companies. Prices paid by consumers are layered, starting with the wellhead price to producers, then adding pipeline transportation costs to get the city gate price. Local distribution companies further add charges for the final consumer prices. Different consumer segments pay varying prices, with residential consumers paying the highest. Recent data shows a 7% increase in residential prices compared to 2003. The most recent EIA data available is from August 2004. The recent EIA natural gas price data from August 2004 shows prices on the NYMEX for December 2004 at $6.80 per mcf and January/February 2005 at over $7.50 per mcf. Natural gas prices have been deregulated since 1978 under the Natural Gas Policy Act, leading to competitively determined wellhead prices. The spot price of natural gas is recorded at a transportation hub in the United States. The price of natural gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana is generally higher than the wellhead price due to processing and transportation costs. NYMEX futures contracts establish forward prices for natural gas, allowing market participants to hedge price risk. The NYMEX future price is influenced by traders with business interests in the natural gas market and financial traders who speculate. Interstate pipeline rates are not directly regulated, reflecting open access for shippers and market pricing monitored by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The city gate price for natural gas includes pipeline transportation charges regulated by state public service commissions. Residential and small commercial consumers pay a price premium for gas due to high fixed distribution costs. The EIA defines effective productive capacity as the maximum production available from natural gas wells. The effective capacity utilization rate (ECUR) is the ratio of actual production to effective productive capacity, with surplus capacity being the difference between the two. Data from 1987 to 2001 shows that natural gas prices are below $3.00 per mcf when ECUR is below 90%, but become volatile as ECUR rises above 90%. High ECUR values correlate with high prices, indicating conditions for volatile prices. Trends since 1985 show a decline in productive capacity since the late 1980s, stable capacity since 1993, and increasing production from 1985 to 1995. The ECUR has remained stable since 1993, with production trending up from 1985 to 1995 and then stabilizing. An ECUR above 90% indicates that natural gas output is fully allocated to meet demand, leading to potential price increases and supply disruptions. Increased drilling may occur in response to higher prices, but there is a lag of 6 to 18 months before new gas reaches the market. The EIA estimates a lag of 6 to 18 months between natural gas price increases and higher production due to declining field productivity. It takes 2.5 times more rig capacity to produce the same amount of gas as eight years ago. When the ECUR is below 90%, additional supply can be quickly brought to the market by increasing production from existing wells. The gas price volatility since 2000 was influenced by factors such as price deregulation, high demand, and supply trends. The ECUR has remained at or above 90% since 1995, leading to price increases. The winter of 2000-01 saw sharp price increases due to high ECUR values and low temperatures. The winter of 2000-01 saw high gas prices due to high ECUR values and low temperatures, leading to increased exploration and drilling. The number of drilling rigs increased from 496 in 1999 to 939 in 2001. However, as production entered the market in 2002, prices fell, resulting in lower developmental drilling. This led to price increases in the winter of 2002-03 as drilling activity responded to higher prices. The EIA reported an increase in drilling activity in 2004 compared to 2003, with a steady monthly rise in drill rig count. The success of exploration, field size, and existing well output affect natural gas prices. When the ECUR is below 90%, production is likely to increase, but above 90% it leads to higher prices. Higher prices incentivize production increases, potentially moderating price hikes. The demand for natural gas shows a seasonal pattern with peaks, leading suppliers to store gas for release during the heating season. Extreme weather conditions can deplete stored quantities, causing price increases if the ECUR is high. The ECUR is high, with stored gas levels dropping due to below average temperatures in the winter of 2002-03, leading to price increases. If the ECUR remains high and a cold winter repeats, another price spike in 2004-05 is possible. Natural gas demand is increasing due to power generators, with 80% of new electricity generation expected to be fueled by natural gas in the long term. The demand for natural gas for electricity generation peaks in the summer months, potentially leading to higher prices and shortages in the system. When the ECUR is above 90%, the industry's ability to meet increased demand is limited, causing prices to rise quickly. The natural gas industry experiences price increases due to limited supply from existing wells, prompting investment in drilling new wells. This cycle of unstable boom and bust can lead to chronic under-investment and stagnant supply. Higher prices justify exploratory drilling, leading to increased production when prices rise. When natural gas prices rise, extra rigs drill more wells, leading to new production. The market then faces excess supply, causing prices to fall. This price decrease discourages exploratory drilling, stabilizing supply and setting the stage for rising prices. Investment in exploration affects the Effective Capacity Utilization Rate (ECUR), influenced by existing wells' depletion levels. In 2003, the U.S. natural gas industry's estimated productive capacity was around 57 billion cubic feet per day. The U.S. natural gas industry's estimated productive capacity in 2003 was around 57 billion cubic feet per day. The balance of production and surplus capacity depends on new drilling and capacity expansion, with 25% of effective capacity coming from wells one year old or less. Texas and the Gulf of Mexico derive 30% of their production from new wells. If drilling stops, surplus capacity would disappear in less than a year. In 2001, high prices led to increased well completions, but in 2002, completion numbers decreased, resulting in a potential boom/bust investment cycle in the industry. The U.S. natural gas market is well integrated with the Canadian market, with imports of Canadian natural gas being an important supply source. Canadian gas fields, like those in the United States, may struggle to expand output without developing new fields. Additionally, liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports could be another source of supply for the U.S. with four operational LNG receiving terminals. The U.S. has four operational LNG receiving facilities with an annual send-out capacity of 1.4 tcf per year. The cost of LNG facilities has decreased by 30% over the last decade, but LNG is still more expensive than conventional gas. Dependence on LNG may lead to higher baseline prices. Gas storage volume is crucial for evaluating price volatility, especially during the winter heating season. The storage volumes of working gas show variability, with 2.7tcf at the end of the 2000 refill season and a low of 742 bcf in March 2001 due to severe temperatures. In contrast, the stored volume was 3.1 tcf at the end of the 2001 refill season. The stored volume of working gas was 3.1 tcf, remaining above 1.5 tcf during the heating season. Gas storage levels in November 2004 were above the five-year average, indicating sufficient supplies. Despite high futures prices, uncertainties about available stocks were unlikely. High natural gas prices can negatively impact the economy and consumers, similar to past oil price shocks. Gas prices as a supply side shock can reduce output and productivity growth, leading to increased unemployment and inflation. High natural gas prices negatively affect industrial users and residential consumers, forcing them to choose between heating and other necessities. Market intervention like price controls and conservation may help mitigate price spikes. Market balance for 2004 and 2005 is largely determined, with weather being a major factor. Aid to low-income gas consumers may be necessary to offset the effects of price spikes. Increased aid to low-income gas consumers through LIHEAP could be considered due to possible price spikes this winter. Long-term solutions to alter natural gas market demand and supply include conservation, LNG expansion, new pipeline construction, and access to new exploration areas. However, these options will take time to implement and are unlikely to significantly impact prices in the next six months to a year."
