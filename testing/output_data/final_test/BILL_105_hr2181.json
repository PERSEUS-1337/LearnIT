Section 1952 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include penalties for traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to obstruct justice by influencing witnesses or tampering with evidence, with fines or imprisonment up to 10 years. If injury results, the offender may be fined or imprisoned for up to 20 years; if death results, they may face fines, imprisonment for life, or even the death penalty. SEC. 102 amends Section 1512 of title 18, United States Code, to impose conspiracy penalties for obstruction of justice offenses involving victims, witnesses, and informants. It states that whoever conspires to commit an offense defined in this section or section 1513 shall face the same penalties as the offense they conspired to commit. SEC. 201 requires the Attorney General to survey State and local witness protection programs, report findings to Congress, and provide training to law enforcement agencies. Up to $500,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998. The Attorney General is tasked with promoting coordination among State and local witness interstate relocation programs by establishing a model Memorandum of Understanding. This model agreement includes requirements for notice when relocating a witness who has been arrested or convicted of a violent crime. Additionally, the Attorney General is authorized to use up to 10 percent of Byrne Grant funds for this purpose. The Attorney General can use up to 10 percent of Byrne Grant funds for grants to jurisdictions with interstate witness relocation programs that follow the model Memorandum of Understanding.
