    "content": "The Act titled \"America Can Code Act of 2013\" emphasizes the importance of computer science education. Only 2% of STEM students major in computer science, yet 60% of STEM jobs are in computing. Computer programming jobs are growing rapidly and offer high-paying opportunities, benefiting American families and the economy. The Act emphasizes the importance of computer science education, focusing on preparing career and technical students for academic and technical opportunities in postsecondary education or high-paying jobs in computer programming. It also highlights the need for coding and computer programming education in elementary and secondary schools, emphasizing its importance for national security and economic competitiveness. SEC. 4 amends the America COMPETES Act to include coding as a critical foreign language. SEC. 5 makes amendments to the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, particularly in the technology field. Additionally, amendments emphasize computer programming in vocational education. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, especially in the technology industry. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, especially in high demand occupations. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, particularly in high demand occupations and the technology industry. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, especially in high demand occupations and the technology industry, including preapprenticeship programs. The amendments also involve acquiring tech prep program equipment, completing a State or industry-recognized certification or licensure in computer programming. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, especially in high demand occupations and the technology industry. This involves completing a State or industry-recognized certification or licensure in computer programming. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006 is amended to include coding and computer programming in career and technical programs of study, especially in high demand occupations and the technology industry. This involves completing a State or industry-recognized certification or licensure in computer programming. Additionally, a Task Force on Computer Programming and Coding is established. The Secretary of Education will convene a task force to develop curricula for computer programming in elementary and secondary education, share best practices among educators, and create a national strategy for competitiveness in STEM fields. The task force will also develop options for a collaborative model and organizational structure. The task force will plan, manage, and conduct joint research and development activities effectively, allocate resources, identify challenges in educating a workforce for computer science and engineering jobs, propose a research agenda, define roles and responsibilities, and establish an information portal. The task force, established by the Secretary, will have representatives from various groups and will not receive compensation. They will also create an information portal. The task force, established by the Secretary, will create an information portal for elementary and secondary schools to access key data and tools for coding and computer programming education. The portal aims to complement existing federal efforts in preparing students for high-paying jobs in the computer programming field. The information portal established under this subsection will provide users with coordinated information on promoting coding and computer programming in elementary and secondary schools. This includes best practices, data, case studies, indicators, scientific reports, policy recommendations, and guidance documents. The information portal will provide guidance documents, incentives for teachers, education initiatives, support tools, and sources of assistance for computer science in schools. The Secretary must report to relevant committees within 24 months of the Act's enactment. The task force will provide a report to the House of Representatives and Senate committees. It will terminate after completing the information portal report. Definitions for terms like \"elementary school\" and \"community college\" are provided in this section. In the context of education legislation, key terms such as \"institution of higher education,\" \"minority-serving institution,\" and \"Secretary\" are defined."
