    "content": "Each year, Congress considers appropriations measures for federal government activities, known as \"regular\" appropriations bills. The House has special rules for their consideration, making them privileged and restricting the amendment process. The House typically agrees on procedural terms before considering a regular appropriations bill. The House has special rules for considering regular appropriations bills, which are typically brought to the floor under unanimous consent agreements or as privileged business. House Rule XIII allows for consideration of general appropriations bills with no restrictions on amendments. These rules impact the content and timing of amendments but do not significantly restrict debate or the number of amendments that may be offered. Special rules and unanimous consent agreements (UCAs) in the House have been used to consider regular appropriations bills, allowing for amendments that would otherwise be in order under House rules. However, during the 111th Congress, there were instances where special rules placed additional restrictions on the amending process. These rules have been frequently used to waive House rules that could prevent or delay the consideration of regular appropriations bills. The report examines changes in waivers of House rules for regular appropriations bills, with recent special rules providing blanket waivers of certain provisions. Waivers have evolved from specifying rules waived to blanket waivers, particularly for Rule XXI, clause 2. This allows for easier consideration of bills, with exceptions for specific portions vulnerable to points of order. Since the 110th Congress, waivers of Rule XXI, clause 2 have been consistently included in special rules or UCAs. The report focuses on the initial consideration of regular appropriations bills in the House from FY1996 to FY2015. It excludes conference reports, amendments between houses, omnibus bills, minibus bills, supplemental appropriations bills, and continuing appropriations measures. It also does not cover special rules prior to the 104th Congress. The report focuses on the initial consideration of regular appropriations bills in the House from FY1996 to FY2015, excluding special rules prior to the 104th Congress. Regular appropriations bills were often brought up using their privileged status in combination with a special rule that waived points of order. Consideration was sometimes further structured once initiated through an additional special rule or unanimous consent agreement. The data presented in the report only includes the terms under which consideration was initiated. The report discusses the initiation of regular appropriations bills in the House from FY1996 to FY2015. It covers the floor consideration of amendments, types of amending processes, waivers of points of order, and the evolution of waiver forms. Table 1 illustrates the frequency of floor consideration methods. Since FY2003, all regular appropriations bills have received floor consideration. Since FY2003, regular appropriations bills have consistently received floor consideration in the House, with special rules, unanimous consent agreements, and privileged measures being used to initiate consideration. House Rule XIII, clause 5, allows for a privileged motion to proceed to the consideration of a regular appropriations bill after certain conditions are met, without the need for debate. This process minimizes the floor time required to bring the bill for consideration. The legislative process in the House governs the consideration of regular appropriations bills, with special rules allowing waivers for parts that may violate House rules. Only three bills were brought to the floor as privileged business, while others required prior agreement on terms of consideration before being brought to the floor. House rules and special rules govern the consideration of measures in the House, specifying debate time, amendments, and waivers. The process typically starts with a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules, allowing one hour of debate managed by the majority party Member of the Rules Committee. Special rules in the House allow for one hour of debate managed by the majority party Member of the Rules Committee. The rule may be amended only with the consent of the majority floor manager, and typically no amendments are offered. At the end of the hour, the floor manager moves the previous question to prevent further debate. Special rules are almost always approved by the House and were used to initiate consideration of most regular appropriations bills from FY1996 to FY2015. During FY2009-FY2015, special rules were used over half the time for each fiscal year. Unlike special rules, UCAs are orally proposed on the floor by a Member and entered into if no objections are raised. UCAs were used to initiate consideration of regular appropriations bills for FY1996 to FY2015 in 10 instances during five fiscal years. During FY1996 to FY2015, UCAs were used to initiate consideration of regular appropriations bills, allowing for alterations to the amending process. This procedure permitted changes such as placing preconditions on amendments, prescribing specific amendments, waiving points of order, or imposing time limits on consideration. Most regular appropriations bills during this period allowed for an \"open\" amending process with an unrestricted number of compliant amendments. During FY1996 to FY2015, UCAs were used to initiate consideration of regular appropriations bills, allowing for alterations to the amending process. Most bills allowed for an \"open\" amending process with an unrestricted number of compliant amendments. Exceptions included the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, which often had a \"structured\" amendment process specifying a list of allowed amendments. A closed process, allowing no amendments, was used only once for the FY2004 Legislative Branch appropriations bill. During FY1996 to FY2015, UCAs were used to initiate consideration of regular appropriations bills, allowing for alterations to the amending process. Exceptions included the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, which often had a \"structured\" amendment process specifying a list of allowed amendments. The House may choose to structure the amendment process subsequent to initiating consideration, either by unanimous consent or by adopting an additional special rule. Regular appropriations measures are considered in the Committee of the Whole under the \"five-minute rule\" for amendment. Amendments must be timely and offered to the paragraph currently being read for amendment. The five-minute rule allows five minutes of debate in favor and against each amendment. The amending process for regular appropriations bills in the House involves the five-minute rule for debate on each amendment offered, with restrictions on content and timing. After amendments are considered, the Committee of the Whole reports back to the House for affirmation. The House may also vote on a motion to recommit. Consideration of regular appropriations bills in the House involves debate, amendments, and final voting. Debate can be time-consuming, with no direct limits on the number of amendments that can be offered. To streamline the process, the House may limit general debate to one hour or use special rules to expedite consideration. Members may offer pro forma amendments to extend debate, further slowing the process. Special rules and UCAs in the House can limit general debate and specify the number or type of amendments allowed for bills. For example, a UCA for the FY2008 Military Construction Appropriations bill limited amendments to a list of 24. Consideration can also be restricted by placing time caps on sections of the bill or individual amendments, as seen in H.Res. 484 (106th Congress) which limited consideration of a section of the FY1999 Defense Appropriations bill to one hour. The House can use UCAs to limit amendments and debate time on appropriations bills, providing a more structured and predictable amending process. This practice became less common in the 110th Congress. The House can adopt a second special rule to limit consideration of subsequent amendments as an alternative to a UCA. This practice, less frequent since the 110th Congress, was exemplified during the FY2010 Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill with the adoption of a second special rule (H.Res. 552, 111th Congress) that restricted further amendments. Prior to 1973, most special rules for regular appropriations bills did not impose restrictions on amendments. Restrictions on amendments have evolved over time in the House, with special rules now regulating the amending process in various ways. The Rules Committee has developed categories to distinguish rules, with six relevant categories for amendment processes in regular appropriations bills. Regular Open allows any amendment under House rules and the Budget Act, while Open Plus waives House Rules to allow specified amendments. The House has developed categories for regulating the amending process in appropriations bills. Open Plus waives House Rules to allow specified amendments, with options like a Preprinting Requirement, Time Cap on Amendments, and Structured processes for considering amendments. The House has developed categories for regulating the amending process in appropriations bills, including Open Plus, which allows specified amendments with options like a Preprinting Requirement, Time Cap on Amendments, and Structured processes for considering amendments. Special rules and UCAs for FY1996 to FY2015 regular appropriations bills mostly provided some type of open amending process, except during the 111th Congress. During FY1996 to FY2004, the House used various types of open amending processes for regular appropriations bills, including \"regular open\" and \"open plus\" rules. The frequency of using open plus processes declined after FY2004, with no open plus amending processes used since then. These processes regulated consideration by waiving points of order against specified amendments. The House used open plus processes for appropriations bills, waiving points of order against specified amendments. These processes included time caps on debate and protected specified amendments from further amendments on the floor. The House used open processes for appropriations bills, waiving points of order against specified amendments and imposing time caps on debate. H.R. 2606 in the 107th Congress specified that certain amendments would not be subject to further amendment, limiting Members to an up or down vote. Amendments had to be preprinted in the Congressional Record before being offered, a practice rare from FY1996 to FY2015. Only four special rules and no UCAs for regular appropriations bills contained such provisions, allowing pro forma amendments. The last four FY2015 regular appropriations bills had open rules with provisions limiting debate time for each amendment to 10 minutes. Special rules prohibited pro forma amendments, except for the chair and ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee. Structured and closed amendment processes for FY1996 to FY2015 appropriations bills were mainly implemented through special rules, with structured UCAs used only twice. Time caps and waivers for amendments were consistent in this period. During the 112th Congress, structured rules and UCAs placed time caps on amendments, with structured rules waiving points of order. Most Legislative Branch Appropriations bills were considered under structured rules, allowing an increased number of amendments compared to previous Congresses. The FY2004 bill was considered under a closed rule. During recent Congresses, structured rules have been controversial for regular appropriations bills. In the 111th Congress, structured rules were used for all but one bill, deviating from the traditional practice of using open rules with subsequent amendment rosters. Prior to this, structured rules were only used once for an appropriations measure other than a Legislative Branch bill in the 105th Congress. During the 111th Congress, structured rules were used for most bills, departing from the usual practice of open rules with subsequent amendment rosters. The use of structured rules began with the FY2010 Commerce/Justice/Science Appropriations bill. Over 100 amendments were prefiled before a deadline, leading to the House passing a second special rule to limit consideration. During the 111th Congress, structured rules were used for most bills, departing from the usual practice of open rules with subsequent amendment rosters. A special rule, H.Res. 552, limited consideration to a list of 23 amendments with a 10-minute debate cap per amendment. Proponents argued it was necessary to complete appropriations in a timely manner, while others claimed it undermined Members' ability to offer amendments. No structured rules were used in the 112th Congress, but one was used in the 113th Congress for the FY2014 Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 2397). During the 113th Congress, a structured rule was used for the FY2014 Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 2397) due to concerns about possible amendments on Syria, Egypt, and the National Security Agency. The rule limited consideration of amendments to a list of 100, provided time caps for debate on each amendment, and waived points of order against those amendments. During the 113th Congress, a structured rule was used for the FY2014 Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 2397) to address concerns about possible amendments on Syria, Egypt, and the National Security Agency. The special rule for floor consideration of this measure (H.Res. 27) prohibited any amendments except five related to certain immigration-related executive actions. The number of amendments allowed by structured rules for appropriations measures has varied over the years, with an average of about 13 per rule during the 111th Congress. During the 113th Congress, a structured rule was used for the FY2014 Department of Defense Appropriations bill (H.R. 2397) to address concerns about possible amendments on Syria, Egypt, and the National Security Agency. The rule allowed 100 amendments, while the rule for the FY2015 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill allowed five amendments. H.Res. 252 (104th Congress) for the FY1996 District of Columbia Appropriations bill allowed an amendment printed in the committee report to be considered first, with exceptions. During the 105th Congress, special rules were implemented for the consideration of various appropriations bills, including the Department of Defense and Foreign Operations bills. These rules included time limits on debates, waivers of points of order against certain amendments, and restrictions on second degree amendments. For example, H.Res. 484 imposed a one-hour time cap on the amendment process for Section 8106 of the Department of Defense bill, while H.Res. 542 contained elements of both open plus and open with preprinting for the Foreign Operations bill. The rule waived points of order against five amendments in the committee report (H.Rept. 105-725), set debate limits for each amendment, and limited the amendment process to five hours. House rules dictate when a measure can be considered and what content is allowed, enforcing restrictions on the floor. The House can choose to waive its standing rules or restrictions in order to consider certain legislation that it wishes to take up, either through a special rule or UCA. Waivers can be specific to certain rules or broad categories, and can apply to specific provisions or the entire measure. This allows the House to set aside rules that may hinder the consideration of legislation in a more favorable form. Waivers of rules can be framed to cover the entire measure except for specified provisions, leaving them vulnerable to a point of order. House rule waivers provided through special rules and UCAs before considering regular appropriations bills for FY1996 to FY2015 evolved from specific waivers to blanket waivers with exceptions. This procedural change does not necessarily reflect changes in bill content. Waivers for Rule XXI, clause 2, with exceptions increased until FY2008 regular appropriations bills. Waivers for House rule exceptions have been used for regular appropriations bills from FY1996 to FY2015. In FY2008 to FY2011, waivers covering the entire bill were used, while waivers with specified exceptions were granted in the 112th and 113th Congresses for FY2012 to FY2014 bills. House action on bills subject to a point of order requires a waiver to be granted to proceed with consideration. Special rules often include provisions waiving points of order against consideration based on specific House rules or the Congressional Budget Act. The FY2002 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill included a provision waiving points of order against consideration of the bill. Similar provisions were also seen in other special rules for regular appropriations bills, such as the FY2012 Agriculture appropriations bill. These waivers allow the House to take up the bill without being hindered by points of order. Broad waivers of points of order are typically addressed in the accompanying committee report as required by House rules. The committee report accompanying special rules for regular appropriations bills often identifies specific House rules that could be violated by the bill's consideration. Unanimous consent agreements may also provide waivers of points of order against consideration. Table 3 shows the breakdown of waivers provided in special rules and UCAs for regular appropriations bills. Since FY2001 bills, waivers of all points of order against consideration have become more common in special rules and UCAs for regular appropriations bills. Exceptions for Rule XXI, clauses 9 and 10 were included in waivers during the 110th and 111th Congresses. Exceptions for Rule XXI, clauses 9 and 10 were included in waivers during the 110th and 111th Congresses, with clause 9 related to earmark disclosure and clause 10 containing the PAYGO point of order against direct spending and revenue legislation. In the 112th Congress, a blanket waiver was provided for all points of order against consideration in special rules for regular appropriations bills. This included waiving House Rule XXI, clause 2, which prohibits general appropriations bills from changing existing law. The House Rule XXI, clause 2 prohibits appropriations for programs not previously authorized by law and changing existing law. Points of order can be raised against any portion of the bill during consideration, leading to the stricken portion. Waivers for provisions in bills have mostly covered the entire measure since FY1996 regular appropriations bills. Waivers of Rule XXI, clause 2 in House resolutions have specified provisions exempt from the waiver, leaving them unprotected. For example, H.Res. 836 waived points of order except for specific sections in the FY2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. This allows for selective protection of certain provisions while leaving others vulnerable to points of order. The Rules Committee often provides waivers with exceptions for specific provisions in House resolutions, known as the \"Armey Protocol.\" This allows certain provisions to be unprotected and subject to a point of order on the floor, leading to their potential removal from the bill. The Rules Committee frequently grants waivers for specific provisions in House resolutions, known as the \"Armey Protocol.\" These waivers can lead to points of order being raised against unprotected provisions during bill consideration, potentially resulting in their removal. During FY1996 to FY2007, waivers with exceptions allowed certain provisions to be stricken by a point of order. However, waivers for bills between FY2008 and FY2011 had no exceptions, providing protection for the entire measure. In the 112th Congress, waivers with exceptions were applied for specific bills. In the 113th Congress, waivers with exceptions were provided for appropriations bills, including H.R. 5972 and H.R. 2217."
