The Diversity Immigrant Category was added in 1990 to encourage new and varied migration. This category allocates visas to countries with low immigration rates over the past five years. In the 1980s, concerns arose about the skewed distribution of U.S. legal immigration admissions favoring immigrants from Asia and Latin America due to the 1965 amendments. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 addressed this by allowing an extra 5,000 immigrant visas per year for natives of 36 countries affected by the 1965 changes. Natives of Ireland, Canada, and Great Britain received the largest proportion of visas under the NP-5 program. In 1988, Congress extended the NP-5 program for two more years and added the diversity immigrant category to the INA. The diversity visa category had an annual allocation of 55,000 visas when it went into effect in FY1995. P.L. 105-100 temporarily decreased the annual ceiling to 50,000 visas. The Diversity Visa program, established in 1988, initially had an annual allocation of 55,000 visas. However, in 1997, the annual ceiling was temporarily reduced to 50,000. This reduction was to offset immigrant visas granted to certain unsuccessful asylum seekers under NACARA. To be eligible for a diversity visa, a foreign national must have a high school education or two years of relevant work experience. The applicant or their spouse must be a native of a qualifying country. Children of qualifying diversity immigrants and their spouses can accompany them as lawful permanent residents and are included in the 50,000 annual limit for diversity visas. A lottery is used to randomly select applicants due to high demand. Registration for the FY2020 lottery started on October 3, 2018, and closed on November 6, 2018. Selectees can check online from May 7, 2019, to September 30, 2020. The FY2018 lottery had 14.7 million entries, with approximately 100,000 selectees chosen randomly. Being selected as a winner does not guarantee a diversity visa. To receive a diversity visa, selectees must complete the application process by the end of the fiscal year they registered for the lottery. This includes security and medical screenings, in-person interviews, and payment of applicable fees. Reviews and background checks are conducted by DOS consular officers and DHS immigration officers. Those residing in the US as nonimmigrants must undergo reviews by USCIS before adjusting to LPR status. The diversity immigrant visa program allocates 50,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years. USCIS conducts in-person interviews and reviews to ensure applicants are not inadmissible under various grounds such as health, criminal history, and security concerns. Each country is limited to 7% of visas. The diversity visa program allocates 50,000 visas annually to low-admission regions and countries, with each country limited to 7% of the total. The distribution of diversity visas by global region has shifted over time, with immigrants from Africa accounting for 40% of diversity visas from FY1995 to FY2017. Europe's share of visas has decreased, while Africa and Asia have seen an increase in their share. From FY1995 through FY2017, immigrants from Africa accounted for 40% of diversity visas, with Europeans at 31% and Asians at 25%. The top countries for diversity immigrants have shifted from Europe to Africa and Asia in recent years. Certain countries like Ethiopia, Ukraine, and Egypt consistently rank high, while others like Ireland, Poland, and Venezuela have limited periods of high diversity visa numbers. Six countries received over 40,000 diversity visas in total during this period, with Ethiopia leading at 67,832 visas. In FY2017, diversity immigrants from Africa accounted for 43% of admissions, while Europeans made up 22% of diversity immigrants. Latin America was the sending region for 43% of all LPRs admitted, but only 4% of diversity immigrants. Asia also had a significant number of diversity visa admissions. The distribution of LPR admissions and DV admissions from Asia shows the impact of the two-step visa allocation formula, with Asia having both high-admission and low-admission countries. In FY2017, foreign nationals from Asia represented a somewhat more equivalent share of LPRs and diversity LPRs compared to other world regions. Diversity immigrants from Asia are typically younger and more likely to be working-age adults and children. The foreign-born population in the United States, particularly diversity immigrants, are more likely to be in the prime working-age group and have a younger age distribution compared to native-born individuals. Diversity immigrants are also less likely to be married and more likely to be single. Critics of the diversity immigrant visa program argue that individuals do not need high levels of education or work experience to qualify. Diversity Visa (DV) immigrants have an average of 14.5 years of schooling upon entering the United States, higher than family-based immigrants but lower than employment-based immigrants. They are also more likely to be fluent in English compared to most family-based immigrants. Diversity Visa (DV) immigrants have higher educational attainment than family-based immigrants, with 50% having a college degree upon entry in 2003. They also had higher initial unemployment rates than employment-based immigrants but lower rates than siblings of U.S. citizens. Diversity Visa (DV) immigrants initially had higher unemployment rates than employment-based immigrants but lower rates than siblings of U.S. citizens. However, after four to six years, their unemployment rates dropped significantly and were similar to other immigrant groups. DV immigrants' hourly earnings were between employment-based and sibling immigrants. Male DV immigrants had the highest percentage growth in real hourly wages between initial entry and re-sampling. The DV program aims to increase the diversity of immigrant flows to the United States. The Diversity Visa (DV) program aims to increase immigrant diversity in the United States. Initially benefiting Irish and Italian constituents, the program has since expanded to include immigrants from a wider range of countries and regions. Despite its small size relative to total annual immigrant admissions, DV admissions make up about 5% of annual LPR admissions. Former Representative Bruce Morrison, who helped create the program, highlighted its limited impact on the immigrant population's makeup. The Diversity Visa (DV) program was created to provide a new pathway for immigrants who couldn't enter through other systems. It has admitted over 1 million immigrants from under-represented countries since FY1995. The program's impact is evident in the diversity of annual LPR flows, with a notable increase in diversity since its establishment in FY1995. The Diversity Visa (DV) program has increased the diversity of annual LPR admissions since its establishment in FY1995. Data shows that DV admissions contribute to higher diversity compared to non-DV admissions. The program has also led to an increase in immigration via the family-based system, particularly for Africans. The Diversity Visa program has increased diversity in LPR admissions since 1995, particularly for Africans. Legislation has focused on eliminating the program, with bills introduced in Congress to do so. In the 116th Congress, bills have been introduced to eliminate or revise the Diversity Visa program, with some proposing to increase the annual visa allocation to 80,000. Policy questions regarding the program's future include using diversity visas for backlog reduction in other visa categories and considering the independent pathways to Legal Permanent Resident status. Some argue that the diversity visa program provides a fair opportunity for individuals who would not otherwise have access to legal immigration, while others believe it reintroduces discriminatory national origin quotas. Additionally, there are examples of other admissions policies that effectively discriminate based on nationality. Some argue that the diversity visa program provides a fair opportunity for individuals who lack family or employer connections in the U.S., enriching the country culturally and economically. Efforts to end the program are seen as racially motivated, with historical limitations on African immigration highlighted. Some argue that the diversity visa program offers a fair chance for individuals without U.S. connections, while others criticize the lottery system as arbitrary. Concerns about immigration fraud in the program have been raised based on past reports. The Diversity Visa (DV) program has faced criticism for fraud vulnerabilities, highlighted in a 2007 GAO report and recent complaints by the Department of Justice seeking denaturalization of individuals who gained entry through the program. Defenders of the program point to revisions made by the Department of State to address fraud risks, such as biographic and facial recognition checks. The Diversity Visa (DV) program has implemented measures to address fraud vulnerabilities, including disqualifying entrants with duplicate entries and requiring passport information on entry forms to prevent unauthorized submissions. Critics argue that fraud risks are not unique to the DV program, citing fraud prevention efforts for all visa applications by the Department of State. Some argue that background checks in countries eligible for the DV program are challenging, raising concerns about terrorism and national security. The 2004 warning from the DOS Deputy Inspector General highlighted vulnerabilities in the diversity visa lottery to state sponsors of terrorism. Critics point to cases like the New Jersey resident from Uzbekistan who committed a terrorist attack in 2017 after entering the US on a diversity visa. The Trump Administration called for the program's termination following this incident. Some argue for the termination of the diversity visa lottery program, while others defend it by highlighting the rigorous background checks performed on all prospective immigrants. They also mention improvements made to the program based on recommendations from the Department of State Inspector General. Critics of the program's termination point out that since the creation of the Visa Security Program in 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has assisted in extensively vetting individuals applying for visas. Since its creation in 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has helped consular officers vet visa applicants. A 2007 GAO report found no evidence of terrorist threats from diversity visa immigrants, but experts warn of potential fraud. Supporters argue the program boosts American goodwill and aids in responding to globalization challenges. They also highlight the value of remittances sent by diversity immigrants. Critics mention concerns about brain drain. Supporters of the Diversity Visa (DV) program argue that it promotes new and varied migration to counterbalance the dominance of certain countries in the immigration system. They believe it honors the U.S. history as a destination for enterprising immigrants who arrive without family ties but with a strong work ethic. Critics raise concerns about brain drain from developing countries due to DV immigrants possessing education and skills beyond program requirements. The Diversity Visa (DV) program is debated regarding whether to remove per-country limits on immigrant admissions. Some argue for its continuation to promote new migration, while others believe it has served its purpose after almost 30 years. Critics raise concerns about brain drain from developing countries due to DV immigrants possessing education and skills beyond program requirements. The Diversity Visa program is debated for removing per-country limits on immigrant admissions. Critics argue for its continuation to promote new migration, citing it as the only accessible avenue for immigrating to the United States in many countries. The entropy index measures population diversity, with a formula that standardizes the index to a range of 0 to 1.0. Between FY1995 and FY2017, the standardized entropy index was calculated for country of birth of total LPR admissions, LPR admissions minus DV admissions, and DV admissions. The index varied over the years, consistently higher when DV LPRs were included."
