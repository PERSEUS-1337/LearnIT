    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act of 2011.\" Amendments are made to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Amendments are made to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act regarding the adoption of new or revised criteria and standards, including the publication of pathogen and pathogen indicator lists. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act include updating monitoring protocols to detect pathogenic contamination and its source, as well as requiring state reports to include all environmental agencies with authority to address contamination sources. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act involve updating monitoring protocols to detect pathogenic contamination sources in coastal recreation waters. This includes implementing programs for monitoring, assessment, and notification, which may include prevention efforts to address identified sources of contamination. Rapid testing methods are also encouraged. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act involve updating monitoring protocols to detect pathogenic contamination sources in coastal recreation waters. This includes implementing programs for monitoring, assessment, and notification, which may include prevention efforts to address identified sources of contamination. Rapid testing methods, including validation by the Administrator, are encouraged. The Administrator will publish guidance for rapid testing methods to enhance protection of public health at coastal recreation waters. The Administrator will publish guidance for rapid testing methods to enhance public health and safety by quickly notifying the public of any water quality standard exceedances for pathogens and indicators. Rapid testing methods will be prioritized at heavily used beaches or access points. The method for testing water quality in coastal recreation waters aims to provide results within 4 hours of sample receipt. Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act require prompt communication of results within 2 hours to relevant agencies. The Administrator administers the program under section 402, determining appropriate forms for reporting on water quality standards exceedances annually. The text chunk discusses amendments to reporting requirements for water quality standards exceedances, including the availability of a geographical information system database for informing the public about coastal recreation waters. The text chunk outlines requirements for reporting water quality standards exceedances, including timely updates, closure measures, public notification of contamination sources, and analysis of monitoring protocols. The text chunk discusses updates to the National List of Beaches under the Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act of 2011, including biennial updates by the Administrator. Compliance review procedures under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act are also outlined. The Administrator is required to conduct compliance reviews annually for State and local governments regarding statutory and regulatory requirements under the Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act of 2011. The assessments must be provided to the governments and made available to the public. The Administrator conducts annual compliance reviews for State and local governments under the Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act of 2011. Assessments are made available to the public in a searchable database. Non-compliant governments risk a reduction in Federal grant share to 50% if corrective action is not taken within one year of notification. The Clean Coastal Environment and Public Health Act of 2011 requires the Administrator to conduct annual compliance reviews for State and local governments. Non-compliant governments may have their Federal grant share reduced to 50% if corrective action is not taken within one year. The Comptroller General will review the Administrator's activities and submit a report to Congress by December 31 of the third calendar year after the Act's enactment. Authorization of appropriations is amended to cover fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Section 8 of the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 is amended to change the year from \"2005\" to \"2015\". Additionally, a monitoring protocol for mercury is established. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will review and update monitoring protocols for mercury in the Great Lakes coastal waters and develop recommendations for testing mercury in sediment and fish tissue. This does not affect the schedule for publishing new water quality criteria. The Pollution Control Act authorizes appropriations for carrying out necessary actions. SEC. 5. STUDY OF GRANT DISTRIBUTION FORMULA. The Administrator will conduct a study to revise the formula for distributing grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Factors considered include base costs for water quality programs, beach monitoring needs, and consultation with relevant agencies. The Administrator will consult with Federal, State, and local agencies. A report must be submitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate within 1 year, detailing the study results and any recommendations for revising the distribution formula. SEC. 6. IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON POLLUTION OF COASTAL RECREATION WATERS. The Administrator will conduct a study on the long-term impact of climate change on pollution of coastal recreation waters and submit a report to Congress within 1 year. The report will include information on potential contaminant impacts on water resources, public health, and ecosystems in coastal communities, as well as address monitoring requirements for coastal water resources and ecosystems. The report will highlight necessary Federal actions to advance the availability of information and tools for assessing and mitigating the impacts of long-term climate change on coastal waters, public health, and ecosystems. The Administrator will consult with relevant agencies in developing the report. SEC. 7. IMPACT OF NUTRIENTS ON POLLUTION OF COASTAL RECREATION WATERS. The Administrator will conduct a study on the impacts of nutrient excesses and algal blooms on coastal recreation waters. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year, including information on these impacts and recommendations for addressing them. The Administrator will establish water quality criteria and consult with other federal agencies, states, and local entities in developing a report on nutrient excesses and algal blooms' impacts on coastal recreation waters."
