    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education and related services. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities aged 3 to 21. States must identify, evaluate, and provide individualized education programs (IEPs) for eligible children. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to provide special education and related services through individual education programs (IEPs) for children with disabilities. Parents are essential partners in planning and overseeing their child's education. IDEA ensures children with disabilities are educated alongside non-disabled peers whenever possible and provides procedural safeguards for parents, including the right to a due process hearing and appeal. IDEA was enacted in 1975 to address the need for education for children with disabilities, and has undergone multiple reauthorizations, with the most recent in 2004. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has undergone multiple reauthorizations, with the most recent in 2004 (P.L. 108-446). The act includes specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011 and has definitions critical for interpreting its requirements. Congress is currently identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization, while the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) includes supplemental appropriations for IDEA. The IDEA defines a child with a disability as having specific conditions and needing special education services. Unlike other disability definitions, IDEA's is categorical and includes the requirement for special education. The IDEA defines a child with a disability as having specific conditions and needing special education services, such as emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities. Judicial decisions have focused on the child's need for special education, even if they have high grades and undisputed intellectual ability. The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities significantly impact educational performance. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA included a new definition of highly qualified teacher for special education teachers. IDEA requires every special education teacher to be highly qualified, regardless of the subject taught. There is no private right of action for students if a teacher is not highly qualified, but a complaint may be filed. The regulations allow for a complaint to be filed under state procedures if a teacher is not highly qualified. IDEA mandates that states have policies in place to identify, locate, and evaluate children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The Ninth Circuit ruled in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that failing to evaluate a student who shows signs of needing special education services violates IDEA's child find requirement. This failure can lead to a due process complaint. The Supreme Court has not yet decided on hearing a case involving a parent of a child with a disability seeking a due process hearing for negligence by school officials in providing an educational program. The issue revolves around whether due process suits are allowed for negligence or only intentional decisions by the school district. The core requirement of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education to receive federal funding. The Supreme Court case Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 set the standard for the level of education required under IDEA, emphasizing the need for a \"free appropriate public education\" to confer educational benefits on children with disabilities. The Supreme Court case Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established the standard for education under IDEA, emphasizing the provision of a \"free appropriate public education\" to benefit children with disabilities. The Court ruled that FAPE is achieved through personalized instruction and support services that meet state standards and the child's IEP, even when the child is mainstreamed. The grading and advancement system is crucial in determining educational benefit. The Supreme Court established the standard for education under IDEA in the 1982 case Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley. FAPE is achieved through personalized instruction and support services that meet state standards and the child's IEP. The states are not required to \"maximize\" each child's potential, but must ensure progress and measurable gains. Courts must avoid imposing their view of educational methods on states, leaving the responsibility to state and local educational agencies. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits presents a challenge. The Court did not establish a specific test for determining educational benefits under IDEA in the Rowley case. Lower courts have varied in their interpretations of Rowley, with some requiring more than minimal educational benefit in IEPs. For example, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that an IEP must provide more than de minimis educational benefit. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to provide more than minimal educational benefit. The IEP must include present levels of academic achievement, annual goals, special education services, and integration with non-disabled children. Compliance with IDEA procedures and educational benefits are key factors in judicial decisions regarding IEPs. The court determines compliance with IDEA procedures and the adequacy of the IEP in providing educational benefits, including related services like transportation, speech-language pathology, and counseling. FAPE, a cornerstone of IDEA, requires special education and related services to enable a child with a disability to receive a free appropriate public education. The Supreme Court decisions under IDEA have involved related services, specifically the provision of medical services for diagnostic and evaluation purposes. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Court ruled that services addressing both medical and educational needs must be provided under IDEA for children with disabilities. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Supreme Court ruled that under IDEA, services must be provided if the child has a disability requiring special education, the service is necessary for the child to benefit from special education, and a non-physician can provide the service. The decision set a precedent for the provision of medical services in schools, leading to further court cases like Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F. involving a ventilator-dependent child paralyzed from the neck down. The Court rejected the school's proposed test for related services for a ventilator-dependent child, stating that the medical services exclusion from IDEA was limited to services provided by a physician or hospital. The 2004 reauthorization addressed this issue by establishing risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. States can reserve a portion of funds for these children. IDEA allows states to reserve funds to establish risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. Courts use a two-pronged approach to determine if an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment. The court uses a two-pronged approach to determine if an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment, considering factors like accommodation efforts, educational benefits, and potential negative effects on other students. In a case example, the Third Circuit examined the disruptive behaviors of a student with disabilities in a regular classroom setting. The court upheld the decision that a student with disabilities could not be educated full time in a regular classroom due to disruptive behaviors. Issues regarding services and funding for children with disabilities in private schools under IDEA have been controversial. The cost of private school placement is covered by the local or state educational agency if initiated by them, but not if initiated unilaterally by parents. The cost of private school placement is not covered by the LEA unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court under IDEA. Reimbursement may be required if a child with a disability is unilaterally placed in a private school by parents without consent or referral from the public agency. IDEA does require some services for children in private schools, even if parents place them there, and there is no finding that FAPE was not available. Under IDEA, a proportionate amount of federal funds must be made available if FAPE was not provided to the child. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed tuition reimbursement for parents who place their child in a private school without public school special education services. The appeals court ruled that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. This decision was not a precedent for lower courts, and the issue was later settled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. The Supreme Court held that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special education services when a public school fails to provide FAPE, regardless of whether the child previously received services from the public school. The IDEA was enacted to address situations where children with disabilities were excluded from school without recourse. It provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents, ensuring that disputes are resolved without disrupting the child's current educational placement. These safeguards protect the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Section 615 of the IDEA addresses the rights of children with disabilities, including FAPE, notice of rights, mediation, resolution sessions, and due process procedures. Amendments have been made to balance these rights with safety concerns and make the process less adversarial. Judicial decisions have clarified issues like burden of proof in due process hearings and recoverable expert witness fees. Parents or schools can file a due process complaint within two years of the violation. The IDEA includes a statute of limitations for filing complaints, with exceptions for state laws and situations where parents were misled by the school. A resolution session is required before a due process hearing to address issues in a less confrontational manner. The resolution session under IDEA involves key members of the IEP team and a representative from the local educational agency with decision-making authority. It aims to improve communication between parents and school officials to resolve disputes promptly. Mediation is available but cannot delay a parent's right to a due process hearing, and discussions are confidential and not admissible as evidence. Courts generally uphold mediation agreements in special education disputes. If mediation fails, a due process hearing can be held with the right to counsel, evidence presentation, and appeal. IDEA allows disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, but they differ from those for children without disabilities. IDEA requires that children with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education and stay in their current placement during due process. School personnel can suspend a child with a disability for up to 10 days. Safeguards are in place for changing a child's placement without parental consent, including a manifestation determination within 10 school days. If a child's conduct is related to their disability or a result of the school's failure to implement the IEP, it is considered a manifestation of the disability. In such cases, a functional behavioral assessment will be conducted. School personnel can place the child in an interim alternative education setting for up to 45 days for serious situations. If the behavior is not related to the disability, disciplinary procedures for children without disabilities may be applied, but educational services must continue. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) allows school personnel to request a hearing officer to change the placement of a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting for 45 school days in cases involving weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief, as determined by the Supreme Court in Schaffer v. Weast. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing rests with the party seeking relief, as determined by the Supreme Court. Justice O'Connor rejected arguments that the burden should be on the school system, stating that schools are obligated to safeguard parents' procedural rights and share information. The Supreme Court ruled in Winkelman v. Parma City School District that IDEA allows parents, even those who are not attorneys, to bring pro se suits in court to protect the rights of children with disabilities. IDEA ensures that schools must share information with parents and uphold their procedural rights, including the right to review records, have an independent evaluation, and receive attorneys' fees if they prevail. The Supreme Court ruled in Winkelman v. Parma City School District that IDEA allows parents to bring pro se suits in court to protect the rights of children with disabilities. Justice Kennedy concluded that IDEA grants parents independent, enforceable rights encompassing a child's entitlement to education, not limited to procedural or reimbursement issues. The Court emphasized the importance of considering the entire statutory scheme of IDEA to ensure the rights of children with disabilities and parents are protected. IDEA provisions support parents' particular interest in their child's education. The IEP team must consider positive behavioral interventions for children with disabilities. IDEA does not specifically address the use of seclusion and restraints. The Department prohibits the use of mechanical restraints or aversive techniques for children with disabilities. State law may allow restraints if consistent with the child's IEP and positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not addressed seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, it ruled that suspensions longer than 10 days violate IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. Educators can use normal procedures to address behavior issues. Representative Miller introduced legislation, H.R. 1381, to establish minimum safety standards in schools to prevent the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion. Prevailing parties used Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or Section 1988 of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act to seek fees under IDEA. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that the only remedies for prevailing parties under IDEA were those contained in that statute. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that the only remedies for prevailing parties under IDEA were those contained in that statute. Congress later enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to provide for attorneys' fees under IDEA, with amendments in 1997 allowing for fee reduction in certain circumstances. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization, P.L. 108-446, allowed attorneys' fees for the state or local educational agency against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The Fifth Circuit ruled that attorneys' fees for the LEA were permissible against a lawyer using stonewalling tactics. Prevailing parents may not be awarded expert witness fees under IDEA, but some lower courts have interpreted the language to allow for such awards. The Supreme Court in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts, despite some lower courts allowing such awards. The court's decision was guided by the fact that Congress enacted IDEA pursuant to the Spending clause. The Supreme Court in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts. The majority concluded that IDEA's statutory language did not provide clear notice for such awards. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 were introduced in Congress to amend IDEA to include expert witness fees."
