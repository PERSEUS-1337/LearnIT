    "content": "The \"Petroleum Marketing Practices Act Amendments of 1993\" allows for the conversion of leased marketing premises to company operation by the franchisor. Section 102(c)(4) of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act is amended to require franchisors to notify franchisees in writing about the duration of the underlying lease before the commencement of the franchise term. Additionally, franchisors must offer franchisees the option to extend the lease or purchase the marketing premises within 90 days of notification. The franchisor may condition the assignment of the marketing premises upon receiving an unconditional release from the landowner and franchisee, releasing the franchisor from liability for financial obligations, environmental contamination, and the operation or condition of the premises. The franchisor may require an instrument ensuring access to the marketing premises for environmental testing and remediation by the franchisor and its contractors when the franchisee acquires possession immediately after the loss of the franchisor's right to grant possession. During the 90-day period after notification, the franchisor must offer to sell, transfer, or assign improvements or equipment on the premises to the franchisee, or provide a right of first refusal if another person offers to purchase them. The franchisor must offer to sell improvements or equipment to the franchisee or provide a right of first refusal if another person wants to purchase them. SEC. 4. WAIVER OF RIGHTS. Franchisors cannot require franchisees to waive any rights under federal or state law as a condition of the franchise relationship. No provision in a franchise agreement can enforce laws of a state other than where the franchisee's business is located. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION. Section 106 of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act is amended to clarify that states or political subdivisions have the ability to regulate specific provisions of a franchise. Additionally, no state or political subdivision can require payment for the goodwill of a franchisee upon termination or nonrenewal of a franchise relationship. The amendment allows states to regulate franchise transfers upon the death of a franchisee. The amendment to the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act expands the definition of failure to include any violation of state law or unenforceable franchise provisions."
