    "content": "The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 2001\" denies federal public benefits to Nazi persecutors. The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 2001\" prohibits individuals determined to have participated in Nazi persecution from receiving Federal public benefits. The Act defines \"Federal public benefit\" and \"participant in Nazi persecution\" to clarify its scope. The \"Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 2001\" prohibits aliens or citizens who have committed specified acts from receiving Federal public benefits. The term \"respondent\" refers to individuals identified by the Attorney General. The Attorney General is offering a hearing on the record to an individual under section 3(a). SEC. 3. DETERMINATIONS. If the Attorney General suspects an individual receiving a Federal public benefit may have been involved in Nazi persecution, a hearing may be held before an immigration judge. Respondents, including U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, and those present in the United States, have the right to appear at the hearing. Respondents who are not citizens, permanent resident aliens, or present in the United States when the proceeding is initiated may appear by video conference. The Act does not allow the return of individuals inadmissible under a specific section of the Immigration and Nationality Act. At the hearing, respondents can have legal representation at no cost, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and request subpoenas. The immigration judge can examine witnesses, issue subpoenas, and apply rules of evidence similar to a removal proceeding. Within 60 days of the hearing, the judge must make findings on whether the respondent participated in Nazi persecution. The immigration judge can issue an order declaring a respondent ineligible for Federal public benefits if they find by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent participated in Nazi persecution. If there is insufficient evidence, no such order will be issued. If a judge finds insufficient evidence for a finding of Nazi persecution participation, the immigration judge will dismiss the proceeding. An order issued under this finding is effective immediately, and liability is not established until the person or entity receives notice of the order. The Attorney General may review any finding or order issued under subsection (c) within 30 days. If no review is done, the finding or order becomes final. The Attorney General will serve the final order, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, on the respondent. Judicial Review: A party aggrieved by a final order issued under this section can seek review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within 30 days of the order being issued. SEC. 4. Jurisdiction of United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over appeals under the Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 2001."
