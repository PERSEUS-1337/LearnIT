HHS is organized into 11 main agencies, including staff divisions within the Office of the Secretary. Eight of these agencies are part of the U.S. Public Health Service, each with diverse missions supporting public health. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) consists of 11 main agencies, including the U.S. Public Health Service divisions. These agencies provide health care services, support medical research, prevent diseases, regulate food and drugs, and administer programs for vulnerable populations. The HHS budget request for FY2018 was influenced by a presidential transition. The FY2018 HHS budget request was delayed due to the presidential transition from Obama to Trump. Final FY2017 appropriations were not enacted until May 5, 2017, leading to unknown funding levels during the formulation of the FY2018 budget proposal. The HHS budget displays FY2017 estimates derived from two sources. The FY2018 HHS budget request was based on estimates from the FY2017 CR, with an estimated $1.131 trillion in outlays for FY2018, a slight increase from FY2017. These estimates should not be considered final or enacted levels for comparison to prior years or the FY2018 proposal. The FY2018 HHS budget request is estimated at $1.131 trillion, with HHS accounting for over a quarter of federal outlays. Mandatory spending, mainly from Medicare and Medicaid, makes up 88% of HHS spending, while discretionary spending only accounts for about 7%. The FY2018 HHS budget request is $1.131 trillion, with HHS receiving more discretionary money than most federal departments. The President's request allocates 56% to the Department of Defense, 7% to the Department of Veterans Affairs, nearly 6% to HHS, and 5% to the Department of Education. The HHS budget includes a broader set of resources than annual appropriations. The FY2018 HHS budget request of $1.131 trillion includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Mandatory spending is provided directly by authorizing laws, while discretionary spending is controlled through annual appropriations. Some mandatory programs like Medicaid require appropriations despite being controlled by authorizing statutes. The HHS budget request includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with funding divided across three appropriations bills. Certain HHS agencies and activities are funded through different bills. Administration estimates for HHS programs may differ from congressional scorekeepers. The HHS budget materials may have different estimates for mandatory spending programs in FY2018, including proposed law and current law estimates. Proposed law estimates consider changes in mandatory spending proposed in the budget request, while current law estimates assume no policy changes. The HHS budget estimates in this report reflect proposed law estimates for mandatory spending programs, but other estimates may reflect current law. Discretionary spending in appropriations bills may not cover all available budgetary resources due to agencies having authority to use user fees and other collections. Agencies may also receive transfers from sources like the PHS Tap or ACA trust funds. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established trust funds for budgetary totals at the \"program level\" in HHS agencies. The FY2018 Budget in Brief lists program levels for each agency, including FDA and AHRQ.
