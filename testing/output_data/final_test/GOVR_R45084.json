    "content": "In 2017, the United States experienced 16 separate billion-dollar disaster events, totaling over $300 billion in damages, setting a new annual record. This surpassed the previous record set in 2005 due to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. In December 2017, the 2017 hurricane season was the seventh most active on record in the Atlantic Basin, with four named storms making landfall on U.S. soil, causing billions of dollars in damage. Concurrently, deadly wildfires ravaged California. Hurricane Harvey struck Texas as a Category 3 hurricane, causing catastrophic flooding. Hurricane Irma, the strongest hurricane ever observed in the open Atlantic Ocean, made landfall near Cameron, LA on August 30. It passed north of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on September 6, causing significant damage. Irma then made landfall on Cudjoe Key and Marco Island as a Category 4 and Category 3 storm, respectively. Hurricane Irma made landfall on Cudjoe Key as a Category 4 storm and then on Marco Island as a Category 3 storm. It moved up the west coast of Florida, delivering heavy rains, strong winds, and storm surge flooding. Hurricane Maria intensified to a Category 5 storm, hitting the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico as a strong Category 4 storm. In 2017, California faced 42 separate wildfire incidents, burning over 700,000 acres and damaging or destroying more than 9,000 structures. The Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties became the largest wildfire on record in the state, destroying over 1,000 structures. Congress passed three supplemental appropriations bills in response to these incidents. In September, October, and November 2017, the Trump Administration requested $7.85 billion in supplemental funding for disaster relief. The House and Senate passed a relief package that included additional funding for disaster relief and a short-term increase to the debt limit. The Trump Administration requested additional funding for disaster relief in September, October, and November 2017. The House passed a bill with $18.67 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, allowing some funding to be transferred to other programs. The Trump Administration requested additional funding for disaster relief in September, October, and November 2017. The House passed a bill with $18.67 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, allowing some funding to be transferred to other programs. Subsequently, a third supplemental appropriations request was made for disaster relief and recovery funding, seeking roughly $44.0 billion in additional funding. H.R. 4667 was introduced on December 18, 2017, with roughly $81 billion in additional funding, as well as provisions for disaster recovery reform, agriculture assistance, and nutrition assistance. On December 21, 2017, H.R. 4667 passed the House with additional disaster-related tax provisions and designated low-income communities in Puerto Rico as opportunity zones. The bill then moved to the Senate. On February 7, 2018, the Senate introduced S.Amdt. 1930, which included over $84 billion in disaster assistance funding. The amendment was approved on February 9, 2018, and the bill was signed into law by President Trump. The House passed H.R. 4667 with disaster-related tax provisions and designated low-income communities in Puerto Rico as opportunity zones. President Trump signed it into law as P.L. 115-123. Table 1 shows supplemental appropriations requested and enacted for 2017 storms and fires. The table details funds by appropriations subcommittee and includes transfers and tasking of funds outlined in public laws. The congressional role in providing disaster relief funds is highlighted. The congressional role in providing disaster relief funds involves exercising \"the power of the purse\" to assist state and local governments overwhelmed by disaster response needs, fund relief for individuals and businesses, and repair federal facilities. Congress debates issues such as exemptions from budget limits for disaster relief investments and the timing of funding availability. Questions arise on ensuring proper spending of relief funds. Recovery funding is available with exemptions to discretionary spending limits for emergencies, outlined in federal budget control laws since 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 placed limits on discretionary spending but provided exceptions for various purposes, including emergency requirements. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established adjustments to discretionary spending limits for emergency requirements, including disaster relief funding under the Stafford Act. This allowed for funding adjustments beyond the normal spending caps for designated emergency needs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for adjustments to discretionary spending limits for emergency requirements, including disaster relief funding under the Stafford Act. The adjustment for disaster relief is based on a 10-year rolling average of federal spending on relief efforts for major disasters. When Congress provides more funding for disaster relief than the adjustment allows, the emergency designation may be used. All funding in enacted supplemental appropriations carries the emergency designation, not disaster relief designation under the BCA. Periodically, Congress considers offsetting disaster relief costs with cuts to other spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 allows for adjustments to discretionary spending limits for emergency requirements, including disaster relief funding under the Stafford Act. Congress may consider offsetting disaster relief costs with cuts to other spending, but historically FEMA's DRF has been given priority funding without offsets. In rare cases, disaster assistance from other agencies has been funded by shifting resources through appropriations legislation, such as after Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Sandy relief efforts also raised questions about offsets for funding. The Obama Administration requested $60.4 billion in supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, including $11.5 billion for the DRF. Amendments to offset the cost of the legislation were considered but did not become law. A point of order was raised during Senate debate against the emergency designation for $3.4 billion in Army Corps of Engineers Construction appropriation for disaster mitigation projects, eliminating the emergency designation. This meant the $3.4 billion would count against discretionary spending limits imposed by the BCA. The Trump Administration's supplemental appropriations requests sought emergency designation for funding, with the November 2017 request including offsets for additional spending. This move was seen as setting a precedent for requiring offsets for disaster assistance and including costs of disaster preparedness in the discretionary budget. The House did not include proposed rescissions and spending cuts in response to the Administration's FY2018 budget request in H.R. 4667. No offsets were included in the three supplemental appropriations measures discussed. Regular appropriations focus on entity funding, purpose, and amount, determined by subcommittee drafting. Supplemental appropriations jurisdiction differs from regular appropriations. Supplemental appropriations, particularly for disaster relief, are typically overseen by the full Appropriations Committee rather than individual subcommittees. The size and scope of these measures are driven by specific events, unfunded needs, and political support. Disaster relief appropriations can be triggered by a single catastrophic event, a series of events, or a combination of both. Supplemental appropriations bills, including those for disaster relief, are usually overseen by the full Appropriations Committee. These bills can be triggered by a single event, a series of events, or a combination of both. The focus of supplemental appropriations bills is not typically limited to a single event, and controlling language is sometimes included to clarify specific appropriations. Examples include the 2013 Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriations act (P.L. 113-2) and the 2017 disaster supplementals. The 2013 Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriations act (P.L. 113-2) provided funding for disaster relief and long-term recovery from major disasters that occurred from 2011 to 2013. It included appropriations for various programs, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund and the DRF, without specific language limiting their use. Other appropriations in the act aimed at mitigating future disaster risks and improving severe weather monitoring and forecasting. The 2013 Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriations act (P.L. 113-2) provided funding for disaster relief and long-term recovery from major disasters that occurred from 2011 to 2013, including appropriations for various programs like the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Fund and the DRF. In contrast, the P.L. 115-56 supplemental appropriations bill for disasters in 2017 included controlling language specifying funding for disaster relief, long-term recovery, infrastructure restoration, and economic revitalization in the most impacted areas. The second supplemental appropriations measure in P.L. 115-72 provided funding for the DRF, debt forgiveness for the National Flood Insurance Program, and appropriations for wildfire suppression costs. The third appropriations measure addressed relief programs, storm operations, damage costs, and specific concerns post-disasters, with controlling language included. The second supplemental appropriations measure in P.L. 115-72 provided funding for the DRF, debt forgiveness for the National Flood Insurance Program, and appropriations for wildfire suppression costs. The third appropriations measure included controlling language targeting various subsets of disaster-related needs across the United States, such as natural disasters in 2017, damage reduction in flood and storm damage, hurricanes, and oversight of funds. The language in appropriations measures does not specify funding amounts for individual jurisdictions or incidents, allowing flexibility for resources to be directed as needed. This approach contrasts with accounts like the SBA disaster Loan Program Account and FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which have specific controlling language. FEMA's DRF regularly receives appropriations for relief efforts from multiple disasters. FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) receives appropriations for relief efforts from various disasters across fiscal years. Prior to P.L. 113-2, nearly $3.4 billion was obligated for Hurricane Sandy-related declarations. By the end of 2017, double the amount from the \"Sandy Supplemental\" had been obligated for disaster declarations. Recent supplemental appropriations for the DRF will also be used for declared and upcoming disasters, with varying timelines for funding utilization. Understanding these differences is crucial for assessing program efficiency. Efforts to assess program efficiency require understanding differences in mission and program structure. Costs within the DRF are incurred upfront for emergency measures and individual assistance, while other costs are reimbursed after completion. Some projects, like infrastructure restoration, may take longer to utilize funding. Redevelopment funds may also require time for state and local governments to develop and approve plans before funds are provided. The 2017 disaster supplemental appropriations include $71 million for audits and oversight efforts, with $14 million allocated to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The federal government faces challenges in tracking disaster relief spending, but a new directive from OMB aims to improve information availability. In September 2016, GAO released a report on disaster assistance provided by the federal government over a 10-year period. GAO analysts attempted to survey disaster relief provided by 17 federal departments and agencies, identifying over $277 billion in obligations for disaster relief. However, obligations were not separately tracked for all disaster-applicable programs and activities. At least 5 federal departments and agencies reported that some disaster assistance programs or activities are not separately tracked due to funding being subsumed by general operating budgets or mission-related costs. For example, U.S. Coast Guard officials stated that most of the agency's disaster-related costs are associated with maintaining readiness to respond to disasters and emergencies. The U.S. Coast Guard and Army maintain readiness for disaster response, with costs not separately tracked. Some federal departments do not track disaster assistance expenditures, making it difficult to estimate funding usage for disasters. One way to obtain a clearer picture of federal spending on disaster relief is to implement consistent reporting requirements on agencies providing assistance. This could include pass-through requirements to state and local governments to provide contract and subcontract data. However, this information alone cannot determine if funds are being wasted, abused, or subject to fraud. Detailed analysis of individual programs and activities is necessary to answer these questions. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum to federal agencies on new requirements for tracking emergency and disaster relief funding. Agencies must apply a special accounting code to resources from the 2017 disaster supplemental appropriations. This initiative aims to support congressional oversight efforts, similar to the post-Hurricane Sandy tracking by the Recovery and Transparency Board (RATB). The Recovery and Transparency Board (RATB) was established to track funding under the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The RATB's authority lapsed in FY2015, and it shut down. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) established a Program Management Office (PMO) in 2013 to monitor Hurricane Sandy Recovery funding flows, coordinating with the RATB. HUD provided public information on funding status. The responsibilities of the HUD Sandy PMO were transferred to FEMA's Office of Federal Disaster Coordination (OFDC) in November 2014. The data gathered by the RATB and PMO may be limited due to inconsistent reporting methodologies by different agencies. FEMA's data on Hurricane Sandy obligations include both previous appropriations and those from P.L. 113-2, making it difficult to compare with other agencies. In the aftermath of the 2017 hurricane season, appropriations and legislative provisions from supplemental bills are listed by the appropriations subcommittee for scoring by CBO."
