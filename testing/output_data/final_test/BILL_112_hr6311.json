    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Overdose Stat Act\" or the \"S.O.S Act\". The Congress finds that drug overdose fatalities in the United States have surpassed traffic fatalities, with a death occurring every 14 minutes. In 2008, nearly 36,500 people died from drug overdoses, with over 75 percent being unintentional. Deaths from unintentional drug overdoses have increased significantly over the years, with 91 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths attributed to drugs. In 2005, drug poisoning deaths cost society $93,464,000 in medical costs and $28,142,598,000 in lost productivity. Opioid pain medications are involved in over 40% of drug poisoning deaths, with methadone overdoses increasing significantly. Naloxone can reverse opioid overdoses. The FDA took action in April 2012. In April 2012, the FDA, along with NIDA, CDC, SAMHSA, and ONDCP, discussed expanding naloxone availability to prevent opioid overdose deaths. Health practitioners need to better educate patients on recognizing overdose symptoms and administering naloxone to save lives. The AMA supports these efforts. The American Medical Association (AMA) supports community-based programs offering naloxone and opioid overdose prevention services. These programs have saved over 10,000 lives since 1996, with 188 local programs in the US. In New Mexico, a naloxone distribution program has reversed 3,000 overdoses, while a program in North Carolina reduced overdose deaths by 69%. Overdose prevention programs are needed in various settings, and a real-time overdose surveillance database is necessary for monitoring and evaluating interventions. The Overdose Prevention Grant Program is established. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will award grants to eligible entities to reduce drug overdose deaths. Eligible entities must submit an application detailing the activities to be funded and demonstrating capacity to carry them out. Priority will be given in awarding grants and cooperative agreements. Priority will be given to public health agencies or community-based organizations with expertise in preventing drug overdose deaths in high-risk populations. Eligible entities must agree to use the grant for activities such as distributing naloxone, educating healthcare professionals, and training first responders and law enforcement. Implementing programs for overdose prevention, treatment, and response is a key focus. Eligible entities must report on grant activities, and funding is authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. SEC. 4. SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles annual data on fatal and nonfatal drug overdoses, collected from various sources including county, State, tribal, and private entities. The data is published in an accessible Internet database and includes details on underlying drugs, substance levels, polydrug use trends, toxicology screenings, and emerging overdose patterns. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles annual data on fatal and nonfatal drug overdoses from various sources. State medical examiners conduct routine analysis to identify drugs involved in unintentional poisonings, the number and percentage of poisonings by drug, and the demographics of victims. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. SEC. 5. SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY BUILDING. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will award grants to improve drug overdose surveillance by enhancing toxicological screenings, providing training for coroners, and establishing a national program for reporting. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will award grants to improve drug overdose surveillance by establishing a national program for reporting fatal and nonfatal drug overdose occurrences to an electronic database. States, local, tribal governments, or the National Poison Data System can apply for grants by submitting an application with a description of the funded activities. The grant or cooperative agreement must include a description of funded activities and a demonstration of capacity. Recipients must submit a report on the results within 90 days of the agreement period. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. SEC. 6. REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a plan to reduce drug overdose deaths, including identifying barriers to data accuracy, implementing prevention strategies, educating about naloxone, and improving prevention programs. In this section, the term \"stakeholder\" includes individuals impacted by drug overdose, service providers, advocates, and various organizations with expertise in drug overdose. The Director will provide recommendations for legislative or administrative action to address drug overdose prevention. SEC. 7. OVERDOSE PREVENTION RESEARCH. The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse prioritizes research on drug overdose prevention, including examining circumstances leading to overdose, evaluating intervention methods, and studying new prevention strategies. Research is also supported on developing naloxone dosage forms for laypersons and first responders to treat unintentional drug overdose prehospital. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the prehospital treatment of unintentional drug overdose by laypersons or first responders. Such sums are authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The term \"drug\" includes any controlled substance as defined in the Controlled Substances Act. An \"eligible entity\" is defined as a State, local, or tribal government, a correctional institution, a law enforcement agency, a community agency, a professional organization in the field of poison control and surveillance, or a private nonprofit organization. The National Poison Data System is operated by the American Association of Poison Control Centers in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for real-time reporting. The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States. \"Training\" refers to educational activities related to poison control and surveillance. The curr_chunk mentions volunteer trainings, awareness building exercises, outreach to at-risk individuals for drug overdose, and distribution of educational materials."
