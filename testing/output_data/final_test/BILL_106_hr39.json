    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". It includes findings related to bird conservation. The Congress finds that neotropical migratory bird populations are declining, endangering various species. 90 North American bird species are endangered or threatened, and the US has responsibility for maintaining healthy populations of migratory birds through treaties. The Government of Mexico lists around 390 bird species as endangered, threatened, vulnerable, or rare. Healthy bird populations offer economic benefits by controlling harmful insects on crops, preventing significant financial losses. Conservation of neotropical migratory birds, which travel across borders, requires safeguards at migration routes and stopover areas. Due to significant challenges, resources for conservation efforts are crucial. To address the continued loss of habitat and declining populations of neotropical migratory birds, a Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation fund is proposed. This fund would support projects aimed at protecting critical habitat through joint efforts of nations and the private sector. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and foster international cooperation for these initiatives. The Act defines key terms such as \"Account\" as the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account, \"conservation\" as methods to ensure species viability, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will establish a program to provide financial assistance for projects outside the US to promote neotropical migratory bird conservation. Project proposals can be submitted by various entities including individuals, government agencies, and international organizations. To be considered for financial assistance under the International Organizations Immunities Act, an applicant must submit a project proposal that includes the name of the project leader, a brief description of the project's goals and organization, qualifications of project staff, estimated funds and time needed, and sources of matching funds. The project should aim to enhance the conservation of neotropical migratory bird species in Latin America. The project proposal for financial assistance under the International Organizations Immunities Act must include details such as project leader's name, goals, organization, staff qualifications, funds needed, and sources of matching funds. It should focus on conserving neotropical migratory bird species in Latin America and meet specific criteria for implementation, public participation, consultation with wildlife authorities, sensitivity to local resources, promotion of sustainable programs, and any additional information required by the Secretary. The project proposal for financial assistance under the International Organizations Immunities Act must include details such as project leader's name, goals, organization, staff qualifications, funds needed, and sources of matching funds. The recipient of assistance must provide financial information to prove their ability to complete the project and submit periodic reports to the Secretary for evaluation. The Federal share of project costs should not exceed 33 percent, and the non-Federal share cannot come from any Federal grant program. The non-Federal share of project costs under the Federal grant program can be paid in cash or in kind. Financial assistance provided under this Act cannot be used to acquire land from unwilling sellers. SEC. 6. DUTIES OF THE SECRETARY. The Secretary will develop guidelines for project proposals, prioritize proposals addressing conservation needs, and implement the Act. SEC. 7. COOPERATION. The Secretary shall support and coordinate efforts to conserve neotropical migratory bird species by facilitating meetings, exchanging information, entering agreements with other agencies, and coordinating activities to enhance conservation. An advisory group will also be established. The Secretary may establish an advisory group consisting of individuals representing organizations involved in neotropical migratory bird conservation. The group will hold open meetings with public participation opportunities. The Secretary may establish an advisory group for neotropical migratory bird conservation, allowing public participation in open meetings. The group will provide an opportunity for individuals to present statements on agenda items, with timely notice and public availability of meeting minutes. The establishment and activities of the advisory group are exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress by October 1, 2002, detailing the results and effectiveness of the program under the Act, along with recommendations for improvement and whether the program should continue. Additionally, there is a provision for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account. Established in the Multinational Species Conservation Fund is the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account, funded by donations and appropriations. The Secretary can use the Account for program purposes without further appropriation, with a limit of 6% for administrative expenses. The Secretary can accept donations to fund the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account, with a limit of 6% for administrative expenses. Amounts received will be transferred to the Treasury for deposit into the Account. Authorization of Appropriations: $8,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002 for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account. Private property rights in the United States will not be restricted or taken under this Act."
