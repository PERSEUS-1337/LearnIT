    "content": "The Supreme Court of the United States issued six opinions on patent law during its October 2016 Term, addressing various issues like patent exhaustion, multicomponent products, and biosimilar patents. This increase in patent cases heard by the Court reflects a general rise in patent litigation, as observed by Judge Kathleen O'Malley of the Federal Circuit. Patent filings in district courts nearly doubled from 2010 to 2013. The increase in patent litigation may reflect a broader interest in patents generally, with an estimated 84% of the S&P 500 Market Value attributable to intangible assets in 2015. Patent law is more visible today than in the past, and understanding patent law and recent Supreme Court cases on patents may be of interest to Congress. The report provides an overview of patent law, discusses the Supreme Court's role in its development, and analyzes recent Court decisions. It also previews upcoming developments in patent law, including administrative proceedings and patent reform activities. The U.S. patent law regime is grounded in the Constitution, specifically Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, which grants Congress the power to promote innovation by granting inventors exclusive rights to their discoveries. The Patent Act of 1952 requires inventors to file a patent application with the PTO to obtain patent protection for any new and useful invention. A valid patent grants the holder the right to exclude others from using or selling the invention without permission. This right is enforceable under the Patent Act, which considers infringement as making, using, or selling the patented invention without authorization. The Patent Act requires inventors to file a patent application with the PTO to obtain patent protection. The application must include a written specification describing the invention in detail. The Patent Act requires a specification to meet the written description, enablement, and best mode requirements. It must also include claims that distinctly define the inventor's invention. Patent claims define the inventor's invention and distinguish it from prior art. Claims are legal documents that define the scope of protection afforded by the patent. In addition to meeting specification requirements, a patent application must be novel, useful, and nonobvious to be patentable. The patent application must be novel, useful, and nonobvious to be patentable. Inventions must be new and different compared to existing references, such as publications and other patents. Certain subject matter is ineligible for patent protection, including laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. The patent application must demonstrate novelty, usefulness, and nonobviousness to be granted a patent. It must show a significant benefit to the public and not be vague. A patent may be found invalid if the differences from prior art are obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the relevant field. During the term of a patent, infringement occurs if someone uses or sells the patented invention without permission. Patent holders need to enforce their rights through litigation in federal court. Accused infringers can defend against infringement claims by arguing noninfringement or lack of liability. The patent holder can defend against infringement claims by arguing noninfringement, patent invalidity, or unenforceability. The Supreme Court has defined remedies for infringement, including injunctions against further infringement. In eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., the Supreme Court clarified the four-factor test for issuing permanent injunctions in patent cases. The Patent Act allows for damages, including enhanced damages for willful infringement, and attorney fees in exceptional cases. In 2014, the Supreme Court clarified the definition of an \"exceptional case\" in patent law. Patent reform has been a recurring topic of interest for Congress, with key legislation such as the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984 amending patent and drug laws. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 amended patent and drug laws to facilitate the marketing of generic pharmaceuticals while incentivizing innovation by brand-name firms. It allowed generic manufacturers to obtain FDA approval for a patented drug by relying on existing safety and efficacy data, while providing the patent holder with regulatory exclusivity. In 2009, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act established procedures for biosimilar or interchangeable biologics. The Leahy-Smith America Invent Act (AIA) of 2011 made significant changes to patent law, including the \"first to file rule\" and assignee filing, bringing the US in line with other countries and promoting cross-border cooperation in the patent arena. The AIA of 2011 introduced assignee filing, allowing an inventor's employer to file patent applications. It also established post-grant review, inter partes review, and supplemental examination for challenging patent validity. The AIA of 2011 introduced post-grant review, inter partes review, and supplemental examination for challenging patent validity. Additionally, there is a transitional program for covered business method patents that will only be available until September 2020. Future changes to patent law are possible, and federal court cases may impact provisions of the AIA. The PTO conducts administrative review proceedings, including those outlined in the AIA. Post-grant review and inter partes review are proceedings introduced by the AIA for challenging patent validity. These proceedings are popular alternatives to litigation and can result in the revocation of issued patents. The post-grant review allows challenges to a patent's validity within nine months of its issuance, with the PTAB conducting a trial and issuing a final decision that can be appealed to federal courts. The inter partes review allows any person, except the patent holder, to initiate a review process. An inter partes review, created by the AIA, allows challenges to a patent's validity based on prior art. Petitions can be filed at least nine months after a patent is issued or a post-grant review concludes. The review involves a trial-like procedure before a three-member panel, with witnesses, limited discovery, and a hearing. Reexaminations, predating the AIA, allow any person to challenge a patent's validity. Unlike post-grant review and inter partes review, reexaminations reopen prosecution on an ex parte basis. The Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. The Federal Circuit has jurisdiction over various appeals, including veterans' claims, government contracts, federal taxation, and claims under the Vaccines Act. It is unique in that it does not handle criminal or state-law issues, leading to a perception of being a separate entity from other courts. Despite being labeled a \"rogue\" court, its reversal rate by the Supreme Court is lower than five of its sister circuits. The Federal Circuit's jurisdiction includes various appeals, with a growing number coming from PTO proceedings since the enactment of the AIA in 2011. This trend highlights the importance of the PTO's administrative proceedings in the country's patent system. The relationship between the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit is under scrutiny, with some questioning the Supreme Court's understanding of patent law and others criticizing the Federal Circuit's approach. The Supreme Court has seen an increase in cases involving patent law and intellectual property over the past decade, indicating a heightened interest in this area. Judge Dyk's prediction of the Supreme Court hearing more cases from the Federal Circuit involving patent law has proven true. Statistics show that the Supreme Court has taken an average of four Federal Circuit cases each term, with a significant number involving substantive patent law. This increase has led to the Federal Circuit no longer being seen as the primary authority on patent cases. The Supreme Court's increased involvement in patent law has led to a shift in its role, with some debate on the extent of its influence. While Judge Dyk believes the Court's decisions have had a major impact on patent law, others argue that key doctrines have remained relatively static despite the increased number of Supreme Court opinions on patents. The increased number of Supreme Court opinions on patent law has revealed trends such as addressing legal issues present in federal litigation, harmonizing patent law with other areas of federal law, and utilizing doctrines from criminal law to articulate requirements for patent infringement. The Supreme Court's opinions on patent law have shown trends in addressing legal issues in federal litigation, harmonizing patent law with other federal laws, and using criminal law doctrines to define patent infringement requirements. In the October 2016 Term, the Court issued opinions affecting venue rules in patent cases, such as TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC. The Supreme Court's recent opinions on patent law have addressed venue rules in patent cases. In TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, the Court clarified that a domestic corporation 'resides' only in its State of incorporation for patent venue purposes. Additionally, in SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Products, LLC, the Court ruled that the equitable doctrine of laches does not apply in patent infringement cases filed within the statute of limitations under the Patent Act. The Federal Circuit has not amended the patent-specific venue statute since the 1957 Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp. decision. However, after Congress amended the general venue statute in 1988, the Federal Circuit held in 1990 that this change also affected the patent-specific statute. In Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., the Federal Circuit interpreted the general venue statute amendment to change the definition of \"resides\" in the patent-specific venue statute. The Federal Circuit has since ruled that venue in patent cases is proper wherever a defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction. Congress enacted the current general venue statute in 2011, maintaining the patent-specific statute unchanged. The statute states that a corporation \"shall be deemed to reside\" in any district where the defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction for the civil action. This amendment was considered in the TC Heartland case, reaffirming the VE Holding decision. In 2014, Kraft Foods sued TC Heartland for patent infringement in Delaware, despite TC Heartland not being registered to conduct business there. The district court dismissed TC Heartland's motion to dismiss or transfer venue, which was upheld by the Federal Circuit. The court reaffirmed its decision in TC Heartland and VE Holding, stating that the 2011 amendments did not warrant reconsideration. In a unanimous opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling in TC Heartland's petition for a writ of mandamus based on the Fourco case. The Supreme Court held that a domestic corporation \"resides\" only in its State of incorporation for patent venue purposes, as interpreted in Fourco. The practical effects of the Federal Circuit's ruling in VE Holdings were significant. The Federal Circuit's ruling in VE Holdings had a significant impact on patent venue. The Eastern District of Texas received 44% of all patent cases in 2015, with one judge handling two-thirds of the cases. This popularity was not due to geographical clustering of patent-intensive industries, but rather the district's patentee-friendly reputation. The Supreme Court's decision in TC Heartland had a significant impact on patent venue, leading to a decrease in patent complaints filed in the Eastern District of Texas. Calls for venue reform in patent cases came from various sources due to the district's patentee-friendly reputation. The issue has also been the subject of legislative proposals. The Supreme Court's TC Heartland decision led to a 43% decrease in patent complaints in the Eastern District of Texas compared to June 2017, and an 83% decrease compared to July 2016. The District Court for Delaware saw a significant increase in patent complaints, while the District Court for Central California experienced a more than a third increase. The long-term effects of TC Heartland, including potential geographic redistribution of patent cases and a decrease in cases filed by non-practicing entities, are still uncertain. Non-practicing entities purchase patents to generate capital by enforcing them. In 2015, 95% of patent cases filed in the Eastern District of Texas were by non-practicing entities. The unavailability of this venue for cases against corporations not incorporated there may discourage such filings. Another case addressed the relationship between laches and claims for damages within the statute of limitations. In SCA Hygiene v. First Quality, the Supreme Court ruled that laches cannot be used as a defense against damages for patent infringement within the statute of limitations. The case began in 2003 when SCA accused First Quality of infringing on their patents. First Quality informed SCA that one of its patents antedated SCA's patent, making SCA's patent invalid. SCA filed a patent infringement action against First Quality in August 2010. The Federal Circuit held that laches can defeat an infringement claim even within the statute of limitations, but the Supreme Court reversed this based on the Petrella case. The Supreme Court's decision in Petrella emphasized that when Congress enacts a statute of limitations, it directly addresses the issue of timeliness for claims. This reflects Congress's decision to rely on a set rule rather than case-specific judicial determinations like laches. Applying laches within a Congress-specified limitations period would exceed the Judiciary's power by overriding legislation. The High Court's ruling in SCA Hygiene extends the prohibition on using laches as an equitable defense in cases seeking damages. The Supreme Court's decision in SCA Hygiene extends the prohibition on using laches as an equitable defense in cases claiming damages, potentially impacting all statutes of limitations enacted by Congress. This could lead to patent holders delaying infringement cases to maximize damages, as noted by Justice Breyer. The Supreme Court's decision in SCA Hygiene highlights the impact of delaying infringement cases on damages. Justice Breyer notes the difference between patent and copyright laws in addressing such delays. This could affect future patent litigation tactics. Section 271(f)(1) of the Patent Act states that supplying components of a patented invention from the US to induce infringement outside the US makes one liable as an infringer. In Life Technologies v. Promega, the Supreme Court ruled that supplying a single component does not constitute a substantial portion under this provision. The case involved a patent for a genetic testing toolkit with five components. Promega sued Life Technologies for patent infringement, alleging that they violated the license agreement by selling genetic testing kits outside of permitted markets. Life Technologies supplied the Taq polymerase from the US to their UK facility, leading to liability under \u00a7 271(f)(1) of the Patent Act. The Federal Circuit held that a party may be liable under \u00a7 271(f)(1) for supplying a single component for combination outside the US. The court found LifeTech liable for infringement for shipping the Taq polymerase component to its UK facility. The Supreme Court disagreed, focusing on the interpretation of 'substantial portion' in the statute. The Supreme Court ruled that a single component does not constitute a 'substantial portion' under \u00a7 271(f)(1), excluding liability for supplying a single component of a multicomponent invention. This decision has implications for global supply chains and the presumption against extraterritoriality in U.S. patent laws. The Supreme Court's ruling on patent law excludes liability for supplying a single component of a multicomponent invention, impacting global supply chains and the presumption against extraterritoriality in U.S. patent laws. This case is of interest to manufacturers of multicomponent products like smartphones produced outside the United States. The Court interpreted the Patent Act to determine if the \"article of manufacture\" in a multicomponent product must always be the end product or if it can also be a component. This decision affects the calculation of damages under the Patent Act, as seen in Samsung Electronics v. Apple where the entire smartphone was considered the \"article of manufacture.\" The Supreme Court disagreed with the Federal Circuit's decision on calculating damages under \u00a7\u00a0289 in the Samsung Electronics v. Apple case involving design patents for the iPhone. Samsung's smartphones were found to infringe Apple's patents, leading to a $399 million damages award, representing Samsung's entire profit from the infringing smartphones. The Supreme Court's decision was based on its interpretation of the \"article of manufacture\" in multicomponent products. The Supreme Court upheld the decision on calculating damages under \u00a7\u00a0289 in the Samsung Electronics v. Apple case involving design patents for the iPhone. The Court interpreted the term \"article of manufacture\" broadly to include both end products sold to consumers and components of those products. The case was remanded to determine the relevant article of manufacture for each design patent infringed. This case is part of ongoing patent disputes between Apple and Samsung related to their smartphones. On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court invited the Solicitor General to file a brief on Samsung's petition to review a Federal Circuit decision in the Samsung Electronics v. Apple case. The case involves three Apple patents related to iPhone features. The Federal Circuit upheld a jury verdict finding Samsung infringed all three patents. If the Court grants certiorari, it could have significant implications. The Supreme Court may have major implications for the pharmaceutical industry. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is one of the largest sectors of the economy, allocating a significant portion of revenues to research and development activities. With a low success rate, getting a drug approved by the FDA is costly and time-consuming. The costly and time-consuming FDA approval process for pharmaceutical companies necessitates laws that balance innovation and competition in the industry. The Supreme Court's recent opinions at the intersection of patent and food and drug law raise issues of interest to Congress in maintaining this balance. The legal landscape for health innovators in the United States, particularly in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, has been shaped by recent Supreme Court decisions. These include Impression Products v. Lexmark on patent exhaustion and Sandoz v. Amgen on the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. These rulings have implications for competition and innovation in the biologic products market. The Hatch-Waxman Act, signed into law in 1984, encourages generic drug production by providing an abbreviated regulatory pathway for approval and resolving patent disputes. Manufacturers must obtain FDA approval through clinical studies before marketing new drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act, signed into law in 1984, created the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) pathway for generic drugs, allowing for market exclusivity periods without patent protection. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides market exclusivity for new drug entities and generic versions, including patent term restoration. The BPCIA was enacted in 2010 to balance innovation and affordability in healthcare. The BPCIA, enacted in 2010, aims to balance innovation and consumer interests by providing an abbreviated pathway for regulatory approval of biosimilars, which are lower-cost versions of biologics made from natural resources. To market a biologic, a sponsor must complete a biologics licensing application (BLA) with clinical data from costly multi-phase clinical trials. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for biosimilar approval, requiring clinical data to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilar applicants must show similarity to a reference product and rely on FDA's previous determination. The BPCIA also includes exclusivity periods of 4 and 12 years for reference products. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for biosimilar approval, with exclusivity periods of 4 and 12 years for reference products. The BPCIA also creates a process to speed up patent litigation while protecting innovator's patent rights. The Supreme Court decision in Impression Products v. Lexmark International clarified that a patentee's decision to sell a product exhausts all patent rights in that item, regardless of restrictions imposed. The Impression Products ruling clarified that the sale of a patented product exhausts all patent rights in that item. This has significant implications for industries like pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Patent law allows for private action against unauthorized use or sale of patented inventions, with a statutory means for compensation in cases of infringement by the federal government. The patent holder can seek compensation in the United States Court of Federal Claims for the use and manufacture of their patented products. They also have rights to license and sell their products with restrictions. However, the exhaustion doctrine limits the patent holder's control once a patented article is sold, allowing the purchaser to use or resell it freely. The patent exhaustion doctrine limits the patent holder's control once a patented article is sold, allowing the purchaser to use or resell it freely. The Supreme Court ruled that patent holders cannot place post-sale use and resale restrictions on domestic sales without implicating the doctrine of patent exhaustion. Impression Products overturned the Federal Circuit's precedent on patent infringement and rewards for international sales. The case involved Lexmark's restrictions on printer cartridge sales, where customers had to agree to use the cartridge once and return it for a discount. Impression Products, including Impression Products, were sued by Lexmark for patent infringement related to cartridges sold through the Return Program in the US and cartridges imported from overseas without authorization. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling on patent exhaustion, stating that once an item enters commerce, it should not be encumbered by legal restrictions as it moves through the marketplace. This decision applied to both domestic and international sales of cartridges, in a case involving Lexmark and Impression Products. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling on patent exhaustion, emphasizing the historic pedigree of exhaustion in copyright law. The Court harmonized patent law with other federal laws, criticizing the Federal Circuit's interpretation that exhaustion is not a requirement for patentees to hand over full rights with each sale. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling on patent exhaustion, stating that exhaustion limits the scope of a patentee's rights. The sale transfers the right to use, sell, or import because those rights come with ownership, extinguishing the patentee's exclusionary power. International patent exhaustion was also discussed by commentators. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit's ruling on patent exhaustion, stating that exhaustion limits the scope of a patentee's rights. Unlike copyright law, patent rights have a territorial requirement restricting their reach to the United States. The Court noted that applying patent exhaustion to foreign sales is just as important. The Supreme Court emphasized that patent exhaustion applies to foreign sales, limiting the scope of a patentee's monopoly. While patent law may not restrict sales, enforceable restrictions can still be upheld under contract law. In Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., the Court ruled that a patentee cannot bring an infringement suit if the products were sold under authorized sale. The Court emphasized that rights retained by Lexmark are determined by contracts with purchasers, not patent law. Additionally, the Court discussed how licensing patented products can affect the exhaustion doctrine, allowing patentees to impose restrictions on licensees without concerns about restraints on sale. The Court ruled in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. that a patentee cannot sue for infringement if products were sold under authorized sale. The patentee can impose restrictions on licensees without circumventing patent exhaustion, as long as the licensee complies with the license terms when selling the item. If the purchaser does not comply, the only recourse for the licensee is through contract law. Contract law offers less protection for patent holders compared to patent law. Once a patented item moves beyond the initial transaction, restrictions made under the original contract may not be enforceable against new purchasers. Damages under contract law are limited to covering losses incurred by the breach, unlike patent law which allows for enhanced damages. With patent infringement no longer an option for enforcing post-sale restrictions, many existing contracts may need to be renegotiated. Many existing contracts may need renegotiation as patent holders become more cautious in future agreements, especially with foreign parties. The Supreme Court's decision in Impression Products changed the landscape by enforcing patent exhaustion, limiting post-sale restrictions, and rejecting international patent exhaustion. This has led to heavy use of restrictions on domestic and international sales of patented products in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Supreme Court's Impression Products ruling on patent exhaustion could have significant implications for pharmaceutical and medical device companies. The industry argues that limiting patent rights could hinder innovation and impact public health. The ruling on international patent exhaustion is particularly important, as it may affect drug pricing in different countries due to varying patent rights and government regulations. The extension of patent exhaustion to foreign sales by Impression Products could lead to an increase in grey market sales of medicines sold at lower prices in foreign markets. This may disrupt the balance between innovation and patient access intended by Congress through statutory and regulatory mechanisms. U.S. patent law provides market exclusivity and protection from infringement, while FDA regulations offer additional exclusivities for innovative medical products. The FDA enforces restrictions on importing medical products to protect innovation. The law prohibits reimportation of drugs sold abroad, giving pharmaceutical companies more protection. This prevents large-scale parallel importation of drugs, limiting patient access to medications. The Supreme Court's decision scaling back a patentee's ability to enforce post-sale restrictions through patent infringement actions may have economic and public health implications for the medical device industry. Single-use devices (SUDs) are designed to be discarded after one use in one patient to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. Compromising the enforcement of restrictions on SUDs could pose public health risks as some devices are not designed for reuse and cannot withstand necessary resterilization procedures. The FDA regulates the reprocessing of medical devices, requiring manufacturers to test reusable devices and reprocessors of single-use devices to demonstrate safety and efficacy. This ensures that devices are safe for reuse and undergo necessary resterilization procedures. The FDA regulates the reprocessing of medical devices to ensure safety and efficacy. Manufacturers of single-use devices are not required to provide reprocessing instructions, leading to concerns about compliance with safety guidelines. The Supreme Court's decision on patent exhaustion may not render all single-use restrictions ineffective, as FDA still requires reprocessors to demonstrate safety. State laws could also deter reprocessors from ignoring single-use restrictions. Contract law can address violations of post-sale restrictions, but only between parties in privity with the agreement. The Supreme Court's reversal on patent exhaustion may impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, raising questions about innovation and competition. Contract law may not reach downstream sales where grey market transactions occur, and patent owners may lack privity to enforce post-sale restrictions on single-use devices. The Impression Products decision could spark legislative debate on balancing innovation and competition. The Supreme Court case Sandoz v. Amgen, issued on June 12, 2017, will impact competition in the pharmaceutical industry by interpreting key provisions in the BPCIA, which aims to balance innovation and consumer interests in the approval of biosimilar products. The BPCIA establishes a patent-dispute resolution regime allowing reference product owners to protect against potential infringements of patents before FDA approval, enabling preapproval infringement actions through the \"patent dance.\" This process, also known as \"artificial infringement,\" allows for litigation during the application process. The BPCIA establishes a patent-dispute resolution regime known as the \"patent dance,\" where an applicant and reference product sponsor exchange information on potential patent disputes before marketing the biosimilar. The Disclosure Requirement mandates the applicant to provide confidential access to its aBLA application and manufacturing information to the sponsor within 20 days of FDA acceptance. Within 60 days of disclosure, the sponsor must provide a list of patents for potential infringement claims. The BPCIA establishes a patent-dispute resolution regime called the \"patent dance,\" where the applicant and sponsor exchange information on potential patent disputes before marketing the biosimilar. The sponsor provides a list of patents for potential infringement claims, and the applicant can respond with reasons why it may not be liable for infringing those patents. The process includes the exchange of arguments concerning infringement, enforcement, and validity of each relevant patent. The BPCIA establishes a patent-dispute resolution regime called the \"patent dance,\" where the applicant and sponsor exchange information on potential patent disputes before marketing the biosimilar. The law requires the applicant to give notice of commercial marketing to the reference product sponsor at least 180 days prior to commercial marketing, allowing time for the sponsor to seek a preliminary injunction. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoz v. Amgen outlines a two-phased litigation process for patent disputes. The BPCIA establishes a \"patent dance\" for exchanging patent dispute information before marketing a biosimilar. Parties can litigate patents not addressed in the first phase upon commercial marketing notice. Failure to comply with the process can lead to declaratory actions for infringement. The BPCIA allows the applicant, not the sponsor, to bring a declaratory judgment action regarding any patent on the sponsor's section 262(l)(3) list. The Sandoz litigation stemmed from Sandoz's FDA approval for the biosimilar \"Zarxio,\" a version of the biologic filgrastim. Amgen, the producer of filgrastim under the brand \"Neupogen,\" sued for patent infringement under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(l)(9)(c) and sought an injunction to prevent Zarxio's market entry. Amgen tried to prevent Zarxio's market entry by alleging violations of the BPCIA, claiming Sandoz failed to comply with disclosure and negotiation procedures. The courts ruled that these procedures were optional, not mandatory, and an injunction was not available under federal law. The Federal Circuit ruled that the 180-day notice provision for biosimilar products must be given after FDA approval, potentially granting reference product sponsors an additional six months of market exclusivity. The Federal Circuit's interpretation of the 180-day notice provision for biosimilar products suggests that the requirement may be optional if the applicant fails to provide necessary information to the reference product sponsor. The Supreme Court addressed whether an applicant must give notice to the manufacturer after obtaining FDA approval for its biosimilar. The Supreme Court ruled that failure to disclose application and manufacturing information for a biosimilar does not constitute artificial infringement under the BPCIA. The Federal Circuit's interpretation of the 180-day notice provision was deemed incorrect by the Court. The Court clarified that failure to disclose application and manufacturing information for a biosimilar does not constitute artificial infringement under the BPCIA. The act of submitting the application, rather than a failure to disclose information, is what constitutes artificial infringement under section 271(e)(4). The Court clarified that failure to disclose application and manufacturing information for a biosimilar does not constitute artificial infringement under the BPCIA. The Court also noted that an injunction was unavailable under federal law to enforce the disclosure requirement, remanding the decision to determine if an injunction is available under California law. The biosimilar applicant must provide notice to the reference product sponsor at least 180 days before the date of first commercial marketing, not after FDA licensing. The Court clarified that the biosimilar applicant can provide notice either before or after receiving FDA approval, citing statutory context. The timing requirement is to give notice 180 days prior to marketing, with no requirement for notice after FDA licensing. The Supreme Court clarified timing requirements for biosimilar applicants, stating that notice must be given after FDA licensing and at least 180 days before marketing. This decision could make the \"patent dance\" optional, allowing applicants to skip the disclosure and negotiation process with the reference product sponsor before marketing. The Supreme Court's rejection of the Federal Circuit's interpretation of the BCPIA means no added exclusivity for sponsors. Legal and industry experts have raised concerns about the impact on notice, injunctive relief, and uncertainty for innovator and biosimilar companies. Justice Breyer's concurrence offers an alternative perspective. Justice Breyer's concurrence suggests that the FDA may have the authority to modify the interpretation of the BPCIA in the future. Congress could also amend the BPCIA if it disagrees with the Supreme Court's interpretation. Additionally, there are upcoming patent-related issues to be addressed by the Supreme Court, Congress, and the PTO. The Supreme Court is considering whether inter partes review violates the Constitution by extinguishing private property rights through a non-Article III forum without a jury. The Federal Circuit previously rejected a constitutional challenge to inter partes review proceedings in a written decision. The Federal Circuit rejected a constitutional challenge to inter partes review proceedings, stating that the patent right is created by federal law and Congress established the PTO with expertise in patent law to correct its own errors. The PTO has expertise in correcting its own errors in issuing patents. Congress can delegate this power to the PTO. Oil States argues that inter partes review transfers decision-making power to agency employees and violates the Seventh Amendment. The Supreme Court is set to decide whether inter partes review proceedings violate the Seventh Amendment by supplanting juries and judges. The outcome of this case is highly anticipated, with potential significant implications for patent law. If the Court determines that patents are private property rights, inter partes review proceedings could be deemed unconstitutional. If inter partes review proceedings are deemed unconstitutional, the fate of invalidated patents is uncertain. Over 1,300 patents have been invalidated in these proceedings since 2012, raising questions about their status. Additionally, patents invalidated through reexamination proceedings also face uncertainty. If the Supreme Court deems inter partes review proceedings unconstitutional, it could impact the constitutionality of other PTO revocation proceedings like reexamination and post-grant reviews. The potential elimination of PTO revocation proceedings may affect the caseload of federal courts, as thousands of petitions for inter partes review have been filed in recent years. This could lead to a tangible effect on federal court dockets. The Supreme Court is set to hear a patent case in October 2017 involving inter partes review proceedings. The case questions whether the PTAB must issue a final written decision on every claim challenged by the petitioner or only some of them. This could impact PTO revocation proceedings and federal court caseloads. The Supreme Court case in October 2017 questions if the PTAB must address all challenged patent claims. This could impact PTO workload management and patent reform concerns in Congress. In the 115th Congress, the STRONGER Patents Act of 2017 was introduced to address issues such as patent trolls, high costs of patent litigation, and strengthening the position of the United States as an innovator by amending title 35 to protect inventors' property rights. The bill contains provisions from previous acts and focuses on the PTO's post-grant proceedings. The STRONGER Patent Act of 2017 aims to address issues like patent trolls and high litigation costs by reforming post-grant proceedings at the PTO. It aligns patent claim construction standards with federal courts, requires clear and convincing evidence for patent invalidity findings, and limits petitioners to those with an adverse relationship to challenged patents. Additionally, it empowers the FTC to take enforcement actions against nonpracticing entities sending misleading patent demand letters. The STRONGER Patent Act of 2017 aims to address issues like patent trolls and high litigation costs by reforming post-grant proceedings at the PTO. It aligns patent claim construction standards with federal courts, requires clear and convincing evidence for patent invalidity findings, and limits petitioners to those with an adverse relationship to challenged patents. The bill may modify or overturn the holdings of at least five intellectual property-related Supreme Court cases from the past decade. The future of the Bill remains uncertain, as similar patent reform legislation introduced in prior Congresses did not lead to enactment. President Donald Trump initiated an investigation into China's intellectual property practices. President Trump initiated an investigation into China's intellectual property practices, including patent protection, under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The USTR is conducting the investigation and may take remedial trade actions if unfair practices are found, such as suspending trade agreement concessions or imposing duties."
