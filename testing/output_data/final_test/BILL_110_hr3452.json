    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new credit for holders of clean renewable water supply bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Taxpayers holding clean renewable water supply bonds can receive a credit against their tax. The credit amount is 25 percent of the annual credit for the bond, determined by the Secretary. The Secretary determines a credit rate for clean renewable water supply bonds daily based on a written contract for bond sale. The credit rate allows issuance of bonds without discount or interest cost to the issuer. The term 'credit allowance date' is defined in this section. The term 'credit allowance date' includes specific dates and the last day the bond is outstanding. A special rule applies for bonds issued or redeemed close to a credit allowance date, limiting the credit based on the amount of tax for the taxable year. The term 'clean renewable water supply bond' refers to a bond issued by a qualified issuer for capital expenditures on qualified projects. The term 'qualified project' includes qualified desalination, recycled water, and groundwater remediation facilities owned by a qualified borrower. A qualified project, owned by a qualified borrower, may be refinanced with proceeds of a clean renewable water supply bond if the original indebtedness was incurred after the enactment of this section. Additionally, a clean renewable water supply bond may be issued to reimburse a qualified borrower for expenses related to a qualified project, as long as certain conditions are met. The qualified borrower must declare intent to reimburse an expenditure with clean renewable water supply bond proceeds before payment, adopt an official intent within 60 days of payment, and make reimbursement within 18 months. Changes in use of bond proceeds are restricted for compliance. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for remedial actions to prevent bond failure if proceeds are not used for a qualified project. Projects must comply with environmental impact regulations to be considered qualified. The regulations under subsection (m) focus on minimizing the environmental impact of the project. Clean renewable water supply bonds have a maturity limit of 20 years. Gross income includes the credit allowed to the taxpayer under this section. An issue must spend at least 95 percent of the proceeds on qualified projects to meet the requirements. The clean renewable water supply bond requires at least 95% of proceeds to be spent on qualified projects within a 5-year period. A binding commitment to spend 10% of proceeds must be made within 6 months of issuance or loan to qualified borrowers. Projects must be completed on time. The clean renewable water supply bond requires 95% of proceeds to be spent on qualified projects within a 5-year period. The Secretary may extend the period if there is a reasonable cause for not meeting the requirement. If less than 95% of the proceeds are spent within the 5-year period, penalties may apply. The qualified issuer must redeem all nonqualified bonds within 90 days after the extended period. To be considered a clean renewable water supply bond, the issuer must satisfy arbitrage requirements with proceeds of the issue. The proceeds of an issue qualify for a temporary period of 5 years (or longer if approved by the Secretary). The credit allowed under subsection (a) is disregarded for computing the yield on the issue. Section 148(b)(3) does not apply, and the bonds are not treated as private activity bonds for rebate exceptions. For clean renewable water supply bonds, exceptions from rebate requirements apply to construction proceeds and small issuers. The credit allowed is disregarded for yield computation, and the bonds are not considered private activity bonds. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for section 148 requirements on rebate amounts for proceeds used for qualified projects. Definitions for this section are provided. Definitions for this section include terms such as 'bond', 'governmental body', 'local water company', 'pooled financing bond', and 'qualified borrower'. The term 'qualified desalination facility' refers to a facility that produces new water supplies by desalinating seawater, groundwater, or surface water with high chloride or total dissolved solids levels. The term 'qualified groundwater remediation facility' refers to a facility that reclaims contaminated groundwater for potable use. The term 'qualified recycled water facility' refers to a facility that reclaims wastewater from various sources for reuse, including wastewater from the general public, such as electric utility, industrial, agricultural, commercial, or residential users. The section outlines special rules for pooled financing bonds, regulations for clean renewable water supply bonds held by regulated investment companies, information reporting requirements, and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary. The section includes regulations for clean renewable water supply bonds to minimize environmental impact. Reporting requirements for interest payments are also amended to include amounts under section 54A(f). The Secretary may prescribe regulations for interest payments on clean renewable water supply bonds, excluding certain subparagraphs. The Secretary of Treasury will issue regulations for clean renewable water supply bonds within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. The amendments apply to bonds issued after the enactment date."
