The FMAP for a State in fiscal year 2007 may be maintained for the last two quarters of fiscal year 2008 if it is lower than the FMAP for fiscal year 2008. Similarly, the FMAP for a State in fiscal year 2008 can be maintained for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2009 if it is lower than the FMAP for fiscal year 2009. In fiscal year 2009, the FMAP shall be increased by 2.95 percentage points for specific quarters. Additionally, there will be an increase in the cap on Medicaid payments to territories for certain quarters in fiscal year 2008 and 2009. In fiscal year 2009, the FMAP for territories like Islands and American Samoa will increase by 5.90 percent under the Social Security Act. This increase applies only to title XIX of the Act and excludes certain payments like disproportionate share hospital payments and payments under other titles of the Act. States are eligible for this FMAP increase under specific conditions. States are eligible for an increase in FMAP or cap amount under specific conditions related to the eligibility criteria of their State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act. If a State has restricted eligibility after January 1, 2008, they can still qualify for the increase in FMAP or cap amount. In the first calendar quarter, a State can reinstate eligibility under specific conditions without affecting its flexibility in benefits offered under the State Medicaid program. Certain States may require political subdivisions to contribute towards the non-Federal share of expenditures under the State Medicaid plan. Under section 1902(a)(2) of the Social Security Act, States cannot require political subdivisions to pay a higher percentage of non-Federal Medicaid expenditures than what was required before March 31, 2008. The term \"FMAP\" refers to the Federal medical assistance percentage, and \"State\" is defined as per title XIX of the Social Security Act. This section is repealed as of October 1, 2009. Adjustment in computation of Medicaid FMAP to disregard an extraordinary employer pension contribution. For Medicaid FMAP computation, employer pension contributions are disregarded for State per capita income calculation but not for the continental US and Hawaii. Significantly disproportionate contributions are defined as employer funds towards pensions or insurance. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will adjust the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for states with significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contributions using personal income data. If the estimated increase in these funds exceeds 25% of the total personal income growth in a state, a special adjustment will be made for negative growth years. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will adjust the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for states based on employer pension and insurance fund contributions. The FMAP calculation cannot exceed 125% of the previous year's contribution. States will not have their FMAP reduced due to this adjustment. A report on the issues with current calculations and possible alternative methodologies will be submitted to Congress by May 15, 2008. The FMAP is defined as the Federal medical assistance percentage."
