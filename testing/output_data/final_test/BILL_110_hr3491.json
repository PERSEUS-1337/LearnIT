The assessment will be conducted within 18 months of the request and will include an inspection of the facility's design and construction. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will inspect the licensee's facility for design, construction, maintenance, and operational safety performance. The inspection will be comprehensive, similar to the 1996 assessment of the Maine Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, including an examination of reactor containment systems. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will inspect the licensee's facility for safety performance, including systems such as reactor emergency core cooling, control room ventilation, electrical, condensate and feedwater, spent fuel storage, and any other system requested by the Governor or public utility commission. The inspection team for an independent safety assessment conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must consist of at least 25 members, with 16 members being Commission employees and unaffiliated with the licensee's facility.

Within 90 days of completing the assessment, the team must prepare and make available a preliminary report with findings and recommendations for public review and comment. The inspection team must consider public comments when preparing the final version of the preliminary report. The final version must be submitted to the Commission within 90 days after the review period ends. This decision may impact licensing actions. The Commission must complete an independent safety assessment of a licensee's facility and the licensee must fully accept and implement all findings and recommendations before making decisions on extending a license or approving a power uprate. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for this purpose."
