    "content": "The \"Meat Safety and Accountability Act of 2010\" aims to protect consumers by ensuring the wholesomeness of meat products and identifying sources of contamination. Congress finds it crucial to safeguard consumer health by preventing adulteration and contamination in meat. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to define 'enteric foodborne pathogen' and 'establishment'. SEC. 4. PROTECTION AGAINST ADULTERATED AND CONTAMINATED MEAT OR MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS. Amends Section 8 to enhance protection against adulterated and contaminated meat products. The Secretary shall implement sampling protocols to trace potential adulteration and contamination of meat products by foodborne pathogens to determine the original source. Sampling protocols will include collecting relevant documentation. The collection of documentary and relevant material for rapid tracing of meat products includes establishment identification data, product description, shipping marks, bar coding, and origin disclosure. This collection must occur when samples are taken, and certification is required from the onsite inspector and establishment representative. The responsible establishment representative must certify the completeness and accuracy of collected tracing material for adulterated and contaminated meat products. If a sample tests positive, the Secretary will trace the source of contamination and conduct subsequent sampling if needed. If a sample tests positive for adulteration or contamination by enteric foodborne pathogens, subsequent sampling at the establishment and its suppliers is required for 15 consecutive days."
