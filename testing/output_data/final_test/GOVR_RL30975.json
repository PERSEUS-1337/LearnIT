    "content": "On October 19, 1999, Indonesia's parliament confirmed the results of the East Timor referendum for independence. Militia groups, supported by the Indonesian military, carried out violence against independence supporters, resulting in numerous casualties. International intervention led to the deployment of peacekeepers, with Australian-led forces entering East Timor on September 20, 1999. By the end of October, Indonesian forces had withdrawn, and a United Nations Transitional Authority was established in East Timor. The United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET) was established in October 1999 to assist in the transition to independence. UNTAET took over full administration of East Timor in March 2000, with tasks including security, law and order, civil administration, social services, humanitarian assistance, and reconstruction. By January 2001, UNTAET had military, police, and civilian personnel from 47 countries, including the United States. The recovery, reconstruction, and transition to independence for East Timor is divided into three phases. The first phase of emergency humanitarian assistance is almost complete, with the second phase involving power-sharing between UNTAET and the Timorese. The Transitional Cabinet, National Council, and public education for elections are key components of the third phase leading to East Timor's independence. The first step in the recovery and transition to independence for East Timor involves planning and public education for elections in 2001. An 88-member Constituent Assembly will be elected, with 13 districts each electing one representative and the remaining 75 members chosen by proportional representation. The Assembly will draft a constitution for an independent East Timor. U.N. officials initially aimed for independence by the end of 2001, but it may be postponed until an indigenous administration is fully functioning. Over 450,000 East Timorese were displaced after September 1999, with ongoing food distribution to those still in need. Food distribution to displaced East Timorese continues, with over 140,000 out of 240,000 having returned to East Timor. Around 93,000 East Timorese are in refugee camps in West Timor, with some controlled by militia groups. U.N. humanitarian activities were suspended in West Timor after three workers were killed in 2000. In West Timor, militia groups control refugee camps, hindering the return of East Timorese to East Timor. UNTAET reopened its office in Kupang in March 2001 to assess aid programs for refugees. Factors influencing future returns include militia intimidation and safety concerns for aid workers. East Timorese in West Timor consist of those wanting to return, Indonesian civil servants, and military members. A survey showed over 90% of refugees preferred to stay in Indonesia, but some believe the survey was conducted under duress. The status of displaced East Timorese in Indonesia in East Timor's forthcoming elections is uncertain due to militia control in refugee camps. U.S. humanitarian assistance has been provided to both refugees in West Timor and for reconstruction in East Timor. Total U.S. humanitarian assistance for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 was not provided for West Timor in FY2001 due to security and access issues. Destruction in East Timor was extensive, with significant damage to housing, public buildings, utilities, and schools. The majority of medical facilities ceased operations, and many professionals left the region. Economic reconstruction efforts in East Timor involve rebuilding infrastructure and addressing education and language barriers. The reconstruction efforts in East Timor include rebuilding schools, homes, medical facilities, and training a workforce. The country has hired over 6,000 civil servants, including teachers, but faces challenges in filling senior staff positions and training personnel. Progress has been made in developing a police force, establishing courts, and starting economic activities. Four courts have been established and staffed in East Timor. Economic activity is starting to pick up, mainly driven by U.N. and expatriate spending. Agriculture is recovering in some areas, with coffee exports expected to play a key role in the country's economic future. Oil drilling in the Timor Gap waters could provide a significant source of revenue. A revenue-sharing agreement with Australia gives East Timor 90 percent of future oil and gas revenues, estimated at over $4 billion over 20 years. Reconstruction efforts have been slow, especially in schools, but roads are being rebuilt on schedule. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, East Timor is still in the process of reconstruction and economic growth. Financing for international activities in East Timor is done through U.N. assessments and voluntary contributions from donor governments. Over $520 million was pledged at a donor conference in December 1999 for rebuilding East Timor, with funds provided as grants. The next donors' meeting is scheduled for June 2001. The next donors' meeting is scheduled for June 2001. Funds pledged in December 1999 include: The Consolidated Fund for Timor with over $32 million for 2000-2002, The Trust Fund for East Timor with pledges of $167.4 million for the same period, and the Interagency Appeal for East Timor Crisis providing humanitarian and development assistance. The 1999 UNOCHA appeal for $179.6 million has received $125.6 million in contributions. The East Timor National Council presented a budget of $123.9 million for 2000-2001, with $52 to $56 million from the Consolidated Fund for Timor. Bilateral donations totaled $95.7 million, and revenues from East Timor added an estimated $25 million. The USAID Office of Transition Initiative focused on community-based initiatives, media, civil society, judicial system establishment, civil servant training, local radio and television programming, soldier reintegration, and short-term employment programs during FY2000. In FY2000, USAID focused on judicial training programs and the recovery of rural coffee cooperatives in East Timor. The bilateral aid program in FY2001 is focusing on voter education and expanding local health clinics. The Department of Defense is providing training for the East Timorese defense force. The Bush Administration requested $10 million for bilateral assistance in FY2002, with Congress likely to approve $25 million as in previous years. After the withdrawal of the Indonesian military from East Timor in October 1999, East Timorese militia groups regrouped in West Timor. The militia groups, with a core strength of several hundred and a broader base of followers, reorganized and rearmed with aid from elements within the Indonesian military. By mid-2000, they were armed with standard TNI weapons and combat clothing. President Wahid ordered more troops to West Timor after U.N. workers were murdered by militia members in September 2000. The TNI dispatched 800 troops to West Timor to help control the situation, but it had little impact on militia activities. Militia groups infiltrated back into East Timor to challenge civil authorities after UNTAET ends. Ten well-armed militia groups had infiltrated, leading to clashes with peacekeepers patrolling the border. Accusations were made against the TNI by Australian and U.S. officials. Minister Alexander Downer and U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Robert Gelbard accused the TNI of supporting militia activities in East Timor. Gelbard warned of a potential guerrilla war. Militia leaders aimed to use refugees and armed infiltration as leverage for negotiating amnesty. A peacekeeping force of 8,000 troops, mainly Australians and New Zealanders, patrolled the border. Increased armed clashes occurred in the summer of 2000 due to aggressive patrolling. The Portuguese force in East Timor was criticized for not aggressively patrolling to locate infiltrators. U.N. officers believe more mobile equipment, like helicopters, is needed to address the issue. The continued presence of militia groups in West Timor could lead to a tense relationship between East Timor and Indonesia post-independence. Indonesia's diplomatic stance towards East Timor after independence remains unclear. Indonesia's diplomatic stance towards East Timor post-independence is uncertain, with key factors including the establishment of diplomatic relations and support for East Timor's international recognition. Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri's attitude is crucial, as she may assume control due to impeachment proceedings against President Wahid. Megawati's reluctance to meet East Timorese leaders and her opposition to the 1999 referendum on independence raise concerns. Calls for prosecution of militia leaders and Indonesian military officers involved in the violence in East Timor have been made by international observers. The U.N. Security Council could establish an international tribunal to try instigators of the violence in East Timor. A government commission recommended investigating 33 people for possible prosecution, including TNI commanders and militia leaders. General Wiranto, the TNI's commander-in-chief at the time, was fired from a cabinet-level position. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman set up an investigating team in response to the commission's findings, but the momentum of investigations slowed down as the military leadership reacted. In September 2000, the Attorney General's team named 22 individuals for possible prosecution in connection with atrocities in East Timor. However, as of April 2001, there have been no prosecutions, raising questions about the Attorney General's legal authority. The Indonesian government rejected a United Nations investigation on Indonesian soil and refused to extradite Eurico Guterres to East Timor. Less than a week after the naming of the 19, East Timorese militia members murdered three U.N. refugee aid workers in Atambua, West Timor. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling on Indonesia to disarm and disband militia groups. Eurico Guterres was arrested for obstructing disarmament efforts and sentenced to six months in prison. Six militia members were arrested in connection with the killings, with three confessing. Six militia members were arrested in connection with the killings, and three confessed. Prosecutors planned to charge them with manslaughter but reduced the charges to participating in \"mob violence.\" The Bush Administration and Congress face issues as East Timor prepares for independence, including the need for a U.N. presence post-independence. Sergio Vieira de Mello stated that peacekeepers and experts should remain until 2003. The U.S. has not submitted a recommended aid program to Congress but reportedly favors $10 million. The U.S. reportedly favors a $10 million program for East Timor's defense force, with Australia taking the lead in training and funding. Discussions are ongoing with the Bush Administration for U.S. support in training and arming the defense force post-independence. The goal is to have a military force of 1,500 personnel backed by 1,500 paramilitary personnel. The Australian-directed program aims to support East Timor's defense force post-independence. Observers suggest a larger force may be needed if Indonesia poses a military threat. U.S. policy faces challenges in influencing Indonesian policy towards East Timor. U.S. officials have criticized Indonesia and its military for supporting East Timorese militia groups. Warnings of potential international war crimes tribunal have been issued to Indonesia. The Clinton Administration suspended U.S. military contacts with and arms sales to the TNI in September 1999 due to violence in East Timor. William Cohen warned Indonesia that failure to disarm militia groups could jeopardize economic assistance. Restrictions on U.S. assistance to the TNI were enacted after the September 1999 violence. The Leahy amendment restricts funding for Indonesian military equipment purchases and participation in U.S. military training programs until Indonesia meets conditions related to human rights abuses in East Timor. Title X of H.R. 1646 authorizes State Department programs for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The bill \"East Timor Transition to Independence Act of 2001\" authorizes State Department programs for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. It outlines U.S. policy towards East Timor post-UN administration, including economic aid, diplomatic relations, and security assistance. It also addresses accountability of Indonesian military leaders for violence in East Timor in 1999. The bill \"East Timor Transition to Independence Act of 2001\" calls for U.S. support of United Nations efforts in East Timor, including the possible establishment of an international tribunal. It also includes provisions for aid from international financial institutions, Peace Corps programs, trade and investment promotion programs, and security assistance programs for East Timor. Title X authorizes $25 million for economic and democratic development in FY2002. Title X authorizes $25 million for economic and democratic development in FY2002, with congressional supporters aiming to prioritize U.S. policy towards East Timor post-independence. The earmark of $25 million may signal a push for the Bush Administration to not overlook East Timor amidst policy priorities in Indonesia. This reflects a pattern from the 1990s where Congress restricted relations with the Indonesian military to address human rights abuses in East Timor within overall U.S. policy towards Indonesia. The ability of U.S. policy to influence Indonesian behavior is limited by factors such as resistance from the TNI and the failure of the Wahid government to exert authority over the TNI in West Timor. China and possibly Russia may oppose any action by the Security Council to create an international tribunal for Indonesian military leaders. U.S. priorities towards Indonesia are strained by various issues including separatist insurgencies, ethnic and religious strife, and economic deterioration. Indonesia's mounting problems create a dilemma for the United States. Indonesia's mounting problems pose a dilemma for the United States in considering expanding Timor-related sanctions, as economic sanctions could worsen Indonesia's destabilization and potential disintegration."
