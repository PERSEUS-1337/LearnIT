In 2004, Congress funded a study by the National Academy of Public Administration to examine outsourcing and its economic effects, particularly on employment shifts. The report discusses outsourcing and off-shoring activities by multinational corporations, including foreign direct investment and non-equity modes of investment in global value chains. The data used in the report do not differentiate between outsourcing and off-shoring. The report discusses various forms of control in global value chains, such as partial ownership, joint ventures, contract manufacturing, and services outsourcing. These mechanisms allow firms to coordinate and control activities of partner firms without the need for full ownership. Evidence shows that these forms of control are prevalent in industries like automotive components, consumer electronics, garments, hotels, and information technology. NEM investments are estimated to have generated $2 trillion in sales in 2010 and can enhance the productive capacities of developing countries. Foreign direct investment is a major conduit for goods, capital, and technology flows between developed and developing economies. It is a much-needed source of funds for capital formation in developing countries, accounting for important shares of employment, sales, income, and R&D spending. By the end of 2011, U.S. firms had accumulated $4.1 trillion worth of direct investment abroad, compared to $2.6 trillion spent by foreign investors in the United States. Foreign direct investment flows have increased since 2003, with U.S. firms investing $4.1 trillion abroad compared to $2.6 trillion spent by foreign investors in the United States. In 2011, U.S. direct investment abroad rose by 27% over 2010, reaching $419 billion. However, in 2012, U.S. direct investment abroad dropped by 16% to about $350 billion. Foreign direct investment in the United States dropped by 25% in 2012 compared to 2011, falling to $175 billion. This decrease was mainly due to reductions in reinvested earnings, intercompany debt investment, and net equity investment. Despite increases in income and earnings, the total amount of foreign direct investment globally exceeded $21 trillion in 2011, with three-fourths invested in economically advanced developed economies. Global direct investment flows have increased sharply since 2004, with Asia, Latin America, and Africa accumulating significant amounts. The top 100 multinational corporations experienced stagnation in sales, employment, and asset growth from 2000 to 2003, but foreign direct investment flows globally picked up. Japan stands out as an exception, investing over $900 billion abroad while receiving $225 billion in investment inflows. Global direct investment flows increased sharply from 2004 onwards, with Asia, Latin America, and Africa seeing significant growth. In 2006 and 2007, global direct investment flows grew by 38% and 18% to nearly $2 trillion, driven by higher corporate profits and stock prices. However, in 2008, flows fell by 14% to $1.7 trillion due to credit market tightening and economic slowdown. The global financial crisis further reduced investment flows in 2009 to $1.1 trillion. Developed economies typically receive two-thirds of global investment flows, with developing economies receiving the rest. Africa receives the smallest share.

However, in 2008, flows fell by 14% to $1.7 trillion due to credit market tightening and economic slowdown. The global financial crisis further reduced investment flows in 2009 to $1.1 trillion. Developed economies typically receive two-thirds of global investment flows, with developing economies sharing the rest. Africa continues to receive the smallest share, generally less than 3%, with Latin America receiving about 8% and Asia getting between 18% and 22%. In 2011, global direct investment flows increased to all major geographic regions, particularly to developed economies, which experienced a 21% increase in direct investment from 2010. By the end of 2010, there were over 2,300 U.S. parent companies with nearly 27,000 affiliates operating abroad, compared to foreign firms with over 6,000 affiliates operating in the United States. U.S. parent companies employed nearly 23 million workers in the United States, while 13.3 million workers were employed abroad by U.S. firms. The data shows that U.S. parent companies are more efficient than U.S. affiliates or foreign firms operating in the United States, with higher output per employee. Foreign firms in the U.S. are more capital intensive, reflecting newer capital stock. U.S. affiliates of foreign companies had higher gross product value than foreign affiliates of U.S. firms abroad. The foreign affiliates of U.S. firms had higher total sales compared to U.S. affiliates of foreign firms, likely due to the economic growth slowdown in the U.S. They also paid more taxes to foreign governments. U.S. multinational companies play a significant role in the U.S. economy, producing $2.9 trillion in goods and services in 2010. In 2010, U.S. multinational companies produced $2.9 trillion in goods and services, representing 23% of total U.S. private industry gross product. The manufacturing sector saw a decline in its share of U.S. parent company gross product, falling from 53% in 1994 to 39.2% in 2010 due to the slowdown in economic growth. The manufacturing sector's share of U.S. parent company gross product rose to 45.7% in 2005, despite a decline in its overall share of the U.S. gross product. U.S. multinational corporations are among the largest firms in the U.S., with 40% of parent companies employing over 2,499 persons each. These large firms account for 95% of the total employment by U.S. MNCs. The largest foreign affiliates of U.S. parent firms account for 90% of affiliate employment. Concerns in the United States focus on the impact of foreign investment on U.S. employment, with some arguing that parent companies are shifting jobs offshore, reducing employment in the U.S. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis provides data on U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the U.S., but these data do not link to employment gains or losses in the U.S. The data do not capture the extent of firms outsourcing services to domestic and foreign firms. Studies show that outsourcing to domestic firms is more significant than other types of business restructuring. U.S. parent companies' employment trends are sensitive to economic conditions in the U.S., especially during periods of economic slowdown. Foreign investment data suggest a growing international linkage between economies, impacting job trends. Between 2002 and 2008, job gains were greater among the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms than among the parent companies, reflecting the impact of the economic conditions on employment trends. Employment among the parent companies declined in 2008 but rebounded in 2009 and 2010, while employment among the foreign affiliates fell in 2009 and 2010. The number of employees in U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates tend to rise and fall together, influenced by economic conditions. However, there is no clear correlation between job creation or loss in U.S. multinational companies and their foreign affiliates. Economic forces driving direct investment inflows also boost outflows, potentially creating jobs in foreign affiliates. Foreign direct investment can create jobs in foreign affiliates that may substitute for jobs in the parent company. However, it can also positively affect job creation in both the parent company and foreign affiliates, making it challenging to identify a clear trend in employment effects. Various factors can influence job gains and losses within individual companies and the economy as a whole. Unemployment is typically categorized as cyclical or structural, with these types accounting for the majority of unwanted job changes in any given year. Structural changes in employment, driven by technological advances and shifts in the economy, can lead to long-term alterations in job composition. These changes, such as those seen during the Industrial Revolution, involve the expansion and contraction of industries due to advancements in technology. When cyclical and structural unemployment coincide, it can be challenging to differentiate between the two. Structural changes in employment, driven by technology and productivity shifts, impact trade activities and foreign investment patterns. Job changes are influenced by the business cycle, with multinational companies being more affected by economic cycles than domestic firms. U.S. parent companies and foreign affiliates experienced employment fluctuations during economic contractions in the early 2000s and 2008-2009, with foreign affiliate employment increasing sharply in 2010. The parent companies' share of total U.S. civilian employment declined from 2000 to 2008, then began to increase due to losses in U.S. employment. Foreign affiliates in the U.S. also saw a decline in employment from 2000 to 2005, followed by an increase until 2008, then a decline in 2009 and 2010. Most workers added by foreign affiliates were through acquisitions of existing U.S. firms rather than new enterprises. In 2008, the global financial crisis made it hard for firms to get credit for acquisitions. Acquisitions support jobs and increase demand for workers. U.S. parent companies' employment dropped from 2001 to 2004 due to an economic downturn, but rose after 2004. During U.S. economic downturns, parent companies' employment declined more than foreign affiliates, leading to an increase in the share of employment by foreign affiliates from 26% in the 1980s to 34% in 2005. Between 2005 and 2010, U.S. civilian employment declined due to the financial crisis and recession, while parent company share of total U.S. employment increased. Recent foreign investment activity shows no major deviation from long-term trends, with about half of foreign affiliates' employment in 2010 in the manufacturing sector. Foreign affiliates of U.S. firms in the manufacturing sector were mainly concentrated in transportation equipment, chemicals, and computers. Employment in services sectors like finance, insurance, wholesale, and retail trade grew rapidly from 2008 to 2010. Most sectors saw an increase in employment during this period, except for mining, computers, broadcasting, and other industries. Source: Department of Commerce. The employees of U.S. overseas investors are mainly in highly developed economies with comparable labor compensation and standards of living to the United States. U.S. direct investment abroad has been focused in Europe since WWII, initially to access the European market. With the enlargement of the European Union, U.S. direct investment abroad is likely to remain concentrated in Europe. The largest share of U.S. direct investment abroad remains focused on Europe, despite a decline in employment from 2008 to 2010 due to economic challenges. In Asia, particularly in China, Malaysia, and Singapore, affiliate employment grew rapidly. U.S. firms in Asia account for one-third of total employment abroad, raising concerns about job loss in the U.S. to developing countries. However, data shows a continued trend favoring investment and jobs in developed economies. In the early 2000s, U.S. foreign affiliates and parent companies both experienced employment losses, particularly in highly developed European economies. This was due to their close ties with the U.S. economy, making them vulnerable to the financial crisis. U.S. investors have shown interest in Latin America, with affiliates in Mexico having 1.3 million employees in 2010. Employment associated with U.S. direct investment in Latin America and Asia has increased, while decreasing in Africa and the Middle East. Investment and employment in Latin America and Asia have increased, while decreasing in Africa and the Middle East. Observers suggest that employment shifts occur mainly between affiliated regions like Latin America and Asia, and among affiliates in developed countries. The U.S. economy created around 2 million jobs per year from 1982 to 1992, 1.7 million jobs per year from 1992 to 2002, and more than 2 million jobs per year from 2003 to 2007. However, in 2008, the economy lost about 5 million jobs due to the recession, followed by another 800,000 job losses from 2009 to 2010. The foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies created an average of about 24,000 jobs per year from 1982 to 1992, increasing to about 300,000 jobs per year from 1992 to 2002. Job creation by these affiliates peaked at over 300,000 jobs per year from 2005 to 2007, but dropped to about 100,000 jobs in 2008 due to the economic recession. In 2009, these affiliates lost about 100,000 jobs, but gained about 2.5 million jobs in 2010, partly due to government stimulus efforts. It is unclear if jobs created abroad came at the expense of jobs in the United States. During 1992 to 2007, U.S. foreign affiliates created an average of 100,000 jobs per year in low-cost developing countries, accounting for 6% of jobs created by the U.S. economy annually. However, the 2008-2010 period saw a shift in trends due to the financial crisis and recession, with job losses in Europe but gains in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Concerns have been raised about U.S. parent companies shifting jobs and economic production abroad, potentially replacing domestic production with foreign production permanently. Foreign direct investment in the United States reflects foreign acquisitions of existing U.S. firms, which may sustain U.S. employment and production. Job shifting and economic activities occur within and between economies, driven by structural changes and economic specialization. U.S. parent companies may shift jobs and production abroad, potentially replacing domestic production with foreign production permanently. U.S. parent companies had a gross product of $2.9 trillion in 2010, representing 68% of total output of U.S. multinational companies. Their majority-owned foreign affiliates had a gross product of $1.2 trillion. U.S. parent companies outperformed overseas affiliates from 1995 to 2001 but since then, foreign affiliates have grown to account for nearly 30% of total output. Foreign affiliates' share of total firm output has remained stable at 33.6%. During the 1980s and 1990s, U.S. MNCs expanded abroad while losing market shares at home due to corporate downsizing. The parent companies' share of U.S. business GDP declined from 32% to 25% by 1989, then remained around 22% in the 1990s. In 1998, there was a brief increase in their share of GDP due to a growing economy, but the economic slowdown in 2002 led to further losses. From 1989 to 1998, MNC parent companies increased their share in the services sector from 6% to 8% of U.S. GDP, and in other industries from 16% to 18%. During the 10-year period, U.S. parent companies increased their share in other industries from 16% to 18%, but lost shares in the manufacturing sector. Investment flows to developed countries, mainly Western Europe, increased from 1999 to 2003, with a decrease in investment going to developing countries. Investment outflows were affected by one-time tax provisions in 2005 and the economic recession in 2008 and 2009, but increased again in 2010. During the 10-year period, U.S. investment abroad shifted towards high technology services and financial industries, with a focus on Asia and Latin America. This reflected changes in the U.S. economy, moving away from extractive and manufacturing industries. During 1996-2000, U.S. direct investment abroad shifted towards high technology, finance, and services industries in developed countries. Investments in finance and services grew twice as fast as overall direct investment abroad. Foreign-owned establishments in the U.S. historically had lower returns compared to U.S.-owned firms, but the gap has narrowed over time. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the narrowing gap in the rate of return between foreign-owned and U.S.-owned manufacturing firms is related to age effects and startup costs. Foreign-owned firms outperform U.S. counterparts with six times more value added and seven times higher value of shipments. The average plant size for foreign-owned firms is six times larger, attributed to the absence of small plants among them. Foreign-owned manufacturing plants outperform U.S. counterparts with higher wages, productivity, and output. They also exhibit higher capital intensity across various industries. However, comparisons between foreign-owned and U.S. firms should be approached with caution due to differences in firm sizes and additional factors influencing performance. Foreign firms investing in the United States are typically large with proven technologies, opting for larger scale and higher capital-intensity plants to offset risks and generate higher profits. Concerns exist about U.S. companies outsourcing jobs overseas or shifting operations abroad, but evidence is anecdotal and not conclusive. The Bureau of Economic Analysis collects data on U.S. firms and their foreign affiliates, but not specifically to capture outsourcing activities like shifting operations abroad. There is a lack of data directly linking the closure of a plant in the U.S. with the opening of a plant abroad. One way to indirectly capture the outsourcing phenomenon is by analyzing data on trade, output, and employment of U.S. multinational firms across different industries and time periods. If U.S. firms are moving activities to foreign affiliates, this would be seen as a substitution for domestic output and employment, indicating competitive weaknesses and a shift in production location. During economic downturns, parent firms may shift production to foreign affiliates to adjust output and employment levels. This trend is also seen during periods of economic growth, where firms in expanding industries increase output and employment. The U.S. economy is transitioning towards capital-intensive activities, leading to changes in production locations and competitive pressures. The U.S. economy is shifting towards capital-intensive activities, prompting firms to respond to economic pressures by potentially outsourcing operations abroad. This can lead to an expansion in foreign affiliate operations while the parent company may experience a contraction. Economic activity in foreign affiliates could substitute for activity by the parent company, reflecting the ongoing churning in different sectors of the economy. Most economists agree that structural changes in the economy involve shifting capital and labor from declining to growing sectors, different from short-term cyclical changes. These changes can occur in maturing industries with technological improvements or declining industries shedding jobs and capital. Understanding the stage of economic change in specific sectors is crucial for assessing the impact of direct investment and determining appropriate legislative measures. Sectors in decline due to structural changes are expected to have persistently lower annual growth. Industries in structural decline are expected to have lower growth and decline in employment compared to other industries during economic expansions and contractions. Data from the BEA comparing U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates show differences in performance during periods of economic growth and slowdown. During periods of economic growth and slowdown, data from the BEA comparing U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates show differences in performance. The analysis focuses on shifts in production and employment, examining whether trends can be attributed to broad outsourcing or cyclical changes in the economy. During economic cycles, firms may experience slower growth and job losses during recessions. Structural changes can lead to mixed performance, with some firms gaining while others lose output and employment. Data comparing periods of slow growth and expansion show varying annual growth rates. Sectors undergoing long-term structural changes are expected to have lower growth rates, while those not undergoing changes may see higher growth rates. During the early 2000s, the U.S. economy experienced slow growth with an average annual rate of 1.4%, while output by U.S. parent companies grew at a rate of 9% and foreign affiliates at 16%. Despite this, job growth was minimal, leading to a jobless recovery. Sectors like manufacturing, retail trade, and wholesale trade saw negative growth rates. In the following years, the economy grew at an average rate of 3.0% from 2002-2006. During 2002-2006, the U.S. economy grew at an annual average rate of 3.0%, with U.S. parent companies increasing output by 7.5% and foreign affiliates by 15.5%. Parent companies expanded employment by 0.5% annually, while foreign affiliates grew by 5.4%. Employment in manufacturing sectors declined for parent companies, with foreign affiliates faring slightly better. Oil and gas extraction and wholesale trade saw above-average growth in employment. During 2006-2010, parent companies and their foreign affiliates experienced positive growth in employment, with rates of 3.4% and 6.0% respectively. Even in the electronic equipment sector, where output increased, parent firms saw a decrease in employment while foreign affiliates saw an increase. During 2006-2010, U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates experienced positive growth in employment, with rates of 3.4% and 6.0% respectively. Multinational firms outperformed the U.S. economy as a whole in terms of average annual growth rates, reflecting the interconnectedness of the global economy. During 2006-2010, U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates saw positive growth in employment, with rates of 3.4% and 6.0% respectively. Multinational firms outperformed the U.S. economy in average annual growth rates, reflecting global economic interconnectedness. Structural changes in the U.S. economy may mirror those in other advanced economies where U.S. direct investment is concentrated. Foreign affiliates generally performed similarly to parent firms in industrial sectors during economic expansions or contractions. The manufacturing sector showed positive growth in output for both parent companies and foreign affiliates, with the latter outperforming in the second and third periods. During 2006-2010, U.S. parent companies experienced a decline in manufacturing employment, while their foreign affiliates saw an increase. The financial crisis and recession impacted output, with parent companies growing at a slower rate than their affiliates. The overall loss in U.S. manufacturing employment reflects structural changes in the sector. During the 2000-2002 period, U.S. parent manufacturing companies saw a 6.8% average annual growth in gross product, but a 2.7% decrease in employment. In comparison, U.S.-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates experienced a 2.7% increase in gross product, but a 2.3% decrease in employment. During the 2000-2002 period, U.S. parent manufacturing companies saw a 6.8% average annual growth in gross product, but a 2.7% decrease in employment. Foreign affiliates experienced an average annual increase of 11.6% in output, with a 2.5% increase in employment. In wholesale trade, U.S. parent companies had a significant growth in gross product and employment during the 1995-1998 period, while foreign affiliates saw a higher increase in employment during the 2000-2002 economic slowdown. In the 2000-2002 period, U.S. parent companies experienced a 6.9% decrease in gross product and employment, while foreign affiliates saw a 7.4% increase in output. From 2002-2006, both U.S. parent companies and foreign affiliates had growth in the wholesale trade sector, with parent companies at 12.5% and affiliates at 9.0%. In the 2006-2010 period, parent firms had a 7.1% increase in output compared to foreign affiliates at -3.8%, but parent company employment decreased while affiliate employment increased. During the 1995-1998 period, U.S. finance firms saw significant growth in gross product and employment, with parent companies growing at 16.7% annually and affiliates at 20.4%. However, in the 2000-2002 period, there was slower growth in the economy, with parent companies growing at 8.8% compared to 19.2% for foreign affiliates. Employment among U.S. parent firms fell by -0.4% annually, while affiliates saw a larger decrease at -11.8%. During the recovery period from 2002 to 2006, U.S. parents' gross product increased by 11.7% annually, while employment decreased by -4.1%. Foreign affiliates experienced growth in gross product by 14.9% annually and employment by 3.1%. In the 2006-2010 period, output in the finance sector by parent companies grew by 1.6% annually, while foreign affiliates saw a growth rate of 6.4%. Employment among U.S. parent companies decreased by -2.8% annually, but increased by 13.8% among foreign affiliates. This reflects the differential impact of the financial crisis on American, European, and Asian finance firms. The impact of the financial crisis differed between U.S.-based firms and foreign affiliates. From 2002 to 2006, U.S. parents saw growth in gross product but a decrease in employment, while foreign affiliates experienced growth in both. In the 2006-2010 period, U.S. parent companies had slower growth in output and a decrease in employment, while foreign affiliates had higher growth rates in both aspects. This reflects the varying effects of the financial crisis on different types of firms. The data shows that U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates experienced negative growth rates in only two sectors during the 2006-2010 period. There is little evidence to support the idea that U.S. multinational firms are closing plants in the U.S. and moving them abroad. This lack of a clear pattern may be due to the growth in value chains and non-equity investments, which offer alternatives to traditional outsourcing. The data also suggests that U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates often experience economic events in similar ways. Foreign direct investment impacts foreign trade and can lead to concerns about job loss and shifts in production. Some argue that U.S. investment abroad replaces domestic production, leading to reduced employment and wages in the U.S. economy. This shift in production can also affect the distribution of employment and demand for skilled labor. Foreign direct investment abroad can lead to job loss and production shifts back to the United States. While some argue that it replaces domestic production, most studies show that it actually increases U.S. exports and sustains employment and wages at home. Intra-firm trade between U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates may increase with the flow of foreign investment. Foreign direct investment abroad can lead to job loss and production shifts back to the United States. While some argue that it replaces domestic production, most studies show that it actually increases U.S. exports and sustains employment and wages at home. Intra-firm trade between U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates may increase with the flow of foreign investment. However, the share of U.S. trade represented by U.S. parent companies and their affiliates has not increased as expected since the 1990s. Intra-firm exports and imports fell as a share of total U.S. exports and imports during the 1990s, with a slight increase from 2000 to 2003, but a downward trend since 2003. The share of U.S. exports by U.S. parent companies has decreased from 67% in 1994 to 47% in 2010. Similarly, U.S. exports by U.S. affiliates of foreign parent companies dropped from 23% in 1992 to 18% in 2010. Intra-firm trade fell from 25% in 1992 to 21% in 2008, while total intra-firm exports decreased from 35% in 1992 to 30% in 2008. Exports fell from 35% to 30% of U.S. exports between 1992 and 2008. Intra-firm trade remained stable during the early 2000s economic downturn, indicating its resilience compared to overall exports. Data from 2009 shows that U.S. parent companies shipped $187 billion to their foreign affiliates, representing 21% of total U.S. exports. Exports from U.S. parent companies to foreign affiliates totaled $187 billion in 2009, with 59% intended for further manufacturing. Over 90% of exports were manufactured goods across various sectors. Intra-firm trade has also declined as a share of total U.S. imports, contradicting the idea of outsourcing production abroad. Intra-firm imports as a share of total U.S. imports have fluctuated over the years. Imports to U.S. parent companies decreased from 41% in 1992 to 36% in 2008, then increased to 42% in 2010. U.S. imports by foreign firms' affiliates also decreased from 35% in 1992 to 27% in 2010. Intra-firm imports from foreign affiliates to U.S. parent companies dropped from 18% to 13% from 1992 to 2010, raising questions about U.S. outsourcing of production abroad. Imports from foreign parent companies and their affiliates to U.S. affiliates decreased from 35% to 27% during the same period. Intra-firm imports as a share of total U.S. imports decreased from 43% in 1992 to 33% in 2010, with U.S. affiliates' imports falling from 35% to 27%. This data challenges the notion of U.S. firms shifting production abroad. Foreign investment may boost domestic production and mitigate the impact of outsourcing on U.S. jobs. Sales patterns of U.S. multinational companies can provide insight into the extent of job outsourcing abroad. The sales patterns of U.S. multinational companies do not conclusively support an increase in jobs or activities being outsourced abroad. Foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies had $4.9 trillion in sales in 2010, with the majority of sales (61%) in the local market. Sales to other foreign countries accounted for about 30% of the affiliates' sales. In 2010, foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies had $4.9 trillion in sales, with 30% of sales going to other foreign countries. European affiliates, accounting for half of all sales, had 40% of their sales to other foreign countries, mainly within the European Common Market. 7.7% of U.S. affiliate sales were sent back to parent firms in the U.S., while 1.9% were to other U.S. persons or importers not directly associated with the parent company. Middle East affiliates sent 13% of their goods back to the U.S., with a significant portion originating in Israel under a free trade agreement since 1985. Sales by affiliates in different regions show varying distribution patterns. In Europe and Africa, sales are evenly spread among the United States, local sales, and other foreign countries. Canada has the most unequal distribution, with 77% of sales occurring there. European affiliates mainly focus on sales within Europe, while Latin American affiliates prioritize local sales. Manufactured goods make up half of all affiliate sales, with 9% being shipped back to the United States in 2010. The largest share of sales by industry accounted for by sales to U.S. parent companies is in the semiconductor industry, with most physical production offshore but high-tech engineering remaining in the U.S. Other industries have low levels of sales back to U.S. parents, focusing on local and nearby foreign markets. Concerns arise as U.S. firms outsource service jobs offshore, impacting sectors once thought immune. Services offshoring has minimal impact, according to a report by NAPA on foreign investment's effect on advanced science and engineering education services. The report on advanced science and engineering education found that services offshoring has had little economic impact on the S&E labor market or career choices of American students. U.S. foreign affiliates had $841 billion in services sales in 2008, with 4.9% sold back to the U.S. parent company. The majority of sales were made in the local market, with Latin America and the Middle East having the highest share of sales back to U.S. parent companies. Asia and Europe had the lowest share of services sales back to the U.S. parent. The Commerce Department has suppressed data on sales of services by industry to protect confidentiality. The highest share of service sales in the local market is in finance, insurance, and information. U.S. financial services companies are competitive globally. Sales of services back to the U.S. parent have shown high growth rates, especially between 2002 and 2006. The sales of services to the U.S. parent company grew by 11% mainly from affiliates in Europe, while sales from affiliates in Africa fell by 11%. Overall, the average annual growth rate in sales of services increased by nearly 75% from 2006 to 2010. Sales to the U.S. parent companies rose by 93%, with a rapid pace from affiliates in Canada and Africa. Sales to local markets grew by 63% in the same period. Sales of services to foreign countries increased significantly, with a 37% rise in the 2006 period and a 114% increase in the 2006-2010 period, driven by sales in Europe. Foreign direct investment is actively pursued by governments to boost their economies, with technology spillovers playing a significant role in productivity growth. Foreign firms invest more in high-technology research and development in the U.S. than U.S. firms do abroad. In the United States, R&D spending by foreign firms exceeds that of U.S. firms abroad. R&D spending slowed in 1991, 2002, and 2009 due to economic downturns, but has generally increased annually. Foreign affiliates in the U.S. outspent U.S. affiliates abroad, making the U.S. a net recipient of R&D expenditures. Global value chains are becoming more prevalent, reflecting a new phase of economic globalization with non-equity activities building interdependent networks. The OECD warns that non-equity activities in multinational firms can increase systemic risks by creating cascading disruptions in the value chains, as seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The 2008-2009 financial crisis led to a sharp drop in foreign investment activity and international trade flows, impacting economic growth among developed economies. The use of global value chains by multinational firms has been facilitated by factors such as production fragmentation, knowledge codification, intellectual property protection, and technological advancements. The growth of global value chains has led to the advancement of multilateral trade negotiations, allowing firms to externalize activities previously done in-house. This shift in ownership models gives firms more control options over foreign affiliates, moving away from the traditional dichotomy of full control or no control. The United Nations defines non-equity modes of investment as alternative forms of governing global value chains by multinational companies, including partial ownership, joint ventures, contract manufacturing, services outsourcing, and other contractual relationships. Multinational firms use codes of conduct to control foreign partners and manage risks. The international operations of overseas subsidiaries of U.S. multinational corporations, along with their non-equity investments, allow firms to specialize in specific stages of the production process. This vertical specialization in global value chains enables countries to focus on their comparative advantages. Non-equity investments in global value chains involve vertically integrated operations where suppliers have a comparative advantage in specific production processes. The United Nations estimates that contract manufacturing, franchising, licensing, and management contracts accounted for about $2 trillion in global sales in 2010. Contract manufacturing was the largest contributor, followed by franchising, licensing, and management contracts. These activities represent significant levels of cross-border trade and intra-firm transactions. Non-equity investments in global value chains involve significant levels of cross-border activities, with contract manufacturing accounting for a large portion of costs in various industries. These investments are estimated to directly employ 18-21 million workers worldwide and have a significant impact on ancillary industries. However, some non-equity investments have been associated with substandard working conditions. The Obama Administration issued a national strategy for securing global supply chains, emphasizing their importance in providing essential goods and services. The strategy aims to promote efficient commerce while protecting and securing the supply chain. The national strategy for securing global supply chains focuses on ensuring the efficient flow of commerce, protecting the supply chain from exploitation, and reducing vulnerability to disruptions. It also aims to build a resilient global supply chain system that can withstand evolving threats and recover rapidly from disruptions. The importance of global value chains in production and trade has led to the development of new models by organizations like the WTO and OECD to better understand trade relations and implications for negotiations between trading partners. The OECD and WTO developed a model to analyze the value added in exports, showing the mix of domestic and foreign sources. The data reveals varying contributions between countries, with the US having 89% domestic value added and 11% foreign value added in its exports, ranking low among advanced economies. Foreign direct investment challenges traditional views on international capital flows, as it primarily occurs between highly developed countries with similar rates of return. Luxembourg stands out with nearly 50% foreign value added in its exports, reflecting the unique trading relationships within the European Union. Countries that are large investors also receive significant amounts of direct investment, with investment flows into and out of these countries moving in tandem. Economists believe firms invest abroad to increase profits, but are uncertain about the factors triggering initial investment decisions and why firms choose specific locations. The United Nations identifies three main factors influencing foreign direct investment: ownership-specific competitive advantages. Foreign direct investment involves ownership-specific competitive advantages, locational advantages in host countries, and superior commercial benefits in intra-firm relationships. Multinational firms invest abroad not just for low-cost resources but also to improve efficiency and market share, requiring long-term commitment and resource management across countries. Foreign direct investment involves ownership-specific competitive advantages, locational advantages in host countries, and superior commercial benefits in intra-firm relationships. The relative importance of characteristics determining investment locations includes low-cost labor and industrial infrastructure. Investments solely based on low-cost labor are risky, as advancements in technology allow firms to extend efficiency strategies across borders. Foreign direct investment seeks cost-reductions, market shares, technology, and innovative capacity influenced by national policies. Nations attracting investment have high-quality infrastructure and skilled workforce. Economists have puzzled over simultaneous import and export of goods and investments within the same industry between different trading countries. Economists have debated the relationship between trade and investment, with some believing they were opposites. However, foreign direct investment has become a significant aspect of globalization, indicating a complex set of factors driving it. Economists suggest that foreign investment offers economic advantages for certain firms due to specific characteristics. Some firms have economic advantages over competitors due to characteristics like managerial ability, technical advantages, and market strength. These advantages allow firms to invest abroad, be competitive in both domestic and foreign markets, and increase market shares. Market imperfections and firm-specific factors contribute to firms attaining an oligopolistic position. Operating in foreign markets may incur additional costs and risks, but firms with competitive advantages can overcome these challenges. Foreign direct investment can be driven by various factors such as economies of scale, market power, cost advantages from patents, and product differentiation. It can also be a strategy for multinational firms to access new markets and remain competitive. In some cases, foreign investment is motivated by product cycle processes, starting with new product introductions and market growth. Initially, production is centered in the home country with foreign subsidiaries focusing on marketing, but competition increases in later phases. In later phases, businesses invest abroad to maintain market shares gained through exporting. The shift from exporting to producing in foreign markets may be a natural process facilitated by foreign investment. Motivations include avoiding tariffs, lower transportation costs, and proximity to foreign markets. U.S. direct investment abroad shows a trend of consuming production locally or shipping to neighboring countries rather than exporting back to the United States. There is little empirical basis for expecting a universal linkage between foreign investment and trade. Studies show that higher output by a U.S. firm in a foreign area leads to higher exports from the United States to that area and smaller exports from other foreign firms. Multinational companies gain economic flexibility through foreign subsidiaries, allowing them to adjust input sources in response to cheaper imports. Host countries' trade policies may influence this pattern by encouraging local production by foreign affiliates. Multinational firms invest abroad to remain competitive and shift production to offshore subsidiaries. This strategic move is influenced by macroeconomic factors like monetary policies, exchange rates, and productivity. External conditions such as growth rates, trade restraints, and technology acquisition also play a significant role in firms' investment behavior. Foreign investments are driven by trade restraints and technology acquisition. Multinational firms invest abroad to compensate for market failures and shift resources among their subsidiaries. The motivation for direct investment varies over time and among companies and foreign markets. U.S. companies invested in Common Market countries in the late 1950s and 1960s to avoid trade barriers, expect economic growth, and address currency valuation issues. Earnings from these investments were reinvested to maintain market shares and profit margins. Foreign investment and production help multinational corporations reduce risks such as bad weather, national business cycles, and changes in government policies. Establishing foreign subsidiaries provides added flexibility in setting prices in response to competition or exchange rate changes. Linkages between foreign affiliates and parent companies allow for price stability and competitiveness. The report utilizes data on direct investment to assess the impact on the U.S. economy. Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that U.S. parent companies may be shifting jobs abroad, but the data does not track job losses or gains in specific industries or companies. The BEA publishes data on U.S. multinational companies with a two-year lag, raising questions about its relevancy to current events. Despite this, there is no conclusive evidence that current investment trends differ significantly from previous periods. Comparison of gross product and employment between U.S. parent companies and foreign affiliates shows that U.S. business cycles have a stronger impact on parent companies, but even affiliates are affected. Long-term structural changes may be occurring. The business cycles in the economy affect both U.S. parent companies and foreign affiliates, leading to a partial synchronization effect. There is no clear evidence that U.S. parent companies are outsourcing jobs at a faster pace than before. Economic growth in U.S. parent companies compared to foreign affiliates may increase pressure for structural changes and job outsourcing, but the impact is likely to be limited. The overall decline in employment due to economic slowdown among U.S. parent companies may lead to job outsourcing, but strong job demand and foreign investments in the U.S. economy could mitigate this effect. It may be challenging to differentiate between sectors undergoing long-term structural changes and those experiencing short-term job losses. The dominating presence of the U.S. economy globally could also impact economic growth abroad. The uneven effect of an economic slowdown among U.S. parent companies on their investment behavior abroad may lead to job outsourcing. Global value chains play a growing role in foreign direct investment, helping firms build interdependent networks of operations and manage cross-border activities efficiently. Global value chains help firms manage cross-border activities efficiently but can increase systemic risks. They have substandard working conditions and lack employment stability, relying on low value-added activities. Jobs in labor-intensive industries are sensitive to economic cycles, leading to quick eliminations during economic distress. Comprehensive data on global value chains is lacking, hindering efforts to determine their full impact on international investment and trade. Efforts to assess the impact of global value chains on international investment and trade show no significant shift towards foreign production and imports. Intra-firm trade has actually decreased over the past decade, challenging predictions of increased outsourcing and job shifts abroad. Concerns about the reliability of the data are unfounded, as patterns of U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the U.S. have remained relatively stable over time. The stability in patterns of investment in the United States is unlikely to change over a short period, with a large share of U.S. direct investment abroad concentrated in highly developed economies. Jobs supported by foreign affiliates make up a small share of the U.S. economy, with U.S. economic factors and policies driving job creation domestically. U.S. foreign affiliates are expected to create around 300,000 jobs annually, a small fraction compared to the total U.S. job market. Data suggests that U.S. parent companies create more jobs than foreign affiliates. Investment in U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates is closely tied to the overall performance of the U.S. economy, with factors like employment, trade, and investment rising and falling together. Economic measures affect U.S. parent companies more than their foreign affiliates, especially during economic downturns. Policies to mitigate the effects of the business cycle could benefit U.S. parent companies and address economic challenges faced by workers and communities. Workers and communities facing long-term structural decline may need support to regain employment or sustain economic development. Industries undergoing decline may see production and jobs move abroad, posing challenges due to immense economic forces at play."
