    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits and services to eligible veterans, including healthcare, disability compensation, education, vocational rehabilitation, home loan guarantees, and burial benefits. It operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) handling healthcare, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) providing compensation and education assistance, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintaining national cemeteries. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national veterans cemeteries and provides grants for state veterans cemeteries. The Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) reviews appeals for veterans' benefits. This report analyzes the President's budget request for FY2013 for VA programs. It includes funding levels for VA health programs. The curr_chunk provides funding levels requested by the President for FY2013 for VA health related programs, mandatory programs, and administration. It briefly introduces the various accounts that fund the department, including mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports various benefits and services, while discretionary funding primarily goes towards providing medical care to veterans. The President's FY2013 budget request for the VA is approximately $140.3 billion, with funding for VA health care programs coming from multiple appropriations accounts. The VA has the authority to bill some veterans and health care insurers for non-service-connected care to help offset costs. The VA health care system receives funds from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009. These funds are deposited into the Medical Care Collections Fund and can be used for medical services for veterans. The Veterans Health Administration has advance appropriations for medical services, medical support, and compliance, and medical facilities. The medical services account funds health care services for eligible veterans and beneficiaries. The VA health care system provides services to eligible veterans and beneficiaries in various facilities. The Veterans Health Administration manages the funds for medical support and compliance, as well as the operation and maintenance of medical facilities. Unlike other publicly funded programs, VA health care services are delivered within its integrated system. The VA health care system is a veteran-specific national system with 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). VHA operates 152 hospitals, 133 nursing homes, 824 community-based outpatient clinics, 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 300 Readjustment Counseling Centers. Additionally, VA has deployed 70 Mobile Vet Centers to improve access to services for veterans in rural areas. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care services to eligible veterans through its network of facilities, including mobile outpatient clinics and Mobile Vet Centers in rural areas. VHA can also pay for non-VA providers in certain situations, known as Fee Basis Care services, which include dental services, outpatient and inpatient care, emergency care, and medical transportation. Inpatient and outpatient care are also available for eligible dependents of veterans through CHAMPVA in the private sector. The VHA collaborates with the DOD and provides grants for construction of nursing homes. It conducts medical research, supports national emergencies, and trains health professionals. Around 8.7 million veterans were enrolled in the VA health care system in FY2012, with an estimated 8.8 million in FY2013. In FY2013, VA anticipates treating approximately 5.7 million unique veteran patients, including 610,416 OEF/OIF/OND veterans. Outpatient visits are expected to increase to 91.1 million, and inpatients treated to 936,201. VA's annual appropriations for medical services include advance appropriations. The FY2013 funding levels for VA medical services accounts were provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2012. The President's budget is requesting $41.5 billion for the medical services account, reflecting increased costs for implementing certain acts. The President's FY2013 budget proposes $56.3 billion for VHA, including $583 million for medical and prosthetic research. Research priorities include mental health, Gulf War veterans' illnesses, prosthetics, TBI, spinal cord injury, women veterans, and pain research. The President's budget for FY2014 requests $54.5 billion in advance appropriations for medical care, a 3.3% increase from FY2013. The budget allocates $43.6 billion for medical services, $6.0 billion for medical support and compliance, and $4.9 billion for medical facilities. VA budget for mandatory benefit programs and administration for FY2011-FY2013 is shown in Table 2. The compensation category includes various benefits like disability compensation, DIC, pension benefits for low-income disabled or elderly combat veterans, burial benefits, and clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans. There was a significant increase in FY2013, but it was overstated due to carryovers from previous years. The carryover was a result of lower retroactive payments related to Agent Orange presumptions. Average payments for benefits are expected to remain stable. The increase in benefits for disability compensation, pension, and survivor benefits is expected due to the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Readjustment benefits for transitioning servicemembers and disabled veterans, including education and vocational rehabilitation, also saw an increase. Insurance funding for NSLI, S-DVI, and VMLI also increased between FY2012 and FY2013. The increase in insurance funding for NSLI, S-DVI, and VMLI between FY2012 and FY2013 reflects deaths associated with the programs and an increase in maximum coverage under VMLI. The decrease in mandatory housing benefits is due to re-estimates for programs, with FY2013 re-estimates to be reflected in the FY2014 budget. VBA general operating expenses increased primarily due to personnel. A new category proposes legislation for a Veterans Job Corps. The FY2013 budget requests $3.3 billion for Information Technology, an increase of $216 million from FY2012. Major Construction projects decreased by 9.7%, while Minor Construction projects increased by 25.9% between FY2012 and FY2013."
