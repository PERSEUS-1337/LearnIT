    "content": "The \"Education for the 21st Century (E-21) Act\" aims to utilize computer hardware in schools to enhance student achievement and prepare them for the modern workplace. The Congress finds that establishing computer literacy programs for students is crucial for their advanced education and employment in the 21st century. Computer skills enhance critical analysis and communication, as shown by a study where students using educational technology outperformed those who did not. Despite schools acquiring the latest computer hardware, the importance of computer literacy remains significant. Teachers need effective training in the latest educational software applications to fully utilize the benefits of computer-based learning. A study by the Educational Testing Service showed that students performed better when their teachers received computer training. Schools providing professional development in computers experienced higher staff morale and lower absenteeism rates. Exciting educational technology applications are being developed by both commercial software companies and students, which should be utilized to benefit elementary and secondary schools. SEC. 4. COMPUTER LITERACY CHALLENGE. The Secretary of Education can award grants to States that integrate technology literacy into the middle school curriculum, with a priority on training teachers.
