    "content": "MEDICARE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM: Use of third-party interest-free payment arrangements to reduce Medicare hospital Part A bad debt claims. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 3-year demonstration program in 5 States to assess the impact of hospitals implementing third-party interest-free payment arrangements on patient engagement, health outcomes, and Medicare hospital Part A bad debt claims. A third-party interest-free payment arrangement involves a hospital, a third-party, and individuals receiving inpatient hospital services under Medicare Part A. The hospital offers individuals the option to make payment of Medicare part A cost-sharing through a third-party arrangement. The third party collects the cost-sharing from individuals who agree to the offer, while efforts for collection are considered reasonable by the hospital. The hospital payment of Medicare part A cost-sharing for services is made through a third-party arrangement. The third party engages financially with individuals to ensure affordability, allows payment over time without interest, and collects and pays the hospital the owed amount. The demonstration program allows hospitals to participate in third-party interest-free payment arrangements for Medicare part A cost-sharing. Hospitals demonstrating improved patient engagement, satisfaction, health outcomes, and reduced Medicare hospital part A bad debt claims can receive payment incentives. The program also requires a report to Congress upon completion. The Secretary will report to Congress after the demonstration program, analyzing the impact on reducing Medicare hospital part A bad debt claims and improving health outcomes for beneficiaries unable to pay for Medicare part A cost-sharing. Medicare part A cost-sharing refers to hospital debts from deductibles and coinsurance under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The term \"Medicare hospital part A bad debt\" refers to hospital debts that cannot be collected due to the inability to collect Medicare part A cost-sharing. This includes debts from deductibles and coinsurance under the Social Security Act."
