    "content": "Between 1998 and 2005, Monsanto field-tested genetically engineered wheat tolerant of glyphosate, a herbicide marketed as Roundup. Monsanto stopped trials in 2005 and withdrew its application for deregulated status due to concerns about approval from Canadian and Australian Wheat Boards. No GE wheat varieties have been approved by the USDA's APHIS. In spring 2013, an eastern Oregon farmer found glyphosate-tolerant wheat plants in their field. Tests confirmed the presence of GE wheat variety tested by Monsanto in field trials between 1998 and 2005. APHIS began an investigation as GE wheat had not been approved for that site. The agency approved field testing of GE wheat in Oregon in 2001, but not at the site where rogue GE wheat was found. APHIS confirmed no evidence of GE wheat entering commerce. The investigation concluded it was an isolated incident on a single farm. Samples of wheat imported by Japan, South Korea, and EU also showed no unapproved GE trait. APHIS couldn't determine how the GE wheat ended up in the field. Samples of seed and grain from the producer and other growers tested negative for GE material. The Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology in the U.S. ensures the safety of genetically engineered products based on their characteristics, not their production method. Three federal agencies regulate genetically modified organisms: USDA's APHIS, FDA, and the Environmental. The Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate genetically engineered products. APHIS oversees herbicide-tolerant plants and GE plants that contain pesticides. FDA is responsible for the safety and nutritional quality of GE foods. APHIS regulates the importation, interstate movement, and field testing of GE plants that are or might be plant pests. APHIS regulations require authorization for import, interstate movement, or field testing of regulated plant pests. Developers must obtain APHIS approval through permits or notifications to prevent pest risks and ensure environmental safety. Most genetically engineered crops use the expedited notification process instead of permits. After testing, a developer seeks \"non-regulated status\" from APHIS for full commercialization. Extensive information on plant biology, genetics, and potential impacts must be provided. APHIS conducts an environmental assessment and public comment periods before deciding on deregulation. Once deregulated, the GE plant is no longer subject to APHIS regulation. APHIS imposes conditions on field testing, harvesting, and transporting GE materials while the plant remains regulated. APHIS imposes conditions on field testing, harvesting, and transporting GE materials, with penalties up to $1 million for violations. If unapproved GE traits are found in shipments, APHIS will take necessary action to protect plant health. Despite FDA's conclusion of no health concerns from consuming GE wheat, APHIS will not remove low-level presence of this variety from the food supply. The LLP policy considers safety criteria when assessing the risk of GE plant materials. The FDA concluded that glyphosate-tolerant GE wheat is safe and nutritionally equivalent to non-GE wheat. Once FDA determines substantial equivalence, its regulatory role typically ends. The United States is the world's largest wheat exporter, with Oregon exporting nearly 90% of its wheat crop. USDA projected an increase in U.S. winter wheat seedings for harvest in 2013. APHIS found no evidence of GE wheat entering commerce, and tests on imported wheat found no unapproved GE trait. Many countries have zero-tolerance policies for unapproved GE varieties. After the discovery of GE wheat in Oregon, Japan and South Korea temporarily suspended U.S. soft white wheat purchases. APHIS validated a DNA test method for detecting the specific GE trait, MON71800, allowing detection at a frequency of 1 in 200 kernels. The method was provided to U.S. trading partners upon request. In September 2014, APHIS closed its investigation into the GE wheat incident in Oregon, stating it was an isolated occurrence. No GE wheat was found in commerce. A new investigation was launched in July 2014 at Montana State University, where GE wheat volunteers were discovered. Monsanto conducted GE wheat field trials in Montana between 2000 and 2003. The GE wheat in Montana was not linked to the contamination in Oregon. In November 2014, Monsanto settled with U.S. wheat farmers for $250,000 and $2.1 million for soft white wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest. Three class action suits were also dismissed as part of the settlement. In addition to the settlement with U.S. wheat farmers, three pending class action suits will be dismissed. APHIS has a history of issues with unauthorized GE crops, including contamination of food products and plant residue from GE field trials. Instances include unapproved GE cotton and rice found in commercial samples, leading to market repercussions. In 2001, GE corn known as StarLink was discovered in taco shells, causing concerns about approved varieties. The discovery of StarLink GE corn in taco shells by Kraft Foods led to recalls of hundreds of corn products. Aventis, the developer of the GE corn, paid over $120 million to settle lawsuits. Critics question APHIS's regulatory oversight of GE crops, while the industry seeks a more streamlined regulatory process. Incidents like the Oregon wheat trade impacts highlight the challenges of introducing GE materials into the environment. The discovery of non-approved GE varieties in the environment can disrupt international trade and incur significant costs. APHIS is reviewing regulations for GE plant introduction but has not finalized any changes since 1987. The origin of GE wheat in Oregon and Montana remains unknown, raising concerns about regulatory oversight. APHIS's ongoing investigations will determine if the GE wheat contamination is isolated or more widespread, impacting trade implications. Wheat growers are concerned until APHIS completes its investigation and issues a final report. Criticism of GE crops and APHIS's regulatory oversight may continue to grow."
