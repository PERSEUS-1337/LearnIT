    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities in various areas. Enacted in 1990 and amended in 2008, the ADA aims to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Supreme Court has decided multiple ADA cases, including United States v. Georgia, which established a private cause of action for damages under title II of the ADA against states for conduct violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The issue of whether the Eleventh Amendment allows prisoners to secure money damages was not addressed in this case. The Supreme Court did not address whether the Eleventh Amendment permits prisoners to seek money damages from a state for ADA violations. The Court also considered a case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act with implications for ADA discrimination. Additionally, the Court granted certiorari in Huber v. Wal-Mart Stores to determine reassignment of a disabled individual to a vacant position, but the case was settled before oral argument. The Eighth Circuit held that Wal-Mart was not obligated to automatically reassign the individual but could choose a better qualified candidate for the position. The court of appeals stated that the plaintiff was treated the same as all other candidates for the Wal-Mart job opening. There is a split in the circuits on accommodation issues, and the ADA's definition of disability has been controversial. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability to include physical or mental impairments that substantially limit major life activities, with new rules favoring broad coverage and interpretation in favor of individuals with disabilities. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the definition of disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities, regardless of episodic or remission status. The Act aimed to counteract Supreme Court decisions that had narrowed the ADA's scope. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability to include impairments that substantially limit major life activities, rejecting previous Supreme Court rulings. The Act aims to reinstate broad protection under the ADA by eliminating discrimination and providing clear, enforceable standards. It specifically rejects the substantially limits requirements of Toyota and EEOC regulations defining substantially limits as \"significantly restricted.\" The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the definition of disability to include impairments that limit major life activities. It rejects the previous substantially limits requirements and covers individuals regarded as having an impairment. Transitory and minor impairments are excluded from the \"regarded\" prong. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability to include impairments that limit major life activities. It questions the authority of regulatory agencies to interpret the ADA's definition of disability, as the ADA does not explicitly grant any agency this authority. The ADA Amendments Act grants regulatory authority to interpret the definition of disability. The Bragdon v. Abbott case established that asymptomatic HIV infection qualifies as a disability under the ADA. Other cases have addressed the impact of medication and assistive devices on determining disability. The ADA Amendments Act changed the criteria for determining disability under the ADA. Previous court cases emphasized the need for substantial limitations on major life activities to qualify as disabled. The Act prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals based on disability in job applications. The ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in employment, including job application procedures, hiring, advancement, and discharge. Employers with 15 or more employees are covered under the ADA, similar to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The 15-employee limit is not jurisdictional but relates to the substantive adequacy of a claim. The ADA's 15-employee limit is not jurisdictional but relates to the substantive adequacy of a claim. The Supreme Court examined the definition of \"employee\" under the ADA in Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates P.C. v. Wells, where the case was remanded for further proceedings. In 1986-1997, Ms. Wells sued for disability discrimination after being fired, claiming the clinic violated the ADA. The clinic argued it wasn't covered by the ADA due to having less than 15 employees. The court debated whether physician-shareholders counted as employees based on the ADA's vague definition. The EEOC's common law control test was considered in determining employee status. The court considered six factors to determine if physician-shareholders were employees under the ADA, including the organization's control, supervision, reporting structure, influence, intent in written agreements, and profit-sharing. Justice Stevens found that some findings favored the conclusion that the physicians were employees. The Court remanded the case for further proceedings as there was evidence supporting the physicians being employees, despite initial indications otherwise. Justice Ginsburg dissented, arguing that the Court's opinion overlooked key aspects of the master-servant relationship and that the physicians should not be allowed to avoid their corporate status when it comes to federal antidiscrimination statutes. The case involves determining if the plaintiff is disabled and if the employer has 15 or more employees. The next step is to assess if the individual can perform the job's essential functions with or without accommodation. Qualification standards may include not posing a direct threat to others' health or safety in the workplace. Title III also states that entities are not required to allow individuals to benefit from services if they pose a threat to others. In Bragdon v. Abbott, the Court found that the ADA does not mandate entities to provide services to individuals who pose a threat in public accommodations. The Court ruled that individuals cannot participate in public accommodations if they pose a direct threat to others' health or safety. The case was remanded for further consideration of the evidence regarding the direct threat issue. The defendant failed to provide scientific evidence showing a significant risk of HIV transmission through routine dental care. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in this case. In Albertsons, the Court ruled that employers can enforce federal safety regulations without justification, even with an experimental waiver program. In Chevron U.S.A. Inc., v. Echazabal, the Court held that the ADA does not require employers to hire individuals with disabilities if the job would endanger their health. The EEOC regulation allows employers to assert a direct threat defense in cases of employment discrimination related to health or safety. The ADA allows employers to defend against discrimination allegations by showing that a qualification standard is necessary for the job. The Echazabal case found that an employer violated the ADA by refusing to hire an applicant with a health condition that would be worsened by workplace chemicals. The court analyzed statutory and regulatory language to make its decision. The Court found that the ADA allows employers to defend against discrimination allegations by showing that a qualification standard is necessary for the job. They noted that the ADA's language did not intend to define all defenses available to an employer, questioning if an employer could not defend a refusal to hire when a worker's disability would threaten others outside the workplace. The Court found that the EEOC had sufficient statutory basis for its regulatory interpretation regarding workplace paternalism and direct threat defense under the ADA. The regulations were deemed reasonable to prevent time lost to sickness, excessive turnover, litigation, and violations of safety laws. The Court emphasized the importance of medical judgment in determining a direct threat defense. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of medical judgment in determining a direct threat defense under the ADA. They distinguished a previous case regarding \"fetal protection\" policies and reversed a lower court decision in favor of the employer. The ninth circuit reversed a district court's summary judgment in favor of an employer in a case involving the ADA and rehiring rights for terminated employees. The Supreme Court, in Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, addressed the issue but did not reach a decision, citing improper application of disparate impact analysis. The Court emphasized the distinction between claims of discrimination based on disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment involves treating some people less favorably due to a protected characteristic, while disparate impact refers to practices that impact a protected group more harshly. In Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corp., the Court ruled that a general arbitration clause in a collective bargaining agreement does not require arbitration for ADA violations. The decision did not address the validity of a union-negotiated waiver. The Supreme Court ruled that a general arbitration agreement in a collective bargaining agreement cannot waive rights under civil rights statutes. In U.S. Airways v. Barnett, the Court stated that an employer can show that a requested accommodation conflicts with a seniority system, making it unreasonable under the ADA. This decision upholds the importance of seniority systems in providing fair treatment to employees. The Supreme Court ruled that a seniority system could undermine employees' expectations of consistent treatment, entitling an employer to summary judgment in most cases. Exceptions may apply in situations where the system is frequently changed unilaterally or contains numerous exceptions. The Court's decision in Barnett had strong dissents and concurring opinions. In Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., the Supreme Court had splintered views with strong dissents and concurring opinions. Justice O'Connor stated in her concurrence that the effect of a seniority system on the ADA depends on its legal enforceability. The dissents, led by Justice Scalia and Justice Souter, argued against the majority's decision on the ADA and seniority rules. The Court found that receiving Social Security benefits does not hinder an ADA claim, as the two statutes serve individuals with disabilities differently. The ADA's definition of a qualified individual as someone who can perform essential job functions with or without accommodation distinguishes it from the Social Security Act. While SSDI benefits can be granted to working individuals, there is no inherent conflict between the two statutes to warrant a negative presumption. The Court noted that while receiving Social Security benefits does not hinder an ADA claim, an earlier SSDI claim may conflict with an ADA claim if the individual asserts inability to work. The Court held that an ADA plaintiff must explain any contradiction arising from a total disability claim. The case in Cleveland was vacated and remanded for further proceedings. In Olmstead v. Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled that Title II of the ADA requires states to place individuals with mental disabilities in community settings instead of institutions. The Supreme Court ruled in Olmstead v. Georgia that Title II of the ADA mandates placing individuals with mental disabilities in community settings rather than institutions if professionals deem it appropriate, the individual agrees, and accommodations can be made. This decision was praised by disability groups but also set limitations on the right, including the need for reasonable modifications to existing programs. The Supreme Court's ruling in Olmstead v. Georgia mandates placing individuals with mental disabilities in community settings rather than institutions if professionals deem it appropriate, the individual agrees, and accommodations can be made. This decision has implications for the interpretation of similar concepts in the employment and public accommodations Titles of the ADA. In Pennsylvania Department of Prisons v. Yeskey, the Court found that state prisons are covered under Title II of the ADA, rejecting the argument that such coverage would alter the constitutional balance between the States and Federal Government. The Supreme Court addressed issues involving prisoners under the ADA in Yeskey, holding that state prisons are considered \"public entities\" under the ADA. The pending decision of United States v. Georgia may address constitutional issues regarding State immunity from damage suits under Title II of the ADA. The Eleventh Amendment limits suits against states by citizens and cannot be abrogated. The Eleventh Amendment limits suits against states by citizens and cannot be abrogated. However, Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allows Congress to enforce provisions through appropriate legislation, with specific conditions for successful abrogation of state immunity. Congressional power is limited to enacting remedial legislation that shows congruence and proportionality to the injury. The Supreme Court has examined statutes to determine if they abrogated the Eleventh Amendment, often finding them lacking. Recent decisions have somewhat limited the Court's federalism doctrine, upholding the Family and Medical Leave Act as valid under the Fourteenth Amendment. The application of these decisions to other aspects of the ADA remains unclear. The recent United States v. Georgia case raised questions about Congress's ability to abrogate State immunity under Title II of the ADA. The Supreme Court examined whether Title II of the ADA abrogated State immunity from damage suits, focusing on cases involving accommodations for prisoners with disabilities. In Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, the Court held that state prisons are considered \"public entities\" under the ADA. United States v. Georgia involved a paraplegic Georgia prisoner who claimed he was confined in a small cell, unable to maneuver his wheelchair, deprived of basic facilities, and forced to sit in his own waste. The Supreme Court ruled that Title II of the ADA allows for damage suits against states for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment. This decision was made in response to a case where a Georgia prisoner with disabilities was subjected to inhumane conditions, including being denied access to basic facilities and forced to sit in his own waste. The Supreme Court, in United States v. Georgia, ruled that Title II of the ADA permits damage suits against states for Fourteenth Amendment violations. This decision addressed a case involving a Georgia prisoner with disabilities facing inhumane conditions. The ruling recognized Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to create private remedies for actual violations. This decision does not resolve the split in the Supreme Court on Eleventh Amendment abrogation under the ADA, as seen in Tennessee v. Lane. In Tennessee v. Lane, the Supreme Court upheld the application of the ADA Title II to the fundamental right of court access, allowing suits against states for Fourteenth Amendment violations. George Lane and Beverly Jones, both wheelchair users, sued Tennessee for court access issues. The Court, in a 5-4 decision, determined that Congress had clearly expressed intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Supreme Court in Tennessee v. Lane addressed whether Congress expressed intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity under the ADA Title II. The Court applied the test from City of Boerne v. Flores, finding a congruence between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted. Justice Stevens' opinion highlighted Title II's aim to prohibit discrimination and enforce constitutional guarantees, including access to courts, based on evidence of discrimination against persons with disabilities. The Supreme Court in Tennessee v. Lane found that Title II of the ADA was a suitable response to the discrimination against persons with disabilities in accessing public services. The Court emphasized the need for \"reasonable modifications\" to ensure access to courts without imposing undue burdens. The Supreme Court in Tennessee v. Lane upheld Title II of the ADA as a valid exercise of Congress' authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. The decision focused on ensuring access to courts for individuals with disabilities without imposing undue burdens. Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented, arguing for a broader consideration of Title II, but the majority emphasized detailed fact-finding in legislative history to support their ruling. The Supreme Court's emphasis on constitutional rights in access to courts is crucial for Eleventh Amendment abrogation. In Garrett v. University of Alabama, the Court ruled that state employees cannot recover monetary damages under Title I of the ADA due to Eleventh Amendment protection. Congress must show a pattern of discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment for individuals to sue states for money damages. In PGA Tour v. Martin, the Supreme Court held that professional golf tours are covered by Title III of the ADA, allowing the use of a golf cart by a golfer with a mobility impairment. Justice Breyer dissented, arguing that the majority ignored evidence of discriminatory treatment. In Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line, the Supreme Court ruled that the ADA applies to foreign cruise ships in U.S. waters, resolving a circuit split. Justice Scalia dissented, criticizing the majority's interpretation of the ADA. The Supreme Court ruled in Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line that the ADA applies to foreign cruise ships in U.S. waters. The majority decision stated that cruise ships do not have to comply with the ADA if modifications conflict with international legal obligations. The case was remanded to determine specific ADA requirements in this situation, leaving the question of structural modifications unresolved. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing against the ADA's application in this context. In Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc., v. West Virginia Department of Human Resources, the Supreme Court rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees, stating that fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship. In Barnes v. Gorman, the Court unanimously held that punitive damages cannot be awarded under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. In 1992, Gorman, who uses a wheelchair, was injured during his arrest by Kansas City police. He sued and was awarded $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive damages. The Supreme Court reversed the punitive damages ruling, with differing opinions on the ADA and Rehabilitation Act remedies. The ADA and Rehabilitation Act remedies are coextensive with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which does not mention punitive damages. Justice Scalia emphasized the need for clear conditions on federal grants, likening it to a contract. Therefore, punitive damages are generally not available for breach of contract under these laws. Justice Scalia found that punitive damages are generally not available for breach of contract under Title VI, Section 504, or the ADA. The implications of this decision are not entirely clear, with Justice Stevens warning of potential far-reaching consequences beyond the issues presented in the case."
