    "content": "Muslims in several countries have shown anger towards the United States due to a controversial film insulting Islam and Prophet Mohammed. Demonstrations, some violent, have occurred in response, with attacks on U.S. diplomatic personnel and facilities. This unrest is fueled by pre-existing anti-U.S. sentiment and domestic political frustrations. The attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, resulted in the death of four U.S. personnel, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Similar incidents have been reported in Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia, and Sudan. The protests in Egypt, Tunisia, and Sudan, along with clashes in other regions, highlight the widespread outrage over a controversial film insulting Islam. Despite some political differences and varying government responses, the global backlash mirrors past controversies involving perceived hate speech against Islam. The global backlash over a controversial film insulting Islam has led to protests, demonstrations, and violence. Similar trends have been sparked by reports of desecration of Islamic religious books. The current unrest echoes incidents targeting U.S. diplomats and embassies in the Middle East and South Asia in 1979, which led to reforms in diplomatic security arrangements. The series of incidents in 1979 shared characteristics with current developments, including spontaneity, raw public emotion, advance planning by violent groups, and manipulation of events for political gain. The rapid spread of information and misinformation through media continues to play a significant role in shaping global events. The recent demonstrations and attacks highlight security challenges for U.S. government personnel and citizens abroad, fuel domestic political rivalries, and raise questions about ensuring short-term security while preserving long-term national interests. The Obama Administration's response is under scrutiny, considering the complexities of individual countries and the varying levels of government control over public anger. The Obama Administration's response to unrest and attacks in the Middle East and North Africa is being questioned. Congress may hold oversight hearings to explore government cooperation in protecting U.S. personnel and facilities. Countries experiencing political change since 2011, such as Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen, have seen large protests and violent attacks. The United States, while embracing political change, now faces security challenges abroad. The United States is navigating security challenges in countries like Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya as they undergo political change. Newly elected Islamist leaders are balancing public opinion, domestic rivals, and international pressure to address security responsibilities. Libyan authorities rely on state-affiliated militia groups. In 2011, a group produced a controversial movie depicting the Islamic prophet Mohammed, leading to global outrage. The film, titled \"Innocence of Muslims,\" portrayed Mohammed and his followers in a negative light, sparking controversy in Christian and Islamic media outlets. In early September 2012, a controversial film project sparked global outrage and violence. Google restricted access to the online videos in Egypt and Libya, while other countries blocked access as well. Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a Coptic Christian Egyptian American, was identified as being involved in the film's production and faced legal issues related to past fraud charges. He is now in hiding with his family due to threats on his life. In September 2012, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a Coptic Christian Egyptian American involved in a controversial film, is now in hiding with his family due to threats from Muslim extremists. The recent attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities raise challenging policy questions for Congress, including options for responding and investigating recent incidents. Recent unrest and attacks have raised questions about threat assessments prior to the recent attacks and potential implications for future U.S. relations with countries in North Africa, the Middle East, and South and Southeast Asia. Congress may discuss logistical and philosophical questions about U.S. foreign assistance to countries affected by upheaval in the Arab world or important U.S. partners on regional security priorities. Evacuation of non-emergency personnel from Libya, Tunisia, and Sudan will temporarily halt some ongoing assistance programs. Some Members of Congress are calling for a suspension of U.S. assistance to countries where attacks have occurred, while others suggest tying assistance to improved security or cooperation in investigations. Legislative developments include a bill introduced by Senator Rand Paul to prohibit funds for assistance to Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, and others. Obama Administration officials advise against letting violent extremists disrupt engagement with key security partners and providing assistance to Arab countries undergoing political change. The bill introduced by Senator Rand Paul aims to prohibit funds for assistance to countries where U.S. diplomatic facilities have been attacked since September 1, 2012. The President can lift the prohibition after certifying cooperation from host nations and identifying individuals involved in the incidents. Congress must approve any requests to lift the prohibition through expedited procedures. Additionally, a report on the status of advanced weaponry is required. The bill introduced by Senator Rand Paul aims to prohibit funds for assistance to countries where U.S. diplomatic facilities have been attacked since September 1, 2012. It also requires a report on the use of advanced weaponry after the fall of Moammar Qaddafi in the Benghazi attack. Senator Rand Paul offered amendments to prohibit funds for Pakistan, Egypt, Yemen, or Libya. Senator James Inhofe introduced a resolution to suspend foreign assistance funding to Libya and Egypt until proper security is provided at U.S. embassies and consulates. H.Res. 783, introduced by Representative Michael McCaul, calls for the suspension of U.S. foreign assistance to Libya and Egypt until they apologize for attacks on U.S. diplomats and ensure their safety. Some officials argue that supporting transitional governments in these countries will help marginalize extremist voices over time. Secretary of State Clinton emphasizes the importance of U.S. engagement and partnership with countries striving for security. The recent violence in Libya and Egypt has raised concerns about U.S. engagement and partnership with countries transitioning to democracy. The Administration's request for $770 million for the MENA-IF initiative was not included in the House Appropriations Committee's version of the FY2013 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, but the Senate Appropriations Committee included $1 billion for the initiative. The enactment of a continuing resolution may tie interim FY2013 spending to FY2012 levels. The recent unrest in several countries may impact U.S. funding levels for FY2013, with consultations between the executive branch and Congress possibly determining funding based on FY2012 levels. The violence linked to an inflammatory film has implications for the U.S. image among Muslims and efforts to counter violent extremism globally, with Al Qaeda affiliates seeking to exploit the situation. The AQAP and AQLIM have called for demonstrations and attacks on U.S. diplomatic targets, urging Muslims to expel U.S. embassies from Muslim countries and continue protests. They praised those who killed the U.S. ambassador in Libya as examples to follow in resisting U.S. hegemony. The statements condemn the U.S. for its actions and seek to liberate Muslim lands from American influence. The United States is condemned for dishonoring the prophet and Muslims are urged to protest by pulling down U.S. flags in embassies, burning them, and killing ambassadors in retaliation. Salafist-jihadist cleric Ahmad Ashush issued a fatwa calling for the killing of those involved in making a controversial movie. Salafist-jihadist cleric Ahmad Ashush issued a fatwa calling for the killing of everyone involved in making a controversial movie, including the producer, director, and actors. He stated that it is the duty of every Muslim to kill them if possible, as it is the decisive ruling of Islam. In contrast, clerics in conservative Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia have denounced the film but urged peaceful responses. In Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt, the crisis has widened fissures between Islamist groups calling for protests but refraining from violence and Salafist movements supporting violence in response to the film. Elected Islamist authorities may face confrontation with Salafist groups over security measures. Tunisian security forces attempted to arrest the leader of the Salafist group Ansar al Sharia, Seif Allah ben Hassine, who escaped after a stand-off at a mosque in Tunis. Ben Hassine, a former member of the Tunisian Combatant Group, escaped arrest after a stand-off at a mosque in Tunis. Similar confrontations were anticipated in Benghazi involving the Ansar al Sharia Brigade, warning of consequences for foreign military intervention in Libya. Shiite extremists and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned the film depicting the prophet Mohammed, with Nasrallah calling it the worst attack on Islam and warning of dangerous repercussions if the film is broadcasted. Hezbollah has called for protests in response to a film insulting Prophet Mohammed, warning of holy punishment for offenders. The group's reaction may be an attempt to overcome setbacks due to sectarian divisions and its unpopular policy on Syria. Security observers suggest that the attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in a politically unstable country should have been anticipated and better prepared for. Some believe the attack was pre-planned, indicating possible intelligence failures. The United States intelligence community may have missed signals of a growing threat in Libya. National Counterterrorism Center Director Matthew Olsen stated that there was no specific intelligence of significant advanced planning for the attack on September 19. It is unclear if State Department security officials requested additional assistance from the host government. Members of Congress may need to explore the lack of appreciation of the threat environment and intentions of anti-U.S. entities. The security for U.S. diplomatic facilities worldwide is primarily the responsibility of host nations, with varying levels of local capacity. The U.S. provides additional security based on local assessments, which is not publicly disclosed. Facilities rely on a combination of host nation-provided guards, physical security measures, and State Department officials or contractors. The U.S. provides security for its diplomatic facilities worldwide, primarily relying on host nations. U.S. Marine Security Guard detachments are posted at some facilities to prevent the compromise of classified information. In the event of an attack, the Secretary of State must convene an Accountability and Review Board within 60 days. Congressional action has been taken to improve security conditions for U.S. diplomatic personnel and facilities. S. 3551, introduced by Senators DeMint and Corker, would require the President to submit a report to the Committee on Foreign Relations within 30 days of enactment. The President must submit a report to Congress within 30 days regarding the 2012 attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in Benghazi, Cairo, and Sana'a, as well as the overall security status of U.S. diplomatic missions globally. The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress before introducing combat-equipped personnel into a foreign country, with specific conditions for such actions. The executive branch contends that the President has broad authority to use military forces for purposes like protecting U.S. embassies and citizens. Presidents have deployed forces for diplomatic or civilian protection purposes since the 19th century, with recent instances during the Arab uprisings in 2011. Such deployments have historically not been controversial between Congress and the President. President Obama notified Congress on September 14, in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, about authorizing the deployment of security forces. The President authorized the deployment of security forces to Libya and Yemen to protect American citizens and property. Further notifications may be made for additional deployments or military operations in these countries. Forces were deployed to Cairo and Tripoli for the same purpose. A force of 16 personnel deployed to Tripoli, Libya to assist in establishing the U.S. Embassy after the 2011 civil war, but had been withdrawn before the September 11, 2012 attack. Concerns were raised in Arabic press about introducing new military forces in Muslim countries, warning it could provoke resistance. Ansar al Sharia Brigade in Benghazi was linked to the attack on U.S. personnel. The Benghazi-based Ansar al Sharia Brigade member threatened retaliation against the U.S. for any military intervention in Libya. The U.N. Security Council condemned the violent attacks on diplomatic premises, and the Secretary-General expressed deep concern. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concern over recent violence in Libya and the Middle East, stating that nothing justifies such killings and attacks. Member States may raise related issues during the general debate at the U.N. General Assembly's 67th session in New York City. The session began on September 18, with the general debate starting on September 25. In 2011, an interim agreement was reached on controversial issues related to freedom of expression and defamation of religion by the 57 member governments of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The OIC raised international attention and sought to combat discrimination and hatred towards Islam and Muslims through U.N. resolutions. The U.S. and other governments opposed measures restricting defamation of religion due to concerns about freedom of speech. In 2011, the U.S. and OIC member states supported resolutions promoting religious tolerance and combating discrimination. The resolutions endorsed by policymakers include controversial provisions calling for criminalizing incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief. The ambiguity surrounding this incitement remains a topic of discussion among key states, with OIC Secretary General emphasizing the responsible exercise of free expression to prevent violence. The OIC and religious authorities in member states view the controversial film as inflammatory, inciting recent violent protests. OIC Secretary General condemns attacks, attributing them to a film that hurt Muslim sentiments. He calls for structured international engagement and may seek UN involvement.
