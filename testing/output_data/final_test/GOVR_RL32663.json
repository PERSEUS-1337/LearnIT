    "content": "Federal government agencies and programs use various public policy approaches such as federal spending, tax laws, tax expenditures, and regulation to accomplish their missions. In FY2004, federal spending was $2.3 trillion and tax expenditures totaled approximately $1 trillion. Evaluating the performance of government activities has proven difficult and controversial due to the scope and complexity of these efforts. Evaluating the performance of government activities is challenging and contentious as different actors in the U.S. political system often disagree on the appropriate use of public funds, goals for public programs, and criteria for success. It is difficult to isolate the impact of federal programs from other factors like state governments, trends, and events. Federal agencies and programs may have conflicting purposes, making it complex to find and assess their effectiveness. Finding a balance among conflicting priorities in government agencies and programs can be controversial and difficult. The outcomes of some programs, such as foreign policy and research and development, are hard to measure due to time lags. Many observers believe that agencies do not adequately evaluate their performance or integrate evaluation efforts across boundaries. Despite challenges, both Congress and the President have made efforts in the last 50 years to address these issues. The Bush Administration's release of PART ratings, as part of the Budget and Performance Integration initiative, aims to use performance information to influence budget and management decisions for federal agencies and programs. This initiative is one of the government-wide efforts under the President's Management Agenda. The BPI initiative aims to have Congress and the Executive Branch consider performance information when making management and funding decisions. The PART assesses individual program management and performance, evaluating purpose, design, planning, results, and accountability. Approximately 400 PART scores were submitted with the President's budget proposals for FY2004 and FY2005, assessing programs totaling about 20% of the federal budget each fiscal year for five years.OMB assessed 234 programs for FY2004 and 173 programs for FY2005, totaling about 40% of the federal budget for those two years. The Bush Administration released the PART to assess federal budget programs, aiming to implement the objectives of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. However, controversy arose due to perceived lack of integration with GPRA, with OMB criticized for substituting their judgment for stakeholder interests. Under GPRA, agencies are required to consult with Congress and stakeholders when developing their strategic plans. OMB developed seven versions of the PART questionnaire for different programs, each containing approximately 30 questions divided into four sections. The effectiveness rating for each section is averaged to create a single PART score, with weights assigned to program purpose and design, strategic planning, and other factors. Under the oversight of OMB and agency political appointees, program examiners and staff negotiate and complete a questionnaire for each program to determine its PART scores. Disagreements are resolved in a manner consistent with settling appeals on budget matters, with final scores approved by OMB political appointees and the White House for inclusion in the President's budget proposal to Congress. The OMB's guidance to agencies for the PART emphasizes that the definition of a program is often based on a budgetary perspective. The PART process allows flexibility for OMB and agencies to determine the unit of analysis, typically using the formal budget structure for review. While the budget structure may not always align perfectly with program activities in practice, it is the most readily available option for assessment. The budget structure is used to convey PART results transparently to interested parties. Program activities are defined by OMB as activities and projects financed by a budget account. Each assessed program has a one-page \"Program Summary\" with four scores displayed. The OMB provides four separate scores for each program based on the PART assessment. These scores determine the program's overall effectiveness rating, which can be Effective, Moderately Effective, Adequate, or Ineffective. Programs without performance measures receive a rating of Results Not Demonstrated. The overall qualitative rating is driven by a single numerical score, but this score is not publicly disclosed in OMB materials. The OMB provides four separate scores for each program based on the PART assessment to determine overall effectiveness rating. OMB does not publish single numerical scores, but composite weighted scores can be manually computed using OMB's formula. The only explicitly defined rating is \"Results Not Demonstrated,\" interpreted as 'unknown effectiveness' by the GAO. The OMB provides four separate scores for each program based on the PART assessment to determine overall effectiveness rating. The ratings are driven by each program's quantitative score, with the only explicitly defined rating being \"Results Not Demonstrated.\" OMB aims for transparency in the PART process and solicited feedback to improve the instrument before publishing it with the President's FY2004 budget proposal. OMB aimed for transparency in the PART process by making detailed worksheets available and subjecting assessments to consistency checks. Formal criteria were established for assessing programs, and changes were made to achieve objectivity, such as eliminating subjective questions. NAPA reviewed the assessments to ensure consistency. OMB acknowledges that while subjectivity can be minimized, it can never be completely eliminated in the PART process. OMB staff exercise professional judgment with some degree of subjectivity, which is open for discussion and debate. Subjectivity in completing PART assessments can also come from White House, OMB, and other political appointees. Performance measurement in the public sector, including the PART, has limitations according to OMB guidance for FY2005 and FY2006. Performance measurement in the public sector, like the PART, has limitations as it only provides part of the information needed for decision-making. Evaluation data is necessary to understand why results occur and the value a program adds. Performance information cannot replace data on program costs, political judgments, creativity, or common sense. The purpose of performance measurement is to raise questions, not provide definitive answers. OMB's guidance for the FY2006 PART emphasizes the reliance on objective data for program assessments. The PART is a diagnostic tool aimed at improving program performance and linking performance to budget decisions. OMB's guidance emphasizes the use of objective data for program assessments. The PART assessments help link performance to budget decisions and provide a basis for making recommendations to improve results. The President's budget proposals for FY2004 and FY2005 were influenced by the PART process. An analysis of the Bush Administration's FY2005 PART assessments by the Performance Institute showed a correlation between PART scores and funding changes, demonstrating a link between budget and performance. The President's budget proposals for FY2005 varied based on OMB judgments, with effective programs seeing average increases, moderately effective programs seeing slightly higher increases, adequate programs seeing decreases, and ineffective programs seeing proposed decreases. The Performance Institute analyzed the President's budget proposals for FY2005 based on the PART assessments, showing a correlation between PART scores and funding changes. Effective programs saw average increases, moderately effective programs saw slightly higher increases, adequate programs saw decreases, and ineffective programs saw proposed decreases. The PART process captured the attention of federal managers, improved performance management, and served as a quality control tool for GPRA. Critics call PART a blunt instrument, but some experts, like Harry R. Hatry from the Urban Institute, believe the administration is making a genuine effort to evaluate programs. Mr. Hatry, an advisory panel member for the PART initiative, believes in evaluating programs for outcomes and tying spending decisions to this information. He acknowledges the challenges in determining the effectiveness of federal expenditures. While enthusiastic about adding information to the budget-making process, he is realistic about the impact on spending decisions in Washington. Scholars are also using statistical techniques to analyze the PART, including investigating the role of merit and political considerations in PART scores. The team investigated the influence of PART scores on the President's budget recommendations for FY2004 and FY2005. They found a positive correlation between PART scores and budget increases or decreases, with some evidence of political influence in FY2004. PART scores seemed to have an impact on small and medium-sized programs, but not on large programs. The PART is considered a form of performance budgeting, involving the use of performance information and program evaluations during the budget process. Scholars support using performance information but note a lack of consensus on its effectiveness. In state governments, developing performance measures is seen as useful for management and decision-making. Performance measurement has been somewhat effective in implementing changes in state governments, including resource allocation, programmatic changes, and communication patterns. However, there is limited enthusiasm for its impact on appropriation levels and cost savings. Legislative budget officers rank the use of performance measures low in cost savings and reducing duplicative services. Implementation of performance measures has improved communication between agency personnel, the budget office, and legislators. Performance budgeting is viewed as an old idea with a disappointing past and an uncertain future. Performance budgeting, viewed as an old idea with a disappointing past and an uncertain future, has been examined by GAO in relation to OMB's use of the PART for the FY2004 budget. The study focused on how the PART influenced OMB's decision-making process, its connection to the Government Performance and Results Act, and its strengths and weaknesses as an evaluation tool. GAO found that the PART helped structure OMB's use of performance information, increased transparency, and sparked agency interest in budget and performance integration. The GAO found that the PART increased transparency and agency interest in budget and performance integration. However, only 18 percent of FY2004 PART recommendations were directly linked to funding matters. The GAO also noted that the PART's main role was in improving program design, assessment, and management, rather than making resource decisions. Additionally, the GAO criticized the PART for not being well integrated with the Government Performance and Results Act, as OMB's judgment was substituted for GPRA judgments, which many agency officials found detrimental to their planning and reporting processes. The OMB's influence on program goals is evident in recent guidance requiring agencies to submit a performance budget for fiscal year 2005, replacing the annual GPRA performance plan. GAO highlighted the importance of integrating PART and GPRA to strengthen both programs. The GAO found a positive relationship between PART scores and proposed budget changes for discretionary programs, particularly for small programs. OMB made efforts to ensure consistency in program assessments for the PART. The OMB staff faced challenges in interpreting the PART questionnaire due to subjective terms, leading to inconsistent responses. Disagreements with agencies on performance measures resulted in some programs being labeled as \"Results Not Demonstrated.\" Lack of performance information hindered program assessments, prompting GAO recommendations for OMB to monitor agency progress on PART recommendations centrally. The OMB is working on improving the PART process by monitoring agency implementation, clarifying resource allocation expectations, and fostering dialogue with congressional committees. OMB aims to integrate GPRA and PART effectively. GAO recommended OMB to centrally monitor agency progress on PART recommendations. OMB Deputy Director for Management expressed commitment to enhancing the credibility and usefulness of the PART. GAO suggested that Congress adopt a more systematic approach to articulate performance goals and outcomes for key programs, facilitating OMB's understanding of congressional priorities. This could involve establishing a communication vehicle for performance goals, developing a structured oversight agenda for crosscutting programs, and using the agenda to inform authorization, oversight, and appropriations. The report discusses potential criteria for evaluating program evaluations, including validity, reliability, and objectivity. These standards may be considered by Congress during the budget process, oversight of federal agencies, and legislation related to program evaluation. The validity, reliability, and objectivity of program evaluations are crucial for measuring the effectiveness of federal programs. Validity is about how well PART scores reflect the actual effectiveness of programs, reliability is the consistency of measurements, and objectivity ensures unbiased and fair conclusions. These criteria are important for Congress during budget processes, oversight of federal agencies, and legislation related to program evaluation. The concept of objectivity in program evaluation involves judging the inquiry against a rational standard to maximize true findings. Subjective application of measurement tools can lead to inconsistent or unreliable results, indicating potential validity or application issues. Further analysis is often needed to identify and address problems. The Administration has conducted assessments on program effectiveness, but determining validity, reliability, and objectivity remains a challenge. Different views exist on the OMB's PART instrument and its determinations. GAO's study highlighted concerns, such as disagreements between OMB and agencies on assessment methods. The OMB and agencies disagreed on assessing program performance due to differing views on appropriate goals and measures, raising questions about validity. Stakeholder perspectives are crucial under GPRA but less certain under PART. Other issues identified by GAO also question the PART instrument's effectiveness in assessing programs. The OMB and agencies disagreed on assessing program performance due to differing views on goals and measures, raising validity questions. GAO identified issues with the PART instrument's effectiveness in assessing programs, including reliability and objectivity concerns. The PART instrument's use of terms without clear definitions raises questions about objectivity. OMB acknowledges subjectivity in evaluations but emphasizes transparency in the process. Despite efforts to minimize subjectivity, the PART implementation still places much decision-making power within the executive branch."
