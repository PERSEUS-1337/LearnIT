    "title": "SB 80",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code allows for an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" starting from January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted by a factor specified in the annual Budget Act. The earned income tax credit is only available when resources are allocated in the annual Budget Act for oversight and auditing. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage vary based on the number of qualifying children, with corresponding earned income amounts and phaseout amounts specified. The phaseout amounts for the earned income tax credit vary based on the number of qualifying children: $3,290 for no qualifying children, $4,940 for one qualifying child, and $6,935 for two or more qualifying children. Certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are modified to adjust the credit and phaseout percentages. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code is modified to adjust the earned income tax credit amounts and phaseout thresholds. The credit amount is increased to $3,400, and inflation adjustments will be recomputed annually. Any excess credit will be refunded to the taxpayer from the Tax Relief and Refund Account. The Franchise Tax Board can create rules for this section, and refunds will be treated like federal earned income refunds for benefit eligibility. Special requirements are exempt for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. The Franchise Tax Board must include scope, costs, and schedule changes for the California Earned Income Tax Credit in its next Special Project Report. The purpose of the credit is to reduce poverty among working families and individuals in California, with annual reports on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the credit. The Franchise Tax Board must report on the number of individuals claiming the California Earned Income Tax Credit, average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimate the impact on lifting families out of deep poverty. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a written report to various Senate and Assembly committees regarding the California Earned Income Tax Credit. Section 19136 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to adjust certain provisions related to failure to pay estimated income tax. No additional tax imposed if tax from previous year minus credits is less than $500, or $250 for separate returns by married individuals. Section 6654(f) of the Internal Revenue Code does not apply to nonresident individuals. The term \"tax\" refers to specific taxes imposed under certain sections, with credits against the tax provided by other sections. The credit for tax withheld on wages is specified in Section 6654(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. The applicable percentage is determined by Section 6654(d)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. Nonresident individuals are exempt from Section 6654(f) of the Internal Revenue Code. Penalties under this section are waived if the underpayment was due to new laws or changes in adjustment factors for tax credits. Amendments to this section from 2008 apply to taxable years starting in 2009. Amendments made to Section 19167 of the Revenue and Taxation Code apply to wages withheld on or after January 1, 2009. The section outlines penalties for failure to provide a copy of the return, an identifying number, or retain necessary documentation as required by specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Failure to register as a tax preparer with the California Tax Education Council may result in penalties. The penalty for the first failure to register is $2,500, which can be waived if proof of registration is provided within 90 days. Subsequent failures to register incur a penalty of $5,000. The Franchise Tax Board cannot impose these penalties until certain conditions are met. Starting from January 1, 2006, there is an annual appropriation in the Franchise Tax Board's budget to cover the costs of the penalty for failing to register as a tax preparer. An agreement between the California Tax Education Council and the Franchise Tax Board ensures reimbursement of first-year and annual costs related to the penalty. The Franchise Tax Board received the first year costs as per an agreement. Legislation aims to expand the California Earned Income Tax Credit in the future. This act is related to the Budget Bill and will take effect immediately."
