The term 'qualified investor' refers to an accredited investor as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, excluding individuals controlling at least 50% of the qualifying business entity, venture capital funds, and certain financial institutions. The angel investment tax credit limitation is $500,000,000 for each calendar year from 2013 to 2017. The Secretary allocates this limitation among qualified small business entities. Unused limitation can be carried over to the following year. The aggregate amount allocated under paragraph (2) for a year increases the limitation for the next year by that excess. No carryover is allowed past 2022. Business credit is part of the general business credit, except for personal credit under subsection (a). The credit allowed under subsection (a) for a taxable year shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A for that year. Any excess credit can be carried forward for up to 20 years if it exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a) and cannot be used in prior years due to the limitation. Special rules apply to related parties for the purpose of determining allowable credits. All related persons are treated as one person, and a person is considered related to another if their relationship would disallow losses under specific sections. Additionally, the basis of any investment eligible for a credit is determined for tax purposes. The recapture of credits under subsection (a) applies to qualified equity investments held for less than 3 years, with exceptions for certain transfers like death, divorce, or transactions under section 381(a). The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to prevent abuse, impose reporting requirements, and apply provisions to newly formed entities under section 381(a) transactions. Amendments to section 38 make the credit part of the general business credit. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the angel investment tax credit. Conforming amendments are made to section 1016(a) and the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. Sec. 30E. Angel investment tax credit effective for investments made after December 31, 2013."
