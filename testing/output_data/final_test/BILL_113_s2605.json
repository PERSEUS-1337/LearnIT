    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Religious Freedom and a Woman's Access to Contraception Act\". Congress finds that preserving a woman's ability to make contraceptive decisions is important for religious freedom, as outlined in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. The Act aims to protect Americans' free exercise of religion and prevent discrimination based on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and amendments provide protections to ensure medication privacy. The FDA approves contraceptives for pregnancy prevention and medical conditions. Government programs like Medicaid offer contraception access for low-income women, with significant spending on contraceptive services in 2010. In fiscal year 2010, government spending for family planning services totaled $2.37 billion, with Medicaid financing 75 percent of it. Over 19 million women were eligible for government-supported contraceptive services. Access to FDA-approved contraception was widespread before Obamacare, with over 85 percent coverage at large businesses. However, Obamacare's mandates now heavily influence personal health care decisions, including employer involvement and the individual mandate for health insurance. Obamacare has caused disruptions in personal health insurance options for many Americans, leading to plan cancellations and limited doctor choices. The Congressional Budget Office predicts a potential loss of 2 million jobs over the next decade due to Obamacare. Additionally, 2.6 million Americans, mostly women, are at risk of reduced hours and wages because of Obamacare mandates. Cuts to Medicare Advantage could result in a $1,538 annual benefit reduction for women relying on the program. Obamacare's payroll tax increase penalizes married working women. Limitations on health savings accounts affect 17.4 million Americans. The current Administration has granted over 1,000 waivers from Obamacare to various organizations. The Senate urges the FDA to study the safety of making prescription contraceptives available over the counter. Employers cannot prevent employees from buying FDA-regulated drugs or devices. Employees are empowered to make their own health choices. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is repealed, allowing employees to make their own health choices without limitations on prescribed drugs or Health FSAs."
