    "content": "On October 19, a conference report was submitted on H.R. 4328, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for FY1999, totaling $14.1 billion for Interior and Related Agencies. The bill passed both the House and Senate on October 20 and 21, respectively, and was signed into law as P.L. 105-277 by the President. The funding includes agencies and programs in five federal departments, with the President's FY1999 budget request at $14.23 billion compared to $13.79 billion enacted for FY1998. Title I of the bill includes agencies within the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Insular Affairs. Title II includes the Forest Service, research programs of the Department of Energy, Naval Petroleum Reserves, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and Indian Health Services. It also covers related agencies like the Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and National Endowment for the Arts. The President's FY1999 budget request for Interior and Related Agencies totals $14.26 billion. The FY1999 budget request for Interior and Related Agencies is $14.26 billion, an increase of $470 million from the FY1998 enacted level. Significant requested increases include Department of Energy, Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey. The FY1999 budget request for Interior and Related Agencies is $14.26 billion, with significant increases for various departments including the Department of Energy, Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, Smithsonian Institution, and Departmental Offices of the Department of the Interior. The Interior Subcommittee recommended a $13.4 billion funding bill with allocations for various programs such as the National Park System, National Wildlife Refuges, wildland fire management, Everglades restoration, Indian Health Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Subcommittee recommended $2.2 billion for Everglades restoration, $772 million for the Indian Health Service, $10 million increases for BIA education and law enforcement, and $398 million for the Smithsonian. Cuts included terminating the National Endowment for the Arts and reducing funding for energy programs. They also suggested extending the recreational fee demonstration program for National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, and National Forests to generate over $400 million in added revenue. Major reforms were proposed for the NPS Construction program, including a 50% reduction in staff. The Senate Interior Subcommittee recommended $13.4 billion in funding for various agencies, including $1.66 billion for the National Park Service. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved total funding of $13.43 billion for FY1999. Major reforms were proposed for the NPS Construction program, including a 50% staff reduction and contracting out 90% of construction projects. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved total funding of $13.43 billion for FY1999. The House passed H.R. 4193 with increased funding to $13.49 billion, $800 million below the President's request. The House also restored $98 million for the National Endowment for the Arts. The Senate bill (S. 2237) is $168 million more than the House bill. The Senate bill (S. 2237) is $168 million more than the House bill (H.R. 4193), with adjustments including increased funding for various agencies. Senate began debating S. 2237 on September 8, 1998, but suspended action after September 17. The Office of Management and Budget suggested a possible Presidential veto. On October 19, a conference report was submitted on H.R. 4328, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1999, totaling $14.1 billion for the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies. The bill passed both the House and Senate on October 20 and 21 respectively, and was signed into law as P.L. 105-277 by the President. Interior and Related Agencies appropriations increased by 16% from FY1991 to FY1995, reaching $13.5 billion annually. Interior appropriations increased by 16% from FY1991 to FY1995, reaching $13.5 billion annually. The Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 provided funding of $12.54 billion, reducing FY1996 budget authority by 9% below the FY1995 level. FY1997 funding increased to $13.1 billion and FY1998 to $13.8 billion. For further information on the budget of the Department of the Interior, visit the DOI's Office of the Budget website.

The Bureau of Land Management manages 264 million acres of public land primarily in the West, along with 300 million acres of minerals on federal and private lands. Controversies surround public land management, including issues with grazing, mining, logging, recreation, and wild horses. The FY1999 budget for the Bureau of Land Management was $1.191 billion, higher than FY1998 but lower than the President's request. The Bureau of Land Management's FY1999 appropriation is $43.0 million lower than the President's request. $619.3 million is allocated for land management activities, including protection, development, and mineral potential assessment. Another $286.9 million is provided for wildland fire management. The BLM appropriation for FY1999 supports fire activities, hazardous fuels reduction, and PILT payments. The PILT program provides funds to local governments for federally owned land. The appropriation is higher than FY1998 but lower than the President's request for FY1999. The BLM appropriation for FY1999 provides $97.0 million for activities on Oregon and California grant lands, including land improvements and resource management. $14.6 million is allocated for land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is $3.4 million higher than FY1998 but $0.4 million lower than the President's FY1999 request. The BLM appropriation for FY1999 includes $14.6 million for 12 projects, with $11.0 million allocated for construction. The law also designates funds for hazardous materials, range improvements, trust funds, and service charges. General provisions in the omnibus law impact BLM activities, including a moratorium on patenting mining claims under the General Mining Law of 1872. The General Mining Law of 1872 is impacted by the omnibus law, with provisions such as postponing the revision of hardrock mining regulations pending a study by the National Academy of Sciences. It reauthorizes the annual hardrock claim maintenance fee and includes administrative provisions for small miner waiver applications. Other provisions affect issues like grazing permits and land purchases in Alaska. The omnibus law includes provisions related to land purchases by the Secretary of the Interior, potentially impacting agencies like the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Specific provisions not addressing general policy issues are not discussed in the report. Some cross-cutting provisions were removed before enactment, such as the termination of the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project. The Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP) was terminated, a joint effort by BLM and Forest Service for managing 72 million acres of land. The BLM appropriation for FY1999 saw an increase in funding, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $1.16 billion, $78.1 million less than requested. Management of lands and resources received $596.4 million, while wildland fire management received $286.9 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.20 billion for the BLM in FY1999, $33 million less than requested but $64.7 million more than enacted for FY1998. The Committee recommended $633.1 million for the management of lands and resources, $289 million for wildland fire management, and addressed BLM policy issues in Title III. The House-passed bill for FY1999 contained $1.18 billion for BLM functions, with certain amendments made during House floor consideration. The bill continued the moratorium on patenting new mining claims under the General Mining Law of 1872 and limited funds for the ICBEMP in the Pacific Northwest. Key amendments proposed were rejected, including terminating the ICBEMP, extending the recreational fee demonstration program, and increasing funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Senate did not pass a free-standing bill. The Senate did not pass a free-standing bill appropriating funds for BLM and other Interior agencies. The Administration recommended $818.2 million for FWS, an increase of $45.7 million over FY1998. Congress appropriated $802.2 million, with the increase mostly within Resource Management, including the endangered species program. The Endangered Species program increased from $96.2 million to $124.8 million, with $20 million allocated for salmon and steelhead recovery in Washington state. The funding for endangered species programs in FY1998-FY1999 saw an increase, with $20 million allocated for salmon and steelhead recovery in Washington state. Smaller increases were provided for programs to conserve candidate species and for consultation with other federal agencies. The President proposed a $5 million Landowner Incentive Initiative in Recovery, and Congress approved a cap on money spent on listing, limiting the agency's discretion to transfer funds for additional listings. The Administration proposed changes to endangered species listing activities to meet lawsuit requirements and protect budgets of other programs. A cap was placed on listing funds, making it a zero sum game at a fiscal level. Additionally, de-listing and down-listing activities were transferred to the Recovery function. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund was proposed to receive $10.0 million (-7.2%). The National Wildlife Refuge Fund received $10.779 million in FY1998, which provides payments to local governments for the reduction of the local tax base due to federal land presence. Congress cut land acquisition funding to $48.0 million, a 23.4% decrease from the proposed $60.5 million. Calls for increased appropriations have been made due to the controversial payment levels and the misconception of entitlements by local governments. The National Park Service manages 376 units in the National Park System, including 56 National Parks. The System covers over 80 million acres in 49 states and the District of Columbia, attracting over 270 million visitors annually. The NPS aims to balance facilitating access for visitors while preserving natural and cultural resources. The National Park Service faces challenges due to static funding and increased visitation, leading to deferred maintenance. Temporary closures during a government shutdown in the late 1990s helped increase public support for funding. The budget request for FY1999 is $1.321 billion, with the conference agreement providing $1.286 billion for NPS operations. Maintenance backlog includes structures, roads, bridges, and employee housing units. The National Park Service has assets valued at over $35 billion, including permanent structures, roads, bridges, tunnels, and employee housing units. In FY1999, there was a proposed increase in maintenance funding to address the deferred maintenance backlog. Congress and the Administration have agreed to adequately fund the operation of the park system and address the maintenance backlog. The Administration proposed adding over $25 million annually from Park concessioners' franchise fees to address the maintenance backlog. This parallels the recreation fee demonstration program, which allows higher entrance fees to be retained by the unit where the money is collected. The goal is to incentivize agency managers to pursue self-financing for operations. The NPS is expecting to collect $136.5 million in FY1999 through incentives for agency managers to pursue \"self-financing.\" The fee demonstration program was extended for 2 years, but funding for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program was not approved due to limited resources. This program had previously provided matching grants for urban area rehabilitation projects. The Committee determined that the effort could not be accommodated due to limited resources. Congress approved the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998, providing park criteria and management reforms. The bill also allows revenue from concession contracts to be returned to National Park units. National Park roads will receive increased funding under the new surface transportation law. The Historic Preservation Fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants to states for activities specified in the National Historic Preservation Act. The Administration's FY1999 budget included $100.61 million for the Fund, with $50.61 million for grants-in-aid and $50 million for the \"Save America's Treasures\" initiative. The Resources Fund for America aims to prioritize the preservation of \"America's treasures\" such as documents, artwork, and historic structures. $25 million would be allocated for grants to states and Indian tribes for preservation projects, with an additional $25 million for federal agency projects. The Historic Preservation Fund budget includes $15.4 million for grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities for building preservation. The National Trust for Historic Preservation supports historically black colleges like Knoxville College, Selma University, Allen University, Tougaloo College, and Fisk University. It receives federal funding through the Historic Preservation Fund but aims to become self-supporting by FY1999. The Administration's FY1999 budget does not specify funding for the National Trust, aligning with Congress' plan to replace federal funds with private funding. Trust received $3.5 million in FY1998 as part of privatizing funding efforts during a transition period. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act did not mention a specific appropriation for the National Trust. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees proposed funding for the Historic Preservation Fund in FY1999, with no allocation for the National Trust or the \"Save America's Treasures\" initiative. Priority was given to cultural projects, with consideration for proposed millennium projects. The Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY1999 allocated $72.4 million to the Historic Preservation Fund, with $30 million designated for the \"Save America's Treasures\" program. This included funding for priority preservation projects such as the restoration of the Star-Spangled Banner and the Sewall-Belmont House. Additionally, $7 million was set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducts research on natural hazards, environmental issues, and resources. Its responsibilities were increased in 1995 with the consolidation of activities from other agencies within the Department of the Interior. USGS conducts surveys and research in four major program areas: National Mapping, Geologic Hazards, Water Resources, and Biological Research. The Administration has requested $806.88 million for FY1999 for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) programs, with increases in Water Resources Investigations, National Mapping Program, and Biological Research. Program decreases are seen in Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes, as well as General Administration. No change in FTEs is requested. The USGS Water Resources Investigations Program Activity includes proposed program increases totaling $17.5 million and decreases totaling $3.24 million for FY1999. The FY1999 budget for the USGS Water Resources Programs includes proposed increases for water quality information, with $10.5 million for the Clean Water and Watershed Restoration Initiative and $7.0 million for the Water Quality Information Initiative. Program decreases include reductions to the Hydrologic Networks and Analysis Program and the Toxic Substances Hydrology Program. The National Mapping Program budget includes proposed increases in the Earth Science Information Management and Delivery subactivity. The FY1999 Budget Request for USGS includes proposed increases for the Biological Research and Monitoring subactivity, with $12 million for the Species and Habitat Initiative. There are also proposed decreases in the Mapping Data Collection and Integration subactivity to achieve planned savings. The National Mapping Program highlights changes in efforts and an increased emphasis on civilian applications of classified data. The FY1999 Budget Request for USGS includes proposed increases for the Species and Habitat Initiative ($9 million) and the Clean Water and Watershed Restoration Initiative ($2 million). There are also proposed decreases in the Biological Research and Monitoring subactivity, including a cut in research and monitoring and elimination of USGS participation in a federal and state partnership program. Additionally, there are program increases for the Earth Surface Dynamics Program related to habitat restoration and species conservation. The House Appropriations Committee recommends $774.838 million for the U.S. Geological Survey, with proposed program reductions for various programs including Minerals Resources, Coastal and Marine Geology, and Energy Resources. This represents a decrease of $32.045 million from the Administration's request, with specific changes in funding levels for different programs within the USGS. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $772.115 million for the U.S. Geological Survey, a decrease of $34.768 million from the Administration's request. The conference agreement provided $797.896 million for the U.S. Geological Survey, with specific allocations for water resources investigations and economic conditions affecting mining industries. The Minerals Management Service administers programs for offshore minerals management and oil spill research, with anticipated revenues of $5.5 billion in FY1999. Revenues from onshore leases are distributed to states and the U.S. General Fund. For more information, visit the U.S. Geological Survey website. The Minerals Management Service administers programs for offshore minerals management and oil spill research, with anticipated revenues of $5.5 billion in FY1999. Onshore leases are distributed to states and the U.S. General Fund, while offshore leases revenues are allocated among coastal states, Land and Water Conservation Fund, Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. The Administration's FY1999 request of $128.5 million includes $122.4 million for Royalty and Offshore Management program and $6.1 million for oil spill research. Increased revenues from recent lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to continue, with exploration activity in ultra-deep waters increasing significantly. The House approved $122.5 million, including $116.4 million for the Royalty and Offshore program. The House approved $122.5 million for the Royalty and Offshore Management program and oil spill research. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $123.4 million for the same programs. The conference agreement allocated $117.9 million for royalty and offshore management and $6.1 million for oil spill research. Congress approved supplemental funding of $6.7 million for Gulf of Mexico exploration oversight. Increased receipts from OCS activity will offset the funding. For more information on the Minerals Management Service, visit http://www.mms.gov/ Royalty Issues. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is facing criticism for discrepancies in royalty valuation, with proposed rule changes for crude oil valuation. Industry officials oppose using index prices as a benchmark and have suggested alternative options. The MMS extended the comment period on the valuation rule to allow for further input, with industry representatives supporting the extension for improvements while critics argue against it. The oil valuation rule was postponed to June 1, 1999, instead of one year, due to a compromise between Congress and the Administration. Critics argue that the delay will cost taxpayers millions in underpaid royalties, while industry officials believe it will allow for a fair rule. An RIK Feasibility Study suggested that the royalty in kind approach could be workable. The MMS is preparing for a second pilot study on a RIK process involving natural gas and oil production in different regions. Legislation in the 104th Congress allowed states to collect royalties from federal oil and gas leases. The OCS moratorium on leasing activity was extended through FY1998. The OCS moratorium on leasing activity was extended through FY1998, with a ban on expenditure of funds for leasing in environmentally sensitive areas. President Bush issued a directive in 1990 banning leasing activity in areas other than Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama offshore. Lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico have been robust, with recent sales resulting in significant tracts leased and bonuses earned. The OCS leasing plan for 1992-1997 saw record-breaking sales, with over $2.4 billion in bonuses earned. The 1997-2002 leasing plan included a Western Gulf auction in August 1997, which generated $680 million in bonuses, 33% higher than the previous year. Annual lease sales in Gulf Coast planning areas continued despite congressional moratoria, reflecting high interest due to rising oil imports. The OCS leasing plan for 1992-1997 saw record-breaking sales, with over $2.4 billion in bonuses earned. The 1997-2002 leasing plan included sales in various areas such as the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Gulf of Alaska. The development of deep water wells is expanding rapidly, with MMS proposing to increase efforts in technological needs and environmental issues associated with deep water drilling. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for over half of the world's drilling rigs operating in deepwater. The Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) to ensure coal-mined land is restored for its pre-mining use. It also created an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund to reclaim hazardous sites. States and tribes were to develop their own regulatory programs. OSM's budget has decreased as reliance on state agencies increased. The Administration's FY1999 request is $276.6 million, with $93.5 million for Regulation and Technology programs. The Administration's AML request for FY1999 is $183.4 million, an increase of $2.6 million over adjusted FY1998 levels. The House added $2 million to raise the authority for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative to $7 million, resulting in a total request for the AML of $185.4 million. Both House and Senate appropriations committees modestly reduced the request for Regulation and Technology, with the final total approved by the 105th Congress being $278.8 million. The 105th Congress approved a total of $278.8 million, including $93.4 million for Regulation and Technology. AML funding is based on states' coal production levels, with \"minimum program states\" receiving a minimum funding level of $2 million. Despite objections, Congress allocated $1.5 million to these states in FY1996-FY1998. The Administration and Senate Appropriations recommended maintaining this funding level in FY1999. For more information on the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The Bureau of Indian Affairs offers various services to federally recognized tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides a wide range of services to federally recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. Key issues for the BIA include reorganization, tribal influence on programs, and equitable funding distribution among tribes. Additional concerns involve taxation of Indian businesses and tribal sovereign immunity from suit. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is facing pressure to reorganize, with proposals from tribes, the Administration, and Congress not always aligning. The BIA had planned to restructure through the \"tribal shares\" process but was advised against it. Appropriations committee reports directed the BIA to develop a reorganization plan and consolidate offices, with a focus on greater tribal control. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is developing reorganization plans and consolidation options to increase tribal control over federal Indian programs. This includes tribal contracting, tribal compacting, and Tribal Priority Allocations, which account for a significant portion of the BIA's operation of Indian programs. The equitable distribution of BIA funding, known as \"means-testing,\" is a key issue. Senate and House committees are addressing the distribution of Tribal Priority Allocations based on need and tribal business revenues, including gaming. The Senate and House committees are addressing the distribution of Tribal Priority Allocations based on need and tribal business revenues, including gaming. The Senate committee's FY1999 bill proposed reallocating funds from tribes with high revenues to those with lower revenues, while the House Committee provided funding for TPA allocation work and directed the BIA to develop criteria for equity in funding. Supporters claim that BIA's proposals maintain the federal trust responsibility and government-to-government relationship with tribes. The Senate committee's proposals aim to address inequitable distribution of BIA funding for tribes based on need and business revenues, including gaming. Supporters argue that poorer tribes are not receiving adequate funding and that means-testing TPA funds could penalize tribes with severe needs. Opponents believe that almost all tribes are in poverty, BIA funding is insufficient, and means-testing would violate the federal trust responsibility to tribes. Congress had previously dropped requirements for a formula and tribal income data in similar proposals. In response to concerns about inequitable distribution of BIA funding for tribes, Congress made changes to the distribution of FY1998 TPA funds. The distribution was based on recommendations from a tribal/federal task force, with a minimum funding amount per tribe set at $160,000 ($200,000 for tribes in Alaska). The GAO also conducted a study on TPA distribution, finding that two-thirds of funds were distributed based on historical levels and one-third based on formulas. The GAO study found that TPAdistribution per capita varied widely across BIA areas, tribal governments' reporting of revenues were inconsistent, and Congress made changes to the distribution of FY1998 TPA funds based on the study's recommendations. Congress dropped the proposed reallocation scheme and revenue data submission requirement but retained the need for alternative TPA funding methods. Additional controversial provisions were considered but not approved during congressional debates over FY1997 and FY1998 Interior appropriations. The House considered a proposal to restrict the Interior Secretary's authority to take land into trust for tribes without agreement on tax collection. The Senate proposed waiving tribal immunity to civil suits in federal court for accepting TPA funding, but this provision was withdrawn. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee discussed a bill restricting tribal sovereign immunity, focusing on insurance against torts. During hearings, the issue of tribal liability insurance coverage was raised. Congress required the Interior Secretary to study this coverage and make legislative recommendations. Both the House and Senate addressed further issues in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act, including placing BIA-funded law enforcement under centralized line authority. Congress approved proposals to make BIA law-enforcement funds unavailable for reprogramming and forbade the use of FY1999 funds for unpaid contract support costs. A one-year moratorium on self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts was recommended by the House and the Senate committee directed a study on the issue. Congress also approved environmental penalties against BIA and provided $3 million for environmental cleanup. Congress approved $3 million for environmental cleanup. The Senate committee included provisions regarding the \"Huron Cemetery\" in Kansas and lands in Scott County, Minnesota. The Senate also directed the Interior Secretary to develop a plan for BIA school facilities but Congress did not address this issue. An amendment was approved to prohibit the Interior Secretary from approving certain Indian gaming compacts. In FY1999, Congress prohibited the promulgation of regulations for approving gaming compacts without state approval. They also extended requirements for repaying misused funds in self-governance compacts. The BIA's FY1998 direct appropriations were $1.703 billion, with a proposed increase to $1.84 billion for FY1999, including various budget increases for different programs. In FY1999, the BIA budget included $86.6 million for education construction, a 59% increase from FY1998. New proposals included a law enforcement initiative to address rising crime rates in Indian country and a land consolidation pilot program to reduce management costs of allotted Indian trust lands. The House approved $1.714 billion for the BIA, a 0.6% increase from the previous year, while the Senate proposed $1.702 billion, a 0.1% decrease. In FY1999, the House recommended increases in various areas of the BIA budget, while the Senate committee proposed decreases in TPA and a shift in law enforcement funds. Congress in the Interior approved a budget of $1.702 billion, a slight decrease from the previous year. In FY1999, Congress approved a total of $1.746 billion for the BIA, with increases in various areas including TPA, BIA school operations, aid to tribal colleges, and BIA school construction. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for the BIA/DOJ law enforcement initiative, with a transfer of BIA law enforcement funds to another portion of the budget. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) oversees tribal regulation of bingo and gaming operations. Its budget authority comes mainly from fee assessments on tribes' Class II operations, with an increased collection limit of $8 million in FY1998. The NIGC was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) may collect up to $8 million in assessment fees for Class III and Class II operations. The Act also increased NIGC appropriations to $2 million and prohibited the Commission from amending definitions of electronic gaming devices. For FY1998, NIGC appropriations were $1 million, with no proposed appropriations for FY1999. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, authorized by Title III of the Act, is within the Secretary of the Interior's office. The Office of Special Trustee (OST) was authorized by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 to oversee the Interior Department's management of Indian trust assets and funds. This was established due to inadequate management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), resulting in potential losses for tribal and individual beneficiaries. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds owned by 338 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts, totaling approximately $2.5 billion in assets. The Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts hold $463.7 million in assets, including funds from various sources like claims awards and trust assets. In 1996, trust fund management was transferred to the OST from the BIA. A class-action suit was filed in 1996 regarding the reconciliation status of the IIM accounts. On June 11, 1996, a class-action suit was filed against the federal government on behalf of all IIM account owners, seeking an accounting of funds and full restitution. The case was certified as a class action in February 1997 and is scheduled for trial on March 15, 1999. In April 1997, the OST submitted a Strategic Plan for improving trust fund management, recommending a new agency for fund transfer and investment to aid Indian economic growth. Congress opposed the plan, directing the OST not to implement the new agency but to pursue trust management. In August 1997, the Secretary of the Interior agreed to implement aspects of the Strategic Plan for trust management systems. The Office of Special Trustee received $33.9 million in FY1998 funding, increased to $38.6 million with supplemental appropriations. The President proposed a $42 million budget for FY1999, with increases for trust systems improvements, settlement and litigation support, and trust funds management. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended FY1999 appropriations of $38 million, a decrease from total FY1998 appropriations. The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee recommended $39.5 million, including funds for trust systems improvement and settlement and litigation support. Congress approved the House figure of $39.5 million in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act. Congress also authorized the expenditure of current BIA and OST appropriations to meet unfunded costs of trust management improvement activities. Additionally, the OST was authorized to make fewer reports and allow withdrawals from trust accounts with balances of $1 or less and no activity for at least 18 months. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides funding for various activities in U.S. territories and freely associated states. The President requested $86.7 million for insular affairs in FY1999, with decreases compared to FY1998 appropriations. For further information, visit http://www.ost.doi.gov/insular-affairs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $86.7 million in FY1999 insular affairs funding, with changes in allocation for specific programs such as brown tree snake control and technical assistance. Funding for the Enewetak support program was recommended to remain at its FY1998 level. The FY1999 Interior Appropriations bill passed by the House contained $84.7 million in insular affairs funding, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending $86.9 million. The Senate committee provided $1.5 million for the Enewetak support program, $0.4 million more than the President's request. The conference report on the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill provides $87.1 million in funding for insular affairs, including $1.6 million for Enewetak support, which is more than the House and Senate Committee recommendations. The Interior Department prioritizes brown tree snake control as a significant ecological threat to Guam and other areas. The FY1999 budget includes increased funding for brown tree snake control in Guam and other areas, such as the Northern Mariana Islands and Hawaii. The House Appropriations Committee provided a substantial increase for the program, addressing concerns about the financial condition of the American Samoa government. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about American Samoa's fiscal problems in FY1999. The Senate report highlighted the territory's failure to pay for medical care in Hawaii and urged aggressive action by the American Samoa government. Additionally, there were issues with alien labor in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, with earmarked funding for a prison facility and crime laboratory from Covenant grant funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about American Samoa's fiscal problems in FY1999, including issues with medical care payment in Hawaii and alien labor in the Northern Mariana Islands. Earmarked funding was allocated for a prison facility and crime laboratory from Covenant grant funding. The Senate report directed the Interior Department to establish an ombudsman's office in the CNMI to assist workers, which was endorsed in the conference agreement. The Department of Agriculture requested $2.657 billion, with a significant portion allocated for wildland fire management. The House appropriated $2.523 billion, while the Senate recommended $2.623 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2.623 billion for the Department of Agriculture in FY1999, including $102 million emergency fire funds. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations enacted $2.752 billion, with increased funding compared to the Administration's request. The focus was on increasing fiscal accountability, with modifications to maintenance and funding restrictions recommended by the House and Senate Committees. The Senate Committee recommended funding allocations for the Department of Agriculture in FY1999, with a focus on fiscal accountability. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations enacted increased funding compared to the Administration's request. The Committee recommended restrictions on indirect support activities from the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund, but this was replaced with language prohibiting the use of these funds for such activities. Further reporting on \"indirect expenditures\" was required, with restrictions on indirect expenditures from specific trust funds and special accounts to not exceed 20% in FY2000. Timber sales and forest health issues are expected to be prominent in debates over the Forest Service budget and legislation. The FY1999 budget proposed decreases in salvage timber sales and new green sales. The proposed sale program would be at its lowest level since FY1950. The House Committee recommended timber sales offered of 3.6 BBF, while the Senate Committee recommended sales sold of 3.784 BBF. The Senate Committee recommended sales of 3.784 BBF and included provisions for timber sales, such as offering economically viable sales and expanding the authorized use of the Roads and Trails Fund to improve forest health conditions. Additionally, there were directions on timber sales and western red cedar shipments in Section 340. Section 332 prohibits prescribed burning until all economically viable wood products are removed from the area, potentially hindering forest health efforts. Section 335 authorizes Stewardship End Result Contracting Demonstration Projects in national forests in Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Oregon to achieve land management goals and meet community needs through timber removal. The Omnibus Appropriations bill enacted provisions related to timber sales and western red cedar shipments from the Tongass, Stewardship End Results Contracting Demonstration projects, and expanded use of the 10% Roads and Trails Fund for forest health improvements. Land management planning for federal lands has been controversial, leading to the enactment of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 guide land management planning for national forests and BLM lands. Public participatory planning processes have not led to harmonious land management. Bills to improve planning, some focusing on forest health, have been introduced but not enacted. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended incorporating scientific findings from the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project into land management plans. The Senate Committee recommended provisions prohibiting new land management plans for national forests until planning regulations are revised. The Senate Committee recommended provisions prohibiting new land management plans for national forests until planning regulations are revised, with exceptions for forests already undergoing revisions or operating under court orders. Section 329 directs the agency to continue management under existing plans until revised under new regulations, despite NFMA requiring revisions within 15 years. Section 322 prohibits the Forest Service from spending to complete the RPA Program, which is to become part of the agency's strategic planning under GPRA. The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes provisions such as the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act and the Land Between the Lakes Protection Act, which transfer management of certain areas to the Forest Service for specific purposes. The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes provisions for forest road construction in national forests, which is controversial due to concerns about environmental degradation and corporate subsidies for the timber industry. The Administration has proposed ending the use of purchaser road credits to finance road construction. The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes provisions to end the use of road credits for forest road construction in national forests, replacing it with a contract requirement for timber purchasers. Additionally, small businesses can opt for the Forest Service to build the road and pay more for the timber to cover construction costs. The Administration has also proposed revising regulations on forest management. The Administration proposed revisions to regulations governing the National Forest System transportation system, including a temporary halt on road construction in roadless areas. Environmental groups and the timber industry had differing opinions on the moratorium. The Department of Energy's FY1999 budget request for fossil fuel research and development reflects energy and environmental priorities. The Administration's FY1999 request for fossil energy is $383.4 million, with a focus on environmental issues related to electric power. Funding for coal R&D projects would increase by 21%, while petroleum R&D would increase by 3.3% and natural gas R&D would decrease by 1.5%. The Clean Coal Technology Program would not receive new funding, but $14.9 million was allocated for its administration. The House approved $315.6 million and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $376.4 million for FY1999, with a final conference agreement of $384 million for fossil energy research. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $112.2 million for natural gas research, while coal research funding increased by $6.4 million to $117 million. The difference between the House and Senate marks is mainly in the funding of the natural gas advanced turbine system. The Administration focuses on new technology utilizing natural gas as a clean fuel, while critics question the reliance on fossil fuel R&D and the role of natural gas as a \"transition fuel\" to non-fossil fuels. The Administration's focus on natural gas as a \"transition fuel\" to non-fossil fuels is being questioned, with concerns about the potential negative impact on jobs and the economy. Funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has shifted from oil purchases to sales to finance program costs. The Administration requested $209 million in conventional appropriation for operating and maintaining the SPR in FY1998. The Administration requested $160.1 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in FY1999, with infrastructure updates for system integrity. Congress approved $160.1 million, rejecting a proposed sale of SPR oil. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the oil field at Elk Hills, CA. Occidental Petroleum Corporation took title to the site and wired $3.65 billion to the U.S. Treasury. The California Teachers' Retirement Fund will receive 9% of the sale proceeds. The FY1999 budget includes an initial appropriation of $36 million for the Elk Hills settlement. The Administration requested $22.5 million for close-out activities at Elk Hills and environmental restoration at NPR-3. Congress mandated the transfer of Naval Oil Shale Reserves to the Department of the Interior for possible leasing. The appropriation was reduced to $14 million by Congress. The FY1999 budget includes a $808.5 million request for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program, a 32% increase from FY1998. R&D would increase by 35% and grants by 23%. The House approved $675.3 million for the program, including $43 million for the Advanced Turbines Program. The House mark for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program includes $9 million more for Weatherization grants, $2 million more for State Energy grants, and $34 million unspecified. Excluding the Advanced Turbines Program transfer, the House mark totals $632.3 million, $176.2 million less than the Administration Request and $45.4 million less than the Senate mark. The Senate Appropriations Committee seeks $677.7 million for the program, $130.8 million less than the Administration request, with reductions in various areas such as Transportation, Buildings R&D, FEMP, Industry, and Weatherization grants. In the Omnibus Appropriations bill, there are significant changes in funding for various energy programs. Industry receives $23.4 million less, Weatherization grants receive $25.1 million less, and State Energy grants receive $5.8 million less. The total mark is $692 million, an increase of $80 million from FY1998. This includes $526 million for R&D and $166 million for grant programs. The R&D funding includes increases for Transportation, Buildings, FEMP, and Industry. For more information, refer to CRS Issue Brief 97027 on Energy Efficiency. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides comprehensive health services for 1.3 million American Indians and Alaska Natives from over 545 tribes in 35 states. Services include hospital and health clinic programs, dental and mental health services, substance abuse programs, preventive health services, and funding for health professions. Funding is divided into Indian Health Services and Indian Health Facilities accounts for various health programs and facility maintenance. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives funding for health services and facilities through federal appropriations and reimbursements from insurance. The budget for IHS in FY1999 varied between $2.118 billion to $2.246 billion, with allocations for services and health facilities. The conference agreement for the Indian Health Service (IHS) budget in FY1999 does not include language mandating a pro-rata distribution of contract support costs. The Committees added over $35 million to address funding inequity and implemented a one-year moratorium on new contracts and compacts. The IHS serves a population with higher rates of illness and premature mortality compared to the general U.S. population. American Indians and Alaska Natives face higher rates of illness and premature mortality compared to the general U.S. population. They also have less access to healthcare, with insufficient healthcare providers and funding. Many IHS facilities are in need of repair or replacement. Funding for construction is lacking. Funding for construction of new facilities for Indian Health Service has decreased, while funding for health services has increased. The Omnibus FY1999 budget allocates $289 million for facility construction, repair, maintenance, and equipment. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation was reauthorized for FY1995-1997. The dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land partitioned in 1974 led to relocation of Navajo families, with some still refusing to move. Negotiations between the tribes and the federal government resulted in a proposed settlement agreement in 1995. The Hopi Tribe and Navajo families reached a settlement agreement in 1995, allowing for 75-year leases on Hopi partitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved the agreement, but some Navajo families oppose it. A deadline was set for signing leases, with enforcement of relocation for those without leases. The FY1999 Interior appropriations bill and related bills included a provision preventing ONHIR from evicting Navajo families from Hopi partitioned lands without providing a replacement home. The settlement agreement allows the Hopi Tribe to take action against the United States in 2000 if Navajo families have not entered into leases. Congress is concerned about the slow pace of relocation for Navajo families. The ONHIR faced challenges with low interest in relocating Navajo families to new lands, leading to discussions of terminating the relocation program. Funding for ONHIR in FY1998 was $15 million, with a proposed amount of $15 million for FY1999. Congress approved $13 million for ONHIR in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations act. The federal government's support for arts and culture programs and agencies, including the Smithsonian Institution, is a topic of debate. The Smithsonian, with 16 museums and galleries, receives over 70% of its funding from the federal government. Discussions revolve around whether federal support should continue or be scaled back to encourage more private or state support. The Smithsonian receives federal appropriations and has private trust funds. The FY1999 budget allocated $419.8 million, with $357.3 million for salaries and expenses. $16 million was designated for the National Museum of the American Indian construction. The museum was controversial, with opponents arguing for renovation of existing museums. Private donations and fundraising totaled $37 million. The American Indian museum project required $37 million in private donations and fundraising. Congress requested a cost reduction for the $110 million project. The FY1998 budget allocated $29 million for construction, while the FY1999 budget included $40 million for Smithsonian repair and renovation. Four Smithsonian buildings need $200 million for renewal. The Smithsonian is facing a funding shortfall for the renewal of four buildings, requiring approximately $200 million. Despite completing a strategic plan in 1999, the institution has struggled to fully implement initiatives to include Latinos in its operations. Latino representation in senior positions and on boards remains low, prompting criticism of the Smithsonian's efforts. The Smithsonian marked its 150th anniversary in FY1997 with public programs like \"America's Smithsonian.\" Facing a funding shortfall, it may introduce admission charges for special exhibits. The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee allocated $397.5 million for the Smithsonian in FY1999. Bond issues are being used for construction projects due to reduced federal support. The House Appropriations Committee approved $397.5 million for the Smithsonian in FY1999, with $346.449 million for salaries and expenses. The Senate Appropriations Committee ordered $404.554 million, including $352.154 million for salaries and expenses and $16 million for construction of the National Museum of the American Indian. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated $347.154 million for salaries and expenses, $16 million for construction, and $40 million for repair and restoration of Smithsonian buildings.

The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including the NEA, NEH, and IMS (now IMLS), has been operating on temporary authority since the expiration of the authorizing act in 1990. The 104th Congress established the IMLS under P.L. The 104th Congress established the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) under P.L. 104-208. Congress is debating federal funding for arts, humanities, and museums amidst budget constraints. Some argue for abolishing NEA and NEH, stating that culture can thrive with private support. Supporters of federal funding point to a long tradition of government support for the arts since 1817. Private sector spokesmen claim they cannot fill the gap left by the loss of federal funds. The Administration's FY1999 budget would provide $136 million for NEA and NEH and $26 million for IMLS. This includes funding for state Partnership funds, regional humanities centers, and General Operating support for museums to improve services. In the 105th Congress, some House members prioritized eliminating the NEA. A small group within the House Republican leadership, known as the \"values action team,\" coordinated legislative action with conservative groups. The Congressional Member Organization for the Arts advocated for full support for the arts at the FY1999 Administration budget request level. The President's Committee on the Arts recommended restoring federal funding for NEA, NEH, and IMLS to adequate levels. The goal was for appropriations to reach $2.00 per person by the year 2000 for all three agencies. The controversy over obscenity charges in a few NEA grants persists despite efforts to address the issue through legislation. No NEA projects have been deemed obscene by the courts. A federal appeals court deemed the \"general standards of decency\" clause unconstitutional. Congress cut funding for most individual artist grants, prompting NEA to eliminate grants by discipline except for Literature, Jazz, and National Heritage fellowships. The Supreme Court later reversed the federal appeals court decision in NEA v. Finley, allowing NEA to consider \"general standards of decency\" in grant judgments. The FY1998 Interior Appropriations bill (P.L. 105-83) allocated $98 million for NEA, $110.7 million for NEH, and $23.280 million for OMS, IMLS, with reform measures for NEA including increased funding to states and underserved populations, a 15% cap on funds allocated to each state, and emphasis on arts education. Three members of the House and three members of the Senate were recommended to serve on the National. The House and Senate recommended reducing the National Council on the Arts to 20 members from 26. Funding for NEA and NEH was specified, with the House initially proposing to terminate $98 million for NEA but later restoring it. The Senate recommended $100.060 million for NEA, $110.7 million for NEH, and $23.280 million for OMS, IMLS in the FY1999 Interior appropriations bill. The House restored $98 million for the NEA in FY1999, along with $110.7 million for the NEH and $23.405 million for the OMS. The authorization for the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act has expired, with no reauthorization legislation enacted by the 104th Congress. The IMLS was authorized through the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 merged the Institute of Museum Services with library resources programs. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee ordered reported S. 1020 to reauthorize the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 for 5 years. Some reforms in the Interior appropriations bill for FY1998 were similar to provisions in S. 1020. For more information on the National Endowment for the Arts, visit http://arts.endow.gov/.
