    "content": "The EPA proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone in January 2010, sparking interest from Congress and state officials. Public hearings were held in February 2010, with over 5,000 comments received. The final standards, initially expected by August 2010, have been delayed multiple times, with the latest deadline set for July 2011. The delays allowed the agency to analyze public feedback and seek additional advice. The EPA plans to seek additional advice from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) regarding the setting of NAAQS. They will prepare questions for CASAC during December 2010 and January 2011, with a public meeting expected in February 2011. CASAC will provide additional advice to the Agency by letter, and the public can submit comments. A final decision on the reconsideration is expected by July 29, 2011. The EPA plans to seek advice from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) regarding the setting of NAAQS. CASAC will provide additional advice to the Agency by letter, and the public can submit comments. The final decision on the reconsideration is expected by July 29, 2011, subject to interagency review before being promulgated. NAAQS are standards that apply to ambient air, with primary standards for public health protection and secondary standards for public welfare. NAAQS are standards set by the EPA to define clean air, identifying areas with excessive pollution levels that need to reduce emissions. State and local governments must create plans to meet these standards within a certain timeframe. EPA also regulates pollutants through national standards for products like automobiles. The EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to regulate pollutants emitted by mobile and stationary sources. These standards impact public health, economic sectors, and state and local governments. Criteria pollutants, such as ozone and lead, are identified under the NAAQS, with the EPA Administrator having the authority to add or remove pollutants based on their impact on public health and welfare. The EPA reviews NAAQS every five years, often due to lawsuits. In 2008, revisions were made to the ozone standard, but concerns led to a review in 2009. The agency suspended the 2008 standards and set a schedule for their review, releasing a proposal in January 2010. EPA is also reviewing other NAAQS. The EPA is in the process of reviewing several NAAQS, including the ozone standard. This review involves EPA scientists summarizing scientific literature in a Criteria Document or Integrated Science Assessment. The 2008 ozone revision identified 1,700 scientific studies on various topics related to ozone in the atmosphere. The EPA prepares a Staff Paper or Policy Assessment to provide options to the Administrator regarding the NAAQS indicators, averaging times, and numerical levels. The Clean Air Act amendments in 1977 mandated the appointment of an independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) to ensure scientific standards are met. CASAC, consisting of seven members from academia and research institutions, is supported by expert panels for NAAQS reviews. The panels can be large, like the 23-member panel for the 2008 ozone standard. The Clean Air Act mandates the appointment of an independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) to ensure scientific standards are met. CASAC and the public provide suggestions on panel membership for specific pollutants, with final selections made by the EPA. The panels review the agency's work during NAAQS-setting and NAAQS-revision. The ozone standard affects a large percentage of the population, with 39% of the U.S. population living in nonattainment areas under the 1997 standard. The standard has been strengthened, leading to more areas being affected and potentially requiring stricter emission controls. EPA set the primary (health-based) standard at 0.08 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period. The EPA and CASAC recommended strengthening the ozone standard due to evidence of health effects at levels below the current standard of 0.08 ppm. CASAC suggested a range of 0.060 to 0.070 ppm for the primary 8-hour standard, while EPA staff recommended considering a standard level below 0.080 ppm to 0.060 ppm. The EPA and CASAC recommended strengthening the ozone standard to a level within the range of somewhat below 0.080 parts per million (ppm) to 0.060 ppm. Stephen Johnson, the Bush Administration's last EPA Administrator, finalized the standard at 0.075 ppm (75 parts per billion). The implementation of this revision is pending as nonattainment areas have not been designated yet. The Obama Administration's EPA announced a further review of the NAAQS before completing the designations. Data from 2004-2006 showed that under the old 0.08 ppm standard, 85 counties had violations, while under the 0.075 ppm standard, 345 counties showed violations. The EPA and CASAC recommended strengthening the ozone standard to a level within the range of 0.060 to 0.070 ppm. Monitoring data showed that at 0.070 ppm, 515 counties exceeded the standard, while at 0.060 ppm, virtually every county with a monitor exceeded the proposed standard. Nonattainment designations will not be made until at least 2011, with the expectation that the number of counties exceeding the standard will be less due to cleaner air trends and regulations on pollution sources. Strengthening the standard may result in additional areas being designated nonattainment and require current nonattainment areas to adopt additional pollution control measures. Some industry groups challenged scientific conclusions on ozone standards before the 2008 review. Concerns have also been raised during the public comment period on the 2010 revision. Members of Congress have urged the EPA to maintain the 2008 standards, citing a lack of new data. EPA assessed the secondary NAAQS for ozone in 2008, which affects tree growth and crop yields. Damage from ozone exposure is cumulative over the growing season. The EPA staff recommended a new seasonal average for the secondary ozone standard, using a \"W126 index\" to cumulate hourly ozone exposures over a 3-month period. The recommended range was 7-21 parts per million-hours, but the CASAC ozone panel suggested the upper bound be no higher than 15 ppm-hours. The Administrator's final choice in March 2008 set the secondary standard at 0.075 ppm averaged over 8 hours, rejecting the higher recommendation. The EPA staff recommended a new seasonal average for the secondary ozone standard, using a \"W126 index\" to cumulate hourly ozone exposures over a 3-month period. The Administrator set the secondary standard at 0.075 ppm averaged over 8 hours, rejecting higher recommendations. The new proposal in January 2010 would adopt the W126 index and set the secondary standard at 7-15 ppm-hours, in line with CASAC's recommendations. Nonattainment with the proposed secondary standard could be widespread, with 196 counties potentially not meeting the standard at 15 ppm-hours. The EPA has proposed new ozone monitoring requirements for urban and non-urban areas to address the complexity of controlling ozone pollution, which forms in the atmosphere when volatile organic compounds react with nitrogen oxides in sunlight. Ozone concentration is influenced by temperature and sunlight, making it a summertime pollutant. Ozone formation is influenced by precursor gases, with lower emissions of VOCs leading to less ozone. However, higher emissions of NOx can sometimes result in lower ozone readings. Modeling ozone air quality is challenging due to the complex reactions involved. Various sources, including motor vehicles and industrial processes, contribute to ozone pollution, requiring a wide array of control measures. Industrial processes, especially in the chemical and petroleum industries, along with the use of paints, coatings, and solvents, are major sources of VOCs. Other significant sources include service stations, pesticide application, dry cleaning, fuel combustion, and open burning. Nitrogen oxides primarily come from motor vehicles, fuel combustion by electric utilities, and other industrial sources. The EPA conducts a Regulatory Impact Analysis to assess the costs and benefits of new or revised NAAQS standards, as required by an executive order and guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. The EPA's analysis of benefits and costs for implementing a new ozone standard shows a wide range of estimates. Benefits range from $13 billion to $100 billion annually, while costs range from $19 billion to $90 billion annually in 2020. The public health benefits include fewer premature deaths, hospital admissions, asthma attacks, and lost work and school days. The proposed standards aim to avoid 1,500 to 12,000 premature deaths annually by 2020. The EPA's analysis of benefits and costs for implementing a new ozone standard shows a wide range of estimates. Benefits in 2020 would include preventing 880 to 2,200 cases of chronic bronchitis, 2,200 to 5,300 nonfatal heart attacks, and 6,700 to 21,000 hospital and emergency room visits, among other health improvements. The agency notes significant uncertainties in cost and benefit estimates for various alternatives, including unquantified benefits like improved forest health and unquantified disbenefits like reduced UVB radiation screening. The EPA's analysis of benefits and costs for implementing a new ozone standard shows a wide range of estimates. The RIA states that future costs and benefits are not intended to be forecasts of actual implementation costs. Technological advances over time will likely reduce emission reduction costs. Quantifying and valuing health effects from pollution exposure remains challenging. Major concerns raised by the proposed standards include whether the Administrator has made appropriate decisions. The proposed standards by Administrator Jackson reflect recommendations from CASAC, raising concerns about their impact on public health and the economy. Stakeholders are reviewing the potential effects of the standards, including air quality projections up to 2020. EPA's analysis shows a wide range of estimates for implementing the new ozone standard, with challenges in quantifying health effects from pollution exposure. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), Clean Air Mercury Rule, Clean Air Visibility Rule, Tier 2 auto and light truck emission standards, and state/local measures aim to control pollution. Despite these efforts, EPA projects 99 counties in 19 states may violate the 70 ppb ozone standard by 2020. If the standard is lowered to 60 ppb, 451 counties in 44 states could be in nonattainment by 2020. Most areas must meet the new standards by 2015 or 2018, highlighting a need for stronger federal controls on ozone sources. The current monitoring network for ozone precursors may not be adequate to detect violations of a more stringent standard, with only 675 out of 3,000 counties having monitors in place. The majority of monitors are in urban areas, but ozone forms in the atmosphere downwind of emission sources, meaning rural areas could also have high concentrations. The EPA proposes additional monitoring in rural areas to detect ozone impacts on forests and agriculture. States would need to operate at least three ozone monitors in non-urban areas and one monitor in urban areas with populations between 50,000 and 350,000."
