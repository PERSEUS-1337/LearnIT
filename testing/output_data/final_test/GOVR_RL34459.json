    "content": "The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 (ADUFA I, P.L. 108-130) established a requirement for FDA to collect fees from sponsors of brand-name animal drugs to improve the review process and reduce backlog. Animal drug development can take 7 to 10 years and cost over $100 million. Timely and predictable reviews are crucial for companies, veterinarians, animal producers, and consumers. The FDA began discussions with animal drug sponsors for ADUFA reauthorization in 2007. In 2008, FDA published a reauthorization proposal and draft legislation for ADUFA II, along with a new user fee authority for generic animal drug reviews. Bills were introduced in the House to reauthorize ADUFA and establish a user fee program for generic animal drugs. The House passed bills H.R. 6432 and H.R. 6433, related to animal drug reauthorization, which were then forwarded to the full committee. The Senate later passed the House measure by unanimous consent, and it is expected to be signed by the President. The reauthorization was supported by various stakeholders to prevent disruption in the animal drug review process. The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 (ADUFA I, P.L. 108-130) established authority for FDA to collect user fees for the animal drug review process. Supporters viewed ADUFA reauthorization as crucial in the 110th Congress, while consumer groups opposed it due to safety concerns. The report discusses funding, program performance, proposed changes for ADUFA II, a new generic animal drug user fee program, congressional activity, and relevant issues. Appendices provide summaries of ADUFA I and FDA approval processes for animal drugs. The report will be updated with legislative actions and events. The Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2003 (ADUFA I, P.L. 108-130) established FDA authority to collect fees from sponsors of animal drugs to reduce application review backlog and decrease review time. ADUFA I authority is in sections 739-740 of the FFDCA. The law has not been amended since its original passage, with ADUFA I authority sunsetting in FY2009. The bills enacted in the 108th Congress were H.R. 1260 and S. 313. The FDA reported to Congress on the need for a user fee program to improve the review process for animal drugs due to inadequate resources and slow approval rates. Approximately $11 million in fees would be needed annually. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions stated that the FDA should eliminate backlogs, review 90% of new applications within 180 days, and address scientific issues. The Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA I) aims to improve the FDA's review process for animal drugs by collecting user fees for pioneer drugs, not generic ones. It sets guidelines for allowable activities and costs related to the review of applications, excluding postmarket activities. The Animal Drug User Fee Act (ADUFA I) sets funding triggers to ensure user fees supplement, not replace, appropriated funds for FDA's review of animal drugs. Triggers include maintaining a baseline level of non-user fee appropriations, specific funding for animal drug review activities, and explicit authorization for user fees in annual appropriations. The FDA must meet funding triggers to ensure user fees supplement, not replace, appropriated funds for animal drug review. These triggers include specific funding levels for salaries and expenses, limitations on spending for animal drug review, and the collection of fees only as provided in annual appropriations acts. FDA reports meeting each of the fee triggers in its annual financial reports to Congress. The FDA met funding triggers to ensure user fees supplement appropriated funds for animal drug review. ADUFA I authorized various user fees to provide predictable funding streams, including application fees for new animal drug applications and supplements. Annual fees are set by the Secretary at least 60 days before the start of each fiscal year and published in the Federal Register. The FDA sets various user fees for animal drug review under ADUFA, including NADA and supplement fees, product fees, establishment fees, and sponsor fees. The FY2008 amounts range from $4,125 for product fees to $172,500 for NADA fees. Sponsor fees apply if the sponsor has had a pending NADA, NADA supplement, or INAD submission since September 1, 2003. ADUFA I establishes that total revenues for each type of fee should comprise one-fourth of total fee revenues. FDA publishes information about fee collections in its annual financial reports to Congress. The Secretary can waive or reduce fees under certain circumstances, such as if assessing the fee would be a barrier to innovation or if fees would exceed FDA's present and anticipated future costs for conducting reviews. Small businesses submitting their first animal drug application may also qualify for fee waivers. The sponsor, a small business, is submitting its first animal drug application. Small businesses are defined as having fewer than 500 employees, including affiliates. FDA grants waivers for fees, with the most common being for sponsors of minor use or minor species indications. ADUFA I goals were developed to address the backlog of animal drug reviews and shorten review times. Goals were not incorporated in the statute but referenced in the Secretary's letter to Congress committees. Animal drug submissions vary in complexity. FDA and the industry agreed on a subset of six sentinel submissions for performance measurement under ADUFA I. Performance goals for the five-year period of FY2004 through FY2008 aimed for FDA to review and act on 90% of sentinel submissions within specified timeframes. Annual performance reports for FY2004 through FY2006 showed that all timeliness goals were met or exceeded each year, with the submission backlog eliminated by the end of FY2004. The goal of recruiting 50% of additional review staff by the first quarter of FY2006 was met, improvements were made in staff training and business systems, and guidance documents were published. FDA reported in FY2007 that the average review time for ANADAs was 570 days, with a backlog of 446 submissions. ADUFA user fee funds cannot be used for generic animal drug reviews. The Secretary's letter to congressional committees did not address goals for ANADAs review. The Secretary must segregate ANADA reviews from user fee-funded reviews to prevent delays. FDA's annual reports lack quantitative data on ANADA review times but mention staffing and performance levels. ANADA review times did not increase in FY2004 but rose in FY2005 and FY2006 due to understaffing. Table 2 compiles CVM workload data for the animal drug program overall from FY2004 to FY2009, showing submissions received, completed, approved, and pending. It is not valid to directly compare program outputs in Table 2 with goals in Table 1. The table does not include review times or specify which submissions the performance goals apply to. Despite an increase in pending ANADA supplements and a decrease in completed ones each year, the reasons are unclear. ADUFA I authorized funding levels for its five-year program period, from FY2004 through FY2008, with amounts ranging from $5 million to $10 million annually. The Secretary has the authority to apply a final-year adjustment for carryover into FY2009. Annual financial reports about the user fee program are required to be submitted to Congress within 120 days of the end of each fiscal year. FDA has published reports for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 addressing funding triggers. The reports for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 address the funding triggers and total costs for the review of animal drug applications under ADUFA I. Funding is primarily borne by FDA CVM, with support from the Office of the Commissioner and the Office of Regulatory Affairs. User fee funds have increased as a proportion of total funding. User fee funds have grown as a proportion of total funding for animal drug review, accounting for almost one-fourth of total funding in FY2006. ADUFA I user fee authority sunsets October 1, 2008, and without reauthorization, the FDA would have to lay off animal drug review staff. Personnel regulations require a 60-day notice for staff reductions. The FDA Commissioner expressed concern to Congress about potential staff attrition due to fear of job loss and the need to avoid sending required RIF notices. ADUFA I directs FDA to develop a reauthorization proposal for fiscal years 2009-2013 (ADUFA II), publish recommendations in the Federal Register, hold a public meeting, provide a 30-day comment period, and present final recommendations to Congress. FDA published its ADUFA II proposal on February 21, 2008, based on discussions with the industry and public meetings. Another public meeting was held on March 11, 2008, and written comments were due by April 14, 2008. FDA's legislative proposal to Congress was published on April 24, 2008. The FDA's proposal for ADUFA II reauthorization, published on April 24, 2008, maintains the basic structure of ADUFA I. The draft legislation largely reflects the Federal Register proposal, with significant changes to program financing and performance goals. FDA notes that user fees have not kept up with inflation, proposing higher fee revenues for ADUFA II to cover increasing program costs. Postmarket activities are not addressed in this proposal. The FDA proposes higher fee revenues for the ADUFA II program period, totaling $98 million over five years. They plan to eliminate inflation adjustments for fee revenues and retain current fee triggers and review time frames. Additionally, they suggest adding an \"end review amendment\" process based on industry discussions. The FDA proposes new processes for ADUFA II, including an \"end review amendment\" process and developing electronic tools for industry submissions. Other proposals include public workshops, streamlining foreign facility inspections, and discussing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in the review process. The FDA proposed a user fee program to support reviews of generic animal drugs, as they have struggled to meet the statutory requirement to act on ANADAs within 180 days. The agency published a draft legislative proposal for the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA) in 2008, with performance goals agreed upon with the industry. The FDA proposed the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act (AGDUFA) in consultation with the industry to address increasing review times for generic animal drugs. The proposal includes fee triggers, workload adjustments, and fixed annual increases, with notable differences from the previous ADUFA program. AGDUFA would collect application, product, and sponsor fees, but not establishment fees, with tiered sponsor fees based on the number of sponsors. FDA's proposed AGDUFA fee structure includes tiered sponsor fees based on the number of approved ANADAs, with authority to waive fees for minor use or species indications. Performance goals aim to review and act on generic animal drug submissions within specific time frames, with proposed targets decreasing from FY2009 to FY2013. No goals were set for backlog reviews or other matters. In June 2008, GADA testified that AGDUFA performance goals do not meet the statutory requirement of 180 days, with 270 days being the highest level achievable. The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health discussed ADUFA reauthorization and expressed support for both proposals, with some members preferring a \"clean\" reauthorization process. On July 8, 2008, bills were introduced in the House to reauthorize ADUFA (H.R. 6432) and establish a user fee program for generic animal drugs (H.R. 6433). Both bills were forwarded to the full committee by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health on July 9, marked up, and passed by the full committee on July 16. The House passed H.R. 6432 on July 30, 2008, under suspension. On July 30, 2008, the House passed H.R. 6432 and H.R. 6433 under suspension. The Senate passed the measure on August 1, 2008, and it is expected to be signed by the President. H.R. 6432 reauthorizes ADUFA with a total of $98 million over five years, extending authority for fee collection. H.R. 6432 reauthorizes ADUFA with provisions for fee collection, fee triggers, and reporting requirements. The program authority would sunset on October 1, 2013, with new requirements for public involvement in reauthorization planning. The bill reauthorizes ADUFA with provisions for fee collection, fee triggers, and reporting requirements. It includes requirements for public input before negotiations with industry, consultations with stakeholder groups, and publishing transcripts of negotiation meetings. Additionally, it alters the reporting period for drug experience reports and does not authorize the use of program fees for postmarket activities or establish new data reporting requirements for industry. H.R. 6433, the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2008, would establish a new animal generic drug user fee program with fee collection, triggers, and reporting requirements. The program would authorize about $27 million over five years, sunset in 2013, and refer to performance goals without explicitly establishing them. The bill H.R. 6433 would establish a new animal generic drug user fee program with fee collection, triggers, and reporting requirements. It would authorize about $27 million over five years, sunset in 2013, and refer to performance goals without explicitly establishing them. The bill also requires public input before negotiations with industry, consultations with stakeholder groups, and publishing transcripts of negotiation meetings. It does not authorize FDA to use program fees for postmarket activities or establish new data reporting requirements for industry. The bill H.R. 6433 would require animal drug sponsors to provide annual reports to FDA on drugs containing antimicrobial ingredients and refuse admission to counterfeit imported animal drugs. H.R. 6433 was amended for technical changes but no substantive changes. The House-passed bill incorporated an amended version of the H.R. 6432 ADUFA reauthorization bill and all provisions of H.R. 6433 (AGDUFA) without substantive changes. The Senate passed the engrossed version of H.R. 6432 on August 1, 2008, including reauthorization of ADUFA, the user fee program for generic animal drugs, and technical corrections to the FDAAA. The Senate passed a bill reauthorizing ADUFA, the user fee program for generic animal drugs, and technical corrections to the FDAAA. The measure has been sent to the President for approval. Companies are satisfied with ADUFA I for eliminating review backlog and improving review timeliness. ADUFA II aims to enhance FDA review capacity for complex reviews. The FDA's reauthorization proposal for ADUFA II includes an increase in user fee revenues to address a backlog of premarket inspections of foreign animal drug producing facilities. The proposal aims to collect almost twice as much in animal drug user fees during the five-year program period compared to ADUFA I. Program costs are driven by factors outside of the agency's control, such as employee salaries and benefits. The FDA's proposal at the March 2008 public meeting did not address the cost of inspections for foreign facilities manufacturing animal drugs. Critics have raised concerns about the lack of specific safety issues regarding these plants and the need for fees to be linked to inspection costs. The aim of drug user fees programs is to expedite drug evaluations without compromising safety and effectiveness. Critics argue that the user fee program for human drugs (PDUFA) gives too much influence to the industry, potentially speeding up drug approvals with inadequate safety review. They are concerned about industry involvement in setting performance benchmarks and potential conflicts of interest. The impact of PDUFA on drug safety is difficult to measure, and there is no clear evidence of its effect. FDA has been allowed to use user fee funds for postmarket safety activities since the second reauthorization of the law, but this authority is not present in ADUFA I for animal drugs. FDA's proposal for ADUFA II did not seek authority to use animal drug user fees for postmarket activities. Concerns about the safety of drugs approved for animal agriculture, particularly antimicrobials, focus on public health and environmental risks rather than the treated animal's safety. Critics are worried about the potential transmission of antimicrobial resistance. The FDA is concerned about the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals and the risk of transmitting antimicrobial resistant infections to people through food. Animal drug companies and livestock producers fear that strict regulation could harm animal health without benefiting public health. FDA has stated that there is evidence of adverse public health consequences from using antimicrobials in animals, and in 2003, they issued guidance for evaluating these drugs. FDA has not provided specific information on submissions, review times, outcomes, or costs for this class of animal drugs. The coalition of consumer groups opposed reauthorization of ADUFA but called for the use of ADUFA funds for postmarket activities related to antimicrobial resistance. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine is responsible for the premarket review of new animal drugs. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates new animal drugs, with specific requirements outlined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Most animal drugs fall under the definition of \"new animal drug,\" regardless of being brand-name or generic. Various application names and acronyms are used in the approval process. The animal drug approval process, outlined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, involves pioneer and generic animal drugs, referred to as \"(b)(1)\" or \"(b)(2)\" animal drugs. Sponsors conduct research on drug candidates, submit information for Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) approval, and request exemptions for clinical trials on drug safety and effectiveness. The FDA approval process for animal drugs involves submitting a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). Sponsors must demonstrate safety and effectiveness in the target species, as well as in humans and the environment. They also need to meet requirements for manufacturing methods, controls, and product stability before submitting a final \"Administrative NADA\" for agency approval. The FDA approval process for animal drugs involves submitting a final \"Administrative NADA\" containing agency sign-off letters, labeling proposals, and other information. An approved NADA signifies the product's safety and effectiveness for its intended use, with adequate manufacturing controls. Sponsors must also report postmarket performance and adverse events. Animal drug approval differs from human products by requiring testing for drug residues in food-producing animals. FDA evaluates if the drug meets safety standards for human consumption. The FDA evaluates animal drugs for safety and effectiveness in food-producing animals. Approved drugs must have a withdrawal time to ensure residues are below harmful levels. Clinical trials for animal drugs differ from those for human drugs, and veterinarians can use approved drugs for unapproved uses under certain conditions. The FDA evaluates animal drugs for safety and effectiveness in food-producing animals, with approved drugs requiring a withdrawal time to ensure residues are below harmful levels. Clinical trials for animal drugs differ from those for human drugs, with initial testing in the target species. CVM also has authority to approve generic animal drugs through the submission of an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA) for bioequivalent products. Holders of approved NADAs must submit patent information to CVM. CVM publishes patent information on approved NADAs and requires ANADA applicants to certify non-infringement or patent invalidity. Sponsors may need investigational exemptions for generic drugs with new uses. CVM can conditionally approve drugs for minor animal species or uncommon diseases, allowing marketing before full effectiveness data is collected."
