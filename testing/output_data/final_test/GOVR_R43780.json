    "content": "The current restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations involve questions about the nature of the restrictions, what constitutes an inverted domestic corporation, and whether the restrictions can be waived. Federal law prohibits government agencies from awarding contracts to inverted domestic corporations or their subsidiaries, with different provisions applying to various agencies and funds. The earliest provision, under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, applies to the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) prohibited DHS from contracting with foreign incorporated entities that were considered inverted domestic corporations. Subsequent amendments (P.L. 108-334, \u00a7523) extended the prohibition to subsidiaries of inverted domestic corporations. Later measures applied restrictions to specific funds across government agencies. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and subsequent amendments prohibited DHS from contracting with inverted domestic corporations. These restrictions are implemented through the Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements. The definition of \"inverted domestic corporation\" is based on Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which treats corporations meeting certain criteria as domestic corporations for U.S. tax purposes. There are differences between the contracting restrictions and the IRC provision, such as the effective date limitation and ownership threshold. The IRC provision captures situations where former shareholders of a U.S. corporation own between 60% and 80% of a foreign corporation after inversion. IRS regulations define \"substantial business activities\" as having at least 25% of assets and income derived from the foreign country. Waivers are permitted for restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 initially allowed waivers for certain circumstances related to homeland security, job loss, and additional costs. However, amendments in 2003-2004 removed the job loss and cost provisions and changed \"homeland security\" to \"national security.\" Later provisions followed a similar model, with a 2005 addition requiring agencies to waive the prohibition on certain actions. In 2005, legislation added a requirement for agencies to report waivers of the prohibition on contracting with inverted domestic corporations on national security grounds to Congress. Subsequent laws have incorporated this requirement. The FAR provisions implementing these restrictions generally align with statutory provisions, but there is a discrepancy in language regarding when the prohibition may be waived in the interest of national security. The enactments do not directly address whether the prohibitions extend to certain circumstances. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act established a preference for acquiring commercial items and exempted them from certain procurement laws. Regulations apply prohibitions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations to contracts for commercial items. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council has discretion in listing laws exempted for commercial items. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council has discretion in listing laws exempted for commercial items, but has chosen not to include prohibitions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations in Subpart 12.5. Recent amendments clarified that restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations apply to FY2013-FY2015 funds. The FAR \u00a79.108-2 no longer specifies restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations for specific FY2012 and earlier appropriations, but instead emphasizes restrictions from FY2008 to present. These restrictions prohibit the use of funds for contracts with inverted domestic corporations, except for certain exemptions outlined in the regulations. The FAR prohibits contracting with inverted domestic corporations, focusing on responsibility determinations rather than exclusion. This ensures contractors are capable of performing satisfactorily and on time. The FAR prohibits contracting with inverted domestic corporations based on responsibility determinations to ensure contractors are capable of performing satisfactorily and on time. Responsibility determinations assess if a prospective awardee meets criteria like financial resources and integrity. Non-responsible contractors are disqualified from awards, but determinations are made on a contract-by-contract basis. Once criteria, including collateral requirements, are satisfied, an entity could be eligible for an award. Exclusion is imposed for specific causes specified by statute or regulation, lasting for a prescribed period of time. Debarments under the FAR last for a period based on the seriousness of the cause, while suspension lasts until the conclusion of an agency investigation or legal proceeding. Excluded contractors are barred from new contracts and subcontracting on certain contracts. Contractors can face exclusion from government contracts for specific causes, with debarments lasting based on seriousness and suspensions until investigations conclude. Exclusion prohibits new contracts and subcontracting. Responsibility determinations do not grant due process, unlike exclusion cases. However, collateral requirements like those for inverted domestic corporations may challenge this distinction. The statutes prohibit contracting with inverted domestic corporations, but do not specify how agencies should determine this. Regulations require contractors to represent that they are not inverted domestic corporations when submitting bids. The offeror must represent that it is not an inverted domestic corporation or a subsidiary of one. Contracting officers can generally rely on this representation unless there is reason to question it. The regulations do not specify what constitutes a reason to question the representation. The Obama Administration has proposed amending the FAR to require contractors to expressly represent whether they are an inverted domestic corporation. The proposed amendment to the FAR would require contractors to expressly represent whether they are an inverted domestic corporation or a subsidiary thereof as part of their offer or annual registration in SAM. Contractors must also notify the contracting officer within five days of becoming an inverted domestic corporation. The government has recourse if a contractor falsely represents its status or becomes inverted during a contract. If a contractor reorganizes as an inverted domestic corporation or becomes a subsidiary of one during the contract period, the Government may stop paying for their activities. Remedies for non-performance could include price reductions, reprocurement at the contractor's expense, and termination for default. Monetary damages for fraud are also possible. The text discusses legislation introduced in the 114th Congress regarding contracting with inverted domestic corporations, specifically H.R. 1809 and S. 975. These bills aim to make the ban on contracting with such corporations permanent and strengthen it. Key differences include the definition of inverted domestic corporations and other restrictions outlined in the bills. H.R. 1809 and S. 975 aim to broaden the definition of inverted domestic corporations for contracting prohibitions. They propose lowering the ownership threshold from 80% to 50% and introducing an alternative test based on management and control within the United States. The bills H.R. 1809 and S. 975 aim to broaden the definition of inverted domestic corporations for contracting prohibitions by lowering the ownership threshold to 50% and introducing an alternative test based on management and control within the United States. The proposed changes would require significant U.S. business activities within the expanded affiliated group, with specific criteria for employees, employee compensation, assets, and income in or derived from the United States. Regulations would also define \"substantial business activities\" in foreign countries to prevent exceptions. H.R. 1809 and S. 975 would amend Titles 10 and 41 of the United States Code to bar defense and civilian agencies from contracting with inverted domestic corporations. The restrictions would apply government-wide and include first-tier subcontractors. H.R. 1809 and S. 975 would require agencies to include a clause in contracts over $10 million, prohibiting contractors from awarding first-tier subcontracts exceeding 10% of the total contract value to inverted domestic corporations or their subsidiaries. Failure to comply could result in contract termination or contractor debarment. These measures would extend to subcontractors as well. The proposed legislation in H.R. 1809 and S. 975 would require agencies to report waivers within 14 days of issuance to relevant committees. S. 975 also expands the circumstances for waiving restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations. S. 975 allows waivers for national security and efficient administration of health programs. It excludes non-FAR contracts and requires agencies to determine if contractors are inverted domestic corporations. The restrictions of S. 975 are limited to contracts subject to regulation under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, specifically procurement contracts for the direct benefit of the United States government. H.R. 1809, on the other hand, generally prohibits executive contracts. H.R. 1809 prohibits executive agencies from awarding contracts to inverted domestic corporations without defining the term \"contract.\" Previous enactments also used similar terms without clear definitions, with regulations in the FAR and agency supplements primarily implementing these measures. The restrictions apply only to procurement contracts and have not been extended to concession contracts, contracts awarded by state or local governments, or contracts under federal grants or cooperative agreements. The term \"contract\" in H.R. 1809 is not clearly defined, leading to potential broad interpretations. The restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations apply to procurement contracts but not to concession contracts or contracts under federal grants. Both H.R. 1809 and S. 975 exempt contracts entered into before their enactment from these restrictions. The proposed legislation exempts existing contracts from restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations to avoid breach of contract concerns. Parties to a contract are bound by their agreements and cannot impose additional requirements without mutual agreement and consideration. The proposed legislation includes new requirements for task and delivery orders under existing contracts to address concerns about inverted domestic corporations receiving orders. This is a departure from earlier statutes that exempted existing contracts from such requirements. Questions may arise about subjecting certain orders to these new rules. The breach of contract occurs when orders, especially those needed to meet minimum requirements under ID/IQ contracts, are subjected to conditions not in the original contract. In a letter to President Obama, Congress members urged him to use executive authority to deny federal contracts to inverted domestic corporations. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act grants the President broad authority to impose procurement requirements for \"economy\" and \"efficiency.\" The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (FPASA) grants the President authority to impose procurement requirements for \"economy\" and \"efficiency,\" including barring federal contractors from discriminating and requiring affirmative action. Executive action to restrict contracting with inverted domestic corporations could be based on FPASA, but some actions have been found to exceed the President's authority under FPASA. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984 prohibits agencies from contracting with inverted domestic corporations, which may conflict with the requirement for full and open competition. However, federal law also defines a responsible source as one that is qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations. The President's restriction on awarding contracts to inverted domestic corporations raises questions about their eligibility under federal regulations. The Buy American Act allows agencies to purchase supplies from foreign entities if they are produced in the US. The Buy American Act requires that end products or construction materials be mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Items must be \"substantially all\" made in the US, with at least 50% of their components sourced domestically. Services are generally not subject to the Act's requirements. Foreign corporations, not incorporated in the US, can still contract with the government, but certain laws may restrict them from specific contracts, such as those related to national security programs. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 limits certain construction projects abroad to \"U.S. persons\" or \"U.S. joint venture persons,\" excluding entities with \"business arrangements\" with Libya. Restrictions on contracting with foreign corporations are not the same as restrictions on contracting with inverted domestic corporations."
