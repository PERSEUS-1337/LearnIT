    "content": "The Act is titled the \"California Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention and Community Protection Act\" and includes sections on findings, definitions, project authority, eligible projects, environmental analysis, administrative and judicial review, acceptance of funds, and reporting. Congress finds that forested lands in California are densely overgrown, leading to extreme risk of insects, disease, and catastrophic wildfires. These fires threaten the health and safety of individuals, communities, and adjacent private landowners, as well as the environment. The Federal Government, including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, must address overgrown forest conditions in California to reduce wildfire risk and improve forest health collaboratively with local communities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk watershed\" as specified in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. It outlines the criteria for identifying at-risk watersheds with a high risk of severe fire impacts on key ecosystem components. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for private lands in high fire hazard zones and defines terms like \"community wildfire protection plan\" and \"county fire plan\". The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for a collaborative annual mitigation strategy for forest lands in California, including National Forest System lands and public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. It excludes lands within the National Wilderness Preservation System or other Federal land. The curr_chunk defines terms related to forest lands management, including eligible projects for hazardous fuels reduction and the Secretary concerned for National Forest System lands and public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The Secretary concerned will implement eligible projects on forest lands near at-risk communities or watersheds in line with wildfire protection plans. Projects will focus on fuel reduction and forest restoration in response to natural disasters. Environmental analysis will be conducted. The Secretary concerned will prepare an environmental assessment or impact statement for proposed eligible projects, including studying the proposed action and no action alternative. Alternative recommendations from counties can be considered if a project conflicts with their wildfire protection plan. The Secretary will evaluate alternative recommendations from counties if a proposed project conflicts with its wildfire protection plan. In case of a county emergency declaration, the Secretary may request the Council on Environmental Quality to develop alternative arrangements for the project. The Secretary may request alternative arrangements from the Council on Environmental Quality in case of a county emergency declaration due to a dangerous nuisance on forest lands. Mandatory information to be provided includes project description, forest fuel condition, and threats to public safety and vital assets. The proposed eligible project aims to reduce the risk of extreme fires and harm to public safety, infrastructure, watersheds, and wildlife habitat. The Secretary may request alternative arrangements in case of a county emergency declaration due to a dangerous nuisance on forest lands. The Secretary concerned transmits information to the Council on Environmental Quality regarding the threat to public safety, infrastructure, and wildlife habitat due to forest fuel accumulation. The Council must respond with alternative arrangements for the eligible project within 15 days of receiving a request. The Council on Environmental Quality must respond to the Secretary concerned's request for alternative arrangements for an eligible project within 15 days. Failure to comply or denial of alternative arrangements allows the Secretary to proceed with the project, bypassing certain laws and appeal processes, and without judicial review. SEC. 7. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\nAdministrative review of eligible projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review of projects is conducted according to the Act as well.\n\nSEC. 8. ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF FUNDS OR IN-KIND SERVICES.\n\nThe Secretary concerned can accept funds or in-kind services from public or private entities to support eligible projects.\n\nSEC. 9. REPORT.\n\nAn annual report on all eligible projects carried out under this Act must be submitted to the House of Representatives and Senate Committees on Natural Resources and Energy and Natural Resources."
