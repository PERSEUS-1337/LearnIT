    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Work Requirements for Welfare Programs Act of 2012\". The bipartisan 1996 welfare reforms focused on promoting work, replacing the ineffective AFDC program with TANF. Research showed that under AFDC, 65% of families remained on welfare for 8+ years, with an average lifetime receipt of 13 years. The 1996 welfare reforms emphasized promoting work to help low-income parents achieve self-sufficiency. These reforms led to increased employment and earnings for single mothers, a significant decrease in welfare dependency, and reduced child poverty in female-headed households. The authors did not intend for States to deviate from this pro-work focus. In the 1996 welfare reform law, Congress established new work requirements for welfare recipients and allowed limited waiver authority for TANF State plan requirements. However, Congress did not authorize waivers involving TANF work requirements in the Social Security Act. Any approved waivers could not waive features of those work requirements. The 1996 welfare reform law established new work requirements for welfare recipients and limited waiver authority for TANF State plan requirements. However, waivers could not override provisions concerning mandatory work requirements. The recent Department of Health and Human Services Information Memorandum suggesting states may waive the pro-work focus should be withdrawn or repealed for various reasons. The Department of Health and Human Services unilaterally allowed states to waive work requirements for welfare recipients, which goes against the 1996 welfare reform law. It is recommended that the Secretary repeal this decision and clarify that waivers of work requirements under the TANF program are not permitted. The Department of Health and Human Services allowed states to waive work requirements for welfare recipients, which contradicts the 1996 welfare reform law. It is recommended that the Secretary repeal this decision and clarify that waivers of work requirements under the TANF program are not permitted.

SEC. 3 prohibits TANF waivers related to compliance with work requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is prohibited from finalizing or implementing actions related to a 2012 Information Memorandum or approving waivers of work requirements under the TANF program.
