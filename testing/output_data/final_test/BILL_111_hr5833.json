The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates disclosure of ties to companies supporting Iran's proliferation activities under Executive Order 13382. Issuers must provide detailed descriptions of such activities, including nature, extent, revenues, and profits. The President will investigate any reported activities to determine if sanctions are warranted under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. The Commission is responsible for public disclosure of information received regarding these activities. The Commission is required to make information on issuers supporting Iran's proliferation activities available to the public, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Administrator of the General Services Administration, and relevant Congressional committees. The Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs define \"covered activity\" as an activity that could lead to sanctions under the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996. The provisions of this subsection will end when the President certifies that Iran no longer supports international terrorism. The amendment made by subsection (a) specifies conditions for Iran to cease pursuit of weapons and missile technology. It will take effect for reports filed after 90 days from the enactment of the Act."
