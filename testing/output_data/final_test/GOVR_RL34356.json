    "content": "The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) in the Department of Homeland Security conducts research and development with a budget of $932.6 million in FY2009. It has faced criticism from Members of Congress for its performance, with concerns raised about its ability to advance science and technology in combating terrorism and other security threats. The Senate Appropriations Committee described the directorate as a \"rudderless ship\" and expressed disappointment in its management. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed satisfaction with the management changes in the S&T Directorate, noting progress in resolving past difficulties. However, fundamental issues still persist. The report discusses the directorate's evolving mission, organization, assets, key policy issues, priorities, relationships with other R&D organizations, budgeting, and financial management. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security with a Directorate of Science and Technology. The directorate's mission is to protect the homeland by providing various responsibilities and authorities. The Directorate of Science and Technology's mission is to protect the homeland by providing state-of-the-art technology and resources to Federal, State, local, and Tribal officials. The Under Secretary's responsibilities include coordinating countermeasures against terrorist threats, regulating biological select agents, reducing R&D duplication, and integrating department activities in R&D. Collaboration with other agencies is crucial for the Under Secretary to fulfill these duties effectively. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology's duties include coordinating countermeasures against terrorist threats, regulating biological select agents, reducing R&D duplication, and integrating department activities in R&D. Additionally, the Under Secretary supports other DHS organizations by advising on R&D efforts, assessing vulnerabilities and threats, and overseeing department-wide R&D guidelines. The Under Secretary also oversees the primary R&D activities of the department, conducts research and testing, transfers technologies, and supports U.S. leadership in science and technology. Under Secretary Cohen reorganized the management structure of the S&T Directorate in August 2006. The directorate consists of six research divisions focusing on various areas such as Explosives, Chemical and Biological, and Borders and Maritime Security. Other functions are carried out by the Offices of Research, Innovation, and Transition. The S&T Directorate consists of 12 divisions and offices, each headed by a director reporting to the Under Secretary. The total FY2009 funding is $932.6 million, allocated to divisions, offices, and activities. The Management and Administration account funds the Under Secretary's office and salaries for headquarters employees. The Office of Special Programs and the Office of Agency and International Liaison also receive funds. The S&T Directorate receives funding through transfers from other programs. It has R&D assets including laboratories transferred into the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The Environmental Measurements Laboratory in New York City was transferred to the S&T Directorate by the Homeland Security Act, focusing on detection and monitoring of low-level radiation releases. The Environmental Measurements Laboratory (EML) was a subject of debate within the DHS regarding its positioning and size. In May 2007, it was decided that EML will remain in the S&T Directorate, operate in smaller facilities, and support both DNDO and other DHS organizations. The realignment process is ongoing. Additionally, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center was transferred to the S&T Directorate from the Department of Agriculture. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) conducts research on animal pathogens to protect livestock. Questions have been raised about its infrastructure, leading to plans for a new National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) at Kansas State University. Some policymakers are concerned about moving foot-and-mouth disease research to the mainland. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has testified that more information and analysis are needed to determine the risks of moving research from Plum Island to the mainland. Congress has enacted authorities related to the creation of the NBAF, transfer of PIADC research activities, and closure of PIADC. The 2008 farm bill addressed concerns about performing live foot-and-mouth disease virus research on the mainland, requiring a risk assessment to be completed by DHS and reviewed by the GAO. The Department of Homeland Security is evaluating options for the future use of the PIADC facility, including turning it into a government-run laboratory for alternative energy R&D, using the site for a wind farm, or selling it for commercial development. Section 540 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2009 directs DHS to \"liquidate the Plum Island Asset\" to offset the cost of environmental remediation at the PIADC site and construction of the NBAF. The Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL) in Atlantic City, NJ, was transferred to the S&T Directorate in FY2006 as part of an effort to consolidate the department's R&D activities. The TSL conducts research, development, and testing primarily related to explosives and conventional weapons threats. The National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) was transferred to the DHS S&T Directorate and renamed. It will be a high-biocontainment laboratory facility for homeland security biodefense research. The Homeland Security Institute (HSI) was an FFRDC that assisted the directorate in addressing homeland security issues. The Homeland Security Institute (HSI) assisted the directorate in addressing homeland security issues with scientific, technical, and analytical expertise. Its funds were project-based, with a separate $5.0 million appropriation in FY2008 and FY2009. Originally set to terminate in November 2005, the HSI's statutory authority expired on April 25, 2009. The Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) was established under Sec. 305 of the Homeland Security Act in March 2009 to continue similar functions. The Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) was established in March 2009 to provide homeland security analysis and expertise. Managed by Analytic Services, Inc., HSSAI's contract is for one year with potential extensions for up to $269 million in total funding. Concerns have been raised about the independence of analysis provided by HSI, as its contractor may compete for a continuation of its management contract. However, there has been little congressional criticism of specific Homeland Security Institute reports. The Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI) was established in March 2009 under the Homeland Security Act. Managed by the MITRE Corporation, it provides advice on concept evolution, development integration, and program-level technical expertise. The contract is for one year with potential extensions for up to $443 million in total funding. Several centers of excellence have been established under the Homeland Security Act, including those for Command, Control, and Interoperability; Border Security and Immigration; Explosives Detection and Response; Maritime and Port Security; Natural Disasters and Emergency Management; Transportation Security; and Risk Analysis of Terrorism Events. These centers are led by various universities and institutions across the country. Several centers of excellence have been established under the Homeland Security Act, including those for Command, Control, and Interoperability; Border Security and Immigration; Explosives Detection and Response; Maritime and Port Security; Natural Disasters and Emergency Management; Transportation Security; and Risk Analysis of Terrorism Events. These centers are led by various universities and institutions across the country. The Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE), National Center for Food Protection and Defense (NCFPD), National Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense (FAZD), National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), National Center for the Study of Preparedness and Catastrophic Event Response (PACER), and Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment (CAMRA) are some of the centers operated by consortia of universities, with funding and activities typically concentrated at the lead institution and major partners. The centers of excellence established under the Homeland Security Act are led by universities and institutions across the country. Funding for these centers is provided through the S&T Directorate's Office of University Programs. The research activities are managed by administrative staff at each center, with their strategies reviewed by DHS. The S&T Directorate plans to align the centers more closely with research divisions, potentially closing or merging some centers in the future. Additional university-affiliated activities are sometimes considered as centers of excellence. The Homeland Security Act established centers of excellence led by universities and institutions across the country. These centers receive funding through the S&T Directorate's Office of University Programs and are managed by administrative staff with strategies reviewed by DHS. Additional university-affiliated activities, such as UACs and RVACs, support the Division of Command, Control, and Interoperability. DHS plans not to fund some centers in the future. The university centers of excellence and university-affiliated activities, like RVACs, support the Division of Command, Control, and Interoperability. DHS plans to transition their research activities to a new Center of Excellence in FY2009. Congressional focus has been on the details of these centers and how their research aligns with DHS R&D needs. Stakeholders have resisted limited terms for the university centers of excellence. The DHS has established new university centers of excellence in specific research areas. Stakeholders resisted efforts to curtail the duration of these centers, but response to plans to realign them has been more muted. DHS has a special statutory relationship with the national laboratories of the Department of Energy, allowing them to engage in research for DHS as if they were being tasked by DOE. The DHS has a special relationship with DOE national laboratories, allowing them to conduct research for DHS as if they were tasked by DOE. The S&T Directorate has aligned its use of DOE national laboratories with its division structure to provide enduring basic research capabilities. The S&T Directorate aligns with DOE national laboratories for enduring basic research capabilities. The directorate faces policy concerns related to mission evolution, resource allocation, performer selection, prioritization, strategic planning, relationships with other R&D organizations, budgeting, responsiveness to Congress and industry, and performance evaluation metrics. The Homeland Security Act lacks a concise statutory mission for the S&T Directorate. The Homeland Security Act did not provide a clear statutory mission for the S&T Directorate, listing various responsibilities for the Under Secretary. There have been debates on the directorate's mission, including its focus on internal and external \"customers,\" the scope of its R&D mission compared to other DHS components, and whether it should have operational responsibilities. The S&T Directorate faces challenges in meeting the diverse needs of internal and external stakeholders. There is skepticism among DHS components about the value of S&T in serving their agencies. Under Secretary Cohen aimed to realign the Directorate to better meet the mission needs of DHS Components and first responders. The S&T Directorate needs to be more accessible to DHS customers in order to provide technologies and solutions that improve efficiency and safety. The directorate's R&D role within DHS has evolved, absorbing programs from other organizations but not taking over certain Coast Guard activities. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is now a separate organization responsible for radiological and nuclear issues. The S&T Directorate within DHS has evolved its R&D role, absorbing programs from other organizations but not taking over certain Coast Guard activities. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office is now a separate organization responsible for radiological and nuclear issues. Questions remain about the principles guiding R&D decisions within DHS and the scope of research undertaken by the S&T Directorate. Congress also established the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) within the S&T Directorate to administer an Acceleration Fund for Research and Development of Homeland Security Technologies. The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) within the S&T Directorate has shifted its focus to high-risk, high-reward R&D activities similar to DARPA. Under Secretary Cohen reorganized HSARPA to concentrate on projects with high risk and high reward through programs like HIPS and HITS. This change has sparked congressional interest in the best utilization of HSARPA. The S&T Directorate's high-risk, high-reward approach requires sustained financial commitment for success. Its programs include standards development, technology testing, and scholarships for future R&D capacity building. The directorate previously conducted operational programs like BioWatch until 2007. The S&T Directorate's focus on R&D and coordinative responsibilities with other federal agencies have been of interest to some Members of Congress. The shift of operational programs in 2007 aimed to prioritize R&D, but other activities and responsibilities remain unclear. Before DHS was established, homeland security was not a separate field of study, lacking academic R&D capability. The directorate funded scholarships for capacity building in this area. The S&T Directorate funded scholarships and fellowships for capacity building in homeland security, but there are questions about their effectiveness. Efforts are being made to align scholarship and fellowship activities with university research centers to improve synergies. There is a debate on whether DHS should continue developing an academic homeland security infrastructure or focus on using federal assets for R&D activities. The S&T Directorate's planning and prioritization process has been criticized for its opacity, leading to concerns about accountability and decision quality. In response, the directorate issued a strategic plan and a five-year R&D plan in 2007, updated in 2008. Integrated Product Teams now provide end users with more input into the prioritization process. The 2004 DHS strategic plan outlines goals for using science and technology to meet departmental missions, leveraging resources from various sectors to develop capabilities for information sharing, threat assessment, and counterterrorism efforts, including detecting and preventing the transport of dangerous materials. The plan also emphasizes developing and deploying systems to anticipate, respond to, and recover from homeland attacks. The 2004 DHS strategic plan established science and technology priorities for anticipating, responding to, and recovering from attacks on the homeland. However, it lacked guidance on their relative importance. The S&T Directorate initially did not have a publicly available long-term R&D plan, and while it developed an annual R&D plan for critical infrastructure protection, there was no similar requirement for other R&D topics. The directorate's annual planning process was internal and not publicly reviewed, making it challenging for outsiders to gain a holistic, multi-year perspective. The S&T Directorate released a separate strategic plan in June 2007, focusing on R&D topics, programs, milestones, and budget projections. However, the documents do not explain how funds were allocated among different homeland security research areas and projects. Specific choices like division topics, threat emphasis, and R&D project selection are mentioned but not clearly explained. The S&T Directorate's strategic plan focuses on R&D topics, programs, milestones, and budget projections. Funding allocations reveal a strong emphasis on developing countermeasures to weapons of mass destruction, particularly biological agents. The establishment of DNDO suggests a prioritization of nuclear and radiological countermeasures, impacting the relative priority of other R&D topics. The focus of the Directorate for Nuclear Detection and Countermeasures (DNDO) on unconventional, low-likelihood, high-consequence threats may stem from its initial programs heavily concentrated on biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. The increase in budget emphasis on radiological and nuclear threats from FY2006 onwards seems to be a strategic decision. The rationale behind DNDO's funding increase by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) remains unexplained publicly. The directorate's historical focus on unconventional threats has raised concerns about its ability to address the conventional needs of other DHS component agencies. The S&T Directorate has integrated support for other DHS agencies' needs into research divisions, making it difficult to track budget trends. The IPT process includes representatives from DHS operational agencies to ensure R&D efforts meet conventional needs. Procedures have been implemented to solicit input from operational components, identify technology gaps, and develop mechanisms to meet those needs through Integrated Product Teams (IPTs). The Integrated Product Team (IPT) process involves customer representatives, S&T Directorate providers, acquisition officials, and end user representatives to identify technology solutions for operational units within three years. Congress and observers view the IPT process positively compared to previous priority-setting efforts by the directorate. The S&T Directorate's IPT process involves customer representatives, acquisition officials, and end user representatives to identify technology solutions for operational units within three years. The process aims to address past criticism of difficulty in meeting end users' needs. The TechSolutions program provides a direct route for first responders to communicate their needs to the S&T Directorate. The Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee (HSSTAC) was created to advise the S&T Directorate on priorities and asset use, but its service has been sporadic. The committee's authority lapsed in 2005, was reauthorized in 2006, and has not been reauthorized since 2008. The HSSTAC was reconstituted in 2009 as an advisory committee under the Secretary's authority. It operates under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and is not constrained by specific statutory authority. The DHS also relies on the Homeland Security Institute for external advice and analysis in various areas. The Homeland Security Institute provides reports on protection, threat scenarios, standards integration, operational analysis, and lessons learned analysis to DHS. The extent to which their recommendations are implemented is not publicly known. Risk methodologies are being explored in the S&T Directorate, but their incorporation into decision making is unclear. A biennial biological risk assessment is tasked to DHS, with expectations that it will identify priority areas for R&D investments. The S&T Directorate is exploring risk methodologies for R&D investments, including a biennial biological risk assessment. However, concerns have been raised about the assessment's flaws and its connection to budgeting processes is unclear. The directorate's application of similar risk assessment methodologies to other threat areas or activities is also uncertain. The S&T Directorate's R&D activities focus on addressing a broad range of threats to homeland security, with a key emphasis on incorporating threat information into planning processes for developing counterterrorism technologies and enhancing preparedness. Coordination between agencies is crucial in ensuring that R&D plans are informed by evolving terrorist techniques, and timely transfer of threat information is essential for deploying effective technological countermeasures. The S&T Directorate focuses on a broad range of homeland security threats, incorporating threat information into R&D planning for counterterrorism technologies. It spans basic research to operational systems, collaborating with national laboratories, industry, universities, and government agencies. The balance between intramural and extramural R&D, and the directorate's role in operational activities are discussed. The S&T Directorate's planning and prioritization processes aim to balance R&D topics, including the allocation of resources between research and development. There is a focus on investing in basic research to address long-term needs and advance knowledge across disciplines. Criticisms have been raised about the directorate's R&D portfolio being skewed towards development rather than basic research, with a stated goal of allocating 20% of its budget to basic research. The FY2009 budget request was the first to allocate 20% of its budget to basic research, as defined by OMB in federal R&D budget analysis. The DHS portion of OMB's analysis in Table 1 includes R&D activities in various organizations, such as the S&T Directorate, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and U.S. Coast Guard. The National Science Foundation also provides annual statistics on federal R&D spending, categorizing it into basic research, applied research, development, and R&D plant. The National Science Foundation categorizes federal R&D spending into basic research, applied research, development, and R&D plant. There are discrepancies between NSF obligation figures for DHS as a whole and just the S&T Directorate, with variations in the balance between applied research and development according to OMB figures. The National Science Foundation categorizes federal R&D spending into basic research, applied research, development, and R&D plant. Discrepancies exist in NSF obligation figures for DHS as a whole and the S&T Directorate, with variations in the balance between applied research and development according to OMB figures. Some NSF figures are preliminary, raising doubts about data reliability and validity of mechanisms used. The S&T Directorate uses different categories than OMB and NSF, with only partial correspondence. Definitions of basic research are similar. The OMB and NSF have partial correspondence in their categorization of R&D spending. The S&T Directorate's investment portfolio lacks mid-term R&D, potentially hindering the transition of basic research into deployable systems. The S&T Directorate funds both extramural and intramural R&D activities, involving contracts, grants, and partnerships with industry and academia. The categorization of these activities is complex due to sponsorship of FFRDCs, university centers, and DOE national laboratories. Formerly managed by HSARPA, the balance between intramural and extramural activities is of interest to congressional policymakers. The S&T Directorate oversees R&D activities funded through contracts, grants, and partnerships with industry and academia, including FFRDCs, university centers, and DOE national laboratories. The breakdown of funding between intramural and extramural activities is not always clear in annual budget documents but may be provided in hearing testimony or briefings. The department's FY2008 budget request included plans to transfer certain operational programs. The S&T Directorate transferred programs to different DHS offices in 2007 due to reorganization and legislative changes. This included moving programs related to biological warning, incident characterization, chemical detection, and communication interoperability. The changes were driven by technical maturity and the creation of the Office of Health Affairs. The S&T Directorate's activities are detailed in annual budget documents, but tracking budget trends can be challenging. The Analytical Perspectives volume provides department-wide data on funding balance, but concerns exist about data quality for DHS due to inconsistent categorization and scope of activities included. Wide variations in funding balance between basic research, applied research, and development are observed. The S&T Directorate's budget shows wide variations in funding balance between basic research, applied research, and development. The data indicate fluctuations in the share of R&D budget authority devoted to different activities, with some activities possibly being recategorized due to changes in accounting or definition. Additionally, the Analytical Perspectives R&D data include some DHS activities that are not R&D, leading to discrepancies in total requested funding. The S&T Directorate's budget for DHS R&D programs in FY2009 was $1.368 billion, including salaries and expenses. The FY2009 edition also included $2.175 billion for Project BioShield. However, discrepancies exist in the Analytical Perspectives data, with some DHS R&D activities not accounted for in the total funding. The S&T Directorate's budget for DHS R&D programs in FY2009 was $1.368 billion, including salaries and expenses. The difference of $59 million is not accounted for by non-R&D activities in the S&T Directorate. Instead, it appears to reflect the omission of the Transportation Security Administration and Customs programs from the Analytical Perspectives data. The directorate's congressional budget justifications are the key source of information on the budgets of individual programs. The main difficulty in using this information to track trends from year to year is the changing organization of the directorate. The S&T Directorate's funding underwent organizational transitions, moving from R&D Consolidation to Explosives Countermeasures and then Laboratory Facilities categories. Tracking the laboratory's funding across these changes was challenging due to inconsistent figures in budget justifications. The directorate had to establish a new financial system when it was formed, incorporating existing programs but mostly engaging in new missions and activities. In 2004, the GAO reported that DHS faced challenges in consolidating financial management systems from its component agencies. The S&T Directorate encountered difficulties such as insufficient ethics controls and unclear administrative overhead costs. While the annual financial report for FY2007 showed improvements in internal financial controls, tests are still needed for financial system security, grants management, and payment management. Congressional policymakers are concerned about unobligated balances from previous fiscal years. The S&T Directorate has not always obligated the full amount of its annual appropriation due to higher appropriations than requested and slow hiring progress. Congress rescinded unobligated funds in 2006 and 2007. Unobligated balances do not expire, and Congress may intend for some to persist in S&T Directorate accounts. The S&T Directorate has been working to reduce its unobligated balance and improve its obligation rate. By the end of FY2007, they had reduced the prior-year unobligated balance to $74 million but had only obligated 75% of their FY2007 appropriation, resulting in an unobligated balance of $291 million being carried forward. In April 2008, the Under Secretary highlighted challenges in the DHS acquisition process and the need for process refinement. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology has statutory responsibilities including coordinating R&D activities, agreements with the Department of Energy, and coordinating with other federal agencies. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs Service, and Coast Guard were transferred to a new department without merging their R&D activities. Some transfers were protected from reorganization. The TSA and Coast Guard were to remain intact within the Department of Homeland Security. The Under Secretary is responsible for coordinating primary research and development activities, while allowing other Under Secretaries to carry out coordinated R&D activities. Consolidation of R&D activities within the Department of Homeland Security was initially streamlined, with the Customs Service and TSA transferring their R&D activities to the S&T Directorate in FY2005 and FY2006, respectively. However, Congress rejected proposals to transfer the Coast Guard's R&D program, which continues to operate independently. Advocates believed consolidation could enhance collaboration, synergy, reduce duplication, streamline processes, and improve budgeting and oversight. Critics doubted the S&T Directorate's ability to balance R&D priorities and support non-homeland security missions. Concerns included neglect of smaller programs and heavy emphasis on countering weapons of mass destruction. Experiences with consolidation have been mixed, with some integration going smoothly but absorbing TSA's R&D program being difficult. In 2006, the Senate Committee on Appropriations considered transferring the Transportation Security Laboratory back to TSA due to disagreements on research priorities. However, a memorandum of understanding was signed between S&T Directorate and TSA, leading to the proposal being abandoned. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) was established in 2005, taking over the S&T Directorate's radiological and nuclear countermeasures portfolio. DNDO became a separate organization under the Secretary's authority in FY2006, receiving funding through the S&T Directorate until FY2007. The establishment of DNDO as a separate organization outside the S&T Directorate in FY2006 was motivated by Congress's displeasure with the management of the S&T Directorate. Despite initial dissatisfaction, Congress approved the move due to potential liabilities. The confidence in the S&T Directorate's competence under former Under Secretary Cohen may impact future deconsolidation decisions. The creation of DNDO as a standalone office raises questions about its effectiveness. The establishment of DNDO as a separate organization outside the S&T Directorate in FY2006 raised questions about its effectiveness and coordination with the Under Secretary for S&T. The growth of DNDO relative to the S&T Directorate may represent a shift of R&D authority away from the Under Secretary. If DNDO budgets increase while S&T Directorate budgets decline or remain constant, it could impact DHS R&D efforts. If DNDO budgets increase while S&T Directorate budgets decline or remain constant, the DHS R&D budget may become more focused on DNDO efforts. DNDO conducts R&D, testing, and evaluation related to countering radiological and nuclear threats. The separation of DNDO from the S&T Directorate could make it challenging to rebalance the department's R&D activities if priorities shift. Concerns have been raised about the role of national laboratory personnel in the directorate's planning and decision-making processes. The DOE national laboratories provide technical experts to the S&T Directorate for program planning and oversight. Congressional interest has been raised regarding the influence of these experts on contractor selection and funding opportunities. The directorate also competes for R&D funding each year. The S&T Directorate competes for R&D funding through Broad Agency Announcements, with questions raised about the balance between awards to industry and national laboratories. The directorate designated some DOE national laboratories as intramural to address concerns about undue advantage. The DOE national laboratories were designated as intramural or extramural, affecting their eligibility for competitively awarded contracts. The plan was abandoned due to congressional opposition. The Obama Administration is considering transferring some national laboratories to the Department of Defense, which has faced opposition from some Members of Congress citing missions beyond national security. This transfer would also impact the relationship between DHS and the national laboratories. The Department of Homeland Security's relationship with the national laboratory would change if transferred to the Department of Defense. DHS activities would be conducted as \"work for others\" and require coordination with other agencies as per the Homeland Security Act. The Under Secretary is responsible for developing a national policy and strategic plan for federal civilian efforts against terrorism, collaborating with other agencies. The Department of Homeland Security collaborates with other agencies like the Department of Agriculture, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services in regulating biological select agents. Interagency coordination is crucial, but the national policy and strategic plan for federal civilian efforts against terrorism has not been released yet. Former Under Secretary Cohen mentioned challenges in developing the plan due to differing perceptions among departments and agencies. The Science and Technology Directorate faced challenges in coordinating with other agencies for Homeland Security efforts. Initially interpreting consultation as requiring concurrence, they later reinterpreted it as giving agencies an opportunity to comment. The Directorate released a document in December 2007 outlining baseline measures for research and development in collaboration with other federal agencies. The coordination document developed across the federal government in collaboration with other agencies is a first step towards a more prescriptive plan for homeland security. It will be updated annually to report on performance measures and progress towards goals. Former Under Secretary Cohen emphasized the importance of aligning strategies and missions in a changing world. The document aims to establish a common framework to help agencies identify synergies and unmet needs, potentially lowering barriers to achieving a more prescriptive homeland security R&D strategy. The S&T Directorate utilizes various mechanisms for interagency coordination. The S&T Directorate utilizes various mechanisms for interagency coordination, including memoranda of understanding, participation in interagency committees, joint management of programs, and coordination through White House groups like the NSTC Committee on Homeland and National Security. Coordination on specific R&D topics also occurs through the multiagency Technical Support Working Group overseen by the Departments of State and Defense. The S&T Directorate's strategic plan highlights the Interagency Programs Division's role in government-wide coordination and the Office of National Laboratories' coordination with DOE. The R&D plan lacks explicit identification of overlap with other federal agencies. Project BioShield, overseen by the Secretary of Homeland Security, involves the S&T Directorate in assessing threats to national security. Coordination with HHS allows for procurement of countermeasures for identified threats. Health and Human Services (HHS) can use funds allocated to DHS in FY2004 to procure countermeasures for biological agents. There are concerns about delays in threat determinations by DHS affecting countermeasure procurement. Discrepancies between DHS and HHS complicate program management. The S&T Directorate initially focused on transitioning advanced technologies into deployable equipment for end users. The S&T Directorate initially focused on transitioning advanced technologies into deployable equipment for end users, with a focus on \"low-hanging fruit\" capabilities. However, experts suggest a shift towards more diverse strategies, including fundamental research and riskier investments, to drive future breakthroughs and enhance DHS's mission fulfillment. The S&T Directorate is evolving its portfolio to include both near-term and long-term research, with plans to fund high-risk, high payoff projects. It is crucial to avoid failure intolerance by supporting Admiral Cohen in taking risks and holding him accountable. Effective assessment of research progress is key to sustaining long-term investments and terminating unproductive projects. Establishing criteria for success and assessing R&D programs effectively can be challenging, especially when it comes to setting quantitative goals and metrics. The impact of longer-range research may not be immediate, and success rates can vary widely depending on the nature of the R&D undertaken. For example, DARPA funds high-risk, high-reward projects, where individual success rates may be low but are expected. The success of DARPA activities is judged by their impact, with individual success rates expected to be low. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 aimed to improve efficiency and accountability in federal spending by setting goals and using performance measures. Strategic planning evaluation remains a weakness despite these efforts. The Bush Administration also prioritized performance measures in the budget process. The Bush Administration prioritized performance measures in the budget process, using the program assessment rating tool (PART) for performance assessment. Some S&T Directorate research portfolios underwent PART assessments, showing varying effectiveness. Factors like lack of initial homeland security focus in transferred programs and challenges in implementing new programs with homeland security focus complicate assessment. The White House Office of Management and Budget acknowledges the difficulty in predicting and assessing outcomes of long-term research programs. The PART documentation for S&T Directorate programs aims to provide clearer information about program goals and performance, R&D management, and effective practices. Some observers had hoped for quantitative metrics and goals in the strategic planning process, but the 2007 R&D plan mostly describes qualitative program work statements. The 2007 R&D plan for the S&T Directorate focuses on qualitative increases, improvements, and developments rather than quantitative criteria. There is a suggestion to use external bodies like the National Academy of Sciences to validate the directorate's strategic planning documents with goals and metrics. The S&T Directorate has not engaged in a rigorous assessment of its research activities by any independent organization. Stakeholder responsiveness has been a recurring issue since the department's creation. The S&T Directorate has taken steps to improve interactions with industry, including increasing accessibility through the Internet, expanding conference opportunities, and creating a Chief Commercialization Officer position. Funding opportunities are listed on a government-wide website for stakeholders. The S&T Directorate facilitates submissions of proposals through the Office of Procurement Operations and maintains an email address for concept submissions. Stakeholder conferences aim to promote business opportunities and partnerships in S&T research. Annual meetings are held to engage with stakeholders. The DHS S&T Directorate holds annual stakeholder meetings on each coast to facilitate collaboration with industry and other stakeholders. In January 2009, they released a Long Range Broad Agency Announcement to address concerns about accessing funding for homeland security R&D ideas. Former Under Secretary Cohen emphasized the importance of continued outreach efforts. Former Under Secretary Cohen emphasized the importance of outreach efforts to encourage industry participation. The S&T Directorate holds conferences in the US and UK to engage stakeholders and establish good contacts. A Commercialization Office was established to manage outreach activities. The Commercialization Office within the S&T Directorate develops and manages outreach efforts with the private sector, focusing on operational requirements and market potential to encourage private sector investment in meeting departmental needs. Industry has responded positively to these efforts, with improvements noted in interaction quality, response speed, and information provision to interested companies. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about difficulties in obtaining information from the S&T Directorate. Congress has criticized the S&T Directorate and DHS for not providing timely information, leading to concerns about poor response to Congressional requests. Under Secretary Cohen has promised to execute appropriations as intended by Congress and ensure fiscal accountability to DHS customers and the American people. The S&T Directorate CFO will help establish systems for budget transparency and responsiveness to Congress. Some members have criticized DHS for not providing requested information promptly. Several statutory authorities related to the S&T Directorate are expiring. Several statutory authorities related to the S&T Directorate have recently expired or will expire during 2009, including the Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee, the Homeland Security Institute, and the authority for DHS to enter into \"other transaction agreements\" for R&D projects. Policymakers have shown interest in these entities and authorities, with hearings held on the topic. Despite attempts to pass budget authorization legislation for DHS, none have been successful, leading to changes in programs through annual appropriations. Changes to the responsibilities, components, and activities of the S&T Directorate have been made through various legislative avenues, including annual appropriations bills, stand-alone bills, and specific provisions within broader legislation. Authorization legislation introduced in each Congress has not passed into law, with chairmen expressing intentions to reintroduce bills in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, authorization bills for the S&T Directorate are planned, but their success is uncertain. The S&T Directorate is funded through the annual homeland security appropriations bill. The FY2009 appropriation was $933 million, with a requested increase to $968 million for FY2010. The FY2010 homeland security appropriations legislation has not been introduced yet. H.R. 549, the National Bombing Prevention Act of 2009, authorizes the establishment of an explosives research and development program within the S&T Directorate. The responsibilities and authorities of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology were established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology, as established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, is responsible for advising the Secretary on research and development efforts, developing a national policy for countermeasures to terrorist threats, and coordinating civilian efforts in this area. The Under Secretary for Science and Technology is responsible for advising on research and development efforts, developing national policy for countermeasures to terrorist threats, and coordinating civilian efforts. This includes establishing priorities for national research, development, and procurement of technology to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.

The restructuring of the directorate's organization and operating policies was implemented by Under Secretary Cohen in August 2006. The directorate had a matrix organization with research areas known as portfolios managed by different offices. Intranural R&D was overseen by the Office of Research and Development (ORD), extramural R&D by the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), and systems engineering and prototype transition by the Office of Systems Engineering and Development (SED). The restructuring of the directorate's organization in August 2006 led to a matrix structure with portfolios managed by different offices. Only HSARPA remains in the current structure, with reduced scope. The matrix structure allowed for flexible fund allocation and information flow between federal researchers and the private sector. However, it also created management challenges and complicated reporting and oversight. The S&T Directorate's funding structure was complex, with different offices managing portfolios and indirect authority over project managers executing R&D. This setup was confusing to outside observers, including Congress. Historical funding data from FY2003 to FY2009 is presented in Table C-1 and Table C-2 for reference. The S&T Directorate's funding structure was complex, with different offices managing portfolios and indirect authority over project managers executing R&D. Historical funding data from FY2003 to FY2009 is presented in Table C-1 and Table C-2 for reference. Table C-1 shows funding in the old portfolio structure, while Table C-2 reflects the present division structure. DNDO funding is included in Table C-1 for historical comparisons, even though it is not part of the S&T Directorate. Activities of the S&T Directorate are described in Appendix D, detailing the six divisions, various offices, and activities funded by the directorate's management. The Chemical and Biological Division (FY2009 funding: $200.4 million) is the largest of the six research divisions within the S&T Directorate. It focuses on increasing preparedness against agricultural, biological, and chemical threats through improved threat awareness, advanced surveillance and detection, and protective countermeasures. The division also works on developing veterinary vaccines, animal disease countermeasures, and modeling the spread of animal diseases. The Chemical and Biological Division focuses on preparedness against agricultural, biological, and chemical threats through improved threat awareness, surveillance, and countermeasures. It includes programs in systems studies, surveillance, detection, forensics, response, and restoration. The division also works on developing veterinary vaccines and modeling the spread of animal diseases. The Infrastructure and Geophysical Division focuses on critical infrastructure protection, preparedness, and response. It includes technology development for infrastructure sectors, modeling and simulation for decision support, and preparation of the National Plan for Research and Development in Support of Critical Infrastructure Protection. The division also develops technologies for first responders and information management. The Command, Control, and Interoperability Division focuses on communications for emergency responders, cyber security, and threat assessment. The Borders and Maritime Security Division researches technologies to improve U.S. border and waterway security, with a focus on border protection and cargo security. The protection component (Border Watch) develops tools for border security officers and technologies for detection, identification, and enforcement at borders. The cargo security component focuses on improving cargo container shipment integrity. The Human Factors Division focuses on social and behavioral sciences, developing biometric technologies, understanding user acceptance of new technologies, integrating human operators and technology for security screening, understanding terrorist behavior, improving risk communications, and identifying public needs during emergencies. The Office of Research manages Laboratory Facilities and University Programs with funding of $161.9 million and $50.3 million respectively. The Laboratory Facilities program supports the operation and construction of the S&T Directorate's own laboratories. The Office of Innovation includes HSARPA with funding of $33.0 million, focusing on advanced research projects in homeland security. HSARPA, part of the Office of Innovation with funding of $33.0 million, manages two main programs: Homeland Innovative Prototypical Solutions and High Impact Technology Solutions. It also oversees the Small Business Innovation Research program and interacts with research divisions. The Office of Transition, with a budget of $28.8 million, expedites technology transition and manages the SAFETY Act Implementation. The Office of Test and Evaluation and Standards provides technical support for emergency responders to assess equipment and procedures, establishes evaluation methodology, and manages classified R&D projects funded by the Department of Homeland Security. The Office of Special Programs oversees classified projects within the Department of Homeland Security, while the Office of Agency and International Liaison manages international outreach and interagency coordination. Management and Administration activities, including funding for the Office of the Under Secretary, are separate and cover salaries and expenses for federal employees."
