The \"Immigration Rule of Law Act of 2015\" prohibits funding for specific policy changes related to immigration, including those outlined in memoranda issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security issued several memoranda on November 20, 2014, regarding policies for apprehension, detention, removal of undocumented immigrants, Secure Communities, prosecutorial discretion for individuals who came to the US as children, parents of US citizens, expansion of the provisional waiver program. On November 20, 2014, memoranda were issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the President regarding various policies related to high-skilled businesses, families of U.S. Armed Forces members, advance parole, access to U.S. citizenship, and modernizing the U.S. immigrant visa system for the 21st century. The memoranda issued on November 20, 2014, regarding high-skilled businesses, families of U.S. Armed Forces members, advance parole, access to U.S. citizenship, and modernizing the U.S. immigrant visa system for the 21st century have no legal effect and prohibit providing immigration benefits.

The budgetary effects of this section are not included in the PAYGO scorecard. SEC. 3 prohibits the use of funds for immigration enforcement policies that do not prioritize aliens convicted of serious offenses. SEC. 4 addresses policies disadvantaging the hiring of U.S. citizens and lawful aliens. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, individuals and businesses are required to purchase health insurance. Employers hiring U.S. citizens or legal residents must offer affordable health insurance or pay a penalty. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients with work authorization are exempt from these requirements. The sense of Congress is that policies granting deferred action to unlawfully present individuals discourage the hiring of U.S. citizens and legal residents. The Sense of Congress is on policies disadvantaging lawfully present aliens. The Congress believes the Director of USCIS should prioritize adjudicating petitions from aliens following proper immigration laws over those unlawfully present to prevent delays and unfair use of fees. The Congress believes USCIS should prioritize adjudicating petitions from aliens following proper immigration laws to prevent delays and unfair use of fees. Additionally, funds should be used to improve services and efficiency of the immigration benefits application process for aliens abroad or lawfully present in the US."
