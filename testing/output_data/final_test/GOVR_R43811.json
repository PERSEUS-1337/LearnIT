    "content": "Businesses typically use either cash basis accounting or accrual basis accounting to calculate their federal tax liabilities and for financial reporting. The choice of accounting method determines when revenue and expenses are recognized. Cash basis accounting records revenue and expenses when cash is paid or received, while accrual basis accounting records revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when payment is made. Recent congressional proposals may change tax accounting requirements for certain businesses, potentially affecting tax liabilities. Additionally, proposals may alter how the U.S. government's financial reports are prepared. This report explains the differences between cash and accrual accounting methods. The report explains the differences between cash and accrual accounting methods. Businesses with average gross receipts over $5 million are required to use accrual accounting for tax purposes. Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, businesses could choose their accounting methods for tax reporting. The current IRC requires certain businesses to use the accrual method to ensure proper reporting of income and tax liability. However, certain entities like farms, partnerships, S corporations, and PSCs are allowed to use cash accounting regardless of their gross receipts. For businesses with gross receipts under $5 million, the cash method is available for easier record-keeping and lower effort in determining tax liability. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to raise this threshold. Legislation has been introduced to raise the threshold for the use of cash method accounting from $5 million to $10 million. This includes bills such as the Small Business Accounting and Tax Simplification Act (H.R. 947) and the Start-up Jobs and Innovation Act (S. 1658). The Tax Reform Act of 2014 would also require certain partnerships, S corporations, and PSCs to use accrual basis accounting when their average annual gross receipts exceed $10 million. Raising the threshold for cash method accounting from $5 million to $10 million would expand its use for businesses with gross receipts in that range. The impact of this proposal on cash accounting overall is uncertain. Congressional proposals aim to change how the U.S. government's financial reports are prepared, with estimated revenue increase of $23.6 billion over 10 years. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Act (H.R. 476) in the 113th Congress would require changes in the federal government's budget and financial reports. The federal government's budget, financial reports, and performance evaluation reports may be required to be prepared using both cash and accrual basis of accounting. Legislation such as H.Res. 545 and the Truth in Government Accounting Act of 2011 have encouraged the use of accrual accounting. Cash basis of accounting is simpler than accrual accounting, recording income and expenses when payment is received or made. The cash basis of accounting records income and expenses when payment is received or made, but it does not accurately reflect a company's financial condition. Accrual basis accounting, in accordance with GAAP, is required for U.S.-based publicly traded companies. This method ensures that financial statements reflect a more accurate picture of a business's assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Accrual accounting, required for U.S.-based publicly traded companies by the SEC under GAAP, recognizes revenue and expenses when services are performed or products delivered, providing a more accurate financial picture. It focuses on recording accruals when payment is pending and deferrals when payment is received before services are rendered. This method ensures consistent measurement and treatment of economic events. Accounting provides consistent measurement of a business's economic events but does not communicate cash flow. A separate statement of cash flows is necessary for users to make informed decisions. It helps determine a business's short-term viability and ability to pay bills on time. Table 1 compares cash and accrual basis of accounting. Two scenarios illustrate how the choice of accounting method affects revenue recognition timing. The choice of accounting method (cash vs. accrual) impacts revenue recognition timing. Two scenarios show different financial conditions based on when payment is received. Financial statements (Figure 1 - Figure 6) illustrate why accrual accounting gives a more complete picture of a company's performance compared to cash basis. The impact of cash vs. accrual basis of accounting on cash flow for a small business is illustrated through examples of a fictitious company called ONSS. ONSS provides online subscription-only news service with a two-year commitment costing $2,400. Revenue is generated when the subscription is paid in full, while expenses of $600 per year are incurred. ONSS had $600 cash on hand on January 1, 2015, with owners' equity. In 2015, ONSS had $600 cash on hand and received a one-time payment of $2,400. They recognized $2,400 in revenue and $600 in expenses, resulting in a net income of $1,620 after taxes. In 2016, they incurred $600 in expenses, leading to a loss for the year. ONSS filed for a tax refund of $60 and had a total net income of $1,080 for the two years. In 2015, ONSS recognized $1,200 in revenue and $600 in expenses, resulting in a net income of $540 after taxes. In 2016, they had the same revenue and expenses, leading to a net income of $540 again. Total taxes paid for the two years amounted to $120. The net income for ONSS over two years is $1,080, with total taxes paid amounting to $120. The difference between cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is illustrated in Figure 1 - Figure 3, showing how revenue, expenses, and earnings can be exaggerated under cash basis. The financial statements for ONSS over two years show a net income of $1,080 and total taxes paid of $120. The difference between cash basis and accrual basis accounting is highlighted, with revenue and expenses being exaggerated under cash basis. Year-end financial statements for the first and second years are provided, showing revenue recognition and expenses incurred. Cash basis results in a loss for the company, impacting cash on hand and owners' equity. The company's financial condition deteriorated under the cash basis, showing a loss and decreased cash on hand and owners' equity. Higher taxes were paid in the first year, resulting in less cash at year-end. Despite differences in revenue and expenses, the net result was the same for both cash and accrual basis at the end of the second year. In 2015, ONSS incurred $600 in expenses with no revenue, resulting in a loss of $600. In 2016, they recognized $2,400 in revenue and incurred $600 in expenses, leading to an income of $1,800. Losses are deductible under IRC 172, allowing ONSS to carry forward the $600 loss from 2015. In 2015, ONSS incurred $600 in expenses with no revenue, resulting in a loss of $600. In 2016, they recognized $2,400 in revenue and incurred $600 in expenses, leading to an income of $1,800. ONSS carried the $600 loss from 2015 forward, resulting in a taxable income of $1,200 for 2016. ONSS follows the matching principle of accrual accounting by recognizing revenue for services provided in 2015, even though payment is received in 2016. This leads to ONSS borrowing $60 to pay taxes on the income recognized in 2015. ONSS borrowed $60 in cash to pay taxes after exhausting its cash reserves in 2015. They had a net income of $540 in 2015 and $600 in 2016 after recognizing revenue and expenses. Total net income for two years was $1,080. Payment received in the second year resulted in the same taxes and net income as under the cash basis. The tax reform proposals would require certain businesses with revenues over $10 million to use accrual basis accounting instead of cash basis. This change can impact a company's cash flow, potentially leading to the need to borrow money to meet financial obligations, including tax expenses. Businesses may need to borrow money to meet tax expenses under the new tax reform proposals requiring accrual basis accounting for companies with revenues over $10 million. ONSS borrowed cash to cover operational and tax expenses in the first year, as shown in the financial statements. At year-end, ONSS's financial statements for the second year show that full payment was received in January 2016 for services provided in both the first and second years. Under cash basis, no taxes were paid in the first year as payment was received in the second year. Cash on hand and shareholders' equity declined to $0. Under accrual basis, cash declined to $0 but shareholders' equity increased to $1,140, reflecting recognized revenue, expenses, and income. In January of the second year, revenue, expenses, and income were recognized and taxes on income earned were paid. The net result is the same under both cash and accrual basis accounting. Tax deferral may allow a company to delay paying taxes until a future date, increasing profitability in the short run. Accrual basis accounting provides a better understanding of a business's financial condition compared to cash accounting. Matching revenue with expenses consistently under the accrual method leads to a more accurate representation of financial results. Chairman Camp's Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposes changes in accounting rules for tax purposes. Businesses with average gross receipts over $10 million would be required to use the accrual method, while those with less than $10 million could use the cash method for easier record-keeping. Changing from cash to accrual method could result in taxpayers recognizing income due to the accounting method change. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed changes in accounting rules for tax purposes, requiring businesses with over $10 million in gross receipts to use the accrual method. This change could result in taxpayers recognizing income differently, affecting federal revenues and tax liabilities. The timing of income recognition can impact tax payments, with deferrals decreasing the real value of taxes over time. While accrual accounting provides a more complete financial picture, it may pose risks for businesses by requiring taxes on revenue earned before payment is received. The government's reliance on tax revenue for providing services to citizens is different from a profit-oriented business's reliance on assets for generating income. Assessing a government's effectiveness is based on service quality rather than revenue generation. Reporting in both cash and accrual basis accounting can offer a more informative view of government performance. Stakeholders use financial statements to make decisions, expecting certain characteristics for useful information. The foundational principles of accrual accounting include realization, matching, and relevance. Realization involves recognizing revenue when a product is delivered or service completed. Matching records revenue and expenses in the same period based on cause-and-effect. Relevance ensures financial information can impact decision-making with confirming and predictive values. Financial information should have predictive value to help users forecast future trends. Materiality refers to the impact of omissions or misstatements on judgment. Conservatism involves using lower estimated values for assets and stating future liabilities clearly. Comparability and consistency allow for analysis across periods by applying similar accounting principles. The Income Statement summarizes revenues earned and expenses incurred during a specific period. The Income Statement shows a company's revenue and expenses for a specific period. The Balance Sheet reflects the financial position at a specific point in time, divided into assets, liabilities, and owners' equity. The Statement of Changes in Owners' Equity tracks changes in equity over time, including stock issuance, repurchase, net income, and net loss. The Income Statement displays revenue, expenses, and operating income. Revenue represents the increase in net assets from selling products or services, while expenses reflect the use of resources in providing goods or services. Operating income is the gross profit minus all operating expenses. Loss results from higher expenses than revenue. Operating income is the difference between gross profit and operating expenses. Net income (net loss) is the difference after deducting all expenses from revenues. Loss carry forward is the carrying forward of a net operating loss to determine taxable income in future years. Balance sheet categories include assets, liabilities, and owners' equity. Assets are economic resources generating cash inflows, liabilities are obligations to outsiders, and owners' equity is the value of assets minus liabilities. Owners' equity is the value of assets minus liabilities. Balance Sheet\u2014Line Items Cash, Receivables, Payables, Cash loan payable, and Deferred Revenue."
