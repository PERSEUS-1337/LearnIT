Congress recognizes the importance of the Mississippi River as a vital natural resource and the backbone of the inland waterway system in the United States. The river basin covers over 1,000,000 square miles and plays a crucial role in the movement of goods like grain, coal, petroleum, and chemicals. The Mississippi River is crucial for transporting goods like grain, coal, petroleum, and chemicals worth billions of dollars. It is home to busy commercial ports like the Port of New Orleans and the Port of St. Louis. Safe navigation of the river is vital for the national economy, but extreme weather events pose challenges. The Council estimates that a disruption in navigation on the Mississippi River between December 2012 and January 2013 would have impacted 20,000 jobs and $7 billion in cargo. The Regulating Works Program of the Corps of Engineers is crucial for maintaining navigation during extreme weather events. The Federal Government, commercial users, and others share the responsibility to ensure the flow of goods during such events. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Extreme weather refers to severe flooding, drought, or other severe weather events that threaten safety, property, and navigation on inland waterways in the United States. The greater Mississippi River Basin includes specific hydrologic units, while the lower Mississippi River starts at the confluence of the Ohio River and flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The middle Mississippi River begins at the confluence of the Missouri River and flows to the lower Mississippi. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers. SEC. 4. GREATER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN EXTREME WEATHER MANAGEMENT STUDY. The Secretary will conduct a study of the Mississippi River Basin to enhance water resource project management in extreme weather conditions, assess modifications and new projects for navigation reliability and flood risk reduction. The study will identify necessary Federal actions for extreme weather mitigation, evaluate impacts on navigation and flood risk. The study of the Mississippi River Basin will evaluate navigation and flood risk management, identify challenges presented by extreme weather, and locate impediments to maintaining navigation during low water periods. Consultation with various agencies and committees will be conducted during the study. The study of the Mississippi River Basin will assess navigation and flood risk management, address challenges from extreme weather, and identify obstacles to maintaining navigation during low water periods. Consultation with multiple stakeholders, including Federal, State, tribal, and local agencies, will be crucial. The Federal government will cover 100% of the study costs, and a report must be submitted to Congress within 3 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. MISSISSIPPI RIVER FORECASTING IMPROVEMENTS. The Secretary will enhance forecasting on the Mississippi River by updating technology, constructing additional river gages, and sedimentation ranges on the river and its tributaries. The Secretary will prioritize sections of the Mississippi River for enhanced navigation by deploying additional automatic identification system base stations at river gage sites. A report on these activities must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Corps of Engineers has flexibility in maintaining navigation, as stated in Section 6 of the Act. The Secretary has the authority to construct and maintain paths to critical locations outside the authorized navigation channel on the Mississippi River, as well as mitigate any impacts through dredging. SEC. 7. MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ENVIRONMENTAL PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary will conduct a pilot program to restore and protect fish and wildlife habitat in the middle Mississippi River for at least 10 years, as part of the navigation project authorized by previous Acts. This includes activities to improve navigation while enhancing habitat. The pilot program aims to restore and protect fish and wildlife habitat in the middle Mississippi River by modifying navigation structures, creating side channels and islands, conducting necessary studies, and acquiring land from willing sellers. Cost-sharing requirements from previous laws apply to activities under this program. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the pilot program to restore and protect fish and wildlife habitat in the middle Mississippi River."
