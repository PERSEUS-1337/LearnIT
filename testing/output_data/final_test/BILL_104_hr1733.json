    "content": "The \"Patent Application Publication Act of 1995\" may be cited as the Short Title. It includes provisions for Early Publication. Section 122 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to ensure the confidentiality of patent applications, with exceptions for publication after 18 months for most applications. The confidentiality of patent applications is protected under Section 122 of title 35, United States Code, with exceptions for publication after 18 months. An application may be published earlier at the request of the applicant, and the Commissioner has the final authority on releasing information. Additionally, upon request, an application can be withheld from publication until 3 months after the Commissioner notifies the applicant. Applications filed under specific sections are not eligible for a request. The applicant must certify that the invention was not or will not be filed in a foreign country. The request is only available to independent inventors with status under section 41(h). The Commissioner may establish procedures and fees for the request. No patent application can claim priority unless a certified copy of the original foreign application is filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. The certification must be done by the foreign patent office and include the date of the application and filing of the specification. Translations may be required if the documents are not in English. The Commissioner may determine the time period for submitting an amendment with a specific reference to an earlier filed application. Failure to do so may result in a waiver of benefits under this section. SEC. 4. PROVISIONAL RIGHTS. Section 154 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to include provisional rights for a patent holder to obtain a reasonable royalty from anyone who uses, sells, or imports the invention claimed in the published patent application before the patent is issued. The United States grants provisional rights to a patent holder to receive a reasonable royalty from anyone who uses, sells, or imports products made by the claimed process in the published patent application. The right to obtain a reasonable royalty is only available if the invention claimed in the patent is identical to the invention in the published patent application. The right to obtain a reasonable royalty based on an international publication of an international application designating the United States starts from the date the Patent and Trademark Office receives a copy of the international publication, unless already communicated by the International Bureau. The Commissioner may request a copy of the international publication and its translation if an international application is in a language other than English. SEC. 5. PRIOR ART EFFECT OF PUBLISHED APPLICATIONS. Section 102(e) of title 35, United States Code, is amended to specify that an invention can be considered as described if it was published in a patent application or international application by another party before the applicant's invention. The amendment to Section 102(e) of title 35, United States Code, allows an invention to be considered as described if it was published in a patent application by another party before the applicant's invention. The Commissioner will recover the cost of early publication through adjusting fees or charging a separate publication fee. Conforming changes will also be made. The provisions of title 35, United States Code, are amended to include published applications in various sections and tables related to patents. Section 181 is also amended to include publication of an application. The text discusses amendments to include published applications in sections related to patents and the publication of an application in Section 181. Additionally, it mentions inserting phrases related to the publication of an application in different paragraphs. Section 154(b) of title 35, United States Code is amended to extend the term of a patent in cases of delays in patent issuance due to specific reasons outlined in the amendment. The term of a patent can be extended for delays in patent issuance, with regulations governing the determination of the delay period. The total extension period cannot exceed 10 years, and the extension granted should match the actual number of days the patent issuance was delayed. The term of a patent can be extended for delays in patent issuance, with regulations governing the determination of the delay period. No patent shall be extended if issued within 3 years after the filing date of the application, and the extension period will be reduced for delays in processing the application. The Commissioner will establish regulations for determining if an applicant has made reasonable efforts to process or examine an application. A patent cannot be extended beyond the expiration date specified in a terminal disclaimer. SEC. 9. LAST DAY OF PENDENCY OF PROVISIONAL APPLICATION. Amendment to Section 119(e) of title 35, United States Code, extends the pendency of a provisional application if the 12-month deadline falls on a weekend or holiday in Washington D.C. SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments in sections 2 through 7 will be effective on January 1, 1996, while sections 8 and 9 will be effective from the date of the enactment of the Act and apply to applications filed on or after June 8, 1995."
