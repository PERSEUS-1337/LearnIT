The American Academy of Pediatrics highlights the vital role of school nurses in providing comprehensive health services to children, promoting wellness, and early intervention services to improve health outcomes. School nurses also serve as leaders in coordinating school health programs and supporting academic achievement. Recent national data shows that 45% of public schools have a full-time school nurse, while 30% have a part-time nurse. Without a registered nurse, responsibilities fall on unprepared staff. 15-18% of students have chronic health conditions, requiring proper care. From 2002 to 2008, the percentage of children in special education with health impairments increased by 60%. School nurses manage children's complex medical conditions. The prevalence of prediabetes, diabetes, obesity, and asthma among children has been on the rise. The prevalence of food allergies among children under 18 increased by 19% from 1997 to 2007. School nurses play a crucial role in providing mental health services, spending 32% of their time on interventions and screenings. In 2011, 9.7% of children under 19, totaling 7.6 million, were without health insurance. More than 1,600,000 children experience homelessness each year in the United States, leading to increased rates of health conditions and affecting their development and learning. School nurses serve as a safety net for vulnerable children, providing access to healthcare. Communicable and infectious diseases cause millions of school days lost annually. Having a school nurse increases immunization rates. A 2011 study found that a school nurse saves time for school staff by addressing health concerns, saving principals almost an hour a day, teachers 20 minutes, and clerical staff over 45 minutes. Establishing a balanced student-to-school nurse ratio based on health acuity and workload is crucial. Establishing a balanced student-to-school nurse ratio based on health acuity and workload can lead to better student outcomes. SEC. 3. REDUCING STUDENT-TO-SCHOOL NURSE RATIOS. In this section, definitions include terms from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the meaning of \"acuity\" in relation to a patient's sickness level, and the definition of an \"eligible entity\" as a local educational agency with a high student-to-school nurse ratio or a consortium of such agencies. In this section, definitions include terms from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the meaning of \"acuity\" in relation to a patient's sickness level, and the definition of an \"eligible entity\" as a local educational agency with a high student-to-school nurse ratio or a consortium of such agencies. The term \"high-need local educational agency\" refers to an agency serving a minimum number of children from low-income families or with a certain percentage below the poverty line. A \"nurse\" is defined as a licensed nurse under State law, and the \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. \"Workload\" for a nurse is the time taken to provide care and complete assigned tasks. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will award demonstration grants to eligible entities to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools. Eligible entities must submit an application for the grant as required by the Secretary. Each grant application must include current student-to-school nurse ratios, health acuity levels, and workload of school nurses in public elementary and secondary schools. Priority is given to high-need local educational agencies or consortia showing the greatest need for new nursing services among students. The Federal share of a grant under this section shall not exceed 75 percent for each year of the grant and may decrease for each succeeding year to ensure continuity of increased hiring of school nurses using State or local funding. The non-Federal share of the grant may be in cash or in-kind. The Secretary may waive or reduce the non-Federal share of a grant under this section for eligible entities facing economic hardship. A report on the demonstration grant program's effectiveness in reducing student-to-school nurse ratios and improving student health must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the grant being awarded to a local educational agency. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2015 through 2019 to carry out the impact assessment on students' health and its effect on academic achievement, attendance, and classroom time."
