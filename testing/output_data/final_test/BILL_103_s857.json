    "content": "The Act titled as the \"National Commission To Ensure Small Aircraft Safety Act of 1993\" is established to ensure small aircraft safety. Congress declares small aircraft safety as a national concern and emphasizes the need for Federal Government resources to ensure safety. The National Transportation Safety Board urged the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct full fleet inspections of Hartzell propeller assemblies after an accident, but the FAA concluded that a special investigation was not necessary, leading to dissatisfaction from the NTSB.
