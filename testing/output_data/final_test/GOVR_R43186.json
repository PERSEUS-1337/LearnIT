    "content": "The law mandating public disclosure of personal financial information applies to the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, federal judges, high-level staff in the government branches, and certain federal officials based on compensation and work days. In the executive branch, it includes officers or employees in positions above GS-15 or with a salary rate equal to or greater. Employees in the General Schedule earning a salary greater than 120% of the base salary of a GS-15 for at least 60 days in a calendar year must file public financial disclosure reports. This requirement also applies to nominees for positions requiring Senate confirmation. A financial disclosure statement must be filed with the agency ethics officer for nominees for positions requiring Senate confirmation. The report is then sent to the Office of Government Ethics and the Senate committee considering the nomination. Nominees must update the report before hearings, providing information on honoraria and outside income. Senate committees can request additional information and ethics agreements from nominees. The annual financial disclosure statements required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 mandate public reporting of detailed financial information about public officials' private financial interests, assets, and income sources. This includes listing income over $200, gifts received, and other financial associations. Financial disclosure requirements include reporting gifts, assets over $1,000, liabilities exceeding $10,000, transactions over $1,000, outside positions, and agreements for future employment. Financial disclosure requirements include reporting agreements for future employment, blind trusts, and disclosures about the finances of spouses and dependent children of federal officials. The identity of financial assets and income-producing property over $1,000 must be disclosed, except when held in a qualified blind trust or a trust not established by the official. The conflict of interest theory behind \"blind trust\" provisions is that government officials should not know the specific assets in the trust to avoid conflicts of interest. Assets in a blind trust remain financial interests until the trustee notifies the official of their disposal or value below $1,000. The \"STOCK Act\" addresses these provisions. Under the \"STOCK Act,\" federal officials must file periodic reports within 30 days of transactions over $1,000 in stocks, bonds, or securities. This requirement does not apply to most mutual funds, ETFs, or real property transactions. The Act aims to increase transparency and prevent conflicts of interest. The STOCK Act requires federal officials to file reports on transactions over $1,000 in stocks, bonds, or securities to prevent conflicts of interest. Reports are filed with designated ethics officials in the respective branches of government. The STOCK Act mandates federal officials to report transactions over $1,000 in stocks, bonds, or securities to prevent conflicts of interest. Reports are submitted to designated ethics officials in each branch of government, including the House Ethics Committee, Senate Select Committee on Ethics, and Judicial Conference. Public financial disclosure reports under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 are available to the public and press within 30 days of the May 15 filing deadline. The STOCK Act also requires reports from high-level government officials, such as the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and Cabinet officials. The STOCK Act requires high-level government officials to report transactions over $1,000 in stocks, bonds, or securities. Reports are posted online, including periodic transaction reports. Originally, the Act would have required all public financial disclosure reports from 30,000 executive and legislative branch employees to be posted online, but concerns over identity theft and data mining led to limitations. The STOCK Act initially required online posting of financial reports for all federal employees, but concerns over privacy and effectiveness led to a study by NAPA. The study found that online posting did little to detect conflicts of interest but could harm federal missions and employees. Congress then amended the Act to only require online posting for high-level officials, maintaining public availability for others. The confidential reporting requirements complement the public financial disclosure system for certain lower-level federal officers and employees who do not meet the public reporting provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. These requirements apply to employees compensated below a certain threshold and involved in government contracting, procurement, grants, subsidies, licensing, auditing, or other governmental duties. Employees involved in government duties, such as auditing, may need to file a confidential report if they serve for more than 60 days in a year. Special Government employees in the executive branch, including advisory committee members, are also required to submit confidential reports. However, disclosure requirements only apply to federal government officers and employees, not private individuals serving on advisory committees."
