    "content": "This report discusses potential issues for Congress regarding U.S. ballistic missile defense efforts in the Asia-Pacific region. Decisions made by Congress could impact defense funding, military capabilities, and relations with countries in the region. The growing number and modernization of ballistic missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly North Korea's arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles, pose a security challenge for the United States and its allies. North Korea possesses a significant arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching South Korea, Japan, and some U.S. military bases. While they have tested long-range ballistic missile systems, they have not shown reliable capability to target Guam or other U.S. territories. Congress is concerned about the missile threat from North Korea and Iran, showing interest in ballistic missile defense systems. The Department of Defense is countering missile threats from Iran and North Korea with BMD systems. China's missiles also pose a challenge. The U.S. extends deterrence to allies in the Asia-Pacific region, including BMD capabilities. Congress supports this commitment. The United States has an obligation to meet its security commitments to allies in the Asia-Pacific region, including ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities. Congress supports this commitment by encouraging cooperation with regional allies on BMD issues to enhance security. The deployment of BMD assets and sensors in East Asia has gradually increased in response to the growing threat from ballistic missiles. Cooperation on regional BMD offers potential for greater effectiveness and cost efficiency, evolving with contributions from treaty allies. The U.S. is working with different countries at varying rates to enhance ballistic missile defense capabilities. Partnerships with Australia and Japan are well-established, while South Korea and Australia are in the early stages of acquiring necessary hardware. Southeast Asian allies like Thailand and the Philippines have not yet invested in BMD systems. The 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense Review Report outlines a policy of implementing the \"phased adaptive approach\" in East Asia to address immediate threats with existing technology. The U.S. is implementing a phased adaptive approach in East Asia for ballistic missile defense, focusing on addressing immediate threats with existing technology and preparing for future threats. Despite commitments to strategic stability with Russia and China, both countries have raised concerns about U.S. BMD programs. The U.S. is implementing a phased adaptive approach in East Asia for ballistic missile defense, focusing on addressing immediate threats with existing technology and preparing for future threats. Russian and Chinese concerns are focused on BMD in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, respectively. Issues for Congress include appropriations for BMD programs, Foreign Military Sales financing, alliance relationships, and the impact on U.S. relations with China, North Korea, and Russia. U.S. BMD policy aims to defend against limited missile strikes from rogue states like Iran and North Korea. The U.S. is implementing a Phased Adaptive Approach in East Asia for ballistic missile defense, focusing on addressing immediate threats with existing technology and preparing for future longer-range ballistic missile threats. The policy aims to develop a global BMD system eventually, with U.S. and allied assets in the Asia-Pacific region capable of intercepting short-range ballistic missiles from countries like North Korea and China. The U.S. is implementing a Phased Adaptive Approach in East Asia for ballistic missile defense, focusing on addressing immediate threats with existing technology and preparing for future longer-range ballistic missile threats. The policy aims to develop a global BMD system eventually, with regional BMD systems providing strategic benefits in peacetime and war. The U.S. has announced plans for a European PAA and completed the first phase, with phase two underway in Romania. Efforts for an Asia-Pacific PAA are ongoing, with unclear prospects. The U.S. is implementing a Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) in East Asia for ballistic missile defense. The current focus is on identifying and prioritizing missile threats, rallying allies, and deploying existing platforms and sensors like Patriot and Aegis interceptors. However, a formal agreement is needed for a more integrated approach with allies and partners in the region. The Obama Administration's strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region in 2011 highlighted this shift in foreign and defense policy. The U.S. strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region in 2011 has led to increased military deployments to Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea. The focus is on deepening engagement with allies and partners in the region, fostering trilateral security cooperation, and encouraging India to play a more active role in Asia-Pacific security. Some Chinese observers view these efforts as containment of China, but U.S. officials and many scholars disagree. The U.S. strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region in 2011 has led to increased military deployments to Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea. Several countries in the region possess ballistic missiles and have space launch programs. North Korea's ballistic missiles are a significant security concern and a central focus of U.S. BMD policy. U.S. BMD systems are not focused on rendering Russia's nuclear capability useless. China's ballistic missile forces are of some concern to the United States, but not a stated focus of U.S. BMD programs. Maintaining strategic stability with China is a key policy goal. Observers believe North Korea has a large arsenal of ballistic missiles. North Korea possesses a large arsenal of ballistic missiles, including SCUD SRBM and Nodong MRBM capable of reaching South Korea and Japan. Pyongyang aims to develop a nuclear-armed ICBM, but its longer-range missiles are unreliable. Analysts believe North Korea is advancing towards this goal, with estimates of around 700 SRBMs in its stockpile. These missiles, while numerous, are highly inaccurate and less effective with conventional warheads. North Korea has unveiled new ballistic missiles based on Russian designs, but they have not been flight tested and some analysts consider them mock-ups. Despite international condemnation, North Korea has launched long-range ballistic missiles twice in 2012. Pyongyang is focused on developing reliable long-range ballistic missiles, including potentially sea-launched ballistic missile technologies. North Korea's slow progress in developing a reliable long-range ballistic missile is highlighted by the successful 2012 space launch following previous test failures. Questions arise regarding the 1999 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate predicting North Korea's ability to test an ICBM by 2015. Experts doubt the capability of the Unha-3 rocket to carry a nuclear warhead at intercontinental range, suggesting the need for extensive flight testing for a future North Korean ICBM. North Korea's potential to develop a long-range ballistic missile is a concern, with doubts about the Unha-3 rocket's capability to carry a nuclear warhead. There is increasing worry over North Korea's development of a road-mobile ICBM known as the KN-08 and their ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead for an ICBM. The Director of National Intelligence states that North Korea has not yet demonstrated all capabilities. North Korea has the capability to mount a plutonium-based nuclear warhead on the shorter range Nodong missile. There is doubt about Pyongyang's ability to fit a warhead on an ICBM or survive re-entry. Gen. Scaparrotti believes North Korea may have miniaturized a nuclear device, but it has not been tested. China's ballistic missiles are not a focus of U.S. BMD programs. China's nuclear arsenal is smaller than the US and Russia, with 50-75 ICBMs and approximately 250 warheads. China follows a \"no first use\" policy for its nuclear weapons. China is engaged in a nuclear modernization effort, with an active ballistic missile development program and a new class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine. They have road-mobile DF-31A and silo-based DF-5 ICBMs, and are developing the DF-41 capable of carrying multiple warheads. China's Second Artillery forces deploy a variety of ballistic missiles, including SRBMs, MRBMs, and ASBMs, with a focus on deterring Taiwan. The DF-21D ASBM, known as a \"carrier killer\" missile, has a range of over 900 miles and is designed to target large ships, including aircraft carriers in the western Pacific. This development is part of China's efforts to counter US military intervention in the region. China is developing anti-access/area denial capabilities to counter US power projection in the Western Pacific. They successfully tested a ground-based mid-course missile interceptor in 2013, following a similar test in 2010. China's efforts in ballistic missile defense mirror US advancements in the same technology. China successfully tested a ground-based mid-course missile interceptor, showcasing competition in BMD technology with the U.S. China's intentions in missile defense technology remain unclear. Russia's ICBM numbers are limited by treaty with the U.S., with about 320 launchers currently. The INF Treaty prohibits the U.S. and Russia from possessing MRBM or IRBM. Russia is developing the RS-26 missile, which may be deployed in Irkutsk, Siberia, potentially targeting China due to its limited range. The United States and its allies in the Asia-Pacific region have responded to ballistic missile threats with various measures, including policy coordination, changes to military doctrine, and deployment of missile interceptors. President Obama has stated that the U.S. is prepared to defend against North Korean threats. The United States is prepared to defend against North Korean threats with a full range of capabilities, including conventional and nuclear forces. Defense policymakers in Asia-Pacific countries have varying views on vulnerability to ballistic missile threats, with Japanese elites feeling most insecure, Australian leaders feeling relatively secure, South Korean policymakers prioritizing defense against North Korea's artillery and invasion, and Southeast Asian leaders showing less concern due to limited defense budgets. The United States has deployed various Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) assets in the Asia-Pacific region, including SM-3 interceptors on Aegis-equipped destroyers, PAC-3 batteries at military bases, and early warning sensors in Japan. These assets are designed to intercept short and medium-range ballistic missiles in a defense and force protection role. The Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) is specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) aimed at the continental United States. The United States has deployed various Ballistic Missile Defense assets in the Asia-Pacific region, including SM-3 interceptors on Aegis-equipped destroyers, PAC-3 batteries at military bases, and early warning sensors in Japan. In response to North Korea's actions, DOD deployed a THAAD system to Guam ahead of schedule. The Navy aims to enhance its BMD capabilities to intercept more sophisticated missiles. Plans include 48 BMD-capable Aegis vessels and over 400 SM-3s by FY2020. The U.S. is exploring collaboration with other countries to establish the APPAA for trilateral BMD cooperation. Japan has heavily invested in Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force having four destroyers equipped with Aegis tracking software and SM-3 Block IA interceptors. Japan also fields 17 PAC-3 units and plans to add more, all linked with advanced radar systems. Plans include building new Aegis destroyers and expanding sea-based missile defense capabilities by 2020. Additionally, Japan is considering deploying a space-based early warning system before the end of the decade. Japan has invested heavily in Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), with plans to expand sea-based missile defense capabilities by 2020. South Korea has recently begun acquiring advanced BMD capabilities, with three cruisers equipped with Aegis tracking software. South Korea is planning to implement an indigenous Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) system to counter threats from North Korea, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles. They have approved a $1.3 billion plan to upgrade their missile defense system by 2020. The United States has recommended deploying a THAAD system in South Korea, which has sparked controversy. Australia currently has no BMD intercept capability but plans to procure Aegis-equipped vessels with BMD capabilities. Australia plans to procure two Aegis-equipped vessels with BMD capabilities for defense against SRBMs and MRBMs in the future. The U.S. is considering deploying a THAAD system in South Korea to defend against North Korean ballistic missiles, sparking controversy due to Chinese opposition. This has raised questions about Seoul's BMD policy. China has raised concerns about the THAAD system being deployed in South Korea, fearing it could be used to monitor Chinese airspace. The U.S. plans to configure the system in \"terminal mode\" to focus on North Korean missile launches, minimizing coverage over Chinese territory. The U.S. military may configure the THAAD radar in \"look mode\" to increase coverage over Chinese territory, which China views as \"spying.\" South Korean Minister of National Defense supports potential THAAD deployment for security. Despite Chinese objections, South Koreans upset by China's interference in defensive measures against North Korea. The proposed THAAD deployment in South Korea has become a litmus test for Seoul's alignment between Beijing and Washington. Some observers are concerned about angering China and its impact on ROK-China relations. South Korea also considers the affordability and effectiveness of THAAD against North Korean missiles. There are concerns that the U.S. may push South Korea to purchase THAAD, potentially as part of a campaign to share costs. Seoul is cautious about THAAD being a backdoor into the U.S.-led regional BMD system. The U.S. is seeking deeper BMD cooperation with Asia-Pacific allies due to the threat of a missile attack from North Korea. The U.S. military aims to integrate air and missile defense capabilities with partner countries, aligning with the strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region. Despite close coordination, South Korea has resisted cross-national integration of BMD systems with the U.S. South Korea and the United States have deepened their bilateral missile defense discussions, with the U.S. urging South Korea to develop advanced BMD capabilities. Seoul plans to develop its indigenous KAMD system, but will ensure interoperability with U.S. systems for efficient bilateral BMD cooperation. South Korea has been resistant to an integrated BMD system due to desires for strategic autonomy, concerns about irritating China, and reluctance to cooperate with Japan. Japan-South Korea defense cooperation is limited due to historical disputes. In 2012, South Korea and Japan almost signed a military information-sharing agreement but backed out due to domestic politics. They later agreed on a more limited MOU on intelligence-sharing with the U.S. in 2014. Australia signed a BMD Framework MOU with the U.S. in 2004 for policy collaboration and information sharing. Australia signed a BMD Framework MOU with the U.S. in July 2004, facilitating policy collaboration and information sharing. Australia relays missile launch and tracking sensor data to the U.S., which would be useful for BMD platforms. The U.S., Australia, and Japan have established a working group on BMD as part of their trilateral security consultations. Japan and the U.S. have been researching BMD technology since 1987 and are jointly developing the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor. Japan relaxed its prohibitions on defense technology exports in 2011 and 2013, allowing for potential sales of SM-3 Block IIA interceptors. The U.S.-Japan BMD partnership allows for future sales of SM-3 Block IIA interceptors and PAC-2 interceptors to third parties. Information sharing between the two nations improves target identification and interceptor cueing. Annual command exercise \"Keen Edge\" enhances interoperability. The U.S. and Japan conduct annual command exercise \"Keen Edge\" to simulate BMD responses, primarily testing the Aegis system and SM-3 Block IA interceptors. The Pacific Integrated Air and Missile Defense Center was established to enhance multinational IAMD capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. also conducts biennial computer-simulation exercises called \"Nimble Titan\" with partners globally. The \"Nimble Titan\" exercises involve partner countries studying the role and effects of BMD in conflict. In 2012, North Korea's missile tests exposed gaps in sensor coverage and flawed communication protocols, prompting adjustments by Japanese defense officials. The U.S. Navy deployed its sea-based X-band radar before the launches, and Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan declared readiness to intercept any threatening missiles. In preparation for the April launch, Japan formed task forces, held meetings with U.S. defense officials, and deployed Aegis destroyers and PAC-3 units on Okinawa and nearby islands. These actions mirrored those taken before North Korea's 2009 missile launch. The U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002 allowed for the pursuit of BMD programs, which have faced criticism from Russia for being targeted at them. North Korea and China strongly criticize U.S. BMD deployments in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, arguing that they threaten strategic stability and show hostile intentions. North Korea's state-run media condemns U.S. and allied BMD activities as examples of hostile policies, while China and Russia view BMD programs as military containment tactics. North Korea and China criticize U.S. BMD deployments in Europe and Asia-Pacific, arguing they threaten strategic stability. North Korea seeks to redefine \"denuclearization\" in negotiations, linking it to U.S. withdrawal of extended deterrence from South Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed China's opposition to BMD during a visit to Russia. During his first trip abroad as president, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia in March 2013 and issued a joint statement with the Russian government opposing the unilateral buildup of anti-missile capabilities. China's criticism of U.S.-led BMD efforts in East Asia is focused on the perceived threat to its nuclear deterrent, which is guided by a \"no first use\" policy. China's nuclear force is designed to survive a first strike. The Science of Military Strategy, a Chinese military text, expresses concerns about US BMD construction in East Asia affecting China's nuclear retaliatory capability. Chinese expert Wu Riqiang highlights worries about forward-based radars detecting Chinese strategic missiles. Chinese expert Wu Riqiang warns that the deployment of forward-based radars close to China could compromise the effectiveness of Beijing's strategic missiles. China's red line is the detection of decoy-deployment processes by BMD systems, which can differentiate real warheads from countermeasures. Wu believes the US BMD system in the Asia-Pacific may utilize various radars in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and other locations. The deployment of radars close to China, including the PAVE PAWS radar in Taiwan and Green Pine radars in South Korea, could impact Beijing's strategic missiles. China is concerned about the US BMD system's ability to detect decoys, with the potential for radars in Japan and Southeast Asia to be utilized. China's nuclear deterrence policy may include launching a retaliatory nuclear attack before enemy warheads reach their targets. Kulacki raises concerns about China's shift to a \"launch-on-warning\" posture, which could increase the risk of accidental or erroneous launch of a Chinese nuclear weapon. China is also worried about U.S. BMD programs undermining its conventional deterrent against Taiwan. China has stationed around 1,000 SRBMs opposite Taiwan to deter its separation. Chinese military scholars warn that US BMD programs, including sales to Taiwan, could embolden Taiwanese independence forces. The US has sold limited missile defense systems to Taiwan, including Patriot missile units in the 1990s and PAC-3 systems in 2008 and 2010. The United States notified Congress of additional sales of PAC-3 systems to Taiwan, including the PAVE PAWS early-warning radar system. There are concerns that BMD programs could undermine Chinese conventional ballistic missile capabilities, although China has not prominently made this argument. Wu Riqiang suggests that U.S. tactical BMD systems could potentially undermine Sino-American strategic stability. A 2013 CSIS report claims that U.S. BMD programs are not meant to compromise China's long-range nuclear deterrent. The U.S. BMD programs are not aimed at compromising China's long-range nuclear deterrent. However, China's shorter-range missile capability is a legitimate target for U.S. theater missile defense. China is concerned about the strengthening of U.S. alliances in East Asia, particularly with Japan, Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, fearing they could be turned against China. Russia has opposed regional BMD capabilities in Europe since the U.S. sought to deploy them against Iranian ballistic missiles. Russia opposes U.S. and allied BMD capabilities in Europe, fearing they could threaten its strategic nuclear deterrent. Despite efforts to reassure Russia, concerns persist. While some Europeans support regional BMD deployments, Russia remains wary. In the Asia-Pacific region, Russia has expressed concerns about progress towards a global BMD system and has raised issues with Japan and South Korea in bilateral discussions. Russia opposes U.S. and allied BMD capabilities in Europe due to concerns about their impact on its nuclear deterrent. In the Asia-Pacific region, Russia has raised objections to the development of a global BMD system and has discussed issues with Japan and South Korea. China closely monitors Russian opposition to U.S. BMD programs, with a focus on bilateral alliances in the region. The U.S. military is promoting greater integration of C4 functions among allies in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. military is promoting greater integration of control, computers, and communications (C4) functions among allies in the Asia-Pacific region for enhanced effectiveness and cost efficiency in Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems. Political challenges and risks exist, but the potential benefits include improved range, coverage, targeting accuracy, burden sharing, and signaling effects of collective organization. The DOD emphasizes the importance of sharing information with partners for a multinational, integrated BMD architecture. The U.S. military is advocating for greater integration of C4 functions among Asia-Pacific allies for more effective and cost-efficient BMD systems. A 2006 CSIS study highlighted the benefits of regional sensor netting in reducing the need for fire units. Sharing technologies and data regionally could enhance defense capabilities and deployment speed. However, challenges include multilateral coordination costs and the risk of entrapment in conflicts. Concerns about the affordability of U.S.-produced BMD systems in South Korea and potential diplomatic strains in a regional BMD architecture are also noted. The establishment of a regional BMD architecture anchored by the U.S. military could lead to changes in C2 relationships and require collective action among East Asian allies. Difficult questions about command authority in missile intercepts would need to be resolved. This integrated BMD network could pave the way for more institutionalized collective security in the region, but significant political hurdles must be overcome before serious discussions can begin. A trilateral military cooperation between the United States, South Korea, and Japan could enhance missile defense capabilities. However, unresolved historical issues between Japan and Korea may hinder a strategic partnership. Historical issues continue to hinder a strategic partnership between Japan and South Korea, affecting military cooperation. South Koreans distrust Japan due to perceived unrepentant attitudes towards Imperial Japan's past misdeeds. Domestic politics in both countries will impact the level of military cooperation. The Abe Administration's reinterpretation of Japan's constitution in 2014 removed obstacles to participation in a collective BMD system, potentially leading to greater trilateral security cooperation. However, many South Koreans are wary of defense cooperation with Japan due to historical issues. Expanding security cooperation through BMD could help alleviate concerns about Japan's military intentions. In 2014, it was argued that Seoul should join the U.S.-led regional BMD system to have a voice in its development. The U.S.-China relationship is complicated by strategic mistrust, with Beijing citing U.S. BMD programs as a factor. Efforts to engage China in nuclear and BMD dialogue have been limited, with only one round of official nuclear dialogue in 2008. The Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the Strategic Security Dialogue have touched on nuclear issues, but sustained discussions on nuclear issues and BMD have been lacking. In early 2015, a senior U.S. State Department official emphasized the importance of open dialogue with China on nuclear issues and BMD programs. U.S. and Chinese experts have made recommendations to address tensions between the two countries. Experts proposed launching an official dialogue with China on strategic nuclear issues. In 2013, Chinese nuclear expert Wu Riqiang proposed a solution to the US-China \"BMD dilemma\" where the US maintains a low level of BMD effectiveness to counter North Korea's ICBMs without threatening China's strategic missiles. The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues recommended that the US implicitly accept China's second strike capability to avoid a Chinese nuclear retaliatory strike. The US should make its BMD program transparent and assure China that it has no intention of using it against China's nuclear deterrent. Confidence-building measures like reciprocal visits to BMD sites and joint analysis by technical experts from both countries have been proposed. Government technical experts from China and the United States conduct a joint analysis of the U.S. national BMD system and its capabilities against Chinese and North Korean missiles. The U.S.-China disconnect over BMD may have strengthened China's relations with Russia. Enhanced BMD cooperation could help deter North Korean ballistic missiles and improve defense for South Korea, Japan, and potentially Australia. An unlikely target, BMD intercepts ballistic missiles from Northeast Asia, improving deterrence by making North Korea uncertain, reducing vulnerability to coercion, and enhancing counterattack strength. Coordinated BMD response may dissuade North Korea's missile program, while China's discomfort with BMD deployments could discourage North Korea's missile development. The U.S. BMD policy aims to defend against limited ballistic missile attacks and regional threats without affecting the strategic balance with Russia and China. However, there are concerns that BMD systems could become increasingly capable against Chinese and Russian ballistic missiles in the future. Despite dropping plans for Phase 4 of the EPAA, efforts to improve ICBM defenses are likely to continue, raising questions about how Russia and China might respond. Efforts to improve ICBM defenses raise questions about how Russia and China might respond. China is working on technologies to counter U.S. BMD systems, which could escalate tensions if shared with rogue states. The FY2015 NDAA includes sections relevant to this issue. The FY2015 NDAA (P.L. 113-291) emphasizes the need for the United States to develop regional missile defense capabilities to counter the growing threat posed by countries like Iran and North Korea. It also highlights the importance of working closely with allies in Asia to improve regional missile defense capabilities. The FY2015 NDAA emphasizes the need for the US to develop regional missile defense capabilities, particularly against the growing threat from North Korean ballistic missiles. It calls for increased cooperation with allies in Asia, such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia, to enhance security and defense in the region. Congress also requires DOD to submit a report on BMD capabilities and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. The FY2015 NDAA emphasizes the need for the US to develop regional missile defense capabilities, particularly against the growing threat from North Korean ballistic missiles. Congress mandates an independent assessment of U.S. military strategy and force posture in the PACOM area, including capability shortfalls in BMD. Funding for BMD programs has remained steady in Congress, with the possibility of additional funding required for BMD systems, sensors, infrastructure, and military construction. U.S. allies may request non-BMD related weapons systems as part of any agreement to deploy BMD capabilities in the region. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recommended deploying THAAD and additional PAC-3 units to protect forward deployed forces in the Asia-Pacific region. Questions arise regarding the expansion of BMD programs by the Department of Defense and the effectiveness of current and planned BMD capabilities against ballistic missile threats. The U.S. has sold various BMD capabilities to allies, including Aegis tracking software, PAC-2 and PAC-3 batteries, and SM-3 Block IA interceptors. There is potential for further sales. The U.S. has sold BMD capabilities to allies, including Aegis tracking software, PAC-2 and PAC-3 batteries, and SM-3 Block IA interceptors. Potential for further sales exists if South Korea, Australia, or Southeast Asian countries view ballistic missiles as a threat. Congress may need to define its role in overseeing Foreign Military Sales of BMD systems. The budget allocated to BMD efforts will impact U.S. defense capabilities in the region. Congress may influence the development of BMD architectures and integration of assets, considering Russian and Chinese concerns."
