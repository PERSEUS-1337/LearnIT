The Lytton Rancheria of California, a federally recognized Indian tribe, lost its homeland in 1958 and was restored to Federal recognition in 1991. Congress must address historic injustices to help the Tribe regain a viable homeland. California's Indian population drastically decreased from 350,000 to 15,000 by the 19th century. The Lytton Rancheria's original homeland was purchased by the United States in 1926 to provide reservations for Indian tribes. The Tribe sustained itself through farming and ranching until Federal Indian policy shifted towards termination in the 1950s. Congress enacted the Rancheria Act of 1958, including the Lytton Rancheria, for termination after meeting certain conditions. The Lytton Rancheria was illegally terminated by the Federal Government in 1961, leading to the loss of tribal lands and means of support. In 1987, the Tribe, along with three others, sued the United States, resulting in a Stipulated Judgment that restored the Lytton Rancheria's status as a federally recognized Indian tribe in 1991. The Stipulated Judgment restored the Lytton Rancheria's status as a federally recognized Indian tribe with rights to acquire trust lands. However, restrictions were placed on exercising full Federal rights on their original homeland. The Tribe acquired 9.5 acres in San Pablo for economic development and purchased property in Sonoma County at fair market value. The Tribe acquired property in Sonoma County at fair market value for a new homeland, totaling approximately 124.12 acres. They plan to build housing, governmental, and community facilities on a portion of the land. Some of the land is currently used for viniculture, with plans to develop more for this purpose. The Tribe's investment in viniculture has revitalized the vineyards, producing high-quality wines sustainably. No gaming will be conducted on the lands taken into trust. The Lytton Rancheria Tribe acquired land in Sonoma County for housing, governmental, and community facilities. Some of the land is used for viniculture, revitalizing vineyards. No gaming is allowed on the trust lands. Additionally, gaming restrictions between Sonoma County and the Tribe do not require further review by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Lytton Rancheria Tribe in Sonoma County will have a permanently protected homeland for communal living and future planning, restoring their status before wrongful termination in 1961. The Tribe and County of Sonoma have agreed to transfer lands into trust for the Tribe's benefit. The Act defines key terms such as \"County\" as Sonoma County, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"Tribe\" as the Lytton Rancheria of California. The Act also specifies the lands to be taken into trust. The Act specifies that land owned by the Lytton Rancheria of California is taken into trust for the Tribe's benefit, to be part of their reservation and administered according to laws for property held in trust by the United States. Lands taken into trust for the Tribe under this Act cannot be used for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Lands taken into trust in Sonoma County after the enactment of this Act are prohibited from gaming until March 15, 2037, with a permanent prohibition for lands located north of a specified line. Lands in Sonoma County used for transportation on January 1, 2016, are ineligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The Memorandum of Agreement between the Tribe and the County regarding land trust approval is not subject to review by the Secretary for effectiveness."
