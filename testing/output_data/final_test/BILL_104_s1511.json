    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Burma Freedom and Democracy Act of 1995\". Since 1962, Burma has been under military dictatorship, with the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) established in 1988 to suppress the pro-democracy movement. Despite a 1990 election victory for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD, the SLORC failed to honor the results. The US has protested by not sending an ambassador to Rangoon due to ongoing human rights abuses. In response to the massacre of Burmese people in peaceful demonstrations, the US imposed economic sanctions on Burma, including suspending economic aid, embargoing arms sales, denying trade preferences, and decertifying Burma as a narcotics cooperating country. Additionally, Burma was listed as an \"outlaw\" state alongside Libya, North Korea, and Iraq, mandating a halt to voluntary US funding. The Senate Resolution 234 urged ASEAN members to work with the US for power transfer in Burma after the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in 1995. However, the SLORC has since rejected dialogue efforts and denied the NLD a role in the political process. The United States policy supports the transition to democracy in Burma, urges the release of political prisoners, recognizes the 1990 election winners as legitimate representatives, and aims to facilitate contact with democratically elected leaders through the US mission in Rangoon. Sanctions are also imposed. Until the President certifies an elected government in Burma, sanctions will be imposed, including investment restrictions, prohibition of US assistance, and voting against financial aid to Burma. Sanctions will be imposed on Burma until an elected government is certified by the President. This includes investment restrictions, prohibition of US assistance, and voting against financial aid. Additionally, Burmese nationals hindering the transition to democracy will be ineligible for US visas and import sanctions may be imposed on products from Burma. Travel to Burma may also be restricted for US passport holders, except for officials. The President is urged not to accept diplomatic representation from Burma at a level greater than that accorded to the United States in Burma. The President is authorized to withhold funding from international organizations supporting activities in Burma, excluding humanitarian aid. SEC. 5. REPORT ON BURMESE LABOR PRACTICES. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must submit a report on Burmese compliance with international labor standards, foreign investment impact on worker rights violations, labor practices in the tourist industry, and U.S. efforts to end labor rights violations in Burma. In this Act, key definitions include \"appropriate congressional committees\" referring to specific Senate and House committees, and \"international financial institutions\" encompassing various global financial entities. Additionally, the term \"investment\" covers various forms such as loans and ownership shares. The term \"investment\" includes purchasing ownership shares, participating in profits, and providing commodities or services under a contract. \"United States assistance\" refers to aid provided by the U.S. government to foreign countries through grants, sales, loans, leases, credits, guarantees, or insurance."
