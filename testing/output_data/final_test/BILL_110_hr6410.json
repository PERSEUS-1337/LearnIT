    "content": "The \"Stop Legislative Automatic Spending Hikes (SLASH) Act of 2008\" requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to provide Congress with a list of ineffective agencies and programs annually. It also includes provisions for the termination of certain agencies and programs that have consistently received inadequate ratings. SEC. 102 of the \"Stop Legislative Automatic Spending Hikes (SLASH) Act of 2008\" mandates the termination of agencies and programs listed in a report by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget after 60 days unless a law is enacted to prevent it. SEC. 103 outlines the transition provisions for terminated agencies and programs, transferring their orders and actions to another agency. SEC. 104 deals with estimating savings. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will estimate annual savings from the operation of the title and report it to the Secretary of the Treasury. Additionally, a new section is added for program elimination rebates to taxpayers in the Internal Revenue Code. The program elimination rebate allows eligible taxpayers to receive a credit against their taxes based on estimated savings reported by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Eligible individuals can qualify for this rebate in the first taxable year beginning in any calendar year. Eligible individuals for the program elimination rebate must have qualifying income of at least $3,000 or meet specific criteria related to income tax liability and gross income. Nonresident aliens and individuals eligible for a deduction under section 151 are not considered eligible. The term 'qualifying income' includes earned income, Social Security benefits, and certain compensation or pensions under specific chapters of the United States Code. Net income tax liability is the excess of the taxpayer's regular tax liability and the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowed by part IV of subchapter A. The credit allowed by subsection (a) shall be treated as allowed by subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amount of credit for any taxable year shall be reduced by refunds and credits made or allowed to the taxpayer in the preceding year. The subsection (f) allows for advance refunds and credits to eligible individuals for the preceding taxable year. The Secretary will refund or credit any overpayment as quickly as possible under this subsection. The subsection (f) allows for advance refunds and credits to eligible individuals for the preceding taxable year, with no interest on overpayments. To qualify for the credit, individuals must provide valid identification numbers on their tax return. The text discusses the issuance of Social Security numbers by the Social Security Administration and amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to tax credits. The amendments made by this section regarding program elimination rebates will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
