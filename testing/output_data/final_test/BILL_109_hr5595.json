The High Threat Urban Areas program, known as the Urban Area Security Initiative, was created to address the unique needs of large urban areas at high risk of a weapon of mass destruction event. The allocation of funds for the Urban Areas Security Initiative grants program by the Department of Homeland Security in 2006 does not align with the program's original intent. The funding formula should be based solely on the risk of terrorist attack, considering threat, vulnerabilities, and consequences. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF URBAN AREAS SECURITY INITIATIVE GRANTS PROGRAM. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to carry out the Urban Areas Security Initiative Grants Program, providing grants for equipment, training, exercises, and technical assistance to State and local first responders. Grants can also be used for constructing, developing, and improving facilities for training and assistance. The Urban Areas Security Initiative Grants Program authorizes grants for equipment, training, exercises, and technical assistance to State and local first responders. Grants can also be used for construction relating to target hardening, communications facilities, emergency command centers, or medical response facilities. Reimbursement is provided for expenses related to counterterrorism and intelligence activities if 100 or more personnel are dedicated exclusively to these activities. The Urban Areas Security Initiative Grants Program authorizes grants for equipment, training, exercises, and technical assistance to State and local first responders. Grants cannot replace State or local funds for homeland security projects. The Secretary cannot require a specific level of expenditure for grants under this program. Grants are awarded based on established procedures and conditions. The Urban Areas Security Initiative Grants Program authorizes grants for equipment, training, exercises, and technical assistance to State and local first responders based on a quantitative assessment of the risk of a terrorist attack on high-threat, high-density urban areas. If any problems are found in a grant application, the Secretary must notify the applicant and provide an opportunity to correct them before awarding the grant. The Urban Areas Security Initiative Grants Program allows grants for equipment, training, exercises, and technical assistance to State and local first responders in high-threat urban areas. The President has authority to modify allocations and approvals for grants under the Program. Section 1014 of the USA PATRIOT Act does not apply to grants under this program."
