    "content": "The Act titled the \"Alaska Native Settlement Trust Tax Fairness Act of 2001\" addresses the tax treatment and information requirements of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It introduces a new section, SEC. 646, outlining the tax treatment of these trusts. The \"Alaska Native Settlement Trust Tax Fairness Act of 2001\" introduces SEC. 646, which applies the provisions of the subchapter and section 1(e) to all Settlement Trusts. It imposes a tax on the taxable income of electing Settlement Trusts at the lowest rate specified in section 1, with specific rules for capital gains. Trusts may make a one-time election for these tax provisions to apply. The provisions of SEC. 646 apply to Settlement Trusts, allowing trustees to make a one-time election for tax provisions to apply starting from the first taxable year after enactment. Once the election is made, it applies to all subsequent taxable years and cannot be revoked. The provisions of SEC. 646 allow trustees of Settlement Trusts to make a one-time election for tax provisions to apply from the first taxable year after enactment. This election is permanent and applies to all future taxable years. Contributions to the trust are not taxable for beneficiaries, and the sponsoring Native Corporation's earnings and profits are not affected by contributions. Distributions to beneficiaries are treated as excludable from gross income up to the recipient's taxable income. The trust's taxable income for the year is reduced by any income tax paid by the trust and any amount excluded from gross income under section 103. Amounts excludable from gross income are distributed by the sponsoring Native Corporation to the recipient beneficiary as described in section 301(c)(1), up to the current accumulated earnings. The trust's taxable income is reduced by any income tax paid and excluded amounts. Distributions by the Native Corporation to beneficiaries are based on current accumulated earnings. Excess distributions by the trust are not subject to corporate distribution rules. Special rules apply if transfer restrictions are modified. Beneficial interest in an electing Settlement Trust may be disposed of in a way not allowed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. If the interest is Settlement Common Stock, no election can be made under subsection (c) for the trust. If an election is in effect, it will cease to apply in the first taxable year of permitted disposition. The provisions of this section will not apply to the trust for that year and all subsequent years. The distributable net income of a trust is increased by the earnings and profits of the sponsoring Native Corporation at the end of the taxable year, with adjustments for distributions made. The increase cannot exceed the fair market value of the trust's assets when the beneficial interest becomes disposable. Earnings and profits of the Native Corporation are adjusted at the end of the taxable year based on the amount included in the trust's distributable net income. The distributable net income of a trust can be affected if the sponsoring Native Corporation transfers assets to a Settlement Trust in a manner not permitted by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This provision applies when dispositions of beneficial interests in the trust are not allowed by the Act. The surrender of an interest in a Native Corporation or electing Settlement Trust for redemption or liquidation is considered a permitted transfer under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Taxable income of an electing Settlement Trust is determined without certain deductions. An electing Settlement Trust is one that has made a specific election for a taxable year. The terms related to Native Corporations and Settlement Trusts under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act are defined, including Settlement Common Stock and Sponsoring Native Corporation. Loss disallowance rule applies to electing Settlement Trusts. The loss disallowance rule applies to a shareholder's recognized loss on a disposition of a share of stock of a sponsoring Native Corporation, which is reduced by the per share loss adjustment factor. This factor is the total contributions to electing Settlement Trusts sponsored by the Native Corporation, expressed on a per share basis. The new section 6039H requires information on Alaska Native Settlement Trusts and sponsoring Native Corporations for electing Settlement Trusts. The fiduciary of an electing Settlement Trust must include a statement with the trust's income return, containing information on distributions to beneficiaries and their tax treatment under section 646. This statement fulfills reporting requirements and replaces the need to provide beneficiaries with separate statements on distributions. The electing Settlement Trust must provide a statement to the sponsoring Native Corporation regarding distributions made to beneficiaries, as required under section 646. The sponsoring Native Corporation then furnishes each recipient with a statement detailing the amount distributed to them for the taxable year. The table of sections for subpart A of part I of subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item at the end for the taxable year. Sec. 646. Tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the date of the enactment of this Act and to contributions made to electing Settlement Trusts for such year or any subsequent year."
