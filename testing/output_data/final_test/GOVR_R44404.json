Recent breaches at the White House, State Department, and Office of Personnel Management have raised questions about the government's ability to protect its networks. Funding for cybersecurity has also increased, but a comprehensive total investment is not available. Understanding how resources are used is crucial for effective oversight and prevention of waste. This report outlines past resource allocation for cybersecurity and suggests future options. The federal government has faced increasing cyberattacks since 2006, leading to concerns about data security. Recent breaches at the White House, State Department, and Office of Personnel Management have raised questions about the government's ability to protect its networks. Funding for cybersecurity has also increased, but a comprehensive total investment is not available. Understanding how resources are used is crucial for effective oversight and prevention of waste. This report outlines past resource allocation for cybersecurity and suggests future options. The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) provides a definition of cybersecurity as the protection of information and communications systems from damage, unauthorized use, or exploitation. Federal agencies engage in cybersecurity activities related to the security and stability of global information and communications infrastructure. This report focuses on protecting U.S. public and private sector data and networks from cyberattacks. It analyzes federal government spending on cybersecurity in three ways: agency spending to protect its own systems, networks, and data; agency spending to protect other governmental entities. The report analyzes federal government spending on cybersecurity in three ways: internal spending to protect its own systems, networks, and data; external spending to protect non-federal IT systems; and promoting cybersecurity to entities beyond its control through direct funding and services. The report will analyze federal government spending on cybersecurity, including internal investments in security hardware, software, personnel, and training. Some agencies have specific cybersecurity responsibilities in protecting the entire federal government from cyberattacks. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) governs agency responsibilities for securing systems, networks, and data, including financial and citizen-submitted information. Cabinet-level departments like OMB, DHS, and DOC have unique roles in promoting internal cybersecurity within the federal government. OMB mandates cybersecurity protocols, DHS protects the .gov domain, and DOC/NIST sets standards for federal IT systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) participates in FISMA requirements and oversees cybersecurity for the .mil domain. The federal government also enhances cybersecurity in the non-federal sector, including state, local, tribal governments, private sector, academia, and NGOs. Federal investment in cybersecurity extends beyond federal agencies. Federal investment in cybersecurity outside the .gov domain aims to improve national cybersecurity through information sharing programs and law enforcement activities, such as the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) at DHS and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF) hosted by the FBI. The federal government invests in cybersecurity to address cyber threats, promote cybersecurity activities in specific sectors, and enforce regulations. This includes grant programs for industry research and regulatory authority over sectors like record-keeping and consumer protections. Interest in federal spending on cybersecurity reflects a commitment to national security. The federal government invests in cybersecurity to address cyber threats and promote cybersecurity activities in specific sectors. However, calculating the exact amount spent on cybersecurity is challenging due to the lack of a clear definition and consistent reporting across federal agencies. The President's Budget, agency budget justifications, and the FISMA report do not provide a complete picture of federal spending on cybersecurity. The President's Budget, agency budget justifications, and the FISMA report are required submissions that account for cybersecurity spending. The budget is typically released by the Office of Management and Budget in February, outlining government activities and policy priorities. The FY2017 budget request included a fact sheet requesting $19 billion for cybersecurity strategy. The FY2017 budget request included a fact sheet requesting $19 billion for a broad-based cybersecurity strategy, with $5.8 billion allocated to seven agencies for priority cybersecurity programs. The methodology used in developing these totals showed inconsistencies among agencies' accounting and a lack of detail. Agencies also released justifications for their proposed budgets in greater detail than the President's budget request. The FY2017 budget request included $19 billion for cybersecurity, with $5.8 billion allocated to seven agencies. Agencies provided detailed budget justifications, revealing inconsistencies in reporting cybersecurity spending. Some agencies, like DOE, included cybersecurity as a crosscut analysis, while others, like DHS, highlighted specific activities. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) integrates cybersecurity investments across all systems, without distinguishing between managerial and mission-execution systems. Other agencies make separate investments in cybersecurity. The Department of the Treasury distinguishes between department-wide cybersecurity and the cybersecurity of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS further separates their taxpayer-facing systems from other systems in their budget justification. OMB is required to submit an annual report to Congress on federal agencies' implementation of FISMA, covering progress and Inspector General assessments. The annual FISMA report to Congress includes an accounting of IT Security Spending Reported by CFO Act Agencies, totaling agency investments for internal cybersecurity. The report for FY2014 released in February 2015 shows $12.7 billion in federal spending on cybersecurity activities such as preventing malicious cyber activity, detecting intrusions, and shaping the cybersecurity environment. The question of whether the federal government is spending \"enough\" on cybersecurity is difficult to answer according to FISMA guidance and industry-respected cybersecurity frameworks. Cybersecurity decisions must be made based on understanding risk, but quantifying the cybersecurity risk to the nation is challenging due to its size, system complexity, and evolving threat landscape. The total federal cybersecurity spending of $6.7 billion for DOD in FY2017 masks the significance of changes in civilian cybersecurity budget. The federal cybersecurity budget for DOD in FY2017 masks the importance of changes in civilian cybersecurity spending. A comprehensive federal cybersecurity strategy, execution plan, metrics for progress assessment, and consistent reporting are essential for effective oversight by Congress. The Administration released the Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP) in conjunction with the FY2017 budget, incorporating previous federal-only strategies. An overarching strategy lacks detail but would improve coordinated efforts. Plans to meet strategy goals should align with agency responsibilities and capabilities. Metrics and reporting are crucial for comparative analysis of cybersecurity efforts. The federal government's cybersecurity functions are carried out on an agency-by-agency basis, with oversight conducted in a similar manner. OMB Memorandum M-16-04 outlines the Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan for the Federal Civilian Government, issued as a follow-up to the Cybersecurity Sprint in 2015. The Cybersecurity Sprint in 2015 outlined high-priority actions to improve internal cybersecurity of the federal government, including protecting data, improving situational awareness, increasing cybersecurity proficiency, raising awareness, standardizing processes, controlling incidents, and strengthening system security. The Cybersecurity Sprint in 2015 aimed to increase platform security by acquiring more secure systems and retiring legacy systems promptly. The formation of a \"Cybersecurity Sprint Team\" led to a 30-day review of federal government cybersecurity policies, resulting in the creation of action plans and strategies to address critical cybersecurity policies and recommend a Federal Civilian Cybersecurity Strategy. The Cybersecurity Sprint in 2015 focused on enhancing platform security by acquiring secure systems and retiring legacy systems promptly. The Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan (CSIP) outlined objectives such as prioritizing the protection of high-value information, timely incident detection and response, workforce talent recruitment, and efficient technology deployment. The FISMA report provides uniform cybersecurity activity reporting, but its limited categories complicate overall cybersecurity funding analysis. The FISMA report is based on self-reported data from agencies, providing a window into past cybersecurity activities. Agencies' Inspector Generals conduct independent audits of IT systems and submit findings to Congress, with recommendations for addressing deficiencies. Federal agencies present cybersecurity investments in various budget formats, aggregating information from across the agency. The budget justification documents may not always provide specific levels of cybersecurity investment, requiring additional questioning of agencies. Effective oversight of cybersecurity funding becomes a challenge when data from the budget request, FISMA reporting, and agency justifications are insufficient. The key question is how much agencies spend on cybersecurity, but this information is only valuable when understood in the broader context of agency activities. Understanding an agency's cybersecurity spending requires knowledge of how the total is divided among activities, the risks they face, and whether functions are performed in-house or contracted out. Questions Congress may explore include data handling, investment based on threat understanding, breach history, mitigation plans, funding adequacy, and audit results. The appropriate role of the federal government in ensuring national cybersecurity is debated. Congress may explore the level of investment in external cybersecurity, including sharing information among cyberattack victims and investing taxpayer dollars in protecting private sector networks. The federal government's role in cybersecurity for non-federal victims and private sector networks is being questioned. Federal grants and investments are being examined to see if they are complementing or supplanting non-federal cybersecurity efforts. Recent legislation has clarified agency responsibilities for promoting federal .gov cybersecurity. The federal government's role in cybersecurity for non-federal victims and private sector networks is being questioned, with recent legislation clarifying agency responsibilities. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 requires agencies to report on their progress in implementing cybersecurity measures, but some reports are still pending. Comparing agencies' cybersecurity investments has limitations due to varying sizes, complexities, and risk profiles based on their missions. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of making valid conclusions from cross-agency comparisons in cybersecurity due to variances in functions and data sets. Despite these challenges, comparing agencies with similar risk profiles can provide useful benchmarks and insights into best practices for cybersecurity investments. Such comparisons can help identify opportunities for agencies to enhance cybersecurity at scale. The CNAP proposes a model for agencies to achieve enhanced cybersecurity through joint efforts and shared platforms, aiming for cost efficiencies while meeting security needs. The Administration requests $3.1 billion in FY2017 for an information technology modernization fund, which could potentially be used for cybersecurity investments."
