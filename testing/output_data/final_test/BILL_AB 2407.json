    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 4600 of the Labor Code is amended to require employers to provide necessary medical treatment for injured workers, including various services and supplies. If the employer fails to do so, they are responsible for the expenses incurred by the employee. The treatment must be in line with guidelines set by the administrative director. After 30 days from reporting the injury, the employee can choose their own physician or facility within a reasonable geographic area, unless a medical provider network is established. Chiropractors cannot be treating physicians after the maximum allowed visits. If an employee notifies their employer in writing before the injury that they have a personal physician, they have the right to be treated by that physician. Medical treatment issues will be governed by specific sections of the Health and Safety Code, with disputes resolved according to the Code as well. If the employee has health care coverage for nonoccupational injuries on the date of injury, all medical treatment issues will be governed by the Insurance Code. The insurer may require prior authorization for nonemergency treatment and conduct utilization review. An employee with health care coverage for nonoccupational injuries is entitled to referrals by their personal physician within the health care plan. Treatment by physicians outside the plan is allowed under certain standards. If the injury affects the employee's back, the medical provider must assess the risk of chronic back pain. After assessing the patient, covered treatments may include acupuncture, chiropractic manipulation, cognitive behavioral therapy, short-term medications, office visits, osteopathic manipulation, and physical therapy. Surgery is only recommended for specific conditions with sufficient evidence of its effectiveness. Other options like yoga, rehabilitation, massage, or supervised exercise therapy may also be included in the treatment plan based on the medical treatment utilization schedule. When requested by specified parties, an employee must undergo a physician examination and will receive transportation, meals, lodging expenses, and temporary disability indemnity for lost wages during the examination. Reasonable expenses of transportation for employee examinations include mileage fees from home to the examination place at a rate of $0.21 per mile or the Director of the Department of Human Resources' adopted rate, plus bridge tolls, to be paid to the employee upon notification of the examination details. When an employee who does not speak English proficiently undergoes an examination at the request of the employer or other parties in a workers' compensation case, they are entitled to a qualified interpreter provided by the employer. The interpreter must be certified according to specific government regulations. If an injured employee cannot effectively communicate with their treating physician due to language barriers, they are entitled to a qualified interpreter during medical treatment appointments. The interpreter must meet requirements set by the administrative director and fees for interpreter services will be covered by the employer or insurance carrier upon request. An employer is not required to pay for interpreter services if the interpreter is not certified. Injured workers are entitled to a qualified interpreter during medical treatment if they cannot communicate effectively with their physician due to language barriers. Employers are not required to pay for interpreter services if the interpreter is not certified. Home health care services must be prescribed by a licensed physician and are only covered if necessary to treat the injury. The employer is not responsible for services provided more than 14 days before receiving the physician's prescription."
