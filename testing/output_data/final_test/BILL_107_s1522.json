    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Second Chance Homes Promotion Act of 2001\". Congress finds that the United States has high rates of teenage pregnancy, costing $7 billion annually. Nearly 1 million teenage pregnancies occur each year, with 80% being unintended. Teenage mothers are less likely to complete high school and more likely to rely on welfare. The children of teenage mothers have lower birth weights, perform poorly in school, and are at greater risk of abuse and neglect. Sons of teenage mothers have a 13% higher chance of ending up in prison, while daughters have a 22% higher chance of becoming teenage mothers themselves. The 1996 welfare reform legislation endorsed the concept of \"second chance homes\" for minor teenage parents. According to reports, many states lack policies to help teenage parents find shelter, leading to denial of assistance for minors in need. Second chance homes provide socialization, nurturing, and structure for teenage welfare mothers, producing promising results. Second chance homes for teenage welfare mothers have shown promising results, including fewer second pregnancies, higher adoption rates, reduced child abuse, improved maternal and child health, increased school completion rates for mothers, higher employment rates, and decreased welfare dependency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants to eligible entities for the Second Chance Home Program. Grants will be awarded competitively after reviewing applications. Eligible entities can carry out activities described in section 6. Eligible entities for grants under the Second Chance Home Program include States, local governments, Indian tribes, and nonprofit agencies or organizations. Definitions for \"Indian tribe\" and \"State\" are provided in the section. An eligible entity seeking a grant under the Second Chance Home Program must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. Priority is given to entities proposing to establish a new second chance home in rural or tribal areas, collaborating with a non-profit entity, or using funds from a State assistance program for operating costs. An eligible entity receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds to establish, expand, or enhance a second chance home. A second chance home is a community-based group home for young mothers and their children, providing parenting skills and promoting long-term economic independence. The home must serve mothers under 23 years old and their children. Matching funds are also required. SEC. 7. MATCHING FUNDS.\n\nEligible entities must provide non-Federal contributions equal to at least 20% of the Federal funds received for the grant, which can be in cash or in kind. Grants awarded under this Act have a duration of 5 years. The Secretary will contract with an entity to evaluate second chance homes supported by grant funds. The evaluation will collect information on individuals benefiting from these homes and the most beneficial services provided. The entity will submit interim and final reports to Congress within 2 years. The entity contracted by the Secretary to evaluate second chance homes must submit an interim report within 2 years and a final report within 5 years of entering into the contract. SEC. 10. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary may use up to $500,000 for technical assistance contracts to support eligible entities. This assistance may include conferences on best practices for second chance homes. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $45,000,000 is authorized for carrying out the Act, with an additional $1,000,000 for evaluation purposes in fiscal year 2002. Amounts authorized shall remain available until expended."
