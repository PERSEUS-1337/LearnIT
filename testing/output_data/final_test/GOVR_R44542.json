    "content": "The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270) supports career and technical education services at secondary and postsecondary levels. It aims to develop academic and technical skills for students in CTE programs. Perkins IV was authorized through FY2012 and extended through FY2013 by the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). Perkins IV was funded at $1.1 billion for FY2016 and reauthorization hearings were held in the 114th Congress. The report covers an overview of career and technical education, legislative history, Perkins IV details, and National Assessment findings. The National Assessment of Career and Technical Education in 2015 highlighted the importance of CTE programs at secondary and postsecondary levels, leading to industry-recognized credentials. CTE courses are focused on specific professions and organized into career clusters and pathways to guide students towards specific careers. At the secondary level, Career and Technical Education (CTE) aims to prepare students for various roles, including family and consumer sciences education, general employment skills like computer proficiency and soft skills such as communication and leadership. It also provides specific occupational skills for immediate workforce entry or further education at the postsecondary level. Secondary CTE providers include public and private high schools, CTE-specific schools, and career academies within comprehensive institutions. CTE courses are widely available to high school students, with a vast majority of public high school graduates attaining at least one CTE credit. Postsecondary CTE programs are designed to prepare students for specific careers and occupational fields. Postsecondary CTE programs offer various credentials such as associate's degrees, industry-recognized certificates, and customized training. These programs are provided by community colleges, universities, vocational schools, and other organizations. In 2011-2012, the majority of undergraduate students pursuing CTE credentials were enrolled in two-year institutions. In 2011-2012, 80% of postsecondary institutions offered CTE programs. Federal government supports CTE for workforce development. Historical goals include providing relevant skills at secondary level and skills for specific occupations at postsecondary level through legislation like the Morrill Acts. The Morrill Acts, Smith-Hughes Act of 1917, Vocational Education Act of 1946, and Vocational Education Act of 1963 were federal legislative efforts to support workforce development by funding vocational education programs and teacher training in various fields. States were required to match federal funds at the state and local levels under these acts. The Vocational Education Act of 1963 (VEA; P.L. 88-210) and subsequent amendments greatly expanded federal involvement in vocational education by creating programs for special populations, increasing support for vocational schools, funding research and program development, and establishing a National Advisory Council on Vocational Education. Federal appropriations for vocational education increased significantly after the enactment of VEA. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act of 1984 focused on vocational education programs for special populations, requiring states to spend 57% of grant funds on these activities. The Perkins II Amendments of 1990 made revisions and introduced the Tech Prep program. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III, P.L. 105-332) increased state funds distributed to the local level to 85%, with 8.5% reserved for programs in rural and high-need areas. It also expanded state accountability by introducing core indicators of performance and adjusted levels of performance. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (Perkins IV; P.L. 109-270) introduced core indicators of performance and adjusted levels of performance, along with sanctions for states failing to meet performance levels and incentive grants for exceeding them. The act replaced \"vocational and technical\" with \"career and technical\" education, and extended its authorization through FY2013. The Perkins IV Act introduced core indicators of performance for the Basic State Grants program at secondary and postsecondary levels, requiring grantees to meet 90% of performance levels. State improvement plans were mandated if targets were not met, and CTE provisions were linked with academic standards under ESEA. States had to develop programs of study leading to industry credentials, and Tech Prep funding could be consolidated with Basic State Grants. Perkins IV authorizes funding for various CTE programs, including Basic State Grants, Tech Prep, National Programs, TCPCTI Program, and Occupational and Employment Information. Basic State Grants make up the majority of funding and align with the goal of developing CTE skills, programs, and instructor training. The report describes the BSG program funding allocation formulas, planning activities at state and local levels, uses of funds, and reporting requirements. Funds are allocated to states based on average per capita incomes and populations aged 15-65, with states deciding the distribution between secondary and postsecondary CTE programs. Additional formulas determine program sizes. The BSG program funding allocation formulas determine subgrants awarded to grantees at the local level. The Secretary reserves funds for outlying areas, with specific initial allotments for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. If appropriations are insufficient, a ratable reduction is triggered. The Secretary also reserves funds for Native American programs. The Secretary reserves funds for Native American Career and Technical Education Program (NACTEP) and Native Hawaiian Program from BSG funds. NACTEP funds support CTE programs for eligible entities like Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities. The Native Hawaiian Program grants go to community-based organizations for CTE programs benefiting Native Hawaiians. Basic State Grants funds are then allocated to states based on population size in the targeted age range for CTE programs. The allocation of Basic State Grants funds is based on population size in the targeted age range for CTE programs, with larger grants going to states with larger populations in the 15 to 19 age group and lower than average per capita incomes. Funds are distributed proportionally based on each state's share of the national population in different age groups, adjusted for states' PCI. The Basic State Grants formula ensures minimum funding levels by incorporating features like the FY1998 hold harmless provision and a minimum grant equal to 0.5% of the total amount available. Special rules calculate adjusted minimums for each state based on prior-year grants and population demographics. The larger of the adjusted minimum or FY1998 hold harmless amount becomes the state's minimum grant. The Basic State Grants formula ensures minimum funding levels by incorporating features like the FY1998 hold harmless provision and a minimum grant equal to 0.5% of the total amount available. States must allocate at least 85% to the local level, with additional funds for state leadership activities and program administration. Up to 10% of funds at the local level can be awarded to CTE providers in rural or high-need areas. States decide how to split funds between CTE providers at the secondary and postsecondary levels. Eligible recipients of funds at the secondary level are determined by the states. At the secondary education level, funds are allocated based on poverty levels and total population. States can choose to distribute funds competitively if allocating 15% or less to secondary education. Eligible recipients include LEAs, public charter schools, BIE-funded schools, CTE schools, and educational service agencies. At the postsecondary education level, funds are distributed to eligible recipients based on their share of Pell Grant and BIE assistance recipients in CTE programs. The minimum grant amount is $50,000, and if a secondary level recipient's allotment is less than $15,000, they must form a consortium to meet the requirement, unless located in a rural area or a public charter school with a CTE program. Eligible recipients include public or nonprofit IHEs, LEAs, CTE schools, tribally controlled colleges, educational service agencies, and consortia of such. The minimum grant amount for eligible recipients in CTE programs is $50,000. States can choose to distribute funds competitively or through alternative methods if allocating 15% or less to postsecondary levels. Each state agency must submit a six-year state plan to the Secretary of Education, developed through public hearings and consultation with various stakeholders. The plan must include details on supported CTE activities, programs of study, and professional development. The state plan for Career and Technical Education (CTE) must include performance targets, CTE programs of study, professional development for teachers, efforts to transition students to baccalaureate programs, academic skills improvement, annual program evaluation, and programs for special populations. States can also submit a plan as part of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The plan is approved by the Secretary unless it doesn't meet Perkins IV requirements or proposed performance levels are not approved. States can reserve up to 10% of their Career and Technical Education (CTE) allotments for state leadership activities, with a portion designated for individuals in state correctional institutions or institutions serving individuals with disabilities. Funds must also be reserved for services preparing individuals for nontraditional fields. Nine required uses of state leadership funds include assessment of CTE programs, technology integration, professional development for CTE teachers, academic and technical skills improvement, preparation for nontraditional employment, and support for partnerships among local providers, employers, and labor organizations. State leadership activities funded by Career and Technical Education (CTE) allotments support various initiatives such as academic and career guidance counseling, articulation agreements between education providers, career and technical student organizations, incentive grants, and data collection systems for education and employment outcomes. State leadership funds for Career and Technical Education (CTE) support programs of study and require local recipients to submit plans detailing CTE program descriptions, academic integration, professional development, industry experience for students, and efforts to improve CTE outcomes. Eligible grant recipients at the local level must use funds to strengthen academic and technical skills of CTE students, link CTE at different levels, provide industry experience, use technology in CTE, offer professional development, evaluate programs, and prepare special populations for high-demand careers. Section 135 of Perkins funds allows for various uses at the local level, including involvement of business, labor organizations, and parents in CTE programs, career guidance, work-related experiences like internships, equipment purchase, and accountability requirements for student outcomes. Eligible recipients can allocate up to 5% of funds for administrative costs. The Perkins accountability system requires states and local providers to meet goals on core indicators of performance to enhance the return on investment of federal CTE funds. There are six indicators at the secondary level and five at the postsecondary level, including student attainment of academic standards, career and technical skill proficiencies, graduation rates, and credentials. The Perkins accountability system mandates states and local providers to achieve goals on core performance indicators for federal CTE funds. These indicators include student attainment of academic standards, career and technical skill proficiencies, graduation rates, credentials, postsecondary education placement, and participation in CTE programs leading to nontraditional fields. Nonregulatory guidance has been issued by the Department of Education to help align definitions and calculate values for these indicators. States and local recipients of Perkins IV funds must establish annual targets for core performance indicators, known as adjusted levels of performance. These targets reflect progress towards improved performance by CTE students and are negotiated between the state and the Secretary of Education. Agreement on adjusted levels of performance is required for the first two program years, with new targets set before the third and fifth years. States and local recipients of Perkins IV funds must establish annual targets for core performance indicators, known as adjusted levels of performance. These targets reflect progress towards improved performance by CTE students and are negotiated between the state and the Secretary of Education. In exceptional circumstances, a state may request a revision of its adjusted levels of performance. Each eligible recipient at the local level may either accept the state adjusted levels of performance or negotiate with the state to establish new local adjusted levels of performance. Additionally, each local provider may establish local levels of performance for each of the state's additional indicators of performance. States must annually report to the Secretary on the levels of performance achieved by their CTE students on each of the core indicators of performance, as well as on the additional indicators of performance. Each indicator must be disaggregated by special populations and by ESEA Title I subgroups. The Secretary publicly disseminates annual state reports called Consolidated Annual Reports, which include state performance data for accountability purposes. States failing to meet 90% of the adjusted performance levels for core indicators must develop a program improvement plan with stakeholder input. The Secretary provides technical assistance and may withhold funds if substantial progress is not made. The Secretary may withhold a state's funds if it fails to implement a program improvement plan or meet performance levels for core indicators. The withheld funds are used for technical assistance. Local providers failing to meet performance levels must also develop improvement plans, with funding at risk if no improvement occurs. The state may take away funding from local providers if improvement does not occur, using it for CTE services through alternative means. Perkins IV authorizes national activities such as collecting performance information on CTE, providing annual reports to Congress, conducting research, and appointing an independent evaluation. The report to Congress summarizes studies on assessment, an advisory panel analyzes findings, information on state efforts is collected, a national research center for CTE is established, and grants support education for Indian students at specific institutions. The United Tribes Technical College in North Dakota and the Navajo Technical College in New Mexico are the only recipients of funds from the Department of Interior's Tribal Technical Colleges program. Funds provided under TCPCTIP can be used for expenses related to CTE programs for Indian students. Section 118 of Perkins IV allows the Secretary to provide assistance for career guidance and academic counseling to improve access to information on career preparation and occupational supply and demand. The Tech Prep program in Perkins IV aims to encourage collaborations between secondary and postsecondary institutions by awarding funds to consortia. Consortia use funds to develop coherent sequences of CTE courses spanning the last two years of secondary education and two years of postsecondary education. Eligible secondary level institutions can participate in Tech Prep consortia. Eligible members of consortia under Tech Prep include secondary and postsecondary level providers, such as nonprofit and proprietary IHEs offering specific programs. Consortia can also include employers, labor organizations, and IHEs granting baccalaureate degrees. Participation in an articulation agreement and development of a \"2+2\" program leading to an associate's degree or postsecondary certificate in a specific field are required. Professional development programs for educators are also mandatory. Tech Prep funds are allocated to states for professional development programs for teachers, faculty, administrators, and counselors. States can choose to operate Tech Prep separately or combine funds with Basic State Grants. Title III of Perkins IV specifies provisions, including the Supplement Not Supplant provision, which requires states to supplement, not supplant, non-federal funds for CTE activities. The Maintenance of Effort provision for Perkins IV funds requires states to maintain CTE expenditures per student or aggregate CTE expenditures at a certain level. If total appropriations for Perkins IV decrease, states can also decrease their CTE expenditures. The Secretary has the authority to reduce the MOE requirement by up to 5% in exceptional circumstances. Section 315 prohibits the use of Perkins IV funds for certain purposes. Perkins IV funds cannot be used for CTE programs for students before 7th grade. State and local CTE providers must include teachers from nonprofit private schools in professional development activities. Students from nonprofit private schools can participate in local CTE programs funded by Perkins IV. Perkins IV authorizes funds for Basic State Grants, National Programs, TCPCTIP, Occupational and Employment Information, and Tech Prep. Total appropriations for Perkins IV have gradually decreased. Total appropriations for Perkins IV have gradually decreased from $1.304 billion in FY2007 to $1.080 billion in FY2013, before slightly increasing to $1.133 billion for FY2014 and FY2015. The Tech Prep program was funded at around $100 million through FY2010 but has not been funded since. The Occupational and Employment Information program has not been funded under Perkins IV. In PY2011-2012, 24 states met or exceeded 90% of their adjusted performance levels for secondary education core indicators. 31 states needed to submit program improvement plans for at least one secondary core indicator. States were most successful in student graduation rates, with all 55 states achieving at least 90% of their adjusted performance levels. 49% met or exceeded 100% on that indicator. States were least successful in nontraditional completion, with 42 states reaching 90% of their adjusted performance levels. At the postsecondary education level, 28 states met or exceeded 90% of their adjusted performance levels for all indicators. 27 states had to submit program improvement plans. In PY2011-2012, all 55 states achieved 90% of their adjusted performance levels for technical skill attainment. However, only 41 states reached 90% for credential, certificate, or degree attainment. Section 114(d)(2) of Perkins IV authorized funds for an evaluation of CTE programs, published as the National Assessment of Career and Technical Education (NACTE) in 2014. The report highlights key findings on the state of CTE in the US and Perkins IV implementation. Federal appropriations for Perkins IV have decreased since the 2006 reauthorization. Federal appropriations for Perkins IV have declined by 24% from FY2007 to FY2014, with state allocations decreasing by 6% to 30%. In PY2008-2009, Perkins funds were mainly used for equipment purchases and career guidance. A survey revealed that many CTE teachers did not understand programs of study (POS) in Perkins IV. The flexibility in defining core performance indicators hinders valid performance comparisons among states. The percentage of high school graduates completing four-year college preparatory coursework nearly doubled from 1990 to 2009, with CTE students showing larger increases than non-CTE students. Participation in CTE programs may increase students' chances of completing college preparatory coursework, but this could be due to changes in participation rather than the impact of CTE. College-going and completion rates varied by CTE concentration field, with different rates for different fields. The allocation formula for Perkins IV Basic State Grant funds targets states with higher proportions of aged 15 to 19 and lower per capita incomes. Funds are awarded to states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands after reservations for outlying areas and Native American and Native Hawaiian CTE Programs. The initial allocation formula for Perkins IV Basic State Grant funds is based on three population groups in each state: persons aged 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 65, with different weights assigned to each group. The second factor is the state's allotment ratio, calculated by dividing the state's per capita income by the national average PCI. This results in higher allotment ratio values for states with low PCIs and lower values for states with high PCIs. No state may have an allotment ratio higher than 0.6. The initial allocation formula for Perkins IV Basic State Grant funds is based on three population groups in each state: persons aged 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 65, with different weights assigned to each group. Allotment ratios for states with higher or lower calculated ratios are set to either 0.6 or 0.4, respectively. Each state's initial allocation is then calculated by adding four quantities based on weighted populations in the three age groups and allotment ratios. The initial allocation formula for Perkins IV Basic State Grant funds is based on three population groups in each state: persons aged 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 65, with different weights assigned to each group. Allocationprop is calculated as the state's proportion of total funding determined by the sum of the formulas. States with lower PCIs and higher numbers of persons aged 15 to 19 will receive the highest initial allocations. Perkins IV has two formulas for adjusting state initial allocations. Perkins IV has two formulas for adjusting state initial allocations based on funding availability compared to FY2006. The first formula is used if funding is equal to or less than FY2006 levels, ensuring minimum grant provisions for each state. The Perkins IV formula adjusts state initial allocations based on funding availability compared to FY2006. It includes three possible minimum grant amounts calculated based on different criteria. The smallest amount is compared with the state's FY1998 allocation to determine the minimum grant amount. If a state's initial allocation is lower, it is increased to meet the minimum grant amount. If it exceeds the minimum, it is reduced to ensure all states meet their minimum grant amounts. Additional adjustments are made if necessary to meet minimum grant requirements. When appropriations are at the FY2006 level or lower, state allocations may be reduced below minimum grant amounts, with further reductions possible until all states meet their minimum grant amounts. A different formula applies when total appropriations exceed FY2006 levels, with initial allocations calculated similarly. State grants are adjusted using the state minimum grant rule of 0.5% of total allocations, along with a special rule for distributing \"new money.\" The formula for state allocations when total funding exceeds FY2006 levels would allot up to one-third of the new money to bring states with allocations below 0.5% of total allocations up to the 0.5% level. States furthest below the 0.5% mark would receive proportionately larger shares of the new money. None of the states with initial allocations below 0.5% could end up with final allocations above 0.5%. If total appropriations are high enough, each state should reach the 0.5% minimum allocation. The remaining funds would be allocated to the remaining states. The remaining funds, if total appropriations are high enough, would be allocated to states in proportion to their initial allocations, ensuring no state receives less than its FY1998 allocation."
