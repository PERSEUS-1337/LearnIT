    "content": "On May 11, 2005, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Act (P.L. 109-13) included a provision for border fencing, originating from H.R. 418. This bill was passed by the House on December 16, 2005, and referred to the Senate. Additionally, on December 6, 2005, H.R. 4312, the Border Security and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2005, was reported out of the Homeland Security Committee. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary reported out Senator Specter's draft bill on March 27, 2006. A modified version was introduced as a substitute amendment to S. 2454 on March 30. Despite several failed cloture votes, the Hagel-Martinez compromise was introduced as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611 / S. 2612) on April 24, 2006, and passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006. The Immigration Reform Act of 2006 was passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006. H.R. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006, was introduced in the House, passed on September 14, 2006. Senate Amendment 4788 added $1.8 billion for border fencing to H.R. 5631, passed by the Senate on September 7, 2006. Border security was previously managed by various federal departments. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated federal agencies to secure America's borders under the Department of Homeland Security. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act eliminated the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security and required Customs and Border Protection to manage border security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated federal agencies under the Department of Homeland Security. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act eliminated BTS and required CBP and ICE to report directly to the Secretary's office. Border security involves controlling official ports of entry and patrolling land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries. CBP is responsible for securing the nation's international border at POE. The report focuses on border security issues related to the movement of people into the country, particularly legislation pending in the 109th Congress. It aims to prevent illegal entry of terrorists, unauthorized aliens, and contraband, with a forthcoming report planned for cargo security issues. The report discusses legislation related to border security and the role of the United States Border Patrol (USBP) in securing the U.S. international land border. USBP patrols over 8,000 miles of borders using various resources like UAVs, sensors, fences, and vehicles to prevent illegal entry of terrorists, weapons, and criminals. The 109th Congress debates DHS resources for border security, with bills requiring a comprehensive plan and National Strategy for Border Security within one year of enactment. The 109th Congress debates DHS resources for border security, with bills requiring a comprehensive plan and National Strategy for Border Security within one year of enactment. The plan includes risk assessments, technology needs, staffing requirements, civil rights considerations, and implementation timelines. The USBP incorporated physical barriers on the border in the early 1990s as part of their strategy to reduce unauthorized migration. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) which authorized the construction of a triple-layered fence along 14 miles of the US-Mexico border near San Diego. Construction stalled due to environmental concerns. Bills in the 109th Congress included provisions for border fencing. The REAL ID Act of 2005 expanded the Secretary's authority to waive legal requirements. The Secretary's authority to waive legal requirements for expedited construction of barriers and roads was expanded by P.L. 109-13. Various bills in Congress propose the construction of fences along the southwest border, with different provisions and funding amounts. Several bills in Congress, including H.R. 4313, S. 2061, S. 2117, S. 2368, and S. 2377, aim to construct a reinforced fence along the southern border to address high alien traffic and smuggling. Additionally, H.R. 4313, S. 2117, S. 2368, and 2377 propose creating a border zone within 100 yards of the land border, requiring other agencies to transfer land to DHS. S. 2394 directs DHS to plan, construct, and maintain a permanent barrier or wall along the border. H.R. 4437 and H.R. 6061 aim to construct reinforced fencing, barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors along 730 miles of the southern border, with priority areas designated for completion by specific deadlines. H.R. 6061 aims to complete fencing along the southern border by December 31, 2008, with priority areas designated. Various bills propose replacing current border fencing in the Tucson Sector with a double layer fence and constructing vehicle barriers. Additionally, the bills require extending fencing beyond urban areas and adding vehicle barriers in the Yuma Sector. S. 2454, S.Amdt. 3192, S. 2611, and S. 2612 would direct DHS to study the construction of barriers along the southern and northern borders, including costs, environmental impacts, and impact on trade. S. 2611 and S. 3564 would require DHS to build 370 miles of triple-layered fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers in high-traffic areas within two years. Consultation with Mexican authorities is also mandated to promote cooperation and understanding. The House-passed Defense Appropriations Bill for FY2007 would allocate $1,829 million for the National Guard to construct barriers along the southwest border. Various bills have been introduced to involve the military or civilians in patrolling the U.S. border, with some focusing on state involvement in immigration law enforcement. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 includes a provision requiring a report on the potential use of military air assets to support DHS in surveilling the border. This replaced prior language in a House-passed bill that would have authorized the U.S. military to assist DHS in border enforcement. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 includes a provision requiring a report on the potential use of military air assets to support DHS in surveilling the border. This provision would allow the Department of Defense to assign members of the armed forces to assist DHS in preventing the entry of terrorists, drug traffickers, and illegal aliens at the border. The bills H.R. 688, H.R. 3333, H.R. 4240, and S. 2394 propose amendments to the Posse Comitatus Act to allow military involvement in preventing unauthorized entry at the border. Other bills suggest collaboration between DHS and DOD for border surveillance. Several bills propose collaboration between DHS and DOD for border surveillance, including the use of military equipment and assets along the southern border. State governors may also be allowed to deploy National Guard personnel for border assistance. The National Guard would provide support for border security, including logistical, technical, and medical assistance, but would be prohibited from participating in law enforcement activities. Legislation would explore incentives for recruiting military personnel into CBP. Additionally, proposals for civilian border patrol organizations, such as a Border Patrol Auxiliary with similar powers to Border Patrol agents, are being considered. H.R. 3622 authorizes states to establish Border Protection Corps (BPC) to prevent illegal entry, with DHS reimbursing expenses. H.R. 4099 creates Citizen Corps within USA Freedom Corps to coordinate homeland security volunteer activities, including Border Corps to assist USBP with surveillance and administrative tasks. The bill focuses on providing support for surveillance, communication, transportation, and administrative tasks. It authorizes annual appropriations for the Citizen Corps and Border Corps. It establishes a Deputy Border Patrol Agent Program with retired law enforcement officers and a Volunteer Border Marshal Program with volunteer state peace officers. Additionally, it directs CBP to establish a National Border Neighborhood Watch Program. The bill directs CBP to establish a National Border Neighborhood Watch (NBNW) Program, allowing civilians and retired federal law enforcement officers to assist USBP in patrolling the border. Within NBNW, a Border Regiment Assisting in Valuable Enforcement (BRAVE) Force would be created with retired local law enforcement officers hired by CBP. Volunteers would report immigration law violations to BRAVE Force employees and be reimbursed for expenses. BRAVE Force employees would not be liable for volunteer actions, and volunteers would not be excused from personal liability. The bills mentioned, such as S. 1438, S. 1916, H.R. 3938, H.R. 4099, H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, and H.R. 5067, aim to add additional USBP agents each year from FY2007 to FY2010 or FY2011 as authorized by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004. Other bills like H.R. 4313, S. 2061, S. 2368, and S. 2377 propose adding 1,000 agents each year from FY2007 through FY2011. S. 2454, S.Amdt. 3192, S. 2611, S. 2612, and S. 3564 would add 400 agents each year from FY2007 to FY2010 and authorize an increase of 2,400 agents in FY2011, with a directive to deploy 20% of the increase to the Northern border. S. 2611 also includes a provision for an additional 3,000 agents from FY2007 to FY2011 and directs DHS to eliminate fixed deployment of USBP agents in the field. The bills aim to increase the number of USBP agents in the field. H.R. 1817 would authorize funding for 2,000 additional agents in FY2006, while H.R. 4044 would increase the USBP by 2,500 agents in FY2006 and additional agents in subsequent years. S. 2391 would direct DHS to increase the USBP by 4,000 agents each year from FY2007 to FY2011. H.R. 4044 also includes provisions to increase student loan repayment programs for USBP agents. H.R. 5456 aims to increase recruitment and relocation bonuses for USBP agents, reestablish the Anti-Smuggling Unit with 500 criminal investigators, and raise pay for journeyman USBP officers to GS-13 level. Other bills require a review of USBP training practices for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Several bills, including H.R. 5067, S. 2454, S.Amdt. 3192, S. 2611, and S. 2612, require a review of using nonfederal training programs for USBP agents. S. 2934 directs DHS to study hiring retired federal law enforcement officers part-time for CBP and implement a five-year program for recruitment and retention. H.R. 5813 directs DHS to control costs of hiring, training, and deploying new USBP agents, ensuring per-agent cost does not exceed $150,000. H.R. 5814 also addresses cost control measures for hiring and training USBP agents. H.R. 5814 allows CPB to appoint 500 full-time Federal retirees to secure U.S. borders for up to five years. It also establishes a plan to strengthen recruitment and retention of Border Patrol agents. Several bills include provisions for procuring surveillance technologies to enhance border monitoring. Several bills, including H.R. 5067, H.R. 6061, S. 2454, S.Amdt. 3192, S. 2611, S. 2612, S. 3564, and S. 2391, call for systematic surveillance of the international land and maritime borders of the United States using technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sensors, satellites, radars, and cameras. They also propose the creation of a \"virtual fence\" along the border with integrated technologies that do not require manual operation. Additionally, S. 1438, S. 1916, and H.R. 3938 suggest the procurement of UAVs, cameras, poles, sensors, and other surveillance equipment. H.R. 3938, S. 2368, S. 2377, H.R. 1320, S. 1033, S. 2391, H.R. 2330, S. 2049, and H.R. 5456 propose various measures to enhance border security, including the procurement of UAVs, cameras, sensors, and other technologies. Funding is authorized annually from FY2005 to FY2010 for these purposes. H.R. 5456 and S. 2394 authorize the deployment of cameras, motion detectors, UAVs, and other technologies to secure the U.S. border. Various bills require the DHS Inspector General to review contracts over $20 million for border security initiatives. Additionally, S. 2391 mandates reviews of new contracts over $5 million for border surveillance. S. 2611, S. 2612, and S. 3564 include provisions for aerial surveillance programs. The bills authorize the establishment of an Aerial Surveillance Program and an Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program for border security. The Aerial Surveillance Program would assess and integrate aerial surveillance technologies for continuous monitoring of the southern and northern borders, consulting with the Secretary of Defense and the FAA. Funds are allocated for MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicles. The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program would procure UAVs, cameras, sensors, and technologies to create a \"virtual fence\" along the borders. The bills propose the creation of a \"virtual fence\" along the borders using surveillance technologies. DHS would develop performance measures and standards for the program. The Secretary would be directed to make physical infrastructure enhancements to prevent unlawful entry and achieve operational control of the border. Additionally, funds would be allocated for all-weather roads and vehicle barriers. The bills propose funding for constructing roads and vehicle barriers along the border to achieve operational control. Various bills authorize appropriations for this purpose from different fiscal years. Several bills, including H.R. 1320, H.R. 3137, H.R. 3333, H.R. 3938, H.R. 4172, H.R. 4313, H.R. 4437, S. 1362, S. 1438, S. 2049, S. 2061, S. 2368, S. 2377, S. 2394, S. 2454, S.Amdt. 3192, S. 2611, and S. 2612, require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to collaborate with the Attorney General to improve connectivity between DHS's IDENT and the FBI's IAFIS fingerprint databases. Additionally, these bills mandate that DHS provide the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) with information on certain categories of aliens for inclusion in the NCIC database. H.R. 4044 would provide resources to the USBP, including helicopters, powerboats, vehicles, computers, radios, GPS receivers, body armor, and night-vision equipment. H.R. 4437 would require USBP uniforms to be made in the United States. Several bills would require DHS to develop a plan for clear two-way communications for agents working along the border. The bills S. 2611 and S. 3564 aim to enhance the resources of the USBP by adding helicopters, powerboats, vehicles, computers, GPS devices, body armor, and night-vision equipment. They also require DHS to ensure proper equipment for agents, including police-type vehicles with access to law enforcement databases, panic buttons, and GPS. Additionally, the bills give USBP control over all assets used in their mission. The USBP utilizes various assets for its mission, including aircraft, watercraft, vehicles, and personnel. Non-Mexican and non-Canadian aliens apprehended by USBP agents are not returned to Mexico or Canada but to their nation of origin. Expedited removal allows for removal without appearing before an immigration judge. Some bills in Congress may change expedited removal procedures. Several bills in Congress propose expanding expedited removal to all aliens apprehended within 100 miles of the border and within 14 days of entry, as well as to all USBP sectors along the southwest border. These bills also include provisions for certification of security risks and appropriations for funding. The bills in Congress aim to address the issue of releasing apprehended non-Mexican aliens due to lack of detention space by proposing mandatory detention for all aliens apprehended at ports of entry or along the border. Exceptions are made for voluntary departures and humanitarian parole, with a deadline set for October 1, 2007. The creation of the DHS led to the reorganization of agencies, including the transfer of the Air and Marine Interdiction Division (AMID) to ICE, which later became the Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO). Concerns were raised by Congress about potential overlap between agencies with air and marine assets within DHS, leading to AMO being moved back to CBP under the FY2005 DHS Appropriations Act. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reorganized agencies, including transferring the Air and Marine Interdiction Division (AMID) to ICE, which later became the Office of Air and Marine Operations (AMO). Concerns about overlap led to AMO being moved back to CBP. H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, and H.R. 5067 propose establishing a separate entity within DHS for AMO, reporting directly to the Secretary and headed by a presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary for Air and Marine Operations. The bills would codify the missions and duties of the new office. The report, required within 120 days of enactment, assesses the impact of the NCR airspace security mission on DHS's border protection efforts. Legislation criminalizes the construction and use of tunnels crossing the U.S. border, with fines and imprisonment for offenders. The bills aim to address coordination between DHS and tribal governments along the U.S. international border, including creating sentencing guidelines for border tunnel offenses and establishing an \"Office of Tribal Security\" within DHS. Additionally, there are proposals to establish a grant program for Indian Tribes with lands adjacent to the border for law enforcement activities. The bills propose a grant program for Indian Tribes near the border for various activities, including law enforcement, health care, and environmental restoration. They also require a report from DHS on USBP access to tribal lands and strategies for improving cooperation with tribal authorities. The Shadow Wolves, an elite Customs Patrol unit, operated within the Tohono O'odham reservation to enforce customs laws and interdict smugglers. The Shadow Wolves, a unit within CBP, consists of certified Native American members. Bills like H.R. 1320, H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, H.R. 5067, and H.R. 5813 aim to transfer the unit to ICE for its investigative functions. Some bills allow states to use grant funding for detecting and responding to illegal entry of aliens. S. 2611, S. 2612, and S. 3564 propose a Border Relief Grant Program to address border-related crime by awarding grants to state, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies. The grants would prioritize communities of less than 50,000 within 100 miles of the border, providing funds for hiring personnel, acquiring equipment, and covering operating costs. The program would be funded at $50 million annually from FY2007 to FY2011, with two-thirds allocated to states with high undocumented alien apprehensions and the rest to High Impact Areas designated by the Secretary. H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, and H.R. 5067 aim to collect data on aliens requiring medical attention when apprehended, establish a Border Security Advisory Committee, and address border-related crime. S. 2611, S. 2612, and S. 3564 focus on collecting statistics on deaths at the southwest border and proposing a Border Relief Grant Program for law enforcement agencies near the border. H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, and H.R. 5067 propose establishing a Center of Excellence for Border Security and conducting a border security exercise involving various government entities and the private sector to test threat detection and information sharing capabilities. These bills also require coordination between CBP, ICE, and Citizenship and Immigration Services within DHS. Various mechanisms and task-forces are being formed within DHS to share information, intelligence, and analysis between immigration-related agencies. The purpose is to better coordinate federal efforts and allocate resources to manage and control the border. Several bills call for reports on improving homeland security information exchange, developing security standards, sharing information on high-risk individuals, identifying immigration fraud trends, and developing terrorist watch lists. DHS is directed to cooperate with the Department of the Interior in securing federal land. The bills would direct DHS to cooperate with the Department of the Interior in securing federal land along the international land border, providing increased enforcement personnel and surveillance technology. DHS personnel would receive federal land resource training to minimize adverse impacts on natural and cultural resources. Additionally, the bills would require DOI to develop an inventory of costs related to illegal border activity and joint recommendations for cost recovery. DHS and DOI would jointly develop a border protection strategy for federal lands along the border. Currently, there are 317 official points of entry (POE) into the United States, including 216 airports, 143 seaports, and 115 land POEs. CBP officers at these POEs inspect travelers' documentation to determine their legal authorization to enter, using various databases. Legislation in Congress is considering issues related to this process, including implementing a biometric entry/exit program. The US-VISIT Program requires selected foreign nationals to submit fingerprints and a photograph when entering the US through airports. Bills are calling for enhancements to the program, including collecting 10 fingerprints from aliens entering the country. Some bills also propose expanding the system to include biometric data collection from visitors exiting the country and alien crew members landing in the US. Several bills propose funding for an automated entry exit biometric program at all land ports of entry, integrating arrival and departure information into an electronic database, and requiring biometric information collection from visiting aliens entering and exiting the country. Additionally, a bill would create an Office of US-VISIT Outreach to inform local border officials and residents about program developments. H.R. 4313, H.R. 4437, S. 2454, S.Amdt. 3192, S. 2611, S. 2612, S. 3564, and H.R. 5017 propose implementing an entry and exit system with biometric data collection at all land ports of entry. The bills also require the submission of timelines for deploying the US-VISIT system, making immigration screening systems interoperable, and adding withholding biometric data as a ground for inadmissibility. H.R. 5017 would require DHS to report to Congress on compliance with IRTPA requirements for an entry and exit system. It also mandates the GAO to certify system implementation. H.R. 1320 aims to make SENTRI and NEXUS programs permanent, establish remote enrollment centers, and authorize appropriations for program expansion. H.R. 4437, as amended, would require DHS to submit a timeline for immigration screening system implementation. H.R. 4437, as amended, requires DHS to make immigration screening systems interoperable and implement a pilot program for automated systems at foreign airports. The program would screen passenger information against the terrorist watchlist using machine-readable passport data. Additionally, several bills mandate the hiring of 250 CBP officers annually at POEs from FY2006 to FY2010. Several bills, including S. 2368, S. 2377, S. 2454, and S.Amdt. 3192, propose adding 250 CBP officers each year from FY2007 to FY2011. S. 2454 and S.Amdt. 3192 also suggest adding 250 POE inspectors annually during the same period. Other bills like S. 2611, S. 2612, and H.R. 3564 aim to add at least 500 POE inspectors each year, with varying authorization periods. H.R. 3333 would authorize DHS to hire 2,000 additional CBP immigration inspectors by FY2008. H.R. 2092, S. 2049, and H.R. 2391 propose hiring 1,000 to 1,500 CBP officers annually from FY2007 to FY2011. H.R. 2092 also suggests extending retirement benefits and raising pay levels for CBP officers. H.R. 1320 would double the number of CBP personnel and authorize the installation of radiation portal monitors at southern POEs. H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, and H.R. 5067 would deploy radiation portal monitors to all POEs. H.R. 4412 aims to integrate IBIS with USCIS databases. S. 2611, S. 2612, and S. 3564 would create a POE technology demonstration program to test new technologies for inspections and port tracking. The DHS would be authorized to implement a demonstration program at three to five POEs for port tracking, identification of persons and cargo, sensory devices, personal detection, decision support, and detection of weapons of mass destruction. Several bills include provisions for funding POE infrastructure and resources, such as H.R. 1320 authorizing $1 billion for a Land Border Infrastructure Improvement Fund and H.R. 4313 adding 25 POE along the international land border with $125 million in appropriations. The bills S. 2061, S. 2368, S. 2377, S. 2394, S. 2611, S. 2612, and S. 3564 authorize the construction of additional Ports of Entry (POE) and improvements to existing ones. They also require reports on POE infrastructure status and prioritize projects for security and trade facilitation. Additionally, they direct the General Services Administration to update a study on POE infrastructure and technology improvements. DHS is tasked with submitting a National Land Border Security Plan to Congress in collaboration with other entities involved in international trade. The bills S. 2611, S. 2612, and S.Amdt. 3192 propose creating criminal penalties for aliens attempting to elude customs inspections at Ports of Entry (POE). Offenders could face up to three years in prison, with increased penalties for bodily harm or death resulting from their actions. Failure to obey CBP officers' directives at a POE while driving would be considered evidence of smuggling. H.R. 6061 proposes evaluating CBP's authority to stop vehicles entering the US illegally, comparing it to the Coast Guard's authority, assessing equipment and technology for stopping vehicles, and reviewing training provided to CBP personnel. Failure to obey lawful orders could result in a fine or up to five years in prison. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 changed documentation requirements for citizens of Western Hemisphere countries, requiring proof of citizenship for entry into the US. S. 2611 would authorize the development of a passport card for US citizens to travel to certain countries and extend the deadline for implementing new requirements. The DHS has certified that the process for applying and receiving passport cards meets requirements outlined in the bill. The bill also sets a maximum fee of $34 for the card and requires DHS to establish a program for U.S. citizens without passports. Additionally, the bill directs DHS to enter a demonstration project with a state to include citizenship information on driver's licenses. The bill would require DHS to establish a program allowing U.S. citizens without required documentation to cross the border for up to 72 hours. It also mandates a grace period for those unaware of documentary changes. H.R. 5456 stipulates that within a year, no individual can enter the U.S. without proper documentation. Customs and immigration inspections at ports of entry were integrated under DHS through the \"One Face at the Border\" initiative. H.R. 4312, H.R. 4437, and H.R. 5067 require DHS to submit a report on goals and benefits. H.R. 4437, H.R. 5067, H.R. 4044, H.R. 1320, and H.R. 1817 focus on DHS reports regarding inspector training, coordination between inspectional occupations, and the \"One Face at the Border Initiative.\" There is debate on the organizational division between CBP and ICE in the 109th Congress. H.R. 1817 requires a report on the organizational division of CBP and ICE. Several bills mandate an increase in canine detection teams at U.S. ports of entry from 2007 to 2011. DHS is directed to boost the number of trained canine teams each year. Coordination and maximizing the use of canine training facilities are also emphasized. H.R. 4958, H.R. 5813, H.R. 5814, and H.R. 1320 aim to establish a competitive grant program for domestic breeders of canines for detection training purposes, increase CBP canine units by 20%, and implement a voluntary accreditation process for canine detection teams acquired with DHS grant funds. H.R. 1320 authorizes appropriations to increase CBP canine units by 20% and mandates distribution to both northern and southern borders for bomb, passenger, and currency detection purposes."
