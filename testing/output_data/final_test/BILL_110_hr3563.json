    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Prostate Research, Imaging, and Men's Education Act of 2007\" or the \"PRIME Act of 2007\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant issue, especially among African-American men, with mortality rates comparable to breast cancer in women. Breakthroughs in breast cancer screening and treatment have been made possible by advanced imaging technologies developed by the Federal Government. Men should have access to accurate and affordable prostate cancer screening and treatment options similar to those available for breast cancer. While current screening methods are important, a recent study funded by the NCI showed limitations in detecting prostate cancer using the PSA blood test. The current methods of detecting prostate cancer are not always accurate, leading to false alarms and missed cancers. Advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer are lacking, resulting in unnecessary medical procedures and complications. Prostate imaging tools could reduce physical, psychological, and financial trauma for men and their families, saving billions in healthcare costs. Research and development of prostate cancer imaging technologies is crucial for improving accuracy in detection and reducing unnecessary medical procedures and complications. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expand research on advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. A grant program will support early-stage research for innovative ideas in prostate imaging. The Secretary of Health and Human Services aims to advance research in prostate cancer imaging for improved patient care, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. The program will involve utilizing the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and the National Cancer Institute for later-stage research, technology development, and clinical trials. Additionally, interdisciplinary private-public partnerships will be established to support the program. The Secretary will establish partnerships for research in imaging and image-guided treatment, addressing racial disparities in prostate cancer incidences and mortality rates. $100,000,000 is authorized for the program annually from 2008 to 2012. For each fiscal year, at least 10% of funds must go to the grant program under subsection (b), and no more than 1% to subsection (d). SEC. 4. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary will conduct a national campaign to raise awareness about prostate cancer screening and detection technologies. This campaign will involve various health organizations and include the distribution of educational materials and public service announcements to encourage men to seek screening. The Secretary will establish a program to award grants for nonprofit entities to test outreach strategies for increasing awareness of prostate cancer screening and improved imaging technologies, focusing on addressing racial disparities in cancer incidences and mortality rates. Authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for screening and imaging technologies. The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, will conduct research to develop an improved prostate cancer screening blood test using in-vitro detection. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 through 2012 for this purpose. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 6 months detailing the implementation strategy of the Act. Within 1 year of enactment, and annually thereafter, reports must be submitted describing funded research, prioritizing high-risk innovation, and addressing barriers to care for racial minorities in clinical trials. The Act requires reports to Congress on implementation strategy within 6 months and annual reports on funded research for racial minorities in clinical trials. Compliance with Act provisions must be certified."
