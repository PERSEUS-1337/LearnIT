Congress has the power to waive or qualify immunity, and the FTCA makes the United States liable for the negligent acts of its employees. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives sovereign immunity for tort suits against the United States, making it liable for the torts of its employees to the extent private employers are liable under state law. Exceptions include the Feres doctrine, discretionary function exception, and intentional tort exception. The United States may not be held liable for strict liability, interest prior to judgment, or punitive damages. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) waives sovereign immunity for tort suits against the United States, making it liable for the torts of its employees to the extent private employers are liable under state law. Exceptions include the Feres doctrine, discretionary function exception, and intentional tort exception. The United States may not be held liable for interest prior to judgment or punitive damages under certain circumstances outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2674 and 2680. Additionally, there are specific exclusions for claims related to loss or negligent transmission of postal matter, tax or customs duties, combatant activities, fiscal operations of the Treasury, regulation of the monetary system, and claims arising in a foreign country. Claimants must present their claims to the relevant federal agency within two years of the claim accruing before filing suit under the FTCA. The Federal Tort Claims Act waives sovereign immunity for tort suits against the United States, making it liable for the torts of its employees. Claimants must present their claims to the relevant federal agency within two years of the claim accruing. If the agency denies the claim, the claimant has six months to file suit in federal district court. If a claimant sues a federal employee for a tort, the United States will be substituted as the defendant in federal court. If the plaintiff fails to present a claim to the agency, the suit will be dismissed. The Federal Tort Claims Act allows for tort suits against the United States, with claimants required to present their claims to the relevant federal agency within two years. If a claimant sues a federal employee for a tort, the United States will be substituted as the defendant in federal court. The agency may settle claims up to $25,000 without approval, unless delegated by the Attorney General. Attorneys representing claimants under the FTCA can settle claims up to $1 million. Settlements under $2,500 are paid by the agency, while larger settlements come from general revenues. Attorneys can only charge up to 25% of a court award or settlement. The United States may only pay attorneys' fees if found to have acted in bad faith. The Westfall Act amended the FTCA to be the exclusive remedy for claims against the United States. The Westfall Act amended the FTCA to make it the exclusive remedy for torts committed by federal employees within the scope of their employment, providing immunity from liability under state tort law. Federal employees can still be sued for violating the Constitution or federal statutes. The Act also bars cases if a judgment in the FTCA case is handed down before a judgment in the case against the employee. The Westfall Act provides immunity to federal employees from state tort law suits, with the United States being substituted as the defendant if the Attorney General certifies that the employee was acting within the scope of their employment. This certification allows for the case to be moved from state court to federal district court. The Westfall Act grants immunity to federal employees from state tort law suits if the Attorney General certifies they were acting within their employment scope. This certification allows for the case to be transferred from state court to federal district court. If the employee's actions are found to be outside their employment scope, the case must be sent back to state court. The Supreme Court has addressed the certification provisions in two cases. The Attorney General's certification under the Westfall Act is subject to court review. This certification allows for federal employees to be substituted by the United States as defendants in tort cases under the FTCA. If the employee was acting outside the scope of employment, plaintiffs can seek review of the certification. The Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision regarding the reviewability of the Attorney General's certification under the Westfall Act. In Osborn v. Haley, a federal employee's certification was invalidated by a federal district court, leading to a remand of the suit to state court. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision that the United States must remain as a defendant unless the employee's conduct is proven to be beyond the scope of employment. The Court examined conflicting statutory provisions regarding the remand of a case certified by the Attorney General from state court to federal district court. The Supreme Court ruled that once the Attorney General certifies a case to be removed from state court to federal district court, the federal district court must retain jurisdiction and cannot remand. The application of the FTCA's statute of limitations to suits against the United States is discussed, and the exclusion for injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service was established in Feres v. United States. The Supreme Court found that prohibiting recovery for injuries sustained incident to service would align with the statutory scheme, as the United States is only liable to the same extent as a private individual under similar circumstances. This limitation could exclude service-connected injuries, as there is no precedent for a private individual to be held liable for such injuries. The Supreme Court's decision in Feres was influenced by the fact that the act makes the law of the place where the act occurred govern liability, which doesn't make sense for soldiers who are not free to choose their habitat. Congress also enacted laws providing compensation for injuries in the armed services, but made no provision for how recovery under the FTCA would affect entitlement to such compensation. The Supreme Court's decision in Feres concluded that the Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen arising from activities incident to service. The Court emphasized that the relationship between military personnel and the Government is governed by federal law, and Congress did not intend to create a new cause of action dependent on local law for service-connected injuries. The Feres doctrine, as identified in Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. v. United States, is based on three rationales. The Feres doctrine is based on three rationales: the distinct federal relationship between the Government and Armed Forces, the Veterans' Benefits Act providing no-fault compensation, and the special relationship of soldiers to their superiors. The Feres doctrine, reaffirmed in United States v. Shearer, prohibits suits under the Tort Claims Act for negligent acts committed during military duty. Each case is examined individually based on Feres and subsequent cases, with significant factors determining if the doctrine applies. The Feres doctrine bars suits that require civilian courts to second-guess military decisions or impair military discipline. Other factors mentioned in Feres are no longer controlling, as reaffirmed in United States v. Johnson. In Atkinson v. United States, a medical malpractice suit was allowed under the FTCA for injuries suffered by a servicewoman in an Army hospital. The government sought a rehearing after the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Johnson caused the Ninth Circuit's panel to reverse its opinion in Atkinson. The plaintiff in Atkinson alleged negligence by Army hospital personnel resulting in a stillborn child and injuries. The panel initially cited the Feres doctrine but later reversed its decision. The Supreme Court declined to review the case. In Shearer, the Supreme Court emphasized a case-by-case approach to claims of immunity, stating that there was no military connection in the medical treatment of a woman seeking to have a healthy baby. The decision did not exempt all military malpractice suits from the Feres doctrine. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Johnson that the Feres doctrine applies to bar suits on behalf of military personnel injured incident to service, even in cases involving torts committed by employees of civilian agencies. The court considered the connection between a serviceman or servicewoman's medical treatment and the decisional or disciplinary interest protected by the Feres doctrine. The Feres doctrine was reexamined and reaffirmed, citing three reasons from Stencel. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the doctrine is not in the FTCA and was wrongly decided. The Ninth Circuit reversed itself in Atkinson, noting the Court's approval of all three Feres rationales. Johnson appears to breathe new life into the first two rationales supporting the Feres doctrine, despite reluctance to carve out an exception after Court endorsement. In Del Rio v. United States, a servicewoman sued for medical malpractice after negligent prenatal care at a military hospital resulted in bodily injury to one twin and the death of the other. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the Feres doctrine in a case where a servicewoman's twins suffered injuries at a military hospital. Another court ruled in a similar case that negligent prenatal care resulting in infant death was also barred by the Feres doctrine. Additionally, the Feres doctrine was applied to preclude a claim for medical malpractice during a pre-induction physical in another case. The Feres doctrine was upheld in a case involving medical malpractice during a pre-induction physical. The court found that the federal relationship between the government and military personnel applied, with no exception for medical malpractice cases. There may be changes in the future due to potential actions by the Supreme Court or Congress. The Feres doctrine could potentially be overturned by the Supreme Court or amended by Congress, allowing for medical malpractice suits against the government. This doctrine has been applied to bar suits under various statutes, including the Privacy Act. In the 111th Congress, the Carmelo Rodriguez Military Medical Accountability Act of 2009 (H.R. 1478/S. 1347) was introduced to amend the FTCA, allowing armed forces members to file claims against the US for certain injuries from improper medical care. The bill permits claims for injuries in foreign countries but excludes claims from combatant activities during armed conflicts. The discretionary function exception in the FTCA shields the US from liability for claims related to discretionary functions. In Dalehite v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that federal employees are protected from liability for negligence in discretionary duties. This includes decisions made by executives in establishing plans and operations. Acts of subordinates following official directions are not actionable. In United States v. Varig Airlines, victims of airplane accidents alleged that the FAA had acted negligently. The Supreme Court ruled that the FAA's \"spot-checking\" program for certifying airplanes was protected from liability for negligence, as it accommodates safety goals and agency resources. Judicial intervention in such decisions would require courts to second-guess agency judgments. The FAA employees conducting compliance reviews are protected by the discretionary function exception. In Berkovitz v. United States, the Supreme Court held the government liable for failing to follow regulations in a case involving a child contracting polio from a vaccine. The Bureau of Biologics of the Food and Drug Administration violated federal regulations in approving the release of a lot of Orimune vaccine that injured an infant. The regulatory scheme required the agency to examine the product and ensure it complies with safety standards before issuing a product license. The plaintiffs alleged that the agency had adopted a policy of testing all vaccine lots for compliance with safety standards before distribution to the public. The Bureau of Biologics of the Food and Drug Administration violated federal regulations by approving a lot of Orimune vaccine that did not comply with safety standards. Despite a policy requiring testing for compliance, employees knowingly approved the lot. The Court ruled that the discretionary function exception would not apply if these allegations were proven, rejecting the idea that the exception exempts the United States from claims based on non-discretionary operational acts. The plaintiff sued the United States for the activities of federal bank regulators in connection with a failing savings and loan association. The regulators were heavily involved in the association's operations, leading to negligence claims and $100 million in damages. The United States argued that the discretionary function exception precluded recovery for negligence claims against federal bank regulators, but the court of appeals found that only some of their activities were protected. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the exception applies to decisions based on policy or at the operational level. The intentional tort exception under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h) excludes claims for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights under the FTCA, unless committed by a federal investigative or law enforcement officer. This exception was added in 1974 due to concerns over abusive actions by federal narcotics agents. In Sheridan v. United States, naval corpsmen found a naval enlisted man unconscious. In Sheridan v. United States, three naval corpsmen failed to alert authorities about a naval enlisted man, Carr, who was inebriated and armed. Carr ended up shooting at passing vehicles, injuring one of the plaintiffs. The intentional tort exception prevented the plaintiffs from suing the government for Carr's actions, so they sued based on the corpsmen's negligence. The government argued that the intentional tort exception applied because the claim arose from assault or battery. The Supreme Court ruled that the intentional tort exception did not apply to the government in Sheridan v. United States. The government could not be held liable for the intentional or negligent acts of an off-duty serviceman not acting within the scope of his employment. This was because the FTCA only holds the government liable for torts committed by an employee within the scope of their office or employment. The Supreme Court ruled in Sheridan v. United States that the intentional tort exception did not apply to the government. The government could not be held liable for the intentional or negligent acts of an off-duty serviceman not acting within the scope of his employment. The Court also raised the question of whether negligent hiring, supervision, or training could lead to liability under the FTCA for a foreseeable assault or battery by a Government employee. In Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. (1988), the Supreme Court established the \"government contractor defense\" for products liability cases involving design defects. Manufacturers can argue that they followed government contract specifications in their product design, protecting them from liability under state law. Justice Kennedy expressed concerns about attributing intentional torts of government employees to negligence of supervisors. In Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. (1988), the Supreme Court established the \"government contractor defense\" for products liability cases involving design defects, citing federal common law and potential conflicts with state law. The Court established the \"government contractor defense\" for products liability cases involving design defects, citing conflicts with state law. In Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. (1988), the Court found that a significant conflict may exist where the state-imposed duty of care contradicts the duty imposed by the Government contract. The government contractor defense may not be available in cases where the state-imposed duty of care does not conflict with the federal contract or if the conflict is not significant. The Supreme Court established the \"government contractor defense\" for products liability cases involving design defects, citing conflicts with state law. The Court explained that military contractor liability would conflict with this doctrine, as it would increase the cost of contracts and defeat the purpose of immunity for military accidents. The Feres doctrine, covering only service-related injuries, could not prevent civilian suits against manufacturers for harm caused by military equipment. The Supreme Court established the \"government contractor defense\" for products liability cases involving design defects in military equipment. The Court found that holding government contractors liable for design defects would conflict with federal law, as it would increase costs for the government and ultimately be passed on to taxpayers. The Supreme Court established the \"government contractor defense\" for design defects in military equipment, ruling that liability cannot be imposed if the equipment met approved specifications and the supplier warned the government about known dangers. This defense prevents conflicts with federal policy and ensures that costs are not passed on to taxpayers. The government contractor defense applies to both civilian and military contractors, based on the discretionary function exception. The policy behind the defense is rooted in military considerations, even though it can apply to civilian equipment as well. The government contractor defense applies to both civilian and military contractors, based on the discretionary function exception. In a case involving civilian equipment, there is a split in the circuits over the applicability of the defense to non-military contractors. The Supreme Court rejected a claim by Agent Orange manufacturers for reimbursement from the government for tort claims brought by Vietnam veterans. The manufacturers sued the United States under the Tucker Act for breach of contract regarding tort liability reimbursement. The Court ruled no implied contract existed and that the government's warranty of specifications did not cover third-party claims. Federal government contractors conducted atomic weapons tests from 1946 to 1962, leading to claims of long-term medical injuries by personnel involved. Military personnel and civilians involved in atomic weapons tests from 1946 to 1962 have claimed long-term medical injuries. Federal law generally prevents them from suing the government or contractors for damages. The Feres doctrine prohibits military personnel from suing the United States, but allows for recovery in certain cases for spouses and children. Courts have distinguished between injuries directly caused by the military and those resulting from a serviceman's service-connected injury. Courts of appeals have applied the Feres doctrine to bar spouses and children of soldiers from recovering for injuries caused by the soldiers' military service, such as exposure to radiation. However, the doctrine does not prevent suits for post-service negligence, like failure to warn or monitor veterans exposed to radiation. A district court allowed a suit by the daughter and grandson of a soldier in such a case. Civilians have also been affected by atomic weapons tests but face limitations in suing for damages. The discretionary function exception to the FTCA has prevented civilians and military personnel from recovering damages for injuries caused by atomic testing. The Supreme Court has not addressed this exception in atomic testing cases, but lower courts have ruled that it bars recovery. In cases like In re Consolidated United States Atmospheric Testing Litigation, courts have cited Dalehite as precedent. In cases like In re Consolidated United States Atmospheric Testing Litigation, the negligent failure of officials to follow safety guidelines resulted in overexposure of test participants. Safety decisions were considered part of policy decisions in the conduct of the weapons tests. The court held that the government's negligence in failing to warn test participants of radiation exposure dangers did not involve simple warnings like hidden obstructions or flash floods, but rather required substantial resources and commitment. The program required difficult judgments balancing the risk from radiation exposure against the risks and burdens of a public program, calling for high-level government discretion. The conclusion is that every aspect of a warning program falls within the discretionary function exception. The Ninth Circuit reached a conclusion similar to In re Consolidated regarding the plaintiffs in Allen who criticized the government for not fully monitoring offsite fallout exposure and providing necessary public information on radioactive fallout. The court found that these actions fell under the discretionary function exception as the government had a broad and discretionary duty to promote safety. No evidence was presented that the AEC or its employees violated specific statutory or regulatory authority. Plaintiffs' case relies on government's lack of better planning, insufficient for FTCA liability. Victims of atomic testing unable to sue federal government contractors due to federal law. The Warner Amendment (P.L. 98-525) states that FTCA lawsuits are the only recourse for radiation exposure injuries from atomic testing by contractors. This provision deems contractor employees as federal employees for legal purposes. However, the Feres doctrine and discretionary function exception limit recovery options. Despite constitutional challenges, two federal courts have upheld the Warner Amendment's validity. Repealing it wouldn't automatically hold contractors liable. In 1990, Congress enacted the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a compensation program for victims of atomic testing and uranium mining. It authorizes payments for individuals who contracted leukemia or certain cancers due to exposure to nuclear tests or uranium mining. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 provides compensation for individuals exposed to specified levels of radiation from 1947 to 1971 who developed lung cancer or respiratory diseases. Accepting compensation forfeits the right to sue the US or federal contractors for related claims. This act was influenced by the Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act of 1988. Department of Justice regulations can be found under 28 C.F.R. Part 79. Federal employees may have immunity from liability for constitutional torts, as seen in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, federal agents entered and searched the plaintiff's apartment without a warrant, leading to the plaintiff's arrest for alleged narcotics violations. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, state officials can be sued for depriving individuals of their constitutional rights. Federal officials, protected by the Westfall Act, are not liable under state tort law, but the Supreme Court ruled in Bivens and subsequent cases that injured parties can seek damages from federal officials for constitutional torts. The Supreme Court ruled in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents that injured parties can seek damages from federal officials for constitutional torts, even though federal officials are not liable under state tort law. However, in cases like Chappell v. Wallace, special factors may limit the availability of such remedies. In United States v. Stanley, the Supreme Court ruled that Feres and Chappell barred a serviceman's claim against the government and officers for being given LSD without his knowledge, causing severe harm. The plaintiff argued that the officers were not his superiors, but the court disagreed. Stanley argues that the injury was not \"incident to service\" and that Chappell implicated military chain-of-command concerns more directly. The Court found that the second argument was not available to Stanley. While Chappell is not strictly controlling, the reasoning does not support the distinction Stanley would rely on. The judgment in the Bivens context should be consistent with previous decisions. In the Bivens context, military concerns should be protected similarly to FTCA suits. The Feres doctrine applies to prevent military personnel from suing the government or federal officials for injuries incurred incident to service. Bivens-type actions are not allowed when Congress has provided an alternative remedy. In Carlson v. Green, a Bivens-type action was allowed against a federal prison official for violating the Eighth Amendment. Congress views FTCA and Bivens as parallel causes of action, as clarified in the 1974 amendment. The Supreme Court has limited the availability of Bivens actions in subsequent cases, such as FDIC v. Meyer. In Correctional Services Corporation v. Malesko, the Supreme Court ruled that Bivens actions cannot be brought against private entities acting under federal law. The purpose of Bivens is to deter individual officers, not policymaking entities, from committing unconstitutional acts. The Court did not decide if an individual officer of a private entity could be subject to a Bivens action. In Wilkie v. Robbins, the Supreme Court explained that recognizing a Bivens remedy may require two steps. In Wilkie v. Robbins, the Supreme Court declined to allow a Bivens action for damages sought from officials of the Bureau of Land Management, citing the need for a convincing reason or special factors before authorizing new federal litigation. The Supreme Court declined to allow a Bivens action, stating that establishing liability solely on a theory of respondeat superior is not possible. Individual liability under Bivens is considered fictional, as the federal government is seen as the real party in interest. The Bivens decision allows individuals to seek damages for constitutional violations, but recoveries are extremely rare. Out of 12,000 claims filed between 1971 and 1985, only four resulted in judgments not reversed on appeal. Since then, recoveries from settlements or litigated judgments remain uncommon, with plaintiffs rarely receiving damages or settlements in Bivens cases. The FTCA grants federal executive officials immunity from state tort law but not from constitutional torts. Qualified immunity is a significant barrier to constitutional tort actions, as established in Butz v. Economou. State executive officers are immune from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 based on the scope of discretion. The existence of reasonable grounds for belief formed at the time, coupled with good-faith belief, provides a basis for qualified immunity of executive officers for acts performed in the course of official conduct. Federal officials may be subject to liability for violating constitutional rights, even if the discretionary function exception of the FTCA would preclude government liability. Congress has the power to grant additional immunity to federal officials."
