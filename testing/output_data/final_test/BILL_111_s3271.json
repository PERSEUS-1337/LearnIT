The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that Event Data Recorders (EDRs) have the potential to improve highway safety by enhancing occupant protection systems, accuracy of crash reconstructions, and collecting various crash-related data elements for all classes of motor vehicles. NHTSA has integrated EDR data collection into its motor vehicle research databases. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has integrated EDR data collection into its motor vehicle research databases. Open access to EDR data can benefit researchers, crash investigators, and manufacturers in improving highway safety. Studies have shown that driver awareness of an on-board EDR can reduce the number and severity of crashes. Different EDR systems may be required for various vehicle classes. Most systems use proprietary technology and need the manufacturer to download and analyze the data. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a rule in 2006 regarding event data recorders in motor vehicles, outlining technical requirements for data collection and format. Recent investigations have emphasized the importance of event data recorders in determining crash causes.

Section 30166 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to define terms related to motor vehicle crashes, including \"model year,\" \"motor vehicle crash,\" and \"owner.\" The term 'owner' in relation to motor vehicles is defined as a person with full ownership rights, regardless of lending or creating security interests. A 'recording device' is a manufacturer-installed feature in a vehicle that complies with specific regulations for data retrieval. Federal Regulations require the installation of Event Data Recorders in new motor vehicles to retrieve information after a crash. This requirement applies to light-duty vehicles with a gross weight rating of up to 8,500 pounds within 1-2 years of promulgated regulations. Federal Regulations mandate the installation of recording devices in new motor vehicles with a weight rating of up to 8,500 pounds. The data stored on these devices must be accessible with a universal data reader. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles must comply within 3-4 years after the promulgation of regulations. Federal regulations require new motor vehicles weighing over 8,500 pounds to have recording devices compliant with part 563 of title 49, CFR. The data stored on these devices must be accessible with a universal data reader. The owner's manual of new motor vehicles with recording devices must disclose their presence. Information from the device can only be accessed by the owner, court authorization, or with owner consent for vehicle maintenance purposes. The government motor vehicle safety agency can retrieve information from recording devices in new vehicles to improve safety, as long as personally identifiable information is not disclosed. The Secretary of Transportation is required to establish regulations for light-duty motor vehicles within 18 months and for medium- and heavy-duty motor vehicles within 3 years of the enactment of the Act."
