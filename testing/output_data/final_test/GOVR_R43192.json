    "content": "The 113th Congress has been active in proposing immigration reform legislation. The Senate passed an omnibus bill (S. 744) addressing various issues, while the House is considering stand-alone bills. The House Judiciary Committee has ordered some bills to be reported, with provisions that may align or differ from the Senate bill. H.R. 2278, the Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act (SAFE Act), aims to enhance immigration enforcement. The Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act (SAFE Act) aims to increase immigration control and enforcement in the United States, particularly within the interior. It includes provisions to address court decisions limiting immigration enforcement, heighten penalties for violations of federal immigration laws, facilitate detention and removal of unauthorized aliens involved in criminal activity, impose additional security-related background checks for aliens seeking admission, and encourage states and localities to participate in immigration enforcement. Amendments were made during Judiciary Committee hearings. The Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement Act (SAFE Act) includes amendments to make unlawful presence by an alien a criminal offense, establish a biometric entry/exit system, and impose more significant penalties for immigration violations compared to the Senate-passed bill. It also tightens requirements for detention and removal of aliens, with a focus on unauthorized alien population. The Senate bill does not criminalize unlawful presence, unlike the SAFE Act. The SAFE Act resembles previous immigration enforcement legislation but includes provisions for potential legalization of some unauthorized immigrants. The report analyzes the SAFE Act's modifications to current immigration laws. The SAFE Act modifies current immigration laws, focusing on sanctions, application review, detention and removal of aliens, visa issuance, naturalization reform, enforcement operations, and state involvement. It aims to strengthen enforcement measures, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, and grounds for denying admission or removing aliens. The Act updates regulations as needed. The SAFE Act aims to strengthen immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, making unlawful presence a criminal offense, broadening grounds for removability, and including more offenses as \"aggravated felonies.\" It also increases immigration consequences for criminal activity and activities posing a security threat. Congress has established penalties for activities that violate immigration rules, affecting aliens' ability to stay in the US. The SAFE Act aims to enhance immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, making unlawful presence a criminal offense, broadening grounds for removability, and including more offenses as \"aggravated felonies.\" It also increases immigration consequences for criminal activity and activities posing a security threat. Several provisions of federal law impose criminal penalties for activities that undermine immigration rules, such as unlawful entry, document forgery, and harboring certain aliens. The SAFE Act would modify existing immigration-related criminal offenses to widen their scope and increase penalties. The SAFE Act aims to enhance immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, making unlawful presence a criminal offense, and broadening grounds for removability. Section 315 of the SAFE Act would rewrite INA Section 275, making it a criminal offense for an alien to violate the terms of admission or parole, or be unlawfully present in the country. First-time offenders could face fines and/or imprisonment for up to six months, with heightened penalties for prior criminal convictions. Subsequent convictions for illegal entry would result in felony penalties. The SAFE Act aims to enhance immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, making unlawful presence a criminal offense, and broadening grounds for removability. Section 315 of the bill would amend INA Section 275 to impose felony penalties for crossing the border illegally, while also providing exceptions for minors, asylum applicants, battered women or children, and victims of trafficking. The SAFE Act aims to enhance immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, making unlawful presence a criminal offense, and broadening grounds for removability. It includes provisions for felony penalties for illegal border crossing, with exceptions for minors, asylum applicants, battered women or children, and victims of trafficking. The bill also deems unlawful entry as a continuing offense until the alien is discovered by federal authorities, increasing criminal penalties in certain situations. The bill aims to enhance immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, including provisions for felony penalties for illegal border crossing and modifying penalty enhancements for aliens convicted of certain offenses. The bill aims to enhance immigration enforcement by expanding criminal statutes, including provisions for felony penalties for illegal border crossing and modifying penalty enhancements for aliens convicted of certain offenses. It would eliminate a provision in INA Section 276 allowing aliens charged with unlawful reentry to challenge the validity of the removal order. This may conflict with the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, which requires permitting collateral challenges to deportation proceedings used in criminal offenses. Given the large number of unauthorized aliens in the US, many may be committing immigration-related document fraud, especially those who are employed. The SAFE Act aims to address immigration-related document fraud by modifying criminal sanctions for identity theft. It includes amendments to federal statutes on fraud involving identification documents and aggravated identity theft, increasing penalties and lowering mental culpability requirements for certain offenses. Attempts or conspiracies to commit offenses are punishable to the same degree as completed offenses under the bill. The SAFE Act includes amendments to federal statutes on fraud involving identification documents and aggravated identity theft, increasing penalties and lowering mental culpability requirements for certain offenses. It also makes it a crime to defraud any person on matters authorized by immigration laws, with specific penalties for fraud committed by education institutions participating in the SEVP program. Additionally, the bill allows for the seizure and forfeiture of property related to violations of the U.S. Criminal Code. Section 314 of the SAFE Act would rewrite and reorganize INA Section 274, covering additional extraterritorial conduct assisting aliens entering the US unlawfully. It grants federal courts jurisdiction over proscribed conduct, expands property subject to forfeiture, and imposes heightened penalties for smuggling offenses. The bill eliminates criminal penalties for hiring 10 or more smuggled aliens and modifies language concerning authority to make arrests for violations of alien smuggling and harboring statutes. Section 314 of the SAFE Act revises INA Section 274, limiting the authority to arrest individuals for violations to designated DHS officers or officers responsible for enforcing federal criminal laws. This may restrict state and local police from making arrests for violations of INA Section 274. The SAFE Act amends Section 274 to limit arrest authority to designated DHS officers, potentially restricting state and local police. It also imposes additional penalties for using firearms in certain violations and broadens gun possession restrictions for non-lawful permanent resident aliens. A 10-year statute of limitations is proposed for federal crimes related to immigration offenses. Section 313 of the bill would amend the federal money laundering statute to cover offenses related to alien smuggling, harboring, and trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor. Section 323 would expand criminal penalties for aliens failing to comply with removal orders to include those described in grounds for deportation or inadmissibility. This aims to address criminal activity and threats to U.S. security. The curr_chunk discusses how criminal activity and involvement in conduct threatening U.S. security can prevent aliens from entering or staying in the country, obtaining relief from removal, or qualifying for immigration benefits. The proposed SAFE Act would broaden the definition of \"aggravated felony\" and expand grounds for removability, limiting relief for criminal or terrorist aliens. The proposed SAFE Act aims to broaden the definition of \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes, adding more crimes to the list and expanding grounds for removability. This includes offenses like manslaughter and sexual crimes involving minors. The SAFE Act aims to broaden the definition of \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes, adding more crimes to the list and expanding grounds for removability, including offenses like manslaughter and sexual crimes involving minors. Additionally, the Act would make a second conviction for driving while intoxicated an aggravated felony, regardless of whether it was a misdemeanor or felony under state law. Offenses under INA Section 275 or 276 would also be considered aggravated felonies if the length of imprisonment is at least a year. The proposed changes in the bill would expand the definition of \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes to include soliciting, aiding, abetting, counseling, commanding, inducing, or procuring of listed offenses. It would also retroactively apply to conduct and convictions occurring before, on, or after the bill's enactment. The SAFE Act expands the grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, particularly related to criminal activity, applying to conduct and convictions before, on, or after the bill's enactment. Subsequent drunk driving convictions would only be considered aggravated felonies if they occurred after the bill's enactment. Some aliens may be disqualified from admission or removable, with certain grounds subject to waiver and others not. The bill aims to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, focusing on criminal activities. It includes making aggravated felony convictions a basis for inadmissibility, covering crimes like domestic violence and firearms offenses. The changes apply to conduct before or after the bill's enactment and to removal proceedings. The bill aims to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, focusing on criminal activities such as espionage and gang membership. It includes new provisions for mandatory detention and limits on relief from removal for individuals involved in criminal street gangs. The SAFE Act aims to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportability, focusing on criminal activities and entities engaging in enumerated offenses. It includes provisions to bar U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents convicted of sex-related offenses from sponsoring aliens for admission. The bill aims to re-state grounds of inadmissibility for aliens previously removed, deterring them from remaining in the US unlawfully. It also allows immigration authorities to consider extrinsic evidence in cases where a conviction record does not clearly establish if the underlying conduct was a \"crime of violence.\" The bill allows immigration authorities to consider extrinsic evidence to determine if an alien's conviction was for a crime of violence or moral turpitude, making them removable. These modifications apply to acts or convictions before or after the bill's enactment. Title III of the SAFE Act would modify immigration consequences for criminal aliens, allowing waivers for new inadmissibility grounds but barring them for aggravated felons. It would also prevent refugees or asylees who committed aggravated felonies from adjusting their status under INA Section 209. The bill would make aggravated felons ineligible for waivers under INA Section 209(c) for adjusting their status. It would also bar alien gang members from receiving asylum or withholding of removal, as well as temporary protected status. Aliens engaged in activities threatening U.S. security, including terrorism, are generally inadmissible and subject to removal. The SAFE Act aims to expand the categories of aliens ineligible for certain immigration benefits related to terrorism. It includes provisions for limited waivers under specified conditions. The SAFE Act aims to expand categories of aliens ineligible for immigration benefits related to terrorism. The bill would make modifications to eligibility for withholding of removal and cancellation of removal for aliens deemed a security threat. It also restricts aliens described in security-related grounds from receiving relief or voluntary departure. The SAFE Act aims to expand categories of aliens ineligible for immigration benefits related to terrorism by establishing that aliens engaged in security-related conduct are ineligible for relief, even if not charged or found removable on those grounds. It also amends INA Section 249 to prevent aliens described in criminal- and security-related grounds from adjusting their status. The bill includes provisions for the consideration of petitions and applications under the INA. The USCIS requires applicants for immigration benefits to undergo criminal and national security background checks, including submitting fingerprints. In 2007, delays in FBI name checks were identified as a problem for USCIS. To address this, USCIS negotiated with the FBI to expedite the process and issued guidance in 2008 to approve benefits if name checks were pending for over 180 days. Section 206 aims to reverse this guidance by generally prohibiting the granting of certain immigration benefits and privileges. Section 206 aims to halt the granting or adjudication of immigration benefits and privileges until background or security checks are completed to the satisfaction of the Secretary of DHS. It also allows immigration authorities to withhold benefits if fraudulent activity is suspected, pending investigation and resolution. Additionally, a new provision in the INA clarifies that federal law does not mandate the granting of any immigration application, petition, status, benefit, or relief to individuals identified under terrorism- and security-related grounds. Section 205 allows immigration authorities to deny or withhold adjudication of requests for benefits, status, or privileges under immigration law for individuals under terrorism- and security-related grounds or with open criminal proceedings. No court can review these denials. The Secretary of DHS can disclose information submitted by applicants for adjustment of status under IRCA. The proposed amendment would allow the Secretary of DHS to disclose information submitted by special agricultural workers and other applicants for legalization for national security purposes. It would also clarify that an alien's adjustment to LPR status constitutes \"admission\" in the United States, codifying BIA decisions and overturning certain federal court rulings. The SAFE Act includes provisions to facilitate the removal of criminal aliens. The SAFE Act includes provisions to facilitate the removal of criminal aliens and clarify immigration officials' authority to detain aliens during removal proceedings or after a final order of removal. Immigration officials detain arriving aliens, certain other aliens not admitted or paroled into the US, those inadmissible or deportable on criminal or security grounds, terrorists, and aliens endangering US security. They prioritize detaining aliens posing a danger to national security, recent illegal entrants, fugitives, or those obstructing immigration controls. Section 310 of the SAFE Act proposes changes in detention policies. Section 310 of the SAFE Act aims to clarify and enhance immigration authorities' ability to detain aliens identified for removal until their removal can be carried out. The proposed changes seek to ensure that certain categories of aliens, especially those involved in criminal activity or deemed a threat to the community, remain detained throughout the removal process. These amendments are intended to address and override court decisions that have interpreted existing detention authorities narrowly. Several courts have interpreted provisions of the INA requiring the mandatory detention of certain categories of aliens as having implicit temporal limitations to avoid definitively resolving constitutional questions. INA Section 241 generally provides that an alien subject to an administratively final order of removal shall be removed from the country. The INA Section 241 mandates the removal of aliens with a final removal order within 90 days, with detention until removal. However, certain aliens can be detained beyond 90 days under INA Section 241. In Zadvydas v. Davis, the Supreme Court limited detention to what is \"reasonably necessary\" for removal, setting a presumptive limit of six months. The Court suggested that continued detention beyond the six-month period may be warranted for especially dangerous individuals or in cases of terrorism. The SAFE Act would amend INA Section 241 to start the 90-day removal period once an alien is in DHS custody and allow for discretionary extension of detention. Aliens subject to mandatory detention during removal proceedings would be required to remain in custody. The SAFE Act would authorize extended detention of aliens ordered removed beyond the 90-day removal period, with discretionary authority given to the Secretary of DHS. Aliens detained beyond this period would not have the right to seek release on bond, but the Secretary would be required to provide habeas review in federal court. The SAFE Act authorizes extended detention of aliens ordered removed beyond the 90-day period, with discretionary authority given to the Secretary of DHS. Aliens detained beyond this period would not have the right to seek release on bond. The Secretary would establish an administrative review process to determine continued detention or release on conditions for aliens not subject to mandatory detention, with the option to detain certain categories of aliens believed to pose a security threat. The bill proposes regulations similar to existing DHS rules post-Zadvydas decision, allowing extended detention of aliens ordered removed under special circumstances. It grants the Secretary discretionary authority to re-detain aliens released if removal is imminent, conditions are violated, or certification requirements are met. Amendments to INA Section 241 are included. The provisions in the bill would amend INA Section 241 to reflect the Secretary of DHS's responsibility for detaining aliens ordered removed, limit review of decisions by other agencies, and address supervised release of aliens who cannot be removed within 90 days. The SAFE Act's Section 310 also covers detention of aliens during removal proceedings under INA Section 236, where detention is required for aliens inadmissible or deportable on certain grounds. The Demore v. Kim ruling upheld the constitutionality of mandatory detention for certain aliens, including LPRs, under INA Section 236(c). The relationship between the Zadvydas and Demore rulings is debated, with some suggesting that prolonged detention prior to a final removal order may raise similar constitutional issues. Section 310 of the bill aims to amend INA Section 236 to address these concerns. Section 310 of the bill aims to amend INA Section 236 by adding language to ensure that aliens can be detained until removal proceedings are completed, without affecting their ability to be detained under INA Section 241 after proceedings. It also addresses the Secretary of DHS's obligation to detain certain criminal aliens and the scope of an immigration judge's review of custody determinations. The bill's Section 310 addresses the scope of an immigration judge's review of DHS's custody determinations under INA Section 236, focusing on detention, release on bond, or release with no bond for certain categories of aliens. It also establishes criteria for granting bond, requiring aliens to prove they are not a flight risk or a risk to others. The bill's Section 310 addresses the scope of an immigration judge's review of DHS's custody determinations under INA Section 236, focusing on detention, release on bond, or release with no bond for certain categories of aliens. It also establishes criteria for granting bond, requiring aliens to prove they are not a flight risk or a risk to others. Other provisions of the bill would make unlawfully present aliens convicted of driving under the influence subject to mandatory detention during removal, along with aliens inadmissible or deportable due to participation in a criminal street gang. Section 610 would also require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to issue a report on detainee deaths. Section 319 of the SAFE Act aims to expedite the removal of criminal aliens by giving the Secretary of DHS discretionary authority to order their removal under criminal grounds for inadmissibility. The changes include shortening the time before execution of removal orders from 14 to 7 days, with exceptions for aliens with credible fear of persecution or eligible for waivers. These changes would take effect upon the bill's enactment, excluding aliens in standard removal proceedings. Section 601 of the SAFE Act imposes limitations on judicial review of agency actions regarding voluntary departure for certain aliens. It allows immigration authorities to permit aliens to voluntarily depart the United States at their own expense before, during, or after removal proceedings. The statute generally prevents courts from hearing appeals or staying removal for denied requests for voluntary departure. Section 601 of the bill imposes restrictions on judicial review of agency actions regarding voluntary departure for certain aliens, allowing immigration authorities to grant voluntary departure before, during, or after removal proceedings. The bill also includes amendments to the voluntary departure statute, shortening departure periods and requiring aliens to post bond in all cases of voluntary departure. Additionally, it imposes terrorism-related bars on grants of voluntary departure and restricts judicial review of reinstated removal orders. Section 603 of the bill aims to impose additional restrictions on judicial review of reinstated removal orders against aliens who illegally reenter the United States. It would effectively reverse previous court decisions that allowed for review of such orders in certain cases. Section 603 of the bill aims to impose additional restrictions on judicial review of reinstated removal orders against aliens who illegally reenter the United States. It would effectively reverse previous court decisions by providing that the order is not subject to reopening \"notwithstanding section 242(a)(2)(D)\" and clarifying that reinstatement applies regardless of the date of the original removal. Foreign nationals must obtain a visa to be admitted to the United States, with the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) each having roles in visa issuances. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 opted not to assign all visa issuance responsibilities to DHS. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 did not assign all visa issuance responsibilities to DHS. The SAFE Act reflects Members' interest in visa security, including strengthening laws, increasing funding, and determining the lead agency. Title IV of the bill addresses tracking foreign students in the US. Visa issuance procedures require applicants to submit photographs, full name, age, gender, and birth details. Certain documents must be certified by government authorities depending on the visa category. All prospective LPRs and nonimmigrants must undergo physical and mental examinations. Consular officers use the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) to store and screen visa applicant data for admissibility. The CCD stores automated records of visa applications dating back to the mid-1990s, including photographs and 10-finger scans since 2007. Data collected is confidential and restricted under INA Section 222(f) for immigration and law enforcement purposes. The INA requires in-person consular interviews for most nonimmigrant visa applicants aged 14-79. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) stores visa applicant data for admissibility screening and links with other databases to flag potential issues. Section 402 of the SAFE Act would amend current law to restrict sharing information on visa revocations or entry permits. Section 403 of the legislation would narrow the Department of State's authority to waive personal interviews for visa applicants, adding national security and visa program integrity as reasons for requiring interviews. Consular officers would have the authority not to interview visa applicants deemed ineligible for the visa they are seeking. Section 405 of the legislation grants the Secretary of DHS exclusive authority over regulations and policies related to consular officers' functions in granting or refusing visas. Consular officers and the Secretary of State have discretion to revoke visas at any time, with revocation currently being a ground for removal. Visa revocations are generally not subject to judicial review, except in cases where revocation is the sole ground for removal. The SAFE Act grants the Secretary of DHS the authority to refuse or revoke visas in the interest of national security, with revocation taking immediate effect. The legislation also limits judicial review of visa decisions by the Secretary of DHS. The SAFE Act grants the Secretary of DHS the authority to refuse or revoke visas in the interest of national security, with revocation taking immediate effect. Section 405 of the bill aims to limit judicial review of visa refusals and revocations, potentially affecting the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary of DHS to assign employees to diplomatic and consular posts for specific security threat assessments related to visa applications. The Visa Security Program (VSP) was established by statutory language to adjudicate visa applications and conduct investigations. The SAFE Act aims to expand the VSP by requiring on-site reviews of visa applications at high-risk posts and assigning personnel to these posts within a year of enactment. The SAFE Act aims to expand the Visa Security Program by assigning personnel to high-risk posts within a year of enactment and authorizing $60 million in appropriations for implementation. It also calls for expedited clearance and placement of DHS personnel at overseas embassies and consular posts. Additionally, it modifies authorizations for consular services to support enhanced border security and allows a portion of fees collected by DOS for immigration visa applications to be credited to the VSP. Congress mandated the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) in 1996, which was expanded after the September 11, 2001 attacks and became operational in 2003. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was established in 2003 by ICE's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to certify schools for accepting foreign students. Concerns have been raised about some schools exploiting the system to allow foreign nationals to work illegally in the U.S. The oversight of SEVP approved schools is being questioned for preventing student visa fraud. The SAFE Act includes provisions related to SEVP accreditation requirements for schools accepting foreign students. The bill aims to change accreditation requirements for schools accepting foreign students on F visas and flight schools. It would require accrediting agencies to notify DHS about accreditation changes, implement GAO recommendations for SEVP and SEVIS, and increase penalties for visa document fraud. DHS must deploy SEVIS II within two years of enactment. The SAFE Act proposes stricter regulations for SEVP certified schools, allowing fines for non-compliance, immediate withdrawal of certification for fraud suspicions, and prohibiting certain individuals from holding positions at institutions accepting F or M foreign students. It also mandates background checks for designated school officials and access to SEVIS. The requirements for naturalization as a U.S. citizen include good moral character, attachment to U.S. principles, continuous residence, English literacy, and knowledge of U.S. history and government. Certain activities can bar an alien from demonstrating good moral character, and engaging in subversive activity may also make an alien ineligible. The INA authorizes the government to revoke U.S. citizenship for naturalized persons who acquired citizenship through fraud or willful misrepresentation of facts. The SAFE Act includes provisions to bar aliens involved in terrorism or crime-related activities from acquiring U.S. citizenship. Section 202 of the SAFE Act would disqualify aliens from possessing \"good moral character\" for certain activities or crimes. The SAFE Act includes provisions to disqualify aliens from possessing \"good moral character\" for certain activities or crimes, such as being described in security-related grounds of inadmissibility or deportability or convicted of an aggravated felony. Waivers may be granted for a single aggravated felony offense if certain conditions are met. Section 202 clarifies that the list of conduct barring good moral character is not exhaustive. Section 203 bars naturalization for aliens with security-related grounds. Section 340 permits denaturalization for illegally procured citizenship. Section 204 authorizes denaturalization for terrorism-related conduct. The bill authorizes the Attorney General to denaturalize individuals involved in terrorism or supporting terrorism, receiving military training from terrorist organizations, or activities aimed at overthrowing the U.S. government through violence or unlawful means. This provision may face legal challenges as it allows the Attorney General to denaturalize individuals without a judicial proceeding. The bill allows the Attorney General to revoke naturalization through an administrative determination, but legal challenges may arise due to the lack of judicial oversight. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of clear evidence in cases involving citizenship rights. The bill allows the Attorney General to revoke naturalization through an administrative determination, but legal challenges may arise due to the lack of judicial oversight. Section 204 permits denaturalization based on conduct committed at any time, including after obtaining U.S. citizenship, but current jurisprudence requires voluntary conduct with intent to relinquish citizenship for loss to occur. The denaturalization provision allows for revocation of citizenship if a person's conduct indicates fraud or deceit in acquiring citizenship. This provision is influenced by a past Supreme Court case, Luria v. United States, which considered establishing foreign residence shortly after naturalization as evidence of not intending to reside continuously in the U.S. The statute characterizes proscribed conduct as showing a lack of attachment to U.S. principles at the time of naturalization. The denaturalization provision allows for revocation of citizenship based on conduct indicating fraud in acquiring citizenship. The statute in question allows for rebuttable evidence of fraudulent citizenship obtained through post-naturalization conduct. The SAFE Act would make certain aliens ineligible for citizenship and modify the naturalization process more broadly. Section 203 of the proposed legislation aims to tighten the naturalization process by disallowing approval of immigrant status or naturalization applications if there are pending criminal or civil proceedings that could lead to denaturalization. It also clarifies the conditions for conditional lawful permanent residents and allows applicants to seek federal court review if their naturalization application is not decided within 180 days of completion of all requirements. Section 203 of the proposed legislation aims to amend the INA provision concerning judicial review of naturalization applications, establishing a more deferential standard of review. It would require the petitioner to show that the denial of the application was not supported by legitimate reasons and limit judicial review of administrative determinations regarding good moral character, attachment to the Constitution, and disposition to the good order of the United States. Title V of the SAFE Act aims to increase the government's capacity to remove aliens by allocating more resources for removal and authorizing a pilot program to expedite clerical tasks during the removal process. There is ongoing debate about resource allocation and prioritization of removable aliens by ICE. The bill would modify immigration officers' authority to arrest removable aliens and create an Advisory Council to advise Congress on enforcement priorities. It could expand categories of officers for enforcement activities and allow warrantless arrests in more circumstances. The Secretary of DHS currently has discretion on enforcement powers, including interrogation of suspected aliens and carrying out orders. Section 501 of the bill would require the Secretary of DHS to authorize immigration enforcement agents to make warrantless arrests for certain offenses and carry firearms under certain conditions. Section 501 of the SAFE Act would provide statutory authorization for immigration officers to make warrantless arrests of aliens in a broader range of circumstances, eliminating the requirement that the alien is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. This could lead to legal challenges as warrantless arrests are generally permitted only in limited circumstances such as exigent circumstances. The SAFE Act includes provisions for equal pay and benefits for immigration enforcement agents, hiring additional detention enforcement officers, increasing deportation officers and support staff, and providing body armor and weapons. It also mandates the establishment of an ICE Advisory Council. The bill mandates the establishment of an ICE Advisory Council within three months of enactment, comprised of seven members advising on immigration enforcement efforts, cooperation between DHS and law enforcement, resources needed, organizational improvements, and enforcement policies. The council must provide quarterly reports to Congress and the Secretary of DHS. Additionally, a pilot program in five field offices will allow for electronic processing and serving of charging documents by deportation officers and IEAs. The pilot program aims to electronically process charging documents and detainers in the field, replacing the current paperwork process. It must be initiated within six months of the bill's enactment, with a report on its effectiveness due 18 months later. The ICE Advisory Council will provide recommendations on the program in its quarterly reports. The Administration has issued guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement, focusing on enforcement priorities and humanitarian interests. Some criticize these policies as granting \"amnesty,\" especially the DACA initiative. Certain provisions of Title VI would address these initiatives. Certain provisions of Title VI in the INA respond to Obama Administration initiatives by restricting prosecutorial discretion and promoting more vigorous enforcement of federal immigration law. Section 605 requires DHS and DOJ to report annually on exercises of prosecutorial discretion and identify individual aliens who received favorable treatment. Section 608 prohibits DHS from implementing recent guidance on prosecutorial discretion, including DACA. The SAFE Act includes provisions on immigration enforcement activities along the U.S. border and federal lands within 100 miles of the U.S. land border. The bill aims to prevent restrictions on U.S. Custom and Border Protection access to federal lands within 100 miles of the U.S. border for search and rescue operations and preventing unlawful entries. It includes waiving environmental and land management laws to expedite the installation of fencing and barriers. Additionally, it establishes new requirements for a biometric entry-exit system. Section 607 of the bill mandates the establishment of a biometric entry-exit system within two years, separate from current requirements. It must include biometric features specified by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The role of states and localities in enforcing federal immigration law has been a significant topic of interest. States and localities have varied approaches to enforcing federal immigration law. Some have taken independent action to enforce federal law and penalize activities that may aid unauthorized aliens, while others have restricted activities that could assist federal immigration enforcement. Legal debates have centered around the authority of state and local police to enforce federal immigration law without explicit federal authorization. In Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that states and localities have a limited role in immigration enforcement. The Supreme Court ruled in Arizona v. United States that states and localities have a limited role in immigration enforcement. States are generally preempted from arresting or detaining aliens without specific federal authorization. However, state and local officers are not preempted from checking immigration status during stops for state and local offenses, as long as it does not unreasonably prolong detention. The SAFE Act aims to provide states and localities with statutory authorization for immigration enforcement activities, encouraging greater cooperation with federal authorities and superseding the Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona. The SAFE Act would allow states and localities to enforce immigration laws more extensively, including making it a separate state or local crime to violate federal immigration provisions. However, they would still be prohibited from imposing additional criminal or civil penalties on employers of unauthorized aliens. Section 102 of the SAFE Act would allow state and local officers to enforce immigration laws by investigating, identifying, and apprehending aliens suspected of violations, transferring them to federal custody. The Act also promotes immigration enforcement by requiring greater information-sharing among federal, state, and local authorities for immigration-related purposes. The SAFE Act promotes immigration enforcement by allowing state and local officers to enforce immigration laws and requiring greater information-sharing among federal, state, and local authorities for immigration-related purposes. It also mandates that the National Crime Information Center's \"Immigration Violators File\" contain all available information on aliens subject to removal orders, voluntary departure agreements, visa overstays, or revoked visas. States would also be granted access to federal programs and technology for immigration enforcement. The SAFE Act allows state and local officers to enforce immigration laws and mandates greater information-sharing among federal, state, and local authorities. It requires the National Crime Information Center's \"Immigration Violators File\" to contain information on aliens subject to removal orders, visa overstays, or revoked visas. States would also gain access to federal programs and technology for immigration enforcement, with Section 105 requiring states to provide DHS with information on apprehended aliens who may be removable. Concerns may arise about the potential commandeering of state and local resources, despite DHS reimbursing all reasonable costs incurred. Section 106 and Section 114 of the SAFE Act impose conditions on the use of federal funds for immigration enforcement. Jurisdictions must allow law enforcement officers to engage in immigration enforcement activities and prohibit policies that prevent inquiries into suspects' immigration status to be eligible for certain funds. Additionally, states and localities that prohibit officers from assisting federal immigration law enforcement would be ineligible for funds. The SAFE Act would amend Section 642(b) of IIRIRA to restrict states and localities from limiting assistance with immigration enforcement efforts by the federal government. It would prohibit establishing restrictions on notifying the federal government of removable aliens and complying with immigration detainer requests. The Act also aims to ensure that the federal government has adequate resources and authorities to detain apprehended aliens. Section 107 of the SAFE Act would require DHS to build or acquire more detention facilities for aliens in removal proceedings, each with enough beds to fulfill the purposes of Title I. Section 108 would mandate DHS to consider taking custody of removable aliens in state or local custody upon request, ensuring prompt transfer to federal custody within 48 hours. This provision aims to enhance federal immigration enforcement efforts. Section 108 of the SAFE Act requires DOJ and DHS to ensure that aliens arrested under Title I are held in custody pending examination for removability. It also sets criteria for detention facilities to meet U.S. Marshals Service standards. States and localities can assist in federal immigration enforcement through various avenues, including INA Section 287(g) agreements. The 287(g) agreements allow state or local officers to assist in immigration enforcement under federal supervision. The DHS has reduced reliance on this program in favor of programs like Secure Communities. The SAFE Act aims to expand cooperative arrangements with states on immigration enforcement, including the use of 287(g) agreements to identify and apprehend removable aliens. The bill requires DHS to enter 287(g) agreements when requested by state or local agencies, with only compelling reasons for denial. DHS must accommodate jurisdictions on enforcement functions and cannot substitute other programs for 287(g) agreements. Termination of agreements must have compelling reasons and follow specific procedures, with review options for states and localities. Section 111 of the bill would require DHS to continue operating a program similar to the Criminal Alien Program, identifying and removing removable aliens in correctional facilities nationwide. States receiving funding for incarcerating criminal aliens would need to assist in identifying them in prisons or jails. Additionally, states and localities would be authorized to hold criminal aliens for up to 14 days after completing their sentences. Section 113 of the bill would amend the definition of \"undocumented criminal alien\" to include unlawfully present aliens charged with offenses, allowing states to request reimbursement for incarcerating them. This would also authorize appropriations for the program for FY2014 and beyond. Section 115 of the bill requires DHS to execute all lawful writs, processes, and orders issued under the authority of the United States. It could be interpreted to mean that DHS must use detainers to acquire custody of removable aliens in state or local custody. Section 109 mandates DHS to create materials for state and local officers to enforce immigration law, without requiring immigration-related training as a prerequisite. Section 110 of the bill clarifies that state and local officers, when acting within their official duties, are immune from personal liability for investigating, arresting, and detaining aliens. This provision aims to grant immunity similar to federal law enforcement officers and potentially provide protection under the Federal Tort Claims Act for intentional torts."
