    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anticounterfeiting Act of 2004\". Congress recognizes the critical role of American innovation and government protection in driving economic growth. Copyright-based industries are a significant economic asset, contributing over 5% of the GDP and employing 4.3 million people. The proliferation of criminal counterfeiting enterprises poses a threat to the growth of these industries. The American intellectual property sector invests in sophisticated authentication features to combat counterfeiting. Counterfeiters tamper with genuine authentication features to evade industry efforts. Federal law lacks adequate remedies to address tampering activities facilitating counterfeiting crimes. Congress must enact legislation to strengthen Federal enforcement against counterfeiting of copyrighted works. To combat counterfeiting of copyrighted works, Congress should pass laws prohibiting trafficking and tampering with authentication features, while also allowing affected parties to pursue civil action.
