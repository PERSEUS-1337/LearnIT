    "content": "Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, is the primary provider of intercity passenger rail service in the US. It was created by Congress in 1970 to maintain passenger rail service and relieve private companies of the obligation. Despite being structured as a for-profit corporation, Amtrak has never made a profit. Federal assistance to Amtrak totaled $78 billion from 1971 to 2015. Amtrak employs around 20,000 people and carries approximately 31 million passengers. Amtrak operates trains on 44 routes over 21,000 miles of track, with most track owned by freight rail companies. The Northeast Corridor (NEC) is a key section owned by Amtrak, heavily used by commuter lines. Amtrak runs corridor routes under 400 miles and long-distance routes over 400 miles, some financially supported by states. Amtrak also provides commuter service under contract with states. Amtrak's expenses exceed revenues each year, with a net loss of $1.1 billion in FY2014 covered by federal grants. This funding allows Amtrak to undertake activities beyond operating its trains, such as improving infrastructure and ensuring ADA compliance at stations. Amtrak's federal funding is primarily provided within the Department of Transportation's appropriation. The Administration requests funding for Amtrak each year as part of its DOT funding request, with Congress typically dividing the grant into operating and capital grants. Funding for Amtrak was authorized through FY2013 in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. Amtrak covers two-thirds of its costs from passenger revenues, requiring federal funding to cover the rest, including capital expenses. Recent federal grants have been sufficient to cover annual losses and fund new projects. Amtrak's requests for federal funding are not likely to decrease in the future due to a backlog of capital maintenance worth billions of dollars. The lack of long-term funding has affected Amtrak's ability to maintain safe and reliable infrastructure and equipment. Amtrak has faced challenges in maintaining safe infrastructure and equipment due to funding uncertainty. Unlike highway and transit programs, Amtrak lacks a trust fund for predictable funding. Proposals to create a trust fund for Amtrak have encountered policy and practical challenges. The uncertainty of Amtrak's federal funding is due to opposition from some Members of Congress. Creating a trust fund for Amtrak faces challenges in identifying revenue sources. Using a tax on passengers alone would require a significant increase in ticket costs, likely reducing ridership. Another option is to allocate funds from the existing Highway Trust Fund, but this has faced opposition. Opposition to using the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for Amtrak funding is based on the fund's revenue source from road users and the shortfall in revenues compared to expenditures. Congress has transferred billions from the general fund to maintain the HTF's solvency, undermining the argument against providing HTF funding to Amtrak. Joseph Boardman, CEO of Amtrak, highlights these transfers as a reason to support funding for Amtrak from the HTF. Amtrak, initially structured as a contracting agency, later received trackage from the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad. The Northeast Corridor, a densely populated route, carries over 259 million passengers annually. Funding for intercity passenger rail from the Highway Trust Fund's general revenues is advocated. The Northeast Corridor (NEC) is a heavily used route by both passenger and freight trains. Amtrak faces challenges in improving service on the NEC due to its aging infrastructure and capacity constraints. The Acela, Amtrak's fastest service, reaches speeds of up to 125 mph between Washington, DC, and New York City. The Acela service on the Northeast Corridor reaches speeds of up to 125 mph between Washington, DC, and New York City, and up to 150 mph briefly between New York City and Boston. However, average speeds are around 70 mph on the Boston-New York segment and 80 mph on the New York-Washington, DC segment. Improving travel times on the NEC would be valuable, with potential annual benefits estimated at $500 million. Amtrak has a plan for improvements to the corridor. Amtrak has published a plan for improvements to the Northeast Corridor (NEC), which includes a near-term Stair-Step Plan and a longer-term Gateway Plan. The Gateway Plan involves adding new tunnels under the Hudson River, replacing the Portal Bridge, and expanding station facilities in New York City. This would allow for increased Acela operations and other services, with initial cost estimates ranging from $14 billion-$16 billion. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is leading the program. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is leading a program called NEC FUTURE to develop an improvement plan for the Northeast Corridor (NEC), with initial cost estimates ranging from $14 billion-$16 billion. The NEC passes through eight states and the District of Columbia, owned mostly by Amtrak but with sections owned by commuter rail agencies. Collaboration between various groups is necessary for improvements, leading to the creation of a Northeast Corridor Infrastructure and Operations Advisory Commission by Congress. The Corridor Infrastructure and Operations Advisory Commission, comprised of members from states along the NEC, aims to promote cooperation and planning for rail operations. They have published reports on infrastructure needs and developed a formula to allocate costs fairly among commuter rail operators on the NEC. The commission ensures no cross-subsidization between commuter, intercity, and freight rail services. The NEC Commission published a cost allocation policy in 2015 for rail service on the NEC, addressing operating costs and replacement amounts. The NEC is heavily used with 2,200 trains daily, but Amtrak's financial capacity for maintenance varies. Amtrak estimates a $5 billion capital maintenance backlog, mostly on the NEC. Amtrak has a $21 billion maintenance backlog on the NEC, with $16 billion on its main line. Acela trains face speed restrictions due to infrastructure conditions. Amtrak plans to replace several aging bridges, including the Niantic River Bridge in Connecticut. They also aim to replace the Portal Bridge in New Jersey, Susquehanna River Bridge in Maryland, and tunnels in Baltimore. Amtrak plans to construct new tunnels under the Hudson River as part of its \"Gateway Project\" to alleviate the strain on existing 140-year-old tunnels. The estimated cost is $1.26 billion and the project is expected to take 12 years to complete. Additionally, upgrades to a 24-mile section of track between New Brunswick, NJ and Morrisville, PA will increase train speeds from 135 mph to 160 mph, reducing travel time between New York City and Philadelphia by 15 to 20 minutes. The completion date for these upgrades is set for September 2017. Amtrak plans to replace the 100-year-old Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River in New Jersey and expand Penn Station in Manhattan. The estimated cost of the bridge replacement alone is nearly $1 billion. Union Station in Washington, DC, is the second-busiest station in Amtrak's system, with 100,000 daily passenger boardings or alightings. The station is operating beyond capacity, with lines of passengers obstructing movement during rush hours. Tracks and platforms are not in compliance with ADA requirements and life safety codes. Amtrak and other transportation agencies have proposed a $7 billion redevelopment plan for Union Station in Washington, DC. The plan includes four phases of construction over 20 years, focusing on reconstruction and increasing terminal capacity. Amtrak owns over 1,500 passenger cars, 400 locomotives, and 25 trainsets with an average age of 28 years. With funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Amtrak rebuilt 15 locomotives and 81 passenger cars. Amtrak has ordered 130 long-distance passenger cars and 70 electric locomotives to replace older equipment. The purchase includes a $563 million loan for the locomotives, with California and Midwest states also investing in new passenger cars. Amtrak plans to replace its Acela Express fleet with 28 high-speed trainsets and purchase 700 single-level passenger cars and 500 bi-level cars between 2016 and 2022. Congress oversight issues include high costs due to lack of scale economies and the need to establish a robust domestic manufacturing base. The purchase of 130 bi-level cars by Sumitomo aims to form an equipment pool for corridor services, promoting economies of scale in manufacturing, repair, and parts replacement. Amtrak faces challenges in equipment standardization, import competition, and equipment lease arrangements. Domestic manufacturing requirements and FRA safety standards impact the design and weight of U.S. equipment, increasing costs for Amtrak. Additionally, Amtrak does not own much of its rolling stock, instead leasing equipment from banks to claim tax benefits. Congress has authorized measures to address these issues in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. Amtrak restructured 13 capital leases under PRIIA Section 205, resulting in $152 million in savings. The Amtrak IG identified 39 more leases that could save $426 million if Congress extends the authorization. Concerns exist about the economic life of Amtrak's equipment and its lease agreements potentially hindering fleet replacement plans. Amtrak's fleet replacement plans are being hindered by the premature failure of concrete crossties, which are crucial for upgrading tracks for higher speed passenger service. Despite being designed to last longer than wood ties, Amtrak has been replacing a significant number of concrete ties due to cracking. The company replaced 95,000 ties in FY2008, 130,000 ties in FY2009, and plans to replace 170,000 ties per year from FY2011 through FY2013. Amtrak estimated in 2011 that about 1.4 million concrete ties along 500 miles of track were defective, leading to reduced train speeds to meet safety standards. A settlement agreement with Rocla Concrete Tie included annual payments of $10 million and purchase discounts for new ties. Labor costs for tie replacement were not specified, with Amtrak estimating a total cost of $370 million. Amtrak has budgeted $64 million for concrete tie replacement, with $50 million from ARRA and $14 million from its FY2009 federal grant. The labor cost of replacing ties is estimated to be $370 million. Amtrak's Office of Inspector General reported positive steps to minimize the risk of procuring defective ties. Other railroads, like MTA, have also faced issues with concrete ties. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) settled with Rocla for $6 million after suing for $92 million to replace 147,000 concrete ties with wood ties. Union Pacific Railroad found 115,000 defective concrete ties supplied by CXT on new track for higher-speed passenger service. Concerns exist in the railroad industry regarding the state of knowledge on concrete ties, which are crucial for higher-speed passenger service. The 2014 FRA study highlighted issues with concrete tie manufacturing specifications, potentially impacting design and performance. Concerns were raised about Amtrak's ability to manage construction projects, including compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Congress may need to confirm the safety of defective ties. Amtrak's initial report highlighted the need to bring all stations into compliance with ADA standards by 2010, with no specific funding allocated for improvements. Amtrak estimated responsibility for accessibility of 70%-85% of platforms, with varying levels of station usage. Amtrak faced challenges in achieving ADA compliance for its stations, with the majority of ridership concentrated in just a fraction of stations. The cost to bring all 481 stations into compliance was estimated at $1.564 billion by 2015. Congress allocated funds for ADA efforts, but the varying heights of boarding platforms and seating areas on Amtrak trains posed a significant obstacle. Freight railroads owning most station platforms further complicated accessibility efforts. The final rule on ADA compliance for intercity and commuter passenger rail stations issued by DOT in 2011 requires level-entry boarding at stations not shared with freight rail operations. Passenger railroads facing challenges due to freight rail ownership of platforms, which restricts platform height to 8 inches above the rails to prevent conflicts with freight rolling stock. This has significantly delayed Amtrak's ADA compliance plans. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 requires certain railroads to install a Positive Train Control (PTC) system by the end of 2015. PTC allows for automatic train control to prevent collisions by slowing down or stopping trains if necessary. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates the installation of Positive Train Control (PTC) systems by the end of 2015 to prevent accidents caused by excessive train speed or conflicting movements. PTC does not address accidents from trespassers or vehicles blocking tracks. Amtrak is concerned about interoperability as it operates on tracks owned by various railroads. Amtrak began installing PTC in 2000 on some tracks, aiming to complete installation by 2012 at an estimated cost of $264 million. Amtrak faces challenges in installing Positive Train Control (PTC) on tracks it does not own, as it is required to pay for the installation on freight lines where its trains operate. The freight railroads have influenced the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to reconsider the requirement for PTC on tracks carrying poisonous or toxic products, using 2015 as the base year instead of 2008. This could impact the extent of PTC installation on freight tracks. Amtrak faces challenges in installing Positive Train Control (PTC) on tracks it does not own, as it is required to pay for installation on freight lines where its trains operate. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is considering using 2015 as the base year for identifying tracks carrying poisonous or toxic products, potentially impacting PTC installation on freight tracks. H.R. 749 and S. 650 propose measures related to PTC implementation, with Amtrak reporting growing ridership across all types of trains. Amtrak's performance is not solely based on the number of passengers carried, but also on efficiency and financial results. One measure of efficiency is the passenger load factor, which currently stands at 52%, near a record high. Factors such as fleet age and network conditions impact Amtrak's performance. Amtrak's operating ratio, a key measure of financial performance, has remained fairly constant over the past two decades. However, it is currently at its highest level in that period. On-time performance is crucial for Amtrak's profitability as it affects ridership and operating costs. Acela service and shorter routes have a 10-minute on-time standard, while longer routes vary. Amtrak's on-time performance varies based on distance, with a 30-minute allowance for trips over 550 miles. Outside of the NEC, delays are often caused by sharing tracks with freight trains, which are controlled by the host freight railroad. Interference from freight trains was the main cause of delays in FY2012. Interference from freight trains, signal problems, and other passenger trains were leading causes of Amtrak delays. Conductors' recordings may not accurately reflect root causes of delay, leading to inaccuracies in data. Rail shipments of oil from the Bakken formation have caused frequent delays in the upper Midwest. Construction to add additional trackage in response to increased rail traffic in the upper Midwest has caused delays in train movements. Amtrak faces challenges operating on single-track routes with sidings, where a single late train can disrupt multiple trains. Amtrak's faster trains require more clearance, complicating operations on heavily used freight corridors. Congress granted Amtrak \"preference\" over freight trains in 1973, but enforcement of this preference is a point of contention between Amtrak and freight railroads. The Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 requires Amtrak to pay host railroads for track usage, but not for overhead costs. Amtrak provides incentive payments for on-time trains, but some freight railroads find them insufficient. Three of the four host freight railroads visited find incentive payments insufficient to influence Amtrak train dispatch. Amtrak pays an average of $100 million annually to freight railroads for track usage and on-time incentives, which is a small percentage of their annual revenues and capital expenditures. Congress gave the Surface Transportation Board the power to investigate Amtrak's failure to meet on-time performance standards. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) can investigate Amtrak's on-time performance standards based on an initiative or complaint from Amtrak, another rail operator, or a host freight railroad. The STB may award damages and order relief if a host freight railroad fails to give preference to Amtrak trains. The constitutionality of this statute was challenged by freight railroads, arguing that Amtrak, as a private corporation, cannot set performance standards. The Supreme Court ruled that Amtrak is a government entity for this purpose and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further review. Amtrak filed a complaint against Canadian National Railroad (CN) in 2012 for not complying with the PRIIA on-time performance provision. The complaint against Canadian National Railroad (CN) is for failing to comply with metrics and standards on routes serving Chicago. The key issue is whether passenger trains can share busy freight tracks without impacting freight railroads' efforts to divert traffic from highways. Amtrak's complaint is over the same routes where the concept of \"scheduled\" freight originated. CN cites Amtrak's erratic trains missing time slots due to fuel and locomotive issues. Amtrak and CN are in conflict over delays on CN tracks, with Amtrak accusing CN of causing significant delays to its passenger trains. Amtrak has filed complaints against other freight railroads as well for similar issues. The extent of infrastructure improvements needed to resolve the conflict between freight and passenger trains is unclear. The investigation by the DOT IG from 2002-2007 found that Amtrak delays were mainly caused by host freight railroads' practices and slow orders on their tracks, rather than capacity utilization. Modifying dispatching practices and improving track maintenance could improve Amtrak's on-time performance. Tension between freight and passenger use of tracks may intensify as states increase passenger train speeds. Freight railroads have an economic incentive to build infrastructure for faster trains to capture lucrative cargo like parcel, refrigerated, and short-haul intermodal shipments. They are trying to regain refrigerated cargo lost to trucks and tap into untapped markets, especially in the eastern United States. This potential increase in track capacity could also benefit Amtrak, which has been providing food and beverage services since 1971. Amtrak is required by law to ensure that revenues from food and beverage services cover the costs, but the definition of costs is not clearly defined. Amtrak believes that excluding labor costs makes the service break even, but including labor costs results in a significant deficit. Amtrak operates food and beverage service at a significant deficit. Measures have been taken to reduce costs, including contracting out activities. Legislation requires Amtrak to develop a plan to eliminate losses and prohibits federal funds from covering losses in the future. Amtrak provides intercity passenger rail service in 19 states under contract. The number of state-supported services has increased over time, with Amtrak developing a standard methodology for determining and allocating operating and capital costs in consultation with the DOT and state governors. The methodology, approved by most governors, allocates costs directly to specific routes and as a percentage of direct route costs for overhead expenses. The STB ruled in 2012 that the methodology complies with PRIIA requirements. Amtrak has developed a standard methodology for allocating operating and capital costs for state-supported services. The methodology allocates costs directly to specific routes and as a percentage of direct route costs for overhead expenses. This new cost methodology may result in additional revenue for Amtrak from states. Amtrak is considered a privatized rail provider, receiving grants from federal and state governments. In the 112th Congress, discussions were held on the privatization of intercity passenger rail service. The British companies receive government funding to operate train routes, while in the U.S., privatizing intercity passenger rail involves Amtrak contracting out activities or private operators competing with Amtrak. However, the U.S. rail network is mostly owned by private freight companies, which control track access. Freight railroads are obligated to carry Amtrak trains but are hesitant to allow other passenger rail providers on their tracks. Private railroads in the U.S. are looking to operate intercity passenger rail services over their own lines, with some proposing new high-speed rail lines. One major challenge is the significant upfront cost of building infrastructure before generating revenue. Florida East Coast Industries plans to run a passenger service between Miami and Orlando, utilizing existing right-of-way and constructing additional track for a station at the Orlando Airport. The All Aboard Florida project, estimated to cost $1 billion, will offer high-speed rail service between Miami and Orlando, with trains reaching speeds of up to 125 mph. The project includes a passenger terminal in downtown Miami and a mixed-use development. Construction is set to begin in 2015, with funding sought through an FRA Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan. Another project by Central Japan Railway Company aims to provide 200 mph passenger rail service between Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, with an estimated cost of $8-12 billion and a target completion date of 2021. XpressWest proposes to build a high-speed rail line from Victorville, CA to Las Vegas at a cost of $8 billion-$12 billion, with a target completion date of 2021. The project group may seek a federal loan and is cooperating with government planning efforts. Previous attempts to develop a high-speed rail line in the region without federal funding were unsuccessful. Trains are proposed to run nonstop at 150 mph, transporting tourists from southern California to Las Vegas. XpressWest is developing a high-speed rail line from Victorville, CA to Las Vegas with private funding commitments of $1.5 billion. They applied for a $5.5 billion loan from the RRIF loan program, which was halted in 2013 due to failure to meet Buy America requirements. Amtrak has eminent domain power over freight railroad facilities, allowing them to use freight track at incremental cost. Amtrak has eminent domain power over freight railroad facilities, allowing them to use freight track at incremental cost. Amtrak can appeal to the STB to enforce terms that give them exclusive access to favorable track conditions, making it difficult for other rail operators to compete directly. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 authorizes funding for passenger rail programs, including $5.8 billion for Amtrak and $1.2 billion for state grants over four years. Proposed changes include restructuring DOT's Amtrak accounts into an NEC account and a national network account. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 proposes restructuring DOT's Amtrak accounts into an NEC account and a national network account to end cross-subsidization. It also includes creating a grant program for states on the NEC, streamlining environmental reviews for rail projects, and setting aside 40% of RRIF funding for NEC projects. Additionally, federal funding for Amtrak's food and beverage service will be prohibited to cover operating losses in the future. Amtrak will be prohibited from using federal funding to cover operating losses from its food and beverage service in the future. Additionally, Amtrak is directed to develop a pilot program for carrying cats and dogs."
