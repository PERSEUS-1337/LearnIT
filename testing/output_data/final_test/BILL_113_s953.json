It also includes modifications to required distribution rules for pension plans. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires that if an employee dies before their interest is fully distributed, the entire interest must be distributed within 5 years, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amendment states that if an employee's interest is payable to an eligible designated beneficiary, the distribution must occur over the beneficiary's life expectancy starting within a year of the employee's death. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 amendment requires distributions to an eligible designated beneficiary to start within a year of the employee's death, unless specified otherwise by the Secretary's regulations. If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse, the distribution start date may differ. The distribution start date for an eligible designated beneficiary must not be earlier than when the employee would have turned 70 1/2. If the surviving spouse dies before receiving distributions, the spouse is treated as the employee. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before their interest is fully distributed, certain rules apply to the remaining beneficiaries. The definition of an eligible designated beneficiary under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is any individual designated as a beneficiary by the employee. This individual must receive their portion within 5 years after their death.

An individual meeting specific requirements, including being a surviving spouse, minor child, disabled individual, or chronically ill person, or an individual not more than 10 years younger than the employee, is subject to special rules. An individual meeting specific requirements, such as being a surviving spouse, minor child, disabled individual, or chronically ill person, will cease to be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority. The distribution of any remaining portion of an employee's interest must occur within 5 years after reaching majority. Additionally, if an employee becomes a 5-percent owner after age 70 1/2, special rules apply. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions for employees who die after December 31, 2013. For employees becoming a 5-percent owner after age 70 1/2, special rules apply.

The amendments made by subsection (c) apply to designated beneficiaries of employees who die before January 1, 2014. Existing annuity contracts in effect before the enactment of this Act are exempt from these amendments.
