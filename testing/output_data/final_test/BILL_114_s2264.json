The amendment allows a $1,000 credit for qualifying children aged 6 and older, and three times that amount for children under 6.

The credit is reduced by $150 for each $1,000 by which the taxpayer's income exceeds the threshold amount. The credit allowable under subsection (a)(1) is reduced by $50 for each $1,000 by which the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the threshold amount. The credit allowable under subsection (a)(2) is reduced to zero. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as adjusted gross income increased by any amount excluded from gross income under section 911, 931, or 933. Additionally, the refundable portion of the credit is increased to 45 percent of the taxpayer's earned income. The credit allowable under subsection (a)(2) is reduced to zero.
