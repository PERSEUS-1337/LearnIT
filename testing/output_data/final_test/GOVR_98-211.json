    "content": "During budget discussions in the final days of the 105th Congress, negotiators added $880 million for Foreign Operations spending in FY1999. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations, 1999, included a total of $31.63 billion for Foreign Operations, with $12.827 billion for regular programs and additional funds for various emergency supplemental spending. Total Foreign Operations money approved for FY1999 is $618 million more than FY1998, but $385 million less than the President requested. The additional Foreign Operations resources in H.R. 4328 are allocated for various purposes including former Soviet aid, USAID operating expenses, disaster relief, the Peace Corps, and U.S. contributions to the Global Environment Facility. Congressional negotiators resolved disagreements on international family planning aid and the U.S. payment to the International Monetary Fund. The bill includes conditions for IMF funding and delays funding for the program to curb North Korea's nuclear weapons production. The legislation in H.R. 4328 allocates $35 million for additional certification requirements, delaying the money's availability until next year. It also begins aid reductions for Israel and Egypt. The annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill is crucial for reviewing and voting on the U.S. foreign assistance budget, funding bilateral development assistance programs, and managing aid in the former Soviet Union. Activities in the former Soviet Union and Central/Eastern Europe are jointly managed by USAID and the State Department. Security assistance for Israel and Egypt, as well as smaller aid programs, are part of the Foreign Operations spending measure. U.S. contributions to the World Bank and other development banks, payments to international organizations, and funding for export promotion agencies are also included in the legislation. Congressional oversight plays a role in U.S. foreign aid policy making. The Foreign Operations bill has gained significance in U.S. foreign aid policy making. Congress has not passed a foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leading to expanded scope in Foreign Operations spending measures. This legislation has been crucial in shaping foreign aid and policy initiatives, allowing the U.S. to modify aid policy and resource allocation priorities post-Cold War. Congress uses this bill to impose restrictions and conditions on foreign assistance management by the Administration. President Clinton submitted his FY1999 Federal budget request to Congress on February 2, 1998, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations Appropriations programs. House and Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittees held hearings with key officials, leading to the approval of a draft bill by the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee in July 1998. This process paved the way for initial action on spending bills. The House and Senate passed bills (H.R. 4569 and S. 2334) related to Foreign Operations Appropriations in 1998. These bills were later incorporated into the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations, 1999. The focus was on adjusting foreign aid spending while maintaining effective foreign policy in a post-Cold War environment. Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY1993 to FY1999 were discussed, with FY1998 and FY1999 amounts excluding arrears payments to multilateral development banks. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and other laws exempted appropriations for arrears, the IMF, and emergency funds from the Foreign Operations budget. Appropriations peaked at $20.7 billion in FY1985 before decreasing. Foreign Operations appropriations peaked at $20.7 billion in FY1985 but declined to about $12.3 billion in FY1997. In FY1996, Congress cut funding by $1.15 billion, impacting U.S. foreign policy interests. Despite smaller decreases in FY1997, the State Department and other agencies campaigned for a $1 billion increase in FY1998, which was mostly approved by Congress, setting appropriations at $13.15 billion. In FY1998, a $1 billion increase was recommended for Foreign Operations appropriations, totaling $13.15 billion. This represents 0.78% of the federal budget and 2.4% of total discretionary budget authority. Over the past 20 years, Foreign Operations spending has shown three distinct trends in real terms, with a peak in funding in FY1985 at $31.9 billion. During the second phase of Foreign Operations budget trends, appropriations remained stable at around $19.5 billion per year in real terms. Foreign aid spending decreased steadily from $16.7 billion in FY1992 to $13 billion in FY1997, the smallest level since 1975. FY1998 Foreign Operations spending is about 30% below the late 1980s average, 19% less than FY1992, and 10% less than FY1995. The FY1999 foreign aid budget proposal requested a $13.6 billion increase, 6.2% higher than FY1998. Unlike the previous year, the funds were spread across various programs, with modest increases enacted for major components. The FY1999 appropriations for Foreign Operations saw only modest increases from FY1998, resulting in few changes in fund distribution. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees issued low allocations for Foreign Operations in mid-May, before final budget resolution. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees issued low allocations for Foreign Operations in FY1999. The Senate provided $12.6 billion in budget authority, slightly lower than the President's request and the previous year. The House set Foreign Operations budget authority at $12.5 billion, $100 million less than the Senate. The House Foreign Operations Subcommittee recommended a $12.471 billion funding measure, $315 million below existing levels for FY1998. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated lower funding for Foreign Operations in FY1999. The House passed a $12.471 billion funding measure, $315 million below FY1998 levels. The Senate approved $12.575 billion, slightly higher than the House. The Senate also included funds for IMF contributions, bringing their total to $30.7 billion. No formal conference was held, and foreign aid funding was incorporated into H.R. 4328, the Omnibus bill. During budget discussions in the 105th Congress, negotiators added over $880 million for Foreign Operations spending in FY1999 to H.R. 4328. The total Foreign Operations funds approved for FY1999 in H.R. 4328 amount to $31.63 billion, including allocations for regular programs, MDB arrears payments, Child Survival, former Soviet aid, counter-narcotics, African embassy bombing-related \"emergency\" supplemental spending, and the IMF. This is $618 million more than FY1998, excluding the IMF. The approved Foreign Operations funds for FY1999 in H.R. 4328 amount to $31.63 billion, which is $618 million more than FY1998, but $385 million less than what the President requested. Congress was selective in adding resources above FY1998 levels. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 exempts MDB arrears payments and the IMF from budget allocations for Foreign Operations programs in FY1999. The Foreign Operations bill, H.R. 4328, includes $399 million in emergency supplemental funds for various purposes not listed in the table. The bill also secures funding for the IMF's New Arrangements to Borrow and quota increase, seen as crucial for addressing global economic crises. Critics question the IMF's ability to handle current economic challenges and its policy effectiveness. The Administration disagreed with congressional concerns about IMF policies but agreed on some points. The Senate fully funded the President's $17.9 billion request with acceptable conditions. The House only provided funding for the NAB, while H.R. 4328 included full funding for both the NAB and the quota increase. The $17.9 billion funding for the NAB and quota increase is conditioned on IMF policy changes. The President proposed a $146 million increase in export assistance, mainly for Export-Import Bank loans. The House provided $635 million for export promotion agencies, meeting half of the proposed increase. The Omnibus spending bill allocates $657 million for the Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and Trade and Development Agency, a 17% increase from FY1998. USAID's bilateral development aid would have grown by $45 million in FY1999, with cuts in child survival programs to fund initiatives in population assistance, environment projects, and aid to countries in crisis. The House reduced USAID development aid by $48 million, while S. 2334 provided slightly more than the full $1.77 billion Administration request. Senate earmarked $435 million for population assistance, while the House limited spending to $385 million. Senate cut funds for the African Development Foundation to $8 million, well below the existing level, and House requested amounts. H.R. 4569 sharply cut disaster relief assistance to $150 million, while S. 2334 provided $200 million. H.R. 4328 funds USAID development aid programs at $1.79 billion, $65 million more than FY1998. The House reduced USAID development aid by $48 million, while S. 2334 provided slightly more than the full $1.77 billion Administration request. Senate earmarked $435 million for population assistance, while the House limited spending to $385 million. Congress made small cuts to the Inter-American Foundation and the African Development Foundation. The President proposed about $400 million for population assistance and $25 million for UNFPA. Family planning restrictions and the UN Population Fund were also discussed. The House reduced USAID development aid by $48 million, while S. 2334 provided slightly more than the full $1.77 billion Administration request. Congress made small cuts to the Inter-American Foundation and the African Development Foundation. The President proposed about $400 million for population assistance and $25 million for UNFPA. Amendment by Representative Wicker inserted revised \"Mexico City\" abortion restrictions and added a ban on U.S. contributions to UNFPA unless UNFPA terminated programs in China or the President certified that China no longer engaged in coercive family planning practices. H.R. 4569 further capped population aid at $385 million. S. 2334 earmarked $435 million for population assistance without Mexico City abortion restrictions or limitations on contributions to UNFPA. The Omnibus Appropriation placed a $385 million cap on population assistance but deleted the House-passed abortion restrictions and denied all funding for UNFPA due to the organization's new China program. Funds for reducing debt owed to the U.S. government were also discussed. Debt reduction funds for developing countries nearly tripled in FY1999 under the President's budget to support debt forgiveness initiatives for African countries and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. The House and Senate made reductions to the proposed appropriation, while the Omnibus Appropriation included $33 million. Peace Corps funding increased to $270 million for a two-year effort to raise volunteer numbers. The Omnibus Appropriations bill reduced Peace Corps funding to $240 million, hindering its expansion to reach 10,000 volunteers by 2000. Additionally, funding for international narcotics and law enforcement programs increased to $275 million, with a focus on Latin America, particularly Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. The bill also included $261 million to fully fund programs in these countries, along with an extra $232.6 million. The Omnibus bill includes $232.6 million for counter-narcotics activities in Andean drug producing countries like Colombia. Funding for Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, and Demining programs would increase to $216 million in FY1999, with demining aid growing from $20 million to $50 million. The FY1999 NADR account included $21 million for science centers in Russia and Ukraine to prevent brain drain of scientists with skills in weapons systems. Congress allocated $198 million for NADR programs, including $35 million for demining and $35 million for KEDO. The FY1999 NADR account programs included targets of $35 million for demining, $35 million to KEDO, and $15 million for non-proliferation activities. Congress also approved $20 million for State Department anti-terrorism programs. Additionally, there was $502 million allocated for multilateral development bank arrearage payments as part of a 3-year plan to clear U.S. arrears. The Administration accelerated the appropriation schedule, and Congress provided budget exemptions to prevent funding squeeze for other foreign policy programs. The President projected $367 million for FY1999 and $863 million total over 3 years for multilateral development bank arrearage payments. The House and Senate-passed Foreign Operations bills made sharp cuts in the arrears request, providing $352 million and $311 million, respectively. The enacted Omnibus Appropriations included $539 million for MDB arrears, exceeding the President's request. H.R. 4328 includes full funding for the Global Environment Facility and the African Development Fund. Funding for Countries and Regions in the FY1999 proposal recommended continuity and change. The FY1999 proposal recommended continuity and change in U.S. aid recipients, with a focus on Middle East peace, democratic transition in the former Soviet Union, and countering the drug trade in Latin America. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan would receive similar levels of aid, while assistance to Russia would increase significantly. Haiti's aid would double in FY1999. In FY1999, U.S. aid to Peru and Bolivia was set to increase significantly for combating drug production. Turkey and Greece would receive only nominal assistance, as the Administration considered ending military aid to them. In FY1998, the US ended military aid to Turkey and Greece, converting $35 million in loan subsidies to grant aid. Assistance to South Africa was also reduced from $73 million to $53 million. The US aid program for South Africa shifted focus to democratic institutions, health care, and education, with plans to phase out by 2005. Congress earmarks specific amounts for a few countries or regions during the Foreign Operations debate. The State Department and USAID notify Congress about fund distribution among countries and regions 60-90 days after passage of the Foreign Operations measure. Table 4 shows country allocations for FY1997 and FY1998, with estimates for FY1999 based on the President's request or congressional earmarks in H.R. 4328. The Omnibus Appropriations passed on October 21 includes earmarks and limitations affecting foreign aid fund distribution. The proposed country and regional plan for U.S. foreign aid includes leading recipients and earmarks enacted in FY1997-FY1999. Data excludes food aid, which would change the rank order of recipients. House and Senate bills suggest phasing out economic aid to Israel and reducing Egypt's aid by half over ten years. The enacted Omnibus Appropriations bill includes a new initiative to reduce economic aid to Israel and Egypt by $100 million for FY1999. Additionally, $100 million is earmarked for a new U.S. economic aid strategy for Indonesia, focusing on local organizations and community leaders. The bill also removes previous restrictions on military training for Indonesia. The omnibus bill earmarks $75 million in economic aid for Indonesia, following Senate guidelines. It allows training grants for the Indonesian military under Expanded-IMET programs focusing on civilian-military relations and human rights. The bill retains the six-year prohibition on U.S. aid for Azerbaijan, with exemptions for American businesses investing in Azerbaijan's oil activities. The omnibus bill includes $75 million in economic aid for Indonesia, with training grants for the military. It retains the prohibition on U.S. aid for Azerbaijan but exempts American businesses in oil activities. The bill addresses North Korea's actions, including missile sales to Iran and nuclear construction activities, making the $35 million request for heavy fuel oil controversial. The House Committee adopted an amendment prohibiting the request without a Presidential waiver. The Omnibus Appropriation includes $35 million for KEDO in FY1999, with the first $15 million available after March 1, 1999, and the remaining $20 million available after June 1. The President must certify progress on implementing agreements with North Korea, cooperation in fuel storage, no diversion of assistance, and efforts to block ballistic missiles. The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes restrictions on ballistic missile issues and underground construction concerns with North Korea. H.R. 4328 limits the President's waiver authority for providing funds to KEDO. There were differences in aid amounts for Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states between the House and Senate, with the final bill allocating $801 million. The Senate measure provided higher amounts for Ukraine ($210 million), Armenia ($90 million), and Georgia ($95 million) compared to the House measure. The final earmarks in H.R. 4328 were set slightly below the Senate targets. The higher overall account level and reduced Senate earmarks may allow for closer allocation of resources for Russia. Congress did not earmark assistance from other foreign aid accounts. The President requested $730 million for African assistance. The President requested $730 million for African development programs in FY1999, including $67 million for democracy initiatives and $35 million for debt reduction. USAID planned to use the increase for technical assistance in support of trade and investment plans. Additionally, a Great Lakes Initiative and Education for Development and Democracy program were expected to be implemented. The FY1999 foreign aid bills did not specify amounts for Africa, but with additional development aid funds, USAID is likely to allocate resources close to the proposed $730 million. Congressional add-ons for child survival and disease activities may require more funds to be programmed in Africa, potentially reducing trade and investment activities. The Foreign Operations appropriation bill includes policy provisions that often lead to disagreements between the President and Congress. Disagreements between the President and Congress over foreign aid authorization bills have led to conflicts in the Foreign Operations legislation. Policy provisions in the spending bill often restrict the President's ability to manage foreign policy, causing delays in enactment or potential vetoes. Key issues include conflicting priorities in development assistance and restrictions on international family aid. Since the end of the Cold War, debates have centered on the future of U.S. development aid, questioning the need for a globally focused economic aid program or a more targeted approach aligned with key foreign policy interests. Disagreements between the President and Congress over foreign aid authorization bills have led to conflicts in the Foreign Operations legislation, with key issues including conflicting priorities in development assistance and restrictions on international family aid. The Clinton Administration supports an activist foreign aid policy for various U.S. foreign policy initiatives. USAID's post-Cold War development aid policy focuses on sustainable development through economic growth, global population stabilization, environmental protection, democracy promotion, and human capacity development. USAID's sustainable development programs are detailed in Table 5. USAID's funding for various programs in FY1998 and FY1999 includes $385 million for family planning, $300 million for agriculture, and $135 million for microenterprise. The agency aims for these programs to support market economies and democratic transitions in developing countries until they can sustain themselves without external aid. However, funding reductions and shifting priorities have led to adjustments in resource allocation, raising concerns about maintaining the integrated approach. The State Department's Bureau of Global Affairs prioritizes environment programs and urges USAID to allocate maximum funding. Congress and the executive branch have disagreements on funding levels for child survival, education, and disease programs, leading to cuts in overall development aid in FYs1996-97. Despite this, funding for children and disease programs remains stable. Congress earmarked children and disease programs at amounts equal to or somewhat greater than those allocated in FY1995, making cuts on other elements of sustainable development closer to 30%. Despite boosting development aid appropriations for FY1998 by $100 million, half of the additional funds were earmarked for child survival and disease accounts. Congressional proponents argue that protecting children is a core American value, and cuts should not risk the lives of children in developing nations. They emphasize the threat of infectious diseases to U.S. citizens and the need for continued support for global efforts to combat them. USAID officials emphasize the importance of child survival and infectious disease programs, stating that efforts to protect children extend beyond immunizations and health services. They argue that factors like societal stability, environmental protection, shelter access, and economic policies also impact a child's quality of life. USAID believes that focusing resources solely on earmarked areas undermines sustainable development programs that benefit children. In FY1999, USAID proposed minor changes to resource allocation for sustainable development objectives. The recommended changes in resource allocation for sustainable development objectives drew criticism in Congress. A $42 million reduction in child survival and infectious disease programs for FY1999 was opposed, while additional family planning funds were requested. The largest increase recommended was $46 million for environmental programs, including support for global climate change activities. Some challenged the lack of increased funding for certain USAID activities, particularly agriculture programs. The House recommended increased funding for certain USAID activities, especially agriculture programs, restoring amounts for Child Survival and disease programs to FY1998 levels. They also set a higher earmark for UNICEF and recommended funding for micro-credit. However, spending levels for other development activities were nearly identical to FY1998 appropriations, resulting in potential reductions to economic growth. The Senate provided funds for development assistance slightly above the President's request in S. 2334. The bill required continued spending on infectious diseases at FY1998 levels and set basic education aid at $100 million. It also included $305 million for agriculture programs and $145 million for micro-credit, with half designated for loans under $300. The Omnibus Appropriations allocated $1.79 billion for USAID development aid programs. The Omnibus Appropriations bill allocates $1.79 billion for USAID development aid programs, including $700 million for child and disease initiatives. Children programs will receive over $100 million more than the FY1999 proposal, while a $385 million cap on population aid will limit resources for that sector. The bill does not earmark a specific amount for micro-credit but requires half of the loans to be less than $300. The President sought $400 million for USAID family planning programs in FY1999, with a focus on abortion-related activities of foreign recipients. Congress has had contentious debates over U.S. international family planning policy, leading to presidential vetoes. Spending on family planning programs increased from $250 million in the late 1980s to $548 million in FY1995. In response to Congress deadlock over abortion-related restrictions and U.S. population aid policy, interim provisions were adopted to limit funding for USAID family planning programs to $385 million in FY1997 and FY1998, down from $548 million in FY1995. Congress established a delayed timetable for fund availability, including monthly apportionments. Funding reductions and metering were connected to abortion restrictions and eligibility requirements for foreign organizations receiving funds for family planning. During the mid-1980s, the \"Mexico City\" policy restricted funds for foreign organizations involved in abortion-related activities, leading to some groups losing U.S. financial support. President Clinton reversed this policy in 1993, allowing funding for family planning organizations as long as it wasn't used for abortion-related work. Congress has since had conflicting views on the issue. The House and Senate have opposing views on the Mexico City policy regarding U.S. aid funds for foreign organizations involved in abortion-related activities. President Clinton would veto any bills with House-passed restrictions, leading to interim arrangements for FY1996-98 without resolving the population program controversy. The FY1998 temporary arrangement allowed the Foreign Operations measure to move forward by deleting Mexico City restrictions and limiting population aid funding to $385 million. The unresolved dispute over family planning and abortion has hindered funding approval for other foreign policy initiatives. In FY1998, House leaders removed Mexico City restrictions from the Foreign Operations measure, leading to a withdrawal of support for funding U.S. participation in the IMF and paying American arrears at the U.N. Congress approved modified Mexico City restrictions in early 1998 as part of an omnibus foreign policy bill, but the President vetoed it in October. In FY1998, House leaders removed Mexico City restrictions from the Foreign Operations measure, leading to a withdrawal of support for funding U.S. participation in the IMF and paying American arrears at the U.N. Congress approved modified Mexico City restrictions in early 1998 as part of an omnibus foreign policy bill, but the President vetoed it in October. The House bill capped family planning assistance at $385 million for FY1999 and continued restrictions on population aid, including prohibiting U.S. funds from paying for abortions. Representative Wicker's amendment inserted revised Mexico City abortion restrictions, prohibiting U.S. funds to foreign groups performing abortions or violating abortion laws in foreign countries. The bill allowed the President to waive the prohibition on performing abortions but not for lobbying, resulting in a reduction of family planning funds. It also banned the U.S. contribution to UNFPA due to their program in China. The Wicker amendment aimed to permanently prohibit UNFPA funding unless certain conditions were met. The House adopted an amendment defining voluntary family planning programs. The Senate took a supportive stance on the issue. The Senate, in S. 2334, allocated $435 million for population assistance, higher than the Administration's request. The legislation maintained restrictions on abortion funding but did not include Mexico City conditions or limits on UNFPA contributions. The Omnibus Appropriation capped population aid at $385 million and denied $25 million for UNFPA due to the China program. It also included a modified version of the Tiahrt amendment on the voluntary nature of U.S. family planning activities. Since the late 1970s, a significant portion of U.S. foreign aid has supported allies in the Middle East, particularly Israel and Egypt, with over $100 billion given in the past 20 years. Annual aid bills have consistently allocated $3 billion for Israel and $2.115 billion for Egypt. Despite calls for reductions in aid to these countries to fund other initiatives, the FY1999 request maintained the traditional levels of assistance. The Administration has financed additional assistance to Jordan by transferring funds from Israel and Egypt's aid packages. Congress legislated a cap on Foreign Operations resources for the Middle East to prevent selected nations and programs from receiving more than $5.4 billion of the total appropriation. The Administration and Congress have worked to allocate Foreign Operations funds for the Middle East, with a cap set at $5.4 billion to prevent certain programs from receiving more than this amount. Israel, Egypt, and Jordan received the majority of the regional total, with discussions ongoing to adjust spending levels to stay within the cap. Israel proposed reducing its aid over the next ten-to-twelve years in light of new peace initiatives in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed a plan to gradually decrease US aid over ten years, reducing economic assistance by $120 million annually while increasing military aid by $60 million. By 2009, Israel would receive $2.4 billion in military aid but no economic assistance, saving $600 million in total. Congressional reaction was generally positive, with some suggesting a shorter implementation period. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu proposed a plan to gradually decrease US aid over ten years, reducing economic assistance by $120 million annually while increasing military aid by $60 million. Congressional action followed with both H.R. 4569 and S. 2334 reducing aid to Israel and Egypt in a generally proportional manner. Israel's economic aid was cut by $120 million, while military assistance increased by $60 million. The House measure also allowed Israel to use $490 million of its military funding for procurement outside the United States. The Omnibus Appropriation, H.R. 4328, includes a reduction in aid for Israel and Egypt, with Israel allowed to spend $490 million of its military funding outside the United States. The legislation also maintains a cap on Middle East bilateral assistance at $5.4 billion, with a waiver available for national security reasons. Aid restrictions for Russia and Ukraine have been in place since the collapse of the Soviet Union. U.S. economic assistance for the transition of Russia, Ukraine, and other successor states to democracy and free market economies has been a focus of past debates. President Clinton requested $925 million for the NIS account in FY1999, with a significant portion allocated for Russia. Congressional scrutiny has been placed on the size and conditions attached to aid, including policy reforms and troop withdrawals. Despite aid restrictions, the President has been able to certify transfers of U.S. assistance. The additional funds for Russia were closely scrutinized by Congress, with a focus on policy conditions related to Russian support for Iran's nuclear program, discrimination against religious minorities, and Ukrainian practices hindering American business investments. The President must withhold 50% of assistance to Russia until certifying the termination of support for Iran's nuclear capabilities. The President could waive the provision if he determines that the assistance is \"vital\" to U.S. national security interests and Russia is taking \"meaningful steps\" to reduce nuclear support for Iran. Another limitation for U.S. assistance to the Russian government in FY1998 was a provision that required certification that Russia had not discriminated against religious groups. President Clinton issued the necessary determination on May 26. President Clinton issued a determination on May 26, stating that Russia's application of the new Russian law on Religion did not conflict with its international obligations on religious freedom. Congress attached a restriction to NIS assistance for FY1998 regarding complaints from American businesses investing in Ukraine about corruption and harassment by Ukrainian officials. Ukraine received strong congressional support and was the third-highest recipient of U.S. economic aid. However, the FY1998 Foreign Operations measure required the Secretary of State to withhold half of Ukraine's assistance until significant progress was made in resolving complaints by American investors. Secretary Albright issued a notice regarding this. Secretary Albright issued a notice on April 29 expressing concerns about the investment climate in Ukraine and unresolved investor complaints. The U.S. will withhold $25 million in assistance due to stalled economic reforms. If progress is not made, funds will be redirected to private sector programs. Congressional actions included restrictions on Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation but dropped conditions on Ukraine's assistance. The Senate incorporated restrictions on Russia and Ukraine for FY1999. S. 2334 imposed restrictions on U.S. assistance to Russia regarding nuclear and missile programs, religious persecution, and taxation. Aid to Russia was withheld until certain certifications were made, and half of the assistance to Ukraine was held back until significant economic reforms were undertaken. The Secretary of State informed Congress about Ukraine's economic reforms progress. H.R. 4328 allocated $801 million for the NIS, with an additional $46 million in emergency funds. Aid to Russia and Ukraine is conditional, with restrictions on aid to Russia unless it ends cooperation with Iran. The omnibus bill includes conditions for providing assistance to Russia and Ukraine, with restrictions on aid to Russia related to discrimination against religious groups and taxation of American aid. Aid to Ukraine is contingent on significant economic reforms and resolution of complaints by American investors. Additionally, Congress has also addressed aid to the Caucasus and the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict in the Southern Caucasus has been a focus of congressional debate, with Armenia advocating for self-determination in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan emphasizing territorial integrity. The dispute has led to thousands of casualties and created numerous refugees since 1992. Efforts to mediate the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict have been ongoing since 1992, with the OSCE's Minsk Group and Russian involvement leading to a cease-fire in 1994. Congress has shown a preference for Armenia by providing economic aid and humanitarian assistance to Nagorno-Karabakh. However, concerns over Azeri refugees and American investment in Azerbaijan's oil sector have led to a softening of aid restrictions, with a regional assistance package aimed at supporting peace efforts. In FY1998, Congress exempted democracy projects and export promotion aid from aid restrictions for Azerbaijan. The Foreign Operations spending measure included $250 million for the Southern Caucasus region, with allocations for Armenia, Georgia, and refugee assistance. Despite aid restrictions, Congress permitted humanitarian aid for Armenian and Azeri refugees and assistance for disarmament programs in Azerbaijan. In FY1998, aid restrictions continued for Azerbaijan, but Congress allowed exemptions for democracy projects and export promotion. The President was expected to meet requirements for lifting the aid ban with an interim settlement by the Minsk Group. If no agreement was reached by May 30, 1998, funds could be reallocated to other NIS states. For FY1999, the Administration sought $80 million for Armenia, $80.7 million for Georgia, and $31.5 million for Azerbaijan, with new programs focusing on the private sector and demining activities. The Administration requested Congress to repeal section 907, citing it as a hindrance for U.S. negotiators. They argued that the restrictions impede efforts to promote economic reforms and protect American investments in Caspian basin oil opportunities. Congressional action allocated funds for post-conflict reconstruction in the Southern Caucasus region, with Armenia and Georgia receiving significant amounts. The House Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment repealing the Sec. 907 aid ban on Azerbaijan, but the full House approved an amendment restoring section 907. The Senate earmarked $90 million for Armenia and $95 million for Georgia in S. 2334, expanding exemptions for certain programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged funding for an east-west oil pipeline in H.R. 4328, providing $228 million for the Southern Caucasus region. H.R. 4328 provides $228 million for the Southern Caucus region, with $40 million for international peace efforts. Aid is earmarked at $84.4 million for Georgia and $79.9 million for Armenia. Section 907 restrictions remain, but exemptions are broadened to include OPIC and the Export-Import Bank. Foreign Operations Programs are covered in various issue briefs by CRS. Foreign Operations Country/Regional Issues: CRS Issue Briefs cover Africa, the Former Soviet Union, Israel, and North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program. Various organizations such as the Export-Import Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and United Nations agencies are involved in foreign assistance programs. The U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Department of State, and World Bank are key players in foreign operations appropriations. The table shows a consistent account structure for development aid. Emergency supplemental appropriations include funding for Child Survival programs, former Soviet aid, anti-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and Africa embassy bombing-related aid.
