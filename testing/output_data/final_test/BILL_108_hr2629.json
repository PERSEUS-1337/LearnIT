    "content": "The Act titled \"New Aid for Trustworthy, Affordable Drugs Act (NAFTA Drugs Act)\" aims to harmonize drug laws for importation into NAFTA countries from other NAFTA countries. Section 803 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to harmonize regulatory requirements for drugs among NAFTA countries, allowing for the import and export of approved drugs between these countries. The United States Trade Representative will work with the Secretary and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to carry out this subsection. The harmonization agreement requires regulatory standards for drugs consistent with the Act, display of a seal on drug labeling indicating compliance, uniform standards for the seal in NAFTA countries, and approval by health authorities before display. The proposed agreement for drug importation within NAFTA countries must comply with uniform standards for seals on drug labeling, include unique tracking numbers for identification, and require approval by health authorities before implementation. The proposed agreement for drug importation within NAFTA countries includes requirements for pharmacy registration, uniform standards for seals on drug labeling, and reimbursement by drug manufacturers for research performed by the National Institutes of Health. The proposed agreement for drug importation within NAFTA countries includes requirements for pharmacy registration, uniform standards for seals on drug labeling, reimbursement for NIH research, and prohibits discrimination based on citizenship or residency. The authority to enter a harmonization agreement under NAFTA terminates one year after the enactment of the NAFTA Drugs Act. The NAFTA Drugs Act defines a \"NAFTA country\" as the United States, Canada, and Mexico while NAFTA is in force with respect to each country."
