    "content": "Federal white-collar employees under various schedules are entitled to annual pay adjustments and locality-based payments under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. In January 2010, employees received a 2.0% pay increase, with 1.5% as an annual adjustment and 0.5% as a locality payment. Some employees did not receive the full increase due to statutory limitations on pay rates. As of January 2010, GS-15 employees in certain areas are affected by the cap on basic pay and locality pay combined, with total compensation limited to EX Level I ($199,700). In January 2009, federal white-collar employees received a 3.9% pay increase, including a 2.9% annual adjustment and a 1.0% locality payment. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) has not been fully implemented as originally enacted, with reduced or missed annual and locality pay adjustments in various years from 1994 to 2010. Table 1 in the report shows the adjustments made under FEPCA during this period. Federal white-collar employees, including those under the General Schedule, receive annual pay adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The President may also adjust salaries for administrative law judges, while individuals in senior-level (SL) and scientific and professional (ST) positions may receive discretionary adjustments. Contract appeals board members' pay adjustments depend on EX pay adjustments. The ECI determines the increase in basic pay rates at 0.5 percentage points less than the ECI change in private-sector wages and salaries. The annual pay adjustments for federal white-collar employees, including those under the General Schedule, are based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI). The ECI data, which is 15 months old at the time of adjustment, determines the across-the-board pay adjustment percentage. In cases of national emergency or economic conditions, the President can issue an alternative pay plan with a different percentage increase. This plan must be submitted to Congress by September 1 before the effective date. The President issued an alternative plan for the January 2010 annual pay adjustment on August 31, 2009, preceding the scheduled effective date. GS employees are intended to receive locality-based comparability payments, which may also be extended to employees in other pay systems. The Pay Agent determines the applicable pay cap level for certain non-General Schedule employees receiving locality pay. GS special-rate employees receive either the special rate supplement or the locality payment, and law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. The President's alternative plan for the January 2010 annual pay adjustment included locality-based comparability payments for GS employees and other pay systems. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense under the National Security Personnel System receive a pay adjustment consisting of performance-based pay increase, base salary adjustment, and local market supplement equivalent to GS pay. FEPCA's locality-based comparability payments aim to equalize pay rates between federal and non-federal workers in the same locality. The President can adjust comparability payments in case of a national emergency or economic conditions affecting welfare. A report must be sent to Congress explaining the need for the adjustment. The President issued an alternative plan for the January 2010 locality pay adjustment. Pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic GS schedule by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding locality payments. The net increase in pay rates for 2010 is calculated by comparing the annual pay rates with locality payments to the 2009 pay rates. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in each locality pay area. The surveys were previously conducted under the Occupational Compensation Survey Program before October 1996 and now under the National Compensation Survey program. The Federal Salary Council recommended improvements to the NCS program for locality payments from 2000 to 2006. By 2007, 100% of NCS data was to be used. Four enhancements have been implemented, with the fifth delayed for three years. In 2009, the pay gap increased in all locality pay areas except Dayton, OH. Huntsville, AL, and Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, showed notable changes. The Huntsville, AL, and Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, locality pay areas had the largest pay gap increases in 2006 to 2007, with +12.33% and +9.72% respectively. The Federal Salary Council recommended not using data from small establishments for calculating locality payments in 2009, but to review it again the following year. The Federal Salary Council recommended in 2009 to not use data from small establishments for calculating locality payments, with a plan to review the decision the following year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys only establishments with 50 or more workers for locality pay data, which is then submitted to the Office of Personnel Management for comparison of federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area. The goal is to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. The target pay gap is adjusted annually to 5% by OPM, based on advice from the Federal Salary Council. Locality rates are determined for each pay area, with 20% of the gap closed in 1994 and an additional 10% each year thereafter as per FEPCA. FEPCA specified that amounts payable could not be less than the full amounts necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5%. Locality pay increases have been implemented at a much lower percentage than required by law, resulting in a slow reduction of the pay gap. Various percentages of the pay gap have been closed each year since 1995. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) must meet specific criteria to be included in an adjacent locality pay area, including minimum number of GS employees and employment interchange measures. Federal facilities crossing locality pay area boundaries also have requirements for inclusion. Requests for changes in locality pay area boundaries must include credentials of the requesting group, identification of the geographic area, number of GS employees by agency, explanation for addition to adjacent locality pay area, current job vacancy rates, recruitment or retention issues, and evidence of previous pay flexibilities. The President typically includes a proposal for federal civilian pay adjustment in the Budget of the United States issued in February each year. The FY2010 budget proposed a 2.0% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. Requests for changes in locality pay area boundaries must include credentials of the requesting group, number of GS employees by agency, current job vacancy rates, recruitment or retention issues, and evidence of previous pay flexibilities. The proposed 2.0% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees is considered annually by Congress, which may legislate a different adjustment. Congress has historically set overall pay adjustment amounts in various years. Congressional recommendations on pay adjustments are usually included in the appropriations bill for the general government. In the 111th Congress, this bill is called the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations (FSGG) Bill. The House version of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2010 (H.R. 3170) did not mention a pay adjustment. The Senate version (S. 1432) proposed a 2.9% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010 (H.R. 3288) ultimately provided a 2.0% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in DOD and DHS, effective from the first pay period after January 1, 2010. Executive Order 13525 implemented the pay increase as a 1.5% annual basic pay adjustment and a 0.5% adjustment. OPM published the 2010 salary tables on its website, including a 1.5% annual basic pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality pay adjustment. The authorized locality payments and net annual pay increases for January 2010 are shown in Table 2."
