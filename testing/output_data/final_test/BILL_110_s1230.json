    "content": "The \"College Saver's Credit Act of 2007\" allows for a refundable credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for college savings. The \"College Saver's Credit Act of 2007\" allows for a 50 percent tax credit on qualified college savings contributions up to $2,000 for eligible individuals. There are limitations based on modified adjusted gross income, where the credit amount is reduced accordingly. The taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year determines the excess over the applicable amount for the phaseout amount calculation. The applicable amount and phaseout amount are determined for the purpose of reducing the tax credit. The phaseout amounts for the tax credit are as follows:\n- Joint return: $60,000 applicable amount, $10,000 phaseout amount\n- Head of household: $45,000 applicable amount, $7,500 phaseout amount\n- Other cases: $30,000 applicable amount, $5,000 phaseout amount The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is defined as the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year plus any excluded amounts under specific sections. Inflation adjustments are made to applicable amounts in the table for taxable years after 2008 based on the cost-of-living adjustment for that calendar year. The earned income limitation for the tax credit is based on the taxpayer's earned income for the taxable year and rounded to the nearest multiple of $500. An eligible individual must be at least 18 years old by the end of the taxable year. Dependents are not eligible for the credit. The term 'eligible individual' does not include those who can be claimed as dependents for a tax deduction. Qualified college savings contributions are defined as contributions made to a 529 account for the taxpayer, their spouse, or any dependent for whom a deduction is allowed. The text discusses the treatment of contributions by dependents for tax deductions and qualified college savings contributions. If a deduction is allowed to another taxpayer for an individual, no credit is allowed to the individual for their taxable year, and contributions made by the individual are treated as made by the other taxpayer. Additionally, refundable amounts can be credited to qualified tuition plans. The text discusses the treatment of contributions by dependents for tax deductions and qualified college savings contributions. If a deduction is allowed to another taxpayer for an individual, no credit is allowed to the individual for their taxable year, and contributions made by the individual are treated as made by the other taxpayer. Additionally, refundable amounts can be credited to qualified tuition plans. The new subsection (l) specifies that any overpayment related to the college saver's credit will be transferred to the qualified tuition program where the taxpayer made contributions. If contributions were made to multiple programs, the overpayment will be divided among them proportionally. The text discusses qualified college savings contributions and special rules for contributions attributable to the College Saver's Credit. Contributions made by a taxpayer to a qualified tuition program are compared to contributions made to all qualified tuition programs. Additionally, any overpayment related to the College Saver's Credit will be transferred to the qualified tuition program where the taxpayer made contributions. The Saver's Credit requires separate accounting for contributions in a qualified tuition program. Distributions including transferred amounts will incur a 100% tax increase. Ordering rules apply to distributions from qualified tuition programs. The program outlines distribution rules for qualified tuition programs, with exceptions for distributions for qualified higher education expenses. Contributions and transfers are prioritized in the distribution process. The College Saver's Credit Act of 2007 amends section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The College Saver's Credit Act of 2007 includes provisions for a college saver's credit and overpayments of tax. The amendments made by this act apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007. Additionally, the act involves the distribution of financial education materials to individuals investing in qualified tuition programs. The amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 require qualified tuition programs to distribute financial education materials to participants. Guidance on the types of materials required must be provided, and the effective date for these changes is 1 year after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a study on participation in qualified tuition programs is mandated. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on individuals participating in qualified tuition programs under section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The study will analyze the income, age, and fees charged in these programs. A report on the study must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment."
