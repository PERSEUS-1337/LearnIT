The number of these temporary representatives varied with each Administration's governing style and issues at the time. As the US became more involved in world affairs, special appointments increased, especially in the 20th and 21st centuries. The authority of the President and Secretary of State to make temporary appointments has been a topic of Congressional concern in the 115th Congress. Critics of special diplomatic appointments in previous Administrations, including Clinton, Bush, and Obama, argue that these positions may circumvent Senate approval, create tension over funding, confuse foreign officials, and make it harder to identify the correct point person. On August 28, 2017, Secretary Tillerson announced plans to address special envoy positions at the Department of State. Out of 66 positions, 30 will be retained, 21 integrated into bureaus, 9 eliminated, and 5 folded into existing roles. Critics argue special appointments may bypass Senate approval and create confusion, while proponents see them as a flexible tool to focus attention on specific issues. Secretary Tillerson announced plans to address special envoy positions at the State Department. Out of 66 positions, 9 will be eliminated, 5 folded into existing roles, and 1 transferred to USAID. Tillerson aims to empower regional and functional bureaus, improve efficiency, and achieve foreign policy goals. Various policy options were proposed for each special envoy position. The 115th Congress is concerned about the State Department's use of temporary positions in foreign policy. Options include retaining, realigning, transferring, or removing special envoy positions. This comes as part of the Trump Administration's reorganization goals for the executive branch. The 115th Congress is examining the State Department's use of special envoy positions, with hearings held to discuss the issue. Congressional interest in limiting temporary foreign affairs appointments has been shown through bills like S. 1631. If enacted, the bill would restrict temporary foreign affairs appointments, requiring Senate confirmation for most appointees. The Secretary of State must provide a report within 30 days of enactment, recommending whether to maintain certain positions not authorized by Congress. Within 90 days, any positions to be retained must be presented to the Senate Committee. The Secretary of State can establish temporary foreign affairs positions without Senate confirmation for up to 180 days, as long as the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations is notified 15 days prior to the appointment.

Special envoys appointed by Congress need Senate advice and consent, except for the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. The authorization for the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma will be repealed. Congressional authorization is provided for the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues. The Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom can supervise special envoys. The Senate Committee on Appropriations passed S. 1780, the \"Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2018,\" which prohibits the use of funds to downsize or relocate certain offices and positions within the United States Government, including the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and the Special Advisor for Religious Minorities in the Near East and South Central. The Senate Committee on Appropriations passed a bill prohibiting the downsizing or relocation of certain government offices and positions, including the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and the Special Advisor for Religious Minorities.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations passed a bill prohibiting downsizing or relocating certain government offices and positions, including the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and the Special Advisor for Religious Minorities. The bill also raised concerns about the reorganization process at the Department of State. The Department of State provided a report to the committees in April 2017 detailing special envoy, representative, advisor, and coordinator positions, including temporary positions created in response to specific global issues or crises. The State Department identified key positions such as special envoy, representative, coordinator, and advisor in a report to Congress. These positions are created in response to global issues or crises and may bypass Senate approval. The Foreign Affairs Manual defines a special envoy as designated for specific purposes on a temporary basis. The State Department appoints special envoys for global issues or crises, bypassing Senate approval for some positions. Special envoys serve temporary roles for specific purposes, such as the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs. The Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS helps coordinate U.S. policy to destroy ISIS. Special envoys are appointed by the President for specific purposes, bypassing Senate approval. The law mandates that each Presidential Special Representative holds the rank of ambassador. The Foreign Affairs Manual outlines the roles of select special representatives. However, there is no clear definition or overview of coordinator roles in the Department of State. Congressional authorized coordinator positions have specified duties, while non-congressionally authorized positions may have descriptions on the Department of State's website. The Department of State's website may have information on authorized coordinators. U.S. law does not define the roles of senior advisors and special advisors in the Department of State, but the Foreign Affairs Manual outlines responsibilities for special advisors in regional bureaus. Public affairs advisors have specific responsibilities in both regional and functional bureaus. However, these guidelines may not apply to advisors outside of regional bureaus. Senior advisors and special advisors in functional and regional bureaus have varying levels of influence and leadership responsibilities. The Department of State appoints Ambassadors-at-large to assist with emergent problems worldwide, subject to Senate approval. Position descriptions for department advisors can be found on the department's website. Ambassadors-at-large are appointed with Senate approval and rank below assistant secretaries of state. They manage specific subject matters, while assistant secretaries have broader responsibilities. Other positions like Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy also hold similar ranks. Special envoys in the Department of State are identified by the American Foreign Service Association. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) and the department oversee special envoys, representatives, coordinators, and related positions, many of which are authorized by statute. However, the positions of \"Lead Coordinator for Iran Nuclear Implementation\" and \"Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Senior Official\" lack statutory authorization. These positions are described within the Foreign Affairs Manual and reflect the institutional structure of their respective organizations. The Senior Official for APEC guides the organization's activities under APEC Ministers. Special envoys and related positions in government service are compensated through various pay rates, including SES, EX, GS, ED, EF, and SL. These pay rates are authorized by statute for personnel in the Department of State and across the federal government.

Limited appointments to the Senior Foreign Service can be made for individuals who are not career Foreign Service Officers under certain conditions. Many in the foreign affairs community and Congress have differing views on the use of special appointments for envoys. The Clinton Administration was criticized for overusing special appointments, while the George W. Bush Administration initially aimed to avoid them but ended up matching the Clinton Administration's numbers. Urgency regarding specific issues also plays a role in appointing special envoys. Members of Congress and interest groups push for special envoys to address important issues, with pressure coming from both Congress and the Administration. Senator Corker criticized special envoys, stating they do more harm than good and are unnecessary. The Trump Administration issued plans regarding special envoys on August 28, 2017. Senator Corker expressed concern about the accumulation of special envoys at the State Department and mentioned the committee's authorization bill recognizing the need for special envoys in urgent situations. Ranking Member Benjamin Cardin also acknowledged the excess of special envoys but emphasized the importance of having a point person for certain issues. Senator Cardin agreed with Secretary Tillerson's plans to review the use of special envoys for efficiency and effectiveness. The use of Special Envoys is being examined for efficiency and effectiveness, with arguments for and against their necessity. Proponents highlight benefits such as quick crisis response and indicating high-level Administration interest in specific issues. The decision on which positions are essential may vary among Members of Congress and Administrations. Special envoys can assist high-level officials with specific issues, represent the views of the President or Secretary of State, and engage with enemies or address issues of concern. Critics argue that overuse of special envoys could undermine ambassadors. Some concerns about special envoys include undermining ambassadors, causing confusion among officials, creating tension with existing roles, lack of accountability to Congress, hiring staff outside of Foreign Service Officers, and potentially undermining the Administration's policy consistency. Special envoys appointed outside the foreign policy arena may lack knowledge of key policy players and department bureaucracy, potentially hindering their effectiveness. They often remain in their positions long after the issues they were created to address are resolved, sending unintended signals to the world. Congress has addressed concerns by requiring reports on the use of special appointments and holding hearings. The Senate is considering legislation to require appointments of special envoys to be made with Senate advice and consent. Other options include limiting funds for special envoys' compensation, requiring appointees to be career members of the Senior Foreign Service or Foreign Service Officers. The Senate is considering legislation to require appointments of special envoys to be made with Senate advice and consent. Exemptions could be carved out for members of the Senior Executive Service, detailees from other federal agencies, or others as needed. Congressional perspectives on these issues may evolve as the Secretary of State and the Trump Administration continue to pursue State Department and executive branch reorganization."
