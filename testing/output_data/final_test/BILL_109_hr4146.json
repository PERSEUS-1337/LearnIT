The Act defines terms such as \"appropriate federal banking agency,\" \"insured credit union,\" \"insured depository institution,\" and \"qualified disaster area.\" The President has declared major disasters in Florida due to Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Wilma in 2005. The Congress expresses its view on the cashing of government checks. The Congress emphasizes the importance of insured institutions providing financial services to consumers affected by hurricanes, including cashing government assistance checks. Treasury and financial regulators should educate institutions on proper guidance for cashing these checks, and regulators should collaborate with institutions. To facilitate cashing of Federal government assistance and benefit checks, work with insured depository institutions and credit unions under extraordinary circumstances. During a specified period, Federal reserve banks will waive transaction fees for wire transfer services for insured depository institutions or credit unions in qualified disaster areas. Additionally, affected institutions will have flexibility in capital and net worth standards. During an 18-month period after the enactment of this Act, Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration have the authority to temporarily refrain from enforcing certain regulatory actions on undercapitalized insured depository institutions or credit unions that primarily serve individuals in qualified disaster areas. During an 18-month period after the enactment of this Act, Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration have the authority to temporarily refrain from enforcing certain regulatory actions on undercapitalized insured depository institutions or credit unions that primarily serve individuals in qualified disaster areas. The insured depository institution or credit union must have been adequately capitalized as of September 24, 2005, or October 22, 2005, depending on the specific disaster area, and the capital reduction must be due to the impact of Hurricane Rita or Hurricane Wilma. During an 18-month period post-enactment, regulatory actions may be temporarily withheld by Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration for undercapitalized insured depository institutions or credit unions in qualified disaster areas affected by Hurricane Rita or Hurricane Wilma. The institutions must have been adequately capitalized before the specified disaster dates, and any capital reduction should align with recovery plans and safe practices. Capital and net worth categories are defined as per relevant sections of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Federal Credit Union Act. SEC. 6. DEPOSIT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS. During an 18-month period after the enactment of this Act, insured depository institutions or credit unions may deduct a qualifying amount of insurance proceeds from their total assets for leverage limit compliance, if certain conditions are met. Insured depository institutions or credit unions in qualified disaster areas must be adequately capitalized and have a plan for managing asset and deposit increases. Insured depository institutions and credit unions in qualified disaster areas must maintain adequate capitalization and a plan for managing increases in total assets and deposits. The definitions of \"leverage limit\" for both types of institutions are outlined in accordance with relevant acts. The term \"qualifying amount attributable to insurance proceeds\" refers to the excess of an institution's total assets over its average total assets due to insurance payments or government assistance following a major disaster in a qualified disaster area. The provisions of this Act will not apply after 180 days from the date of enactment, with a possible 30-day extension for section 4 upon Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System approval."
