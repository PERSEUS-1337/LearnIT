    "content": "Priority for Federal grants will be given to Indian tribes certifying that retail establishments on trust lands are collecting and paying State retail taxes. Failure to pay taxes will be certified. If an Indian or Indian tribe consistently and willfully fails to pay qualified State retail tax on retail items sold from a retail establishment on trust land, the Governor or Attorney General of the State can request action from the Assistant Secretary. The Governor or Attorney General of the State can certify failure to pay state retail tax on trust land and request removal of trust status for the retail establishment structure. SEC. 3. NOTICE OF REQUEST; COMMENT PERIOD. The Assistant Secretary must publish notice of a request in the Federal Register within 30 days of receiving documentation and certification from a State. Rules for notifying Indian tribes about trust removal requests must be established within 90 days of the Act's enactment. A 90-day comment period is provided after publication for responses. The Act requires the Assistant Secretary to publish a notice of a request in the Federal Register within 30 days of receiving documentation from a State. Interested persons have 90 days to submit comments on the request. If a request is made to remove Indian land from trust, the Indian tribe may request a hearing within 60 days of publication. The Secretary must hold the hearing within 90 days of the comment period. Regulations to implement this section must be promulgated within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Upon receipt of documentation and a request from the Governor or attorney general, the Assistant Secretary investigates if an Indian tribe failed to make payments as required. Within 60 days of the notice period, the results are published in the Federal Register. If an Indian or Indian tribe consistently and willfully fails to make payments for retail items sold to non-tribal members on trust land, the Assistant Secretary informs the Secretary for removal of the land from trust status, eliminating tribal taxation authority. The Act eliminates tribal taxation authority on goods purchased on trust land, subjecting them to State and local sales taxes regardless of the buyer's tribal status. If payments are made to the State before land is removed from trust status, the land may not be taken out of trust. The Secretary must follow specific procedures to remove land from trust status, including submitting new documentation and certification. The Secretary's decision is final and can be appealed. Land taken out of trust can be restored if the Indian tribe has made all required payments to the State for at least one year. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS. Land taken out of trust under this Act will still be considered part of the service area for federally recognized Indian tribes and their members. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Indian,\" \"Indian tribe,\" and \"qualified State retail tax.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior in the context of the Act. The Secretary of the Interior will issue interim rules to implement the provisions of the Act within 90 days of its enactment."
