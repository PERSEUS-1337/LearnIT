    "content": "The \"Spring Mountains National Recreation Area Act\" defines National Forest lands, the Recreation Area, and the Secretary of Agriculture. The Act establishes the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area for recreational purposes. The \"Spring Mountains National Recreation Area Act\" aims to preserve scenic, scientific, historic, cultural, natural, and wildlife values in Nevada. It also ensures conservation and management of natural recreation resources and provides public recreation opportunities for present and future generations in the Spring Mountains. The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area in Nevada, spanning 316,000 acres of federally owned lands in the Toiyabe National Forest, was established to preserve various values and provide public recreation opportunities. The Secretary is required to file a map of the area for public inspection. In case of discrepancies between acreage and map, the map controls boundaries of the Recreation Area. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT. The Secretary, through the Chief of the Forest Service, manages the Recreation Area to conserve scenic, scientific, historic, cultural values, fish and wildlife populations, watersheds, outdoor recreation benefits, and designated wilderness areas. The Secretary manages the Recreation Area to conserve scenic, scientific, historic, cultural values, fish and wildlife populations, watersheds, outdoor recreation benefits, and designated wilderness areas. The Recreation Area allows hunting, trapping, fishing, and habitat management in accordance with US and Nevada laws, with exceptions for public safety and enjoyment. Livestock grazing may be permitted by the Secretary. The Secretary may permit livestock grazing within the Recreation Area under Federal law and reasonable regulations. The Secretary can also take preventive measures to protect the land and resources from fire, insects, or disease infestation. The management plan for the Recreation Area may include permitting livestock grazing and implementing preventive measures for land and resource protection. The Secretary will develop a general management plan for the Recreation Area as an amendment to the Toiyabe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan within 3 fiscal years of the enactment of this Act. The plan will reflect the establishment of the Recreation Area and be consistent with the Act. The general management plan for the Recreation Area under the Toiyabe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan will be developed with public participation. It will include implementation plans for interpretation, public education, and proposals for public facilities. Proposals for public facilities, management of natural and cultural resources with emphasis on preservation, and wildlife and fish resource management plans for the Recreation Area will be developed with public participation. The Recreation Area will have management plans developed in consultation with appropriate departments of the State of Nevada, including recreation management plans, wild horse and burro herd management plans, and an inventory of lands for possible future acquisitions. Consultation will be part of the natural resource management plans. The management plans for natural and cultural resources in the Recreation Area will be prepared in consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the Nevada State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The general management plan will include recommendations from the Bureau of Land Management on the suitability for wilderness preservation of the identified acres. The Secretary will manage the lands within the Mt. Stirling, La Madre Mountains, and Pine Creek Wilderness Study Areas to maintain their potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary will manage lands in designated wilderness study areas to preserve their potential for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Secretary has the authority to acquire lands through various means for the purpose of implementing the Act. Federally owned lands within the Recreation Area can only be exchanged for lands owned by the State of Nevada or its political subdivisions. Any acquired lands within the Recreation Area will be managed according to the Act. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 allows for the acquisition of lands, waters, and interests in lands and waters within the National Forest System. Money from the fund can be used for this purpose, and new boundaries established for a unit of the National Forest System will be treated as if they were set on January 1, 1965. SEC. 8. WITHDRAWAL. Federal lands within the Recreation Area are withdrawn from various activities under public land laws, mining laws, and leasing laws, except for specific described lands. SEC. 9. COORDINATED MANAGEMENT. The Secretary will coordinate the management of the Recreation Area with proximate lands to meet the needs of the people. Cooperative agreements may be entered into for unified management of natural and cultural resources in southern Nevada. Appropriations are authorized for carrying out this Act."
