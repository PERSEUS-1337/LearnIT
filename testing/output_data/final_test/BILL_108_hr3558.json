The Congress finds that the privacy of wireless subscribers has been safeguarded, reducing unwanted interruptions on their phones. The wireless industry is considering implementing a directory assistance service for wireless subscribers, even those who have not shared their phone numbers. Some subscribers may find this service useful, but current subscribers should have the choice to opt-in. The wireless industry is exploring a directory assistance service for wireless subscribers, allowing them to control the disclosure of their phone numbers. Current and new subscribers should not be charged for opting out of this service. Concerns remain about protecting consumer privacy rights in the marketplace. Congress previously protected wireless location information by prohibiting its disclosure without subscriber authorization. The public interest would benefit from similar privacy protections for wireless directory assistance services. Consumer control of wireless phone numbers is addressed in Section 3.

It states that mobile service providers cannot include a current subscriber's wireless telephone number in any directory assistance service without providing notice and obtaining consent from the subscriber.

The commercial mobile service provider must inform subscribers of their right not to be listed in any wireless directory assistance service database and provide mechanisms for them to decline participation.

The subscriber's wireless telephone number information must not be disclosed. The commercial mobile service provider must not disclose subscriber information, including wireless telephone numbers, to calling parties. They are prohibited from publishing any part of the wireless directory assistance service database. Subscribers cannot be charged for exercising their privacy rights.
