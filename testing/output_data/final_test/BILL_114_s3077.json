    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Marijuana Effective Drug Studies Act of 2016\" or the \"MEDS Act.\" It focuses on marijuana research. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to register practitioners for marijuana research, excluding marijuana from schedule I. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to allow practitioners to conduct marijuana research if authorized and approved by the Secretary or federal agencies. The Controlled Substances Act allows practitioners to conduct marijuana research if approved by the National Institutes of Health and the Attorney General, who considers factors like the applicant's experience and conviction record. The Controlled Substances Act requires researchers to comply with laws related to controlled substances and other conduct that may threaten public health. The National Institutes of Health must establish a process for researchers to submit and receive approval for their research protocols within specific timeframes. The Attorney General must review complete registration applications within 60 days. The Attorney General must approve or issue an order to show cause for research applications. Applications are complete when requirements are met. Researchers must store marijuana securely. Security measures must prevent diversion. Approved applicants can make amendments. Applicants can amend or supplement their research protocol without reapplying if it does not change the drug type, source, storage conditions, or increase diversion risk. They must notify the Attorney General of any amendments to renew registration. If changes involve drug type, source, or increase diversion risk, additional approval is required. The applicant must notify the Attorney General 30 days before making changes to their research protocol that increase the risk of diversion. If there is no objection within 30 days, the applicant can proceed with the changes. The Attorney General can object if additional security measures are necessary to prevent diversion or abuse. Research involving marijuana in accordance with regulations is not restricted by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. If marijuana is listed on a schedule other than schedule I, additional restrictions may apply. The Controlled Substances Act allows for research with marijuana or its compounds listed on schedules other than schedule I, with specific provisions applying to such research. A conforming amendment includes \"marijuana\" in the definition of \"marihuana\" in the Act. Manufacturing of marijuana for clinical use is addressed in Section 3. Manufacturing and distribution of marijuana for research and scientific purposes under federal registration requirements are outlined in an amendment to Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act. The amendment to Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act allows for the registration of applicants to manufacture or distribute marijuana exclusively for commercial production of approved drugs. The Attorney General cannot limit the number of eligible manufacturers and distributors, and applications must be processed within 30 days. The Attorney General must grant the application or serve an order to show cause for registration under paragraph (1) or (2). When considering factors for registration, the Attorney General must consider the demand for specific strains of marijuana and manufacturing processes. The registration of manufacturers and distributors is related to the single convention on narcotic drugs. The registration of manufacturers and distributors of marijuana under paragraphs (1) and (2) constitutes constructive possession and control by the Federal Government for obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Article 28 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs does not prohibit or impose additional restrictions on the manufacturing of marijuana conducted in accordance with applicable provisions. SEC. 4. The National Institute for Drug Abuse will develop recommendations for good manufacturing practices for marijuana research. SEC. 5. Quotas for controlled substances should be increased to meet medical, scientific, and industrial needs. SEC. 6. Termination of interdisciplinary review process for non-NIH-funded researchers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is prohibited from reinstating the Public Health Service interdisciplinary review process for marijuana research or creating an additional review process specifically for marijuana research protocols."
