Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 1022, which pertains to indexing certain assets for determining gain or loss. This section states that for indexed assets held for 1 year or longer, the indexed basis shall be substituted for the adjusted basis when sold or disposed of. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization deductions are determined without applying this substitution. Indexed assets include stock, bonds, tangible property used in trade or business, and land held in connection with a trade or business. The indexed basis of assets for determining gain or loss is calculated by adjusting the basis of the asset and applying an inflation adjustment. The applicable inflation adjustment is based on the gross domestic product deflator for the year of disposal. The gross domestic product deflator is used to adjust the basis of assets for determining gain or loss. If the risk of loss from holding an asset is substantially reduced, it will not be treated as an indexed asset for that period. For a reduced risk period, the taxpayer is treated as acquiring the asset the day after. Pass-thru entities like partnerships, S corporations, common trust funds, and regulated investment companies pass adjustments to partners, shareholders, participants, and shareholders respectively. Stock in a qualified investment entity is considered an indexed asset based on the ratio of indexed assets to total assets held by the entity at the end of a calendar month. If this ratio is 90 percent or more, it is treated as 100 percent. For a calendar month where the ratio of indexed assets to total assets is 10 percent or less, the ratio shall be zero. Real estate investment trusts are not required to value assets more frequently than once every 36 months, with the trustee's judgment used in the absence of valuation. A qualified investment entity refers to a regulated investment company. The section excludes sales between related persons unless the transferee's basis is substituted. Related persons are defined as those with specific relationships under section 267(b) or treated as a single employer under section 414. If the adjusted basis of tangible property or stock increases by $10,000 or more due to improvements or capital contributions, it will be treated as a separate asset. This section prevents the creation or increase of a net ordinary loss that would apply under certain provisions. The taxpayer will be treated as having a long-term capital loss equal to the amount of the ordinary loss. Special rules apply for assets that were not indexed throughout the holding period. Certain distributions with respect to stock will be treated as a disposition. If subsection (a)(1) was previously applied to an asset, the acquisition date will be adjusted. The taxpayer's acquisition of an asset is treated as not earlier than the most recent prior application. Collapsible corporations are not affected by this section. Transfers made to increase indexing adjustment or depreciation allowance may be partially or fully disallowed by the Secretary. The table of sections for part II of subchapter O of chapter 1 is amended to include a new item after section 1021 to address an increase in indexing adjustment or depreciation allowance. SEC. 1022 amends the indexing of certain assets for gain or loss determination. The effective date applies to property dispositions after the enactment date. SEC. 2 excludes gain from the sale of a principal residence under Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence under Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount excluded to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint returns) and includes special rules for property held jointly by spouses. Both spouses are considered to meet the requirements for holding and using property if one spouse satisfies them. If a spouse is deceased, the surviving individual is treated as meeting the requirements if the deceased spouse did. Additionally, if the taxpayer holds stock in a cooperative housing corporation as a tenant-stockholder, they are also eligible for the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence under Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code. If a taxpayer holds stock in a cooperative housing corporation as a tenant-stockholder, the holding and use requirements for the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence under Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code apply to the stock and the house or apartment occupied by the taxpayer. Involuntary conversions of property are treated as the sale of such property, and the exclusion applies to the gain from the sale of a property used in part as a principal residence. The determination of marital status for tax purposes is made at the time of sale or exchange. Legal separation under a divorce decree means the individual is not considered married. This applies to involuntary conversions and the sale of a residence under Sections 1033 and 1034. The amount realized from the sale or exchange of property is determined without regard to certain sections, reduced by the amount of gain not included in gross income. Property acquired after involuntary conversion has its basis determined under section 1033. Taxpayers who become physically or mentally incapable may have their use of property treated differently. Taxpayers who become physically or mentally incapable may have their property treated as their principal residence if they reside in a licensed facility. They can elect to not have this section apply to any sale or exchange. Clerical and conforming amendments are made to section 1033(k) of the Code. The text discusses amendments to various sections of the tax code related to the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. These changes include updates to sections 1038(e)(1), 1250(d)(7), and the table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1. Amendments to the tax code include the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence. The effective date for these changes applies to sales and exchanges after the enactment of the Act."
