    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48204 of the Education Code is amended to specify residency requirements for school attendance in a school district, including pupils placed in licensed institutions or foster homes, and foster children remaining in their school of origin. (3) A pupil approved for interdistrict attendance under Section 46600 of the Education Code.\n(4) A pupil whose parent or legal guardian is emancipated and resides within the school district.\n(5) A pupil living with a caregiving adult in the school district, confirmed by affidavit.\n(6) A pupil residing in a state hospital within the school district's boundaries. A pupil may be deemed to have met residency requirements for school attendance in a district if a parent or legal guardian is employed within the district for a minimum of 10 hours per week. The school district where a parent or legal guardian is employed for at least 10 hours per week does not have to admit the pupil. However, the district cannot refuse admission based on race, ethnicity, sex, parental income, or scholastic achievement. The district where the parents' residency is established or where the pupil is to be transferred can deny the transfer if it would negatively impact desegregation plans. The school district can prohibit pupil transfer if the cost exceeds additional state aid. The governing board should communicate reasons for denial and record them in meeting minutes. Average daily attendance is calculated for admitted pupils. The school district can limit pupil transfers based on attendance numbers. Approval is needed for a net transfer exceeding certain limits, depending on the district's average daily attendance. Once a pupil meets residency requirements and enrolls in a school district where a parent/guardian is employed, they can attend school through grade 12 without reapplying each year. The governing board must allow this if the parent/guardian remains employed within the district boundaries. Section 48204 of the Education Code is repealed."
