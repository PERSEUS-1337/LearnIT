    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Children from Peer-to-Peer Pornography Act of 2003\". Congress finds that peer-to-peer file trading software, with over 200 million downloads, is being used by over 3 million people, including juveniles who are at risk of exposure to child pornography. The number of reports of child pornography on peer-to-peer systems has increased fourfold, with approximately 40 percent of users being juveniles. The availability of peer-to-peer systems poses a significant risk of inadvertent exposure to pornography, including child pornography, for juveniles. This can lead to further sexual abuse of children as the production of child pornography is linked to abuse. Additionally, peer-to-peer systems present security and privacy threats by allowing access to all files on a user's hard drive without their knowledge. Federal law should provide protection for juvenile users of peer-to-peer systems due to security and privacy threats. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Trade Commission, \"juvenile\" means an individual under 18, \"parent\" includes a legal guardian, \"peer-to-peer file trading software\" and \"peer-to-peer system\" are defined by regulations under section 3(b)(1), and \"verifiable parental consent\" involves reasonable efforts to ensure parental authorization for distributing peer-to-peer file trading software to a juvenile. The Privacy Protection Act of 1998 defines \"verification of majority\" as efforts to ensure recipients of peer-to-peer file trading software are not minors, including verifying credit card information. The term \"person\" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and other entities. Regulation of juvenile access to peer-to-peer networks is addressed in Section 4.
