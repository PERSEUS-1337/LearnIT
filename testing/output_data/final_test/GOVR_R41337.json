    "content": "An evaluation provides information during the policy process to understand policy problems and inform policy design, implementation, and oversight. Stakeholders like Congress, the President, federal agencies, state and local governments, interest groups, and the public seek evaluation data. There is no one best way to conduct an evaluation due to various reasons. An evaluation is essential for understanding policy problems and informing policy decisions. The context and implementation of a program influence the evaluation design. Stakeholders have different information needs and research questions. Independence in evaluation can refer to the evaluation itself or the evaluator, ensuring impartiality and objectivity. The concept of independence in evaluation is debated, with varying opinions on what defines independence and when it is necessary. External or internal status of an evaluator does not always equate to independence. Independence may not always be needed in evaluations, depending on the context and goals of the evaluation. This report focuses on the characteristics of independent evaluators (IEs) when an evaluation is conducted by an entity outside the responsible organization. IEs vary in structure, jurisdiction, authority, resources, tenure, duties, and responsibilities, which can impact their effectiveness in overseeing programs or projects. This report discusses the characteristics and criteria of independent evaluators or similar units, including newly created entities like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and offices of inspector general (OIGs). It suggests different kinds and degrees of independence that Congress could consider for evaluators. The report also provides examples of independent offices with relevant citations, tracing the roots of evaluation back hundreds or even thousands of years. The \"modern era\" of evaluation, particularly \"program evaluation\" for government social programs, emerged in the 1960s and has grown since then. Legislation and executive directives have mandated and funded evaluations to better inform policy responses and strengthen oversight. Program evaluation has become more sophisticated and selective in methods, methodology, and subject areas, with the 1990s seeing increased assessments and reviews of programs. The 1990s saw increased evaluations of programs and operations through laws like the CFO Act, GPRA, CCA, and Federal Financial Assistance Improvement Act. These statutes allow flexibility in determining evaluation requirements for individual projects and programs. GPRA defines \"program evaluation\" as an assessment of how well Federal programs achieve objectives. Independent evaluation is conducted by units outside the program office and can be carried out by various positions with different titles. Independent evaluation units, such as independent or peer review panels, program evaluators, and research institutes, are growing in number across various policy domains. However, there is a lack of a precise, agreed-upon definition for \"independent evaluation\" or \"independent evaluator\" in federal statutes or regulations. The analysis found significant variations among offices that fall under the same rubric or conduct similar functions. Independent evaluators or similar entities were found to have differences in structure, organization, authority, jurisdiction, funding, staffing, tenure, and duties. Dissimilarities among these characteristics in IE-like positions and functions are more common than similarities due to different rationales, expectations, research questions, and contexts. The establishment of independent evaluators lacks standardization and uniformity due to different rationales, expectations, and conditions. Structural differences may arise because of the discretion and flexibility granted by the creator of the entity. Disagreements exist over the support for independence and the characteristics of the office. Disagreements persist over the value and means of supporting independence for evaluators, highlighted by the tension between OMB and agency evaluation interests. OMB revised guidance to allow for independence if evaluations were outsourced or conducted by an agency's program evaluation office, but debates continue on the importance of this criterion. Independence in evaluation may not be crucial if the focus is on strengthening institutions or building capacity. Concerns include the size of the evaluation task, integration into program operations, and potential competition with other offices. Selecting the right evaluation technique is also important. The establishment and operation of independent evaluation entities vary widely, from small, ad hoc efforts to larger, continuous units with their own resources. These entities differ in structure and operation, with a range of possible combinations and variations even among units evaluating similar programs. The characteristics of independent evaluators and similar constructs are determined by formal and informal factors, reflected in their powers, protections, and relationships with executive officials. Other influences include staff expertise, competency, impartiality, and trust. The characteristics of independent evaluators and similar constructs are influenced by factors such as staff expertise, competency, impartiality, and trust. These factors impact the independence, capacity, capability, and effectiveness of evaluators, affecting their contributions to oversight by Congress and the executive. The terms \"independent evaluator\" and \"independent evaluation\" lack standardized definitions, but various criteria and attributes can be identified based on research and other sources. The American Evaluation Association (AEA), Encyclopedia of Evaluation, Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation, and federal agencies like GAO, CIGIE, and OMB provide varying levels of detail on evaluation concepts and independence. Differences exist in the depth of descriptions, with AEA taking a broad approach to evaluation for public programs. The American Evaluation Association (AEA) promotes evaluation for public programs with a broad understanding of evaluation. Evaluators aim for accountability and learning by providing valuable information. Professional evaluations help improve knowledge, accountability, effectiveness, efficiency, and identify pathways to achieving objectives. The American Evaluation Association (AEA) promotes evaluation for public programs with a focus on accountability, learning, and efficiency. AEA specifies key elements for evaluation practices, including using professional standards, stating specific program goals, issuing performance measures, specifying necessary resources, supporting evaluators with competencies and authorities, and utilizing private evaluators for independent evaluation. The American Evaluation Association (AEA) promotes evaluation for public programs with a focus on accountability, learning, and efficiency. AEA approved guiding principles for evaluators in July 2004, emphasizing systematic inquiry, competence, integrity/honesty, respect for people, and responsibilities for general and public welfare. The Encyclopedia of Evaluation defines \"independent evaluation\" as requiring impartiality, objectivity, and accountability. External evaluations are seen as more credible than internal ones due to perceived independence and reduced conflict of interest. The Joint Committee's standards for evaluating educational programs emphasize four basic attributes: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Independence. These standards ensure that evaluations serve the information needs of users, are realistic and cost-effective, and maintain impartiality and objectivity. The evaluation of educational programs focuses on four key attributes: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Independence. Propriety ensures legal and ethical conduct, fair assessment, disclosure of findings, and fiscal responsibility. Accuracy aims to provide technically adequate information through program documentation, valid sources, quantitative analysis, and impartial reporting. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) explains program evaluation as systematic studies to assess program effectiveness, conducted by external entities, agency experts, or program managers. Evaluations compare program performance against standards and examine strengths and weaknesses. The 2008 Inspector General Reform Act has directed the new Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to develop plans for coordinated, Governmentwide activities that address problems and promote economy and efficiency in Federal programs. This call to action builds on a growing movement among individual offices to increase and enhance program evaluation. The CIGIE Inspection and Evaluation Committee developed standards for inspection and evaluation processes, including competency, independence, quality control, data analysis, and reporting. These standards aim to provide factual information for decision-making, monitor compliance, measure performance, and identify areas for improvement in programs and operations. The Inspection and Evaluation Committee developed standards for inspection and evaluation processes, focusing on maintenance, timeliness, fraud, reporting, performance measurement, and working relationships. The standards are advisory and voluntary, tailored to each Department/Agency's unique mission. The inspection function has evolved in complexity, diversity, and size since the IG Act in 1978, with varying expertise, location, staffing, and budget among IG offices. OMB has provided guidance on achieving independence and expertise. OMB has provided guidance on achieving independence and expertise in evaluations, with differences in specifications between the Bush and Obama Administrations. The Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) developed during the Bush Administration included considerations about program evaluation independence. OMB emphasized the importance of non-biased evaluations to improve program effectiveness. OMB emphasized the importance of high-quality, unbiased, and independent evaluations to improve program effectiveness. There were disagreements over the definition of independence for evaluators, with OMB initially suggesting outside entities like statutory IGs or GAO, but later allowing evaluations to be considered independent if contracted out to a third party or conducted by an agency's program evaluation office. After Barack Obama became President, the Office of Management and Budget issued memoranda and guidance on independent program evaluation, emphasizing the importance of rigorous, unbiased evaluations to determine program effectiveness. OMB allowed evaluations to be considered independent if contracted out to a third party or conducted by an agency's program evaluation office. In October 2009, OMB focused on independent evaluation in a memorandum, emphasizing the need for studies free from political interference. Agencies seeking funding had to demonstrate their ability to conduct unbiased studies. In a follow-up memorandum, OMB allocated $100 million for program evaluations and capacity-building in the President's budget proposal for FY 2012. The 2010 memorandum reiterated the importance of independent evaluations within agencies and the need to attract talented researchers. It suggested various ways to institutionalize independent evaluation, including creating a congressionally chartered institute or an office reporting directly to senior officials. The memorandum also emphasized the need for program evaluations, particularly impact evaluations. The 2010 memorandum emphasized the importance of independent evaluations within agencies and the need for program evaluations, specifically impact evaluations. It called for funding in FY2011 to conduct evaluations or build capacity to strengthen program evaluation. Another OMB memorandum in mid-2010 highlighted a shift towards performance improvement strategies and achieving ambitious performance goals identified as High Priority Performance Goals in the President's FY 2011 Budget. The 2010 report by the Government Accountability Office examined government efficiency improvement efforts by the Bush and Obama Administrations, focusing on program-level efficiency and performance measures. While most programs developed efficiency measures, they often lacked input and output or outcome measures. Despite challenges, some officials found the efficiency measures reported for PART useful for evaluating proposals. The GAO report recognized improvements in government efficiency efforts by the Bush and Obama Administrations, emphasizing program-level efficiency and performance measures. The 2010 OMB memoranda focused on evaluating programs for efficacy and cost-efficiency, emphasizing the relationship between efficacy and efficiency. Performance Improvement Guidance specified that evaluation should concentrate on performance improvement strategies and making GPRA documents useful. The criteria for an independent evaluator can be identified using perspectives and examples cited in the report. These characteristics are intended to establish a range of possibilities for evaluating an IE's capacity, credibility, and effectiveness. Well-defined jurisdiction is a key factor in determining the independence of an IE-like entity. Well-defined jurisdiction is crucial for an independent evaluator, ensuring clear separation from the program or project office. This can be achieved through various options such as establishing an external evaluation unit or contracting with a private organization. An independent evaluator should have relevant expertise and experience, with options including an external evaluation unit or an in-house program evaluation office. Avoiding conflicts of interest is crucial, with neutrality, objectivity, and impartiality in conducting and reporting evaluations. Third-party review can help detect bias, ensuring independence in the evaluation process. Evaluations may need to consider various definitions of programmatic success. Evaluations should focus on different definitions of programmatic success, with criteria and standards determined by the subject matter and extent of coverage. GAO identifies evaluation types as cost-effectiveness, implementation, impact, and outcome. Responsibilities may include assessing performance, developing measures, providing information, monitoring compliance, and issuing recommendations. The responsibilities of program evaluations include monitoring compliance, issuing recommendations, ensuring competency and expertise, allocating sufficient resources, accessing reliable data, documenting the evaluation process, and adhering to report contents and timetables. The responsibilities of program evaluations include monitoring compliance, issuing recommendations, ensuring competency and expertise, allocating sufficient resources, accessing reliable data, documenting the evaluation process, and adhering to report contents and timetables. This involves what the reports should contain (findings, conclusions, and/or recommendations) and when they should be submitted. It also includes who is to receive the reports and how they should be made available. Evaluation responses and report revisions are specified, including whether a report may be revised by certain authorities or if responses from evaluation subjects are required. The criteria for establishing an independent evaluation entity are important for resolving differences between evaluators and program offices. Clear requirements are needed to support the independence and quality of evaluation studies and reports for various stakeholders. The criteria for establishing an independent evaluation entity are crucial for ensuring independence and quality in evaluation studies. Key considerations include selection requirements, appointing authority, and duties of the IE entities and their officers. The criteria for establishing an independent evaluation entity are crucial for ensuring independence and quality in evaluation studies. Key considerations include selection requirements, appointing authority, tenure, funding, supervision, and purposes of the entity. The evaluation unit's roles in long-term programs or short-term projects, recommendations, findings, and conclusions, as well as its contribution to management practices and program effectiveness, are important considerations. Substantive research questions, types of evaluation, discretion given to the unit, and mandated studies are key factors to determine. The evaluation unit's roles in long-term programs or short-term projects, recommendations, findings, and conclusions, as well as its contribution to management practices and program effectiveness, are important considerations. Is an IE required to conduct certain studies (e.g., interims as well as a final) or does he or she have some discretion over the range and frequency of studies? Study Standards and Procedures: What standards, procedures, and guidelines is an IE expected to follow in conducting evaluations? Consultation with Outside Organizations: Is an IE entity required to consult with other governmental or nongovernmental organizations in carrying out its responsibilities? Types of Reports: What types of reports are ordered?

How is it to be disseminated? Is it in hard-copy (from the IE or the Government Printing Office, for instance) or on the website of the IE, the affected agency, or another official recipient? Response Obligations : What The independent evaluation unit's jurisdiction, mode of operation, and response obligations are key considerations. It is important to determine the scope of jurisdiction, whether it covers a narrow project or a broad program, and the entities it encompasses. Additionally, understanding the unit's mode of operation, such as continuous monitoring or assessing specific programs, is crucial. Response obligations of the affected agency or program office to the unit's findings and recommendations should also be clarified. Independent evaluators of federal programs have increased since the 1960s and continue to do so, operating both inside and outside agencies as separate units. They are not found within program offices to maintain independence. Independent evaluators of federal programs operate as separate units under various names and titles. Evaluations are conducted by different agencies like the Government Accountability Office, offices of inspector general, NIST, and the National Academy of Sciences. These evaluators have diverse structures, responsibilities, and requirements due to the lack of a precise definition of \"independence\" and \"evaluation.\" Recommended standards vary in detail, but common criteria can be considered when creating or modifying an independent evaluator. Independent evaluators of federal programs have diverse structures and responsibilities. They operate under various names and titles, with some having flexibility in their structure and operations while others have detailed duties and directions. The political context in which independent evaluators are established varies, leading to different demands and expectations. As a result, independent evaluators follow various approaches to assess federal programs, provide relevant information to stakeholders, enhance program oversight, and aid in the development of new legislation or executive directives. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of independent evaluation entities through legislation or executive directives. It highlights the diversity of these units and their adoption over time. The listing is not comprehensive but illustrates the various structures and responsibilities of independent evaluators. The curr_chunk discusses the diversity among entities empowered to conduct evaluations, highlighting differences in appointment, tenure, jurisdiction, criteria, reporting mandates, funding, and staffing. One example is the Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration Independent Evaluator established by Executive Order 13508. The independent evaluator called for in Executive Order 13508 assists the Federal Leadership Committee for the Chesapeake Bay in overseeing programs and activities for the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The committee is responsible for developing strategies, program plans, and publishing a strategy for the watershed. The Committee, in collaboration with State agencies, will ensure that an independent evaluator periodically reports on progress towards meeting the goals of the executive order for the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The Committee will ensure that program evaluation reports are made public, including data on practice or system implementation funded through agency programs. The independent evaluator for the Chesapeake Bay Restoration will have an interagency and inter-governmental jurisdiction, indefinite tenure, and reporting requirements to track progress towards the goals of the executive order. The Chesapeake Clean Water and Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2009 focuses on restoring Chesapeake Bay by reauthorizing the Chesapeake Bay Program, expanding government authority, providing new grants, and strengthening enforcement tools. It aims to expedite and enhance water and ecosystem restoration efforts. The Chesapeake Executive Council, established in the mid-1980s, directs the Chesapeake Bay Program according to the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. The Council develops and implements management strategies, coordinates science and research, and implements outreach programs for public education and participation. The EPA Administrator can enter agreements with other federal agencies to carry out these tasks. S. 1816 would authorize agreements with federal agencies for grants, technical assistance, and monitoring related to protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Bay. The EPA Administrator must issue an annual action plan and biennial progress reports. The Inspector General will evaluate implementation every three years, and consultation with various entities is required. The EPA Administrator is directed to consult with the Chesapeake Bay Program Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee regarding monitoring designs. Proposed legislation (H.R. 1053) mirrors E.O. 13508 in addressing Chesapeake Bay restoration, including an Independent Evaluator. The House bill calls for an interagency crosscut budget for restoration activities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed to be submitted to Congress by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. H.R. 1053 requires the EPA Administrator, in consultation with other agencies, to develop an adaptive management plan for the Chesapeake Bay Program. This plan includes specific objectives for improving water quality, habitat, and fisheries, stakeholder participation, monitoring, research practices, and modifying restoration priorities as needed. The proposal for the Chesapeake Bay Program includes an Independent Evaluator to review and report on restoration activities and the use of adaptive management. The IE will submit a report to Congress every 3 years on the findings and recommendations regarding the adaptive management plans and their implementation. The Independent Scientific Review Panel, established to review the progress of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, produces biennial reports assessing ecological indicators and restoration progress. An independent peer review of project analysis methods is also mandated. The Secretary of the Army is required to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on project analysis methods, with specific recommendations for modifying economic and environmental analysis methods. The Oil Spill Recovery Institute is tasked with research and projects to develop techniques for oil spill recovery. The Oil Spill Recovery Institute conducts research and demonstration projects to develop techniques for oil spill recovery.

The board may request a scientific review of research programs every five years. The Oil Pollution Research Interagency Coordinating Committee, chaired by the United States Coast Guard, includes representatives from various federal agencies and operates under a specified budget. It reports to Congress on a plan for oil pollution research, development, and demonstration programs, consulting with affected states and seeking advice from the National Academy of Sciences. The committee coordinates oil pollution research and development programs, makes grant recommendations to the private sector, and reports to Congress every two years. Project studies are subject to peer review by independent panels of experts. Peer reviews for project studies are conducted by independent panels of experts, including those requested by governors or federal agencies. The Chief of Engineers contracts with organizations like the National Academy of Sciences to establish review panels. Reviews assess economic, engineering, and environmental methods, with reports due within 60 days of public comment. Certain congressional committees must be notified before a project study undergoes peer review. The Chief of Engineers contracts independent panels of experts for peer reviews on project studies, with reports due within 60 days of public comment. The panels submit final reports with analyses and recommendations, to which the chief must respond. Federal funds are authorized for each panel, with a $500,000 ceiling that can be waived by the chief. The reports and responses are made public and sent to certain congressional committees. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes oversight mechanisms like the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board and Independent Advisory Panel. The Recovery Act established the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to oversee covered funds and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. The board includes ten specified inspectors general and can request information from any federal agency. The President appoints the chairperson from three specified officers, one of which is the OMB deputy director for management. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, established by the Recovery Act, has powers similar to inspectors general under the IG Act of 1978. It can conduct public hearings, enter contracts, transfer funds, and collaborate on audits. The board's audit functions include reviewing covered funds, contracts, personnel training, and interagency collaboration mechanisms.
