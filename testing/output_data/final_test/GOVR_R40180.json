    "content": "The federal government has a history of involvement in water resource development and management for various purposes. Growing population and changing public interests have led to increased water use conflicts, especially in the West. Federal water resource construction decreased in the late 20th century due to fiscal constraints and a shift towards more local control and environmental considerations. Water resources debates in the 111th Congress will focus on changing policies, accountability, and authorizing investments in ecosystem restoration, land drainage, navigation, and flood reduction. The federal role in water planning and management is evolving, especially after natural disasters like the 2008 Midwest flooding and hurricanes. The 111th Congress is facing water resource development and management issues, including the federal role in planning, construction, maintenance, inspection, and financing of water projects. Disasters like the 2008 Midwest flooding and hurricanes have raised questions about the division of responsibilities among local, state, and federal entities for flood mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Competition over water supplies, especially in urban centers like Atlanta, has led to communities seeking federal assistance for water supply development projects. The 111th Congress is dealing with water resource issues such as federal investment in research, management of existing projects, environmental protection, and climate change. Congress faces challenges due to conflicting laws, competing objectives, and entrenched institutional mechanisms. Common themes in water resource conflicts include demand for new project services, protection of species, and water quality concerns. The 111th Congress is likely to address authorizations and appropriations for water resource development projects, aging infrastructure management, water resource protection, and regional aquatic ecosystem restoration programs. Legislation enacted in the 110th Congress included programs for coastal Louisiana, the Upper Mississippi River System, and Platte River. Site-specific measures include individual water resources projects authorized through Water Resources Development Acts and stand-alone bills addressing new water supply technologies, rural water supply development, and Indian water rights. The 111th Congress is expected to focus on authorizations and appropriations for water resource development projects, aging infrastructure management, water resource protection, and regional aquatic ecosystem restoration programs. Oversight of existing laws and projects, such as the Central Valley Project and flood protection in New Orleans and Sacramento, is also anticipated. It is uncertain if broad water policy reform will be considered, as Congress faces challenges in enacting changes that impact a wide range of constituencies. The fractured nature of congressional committee jurisdictions over water resources and quality issues leads to incremental changes through legislation for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation. Water allocation debates, drought conditions, and climate change impacts continue to challenge water managers nationwide. The concerns about water supply reliability and management flexibility due to climate change have increased. Western water legislation in the 111th Congress may focus on project authorization issues like San Joaquin River restoration, water reclamation projects, Indian water rights settlements, and climate change initiatives. Congressional attention may also be on oversight of Reclamation's Central Valley Project, Klamath project, and Colorado River operations, as well as the federal role in levee construction and maintenance. The federal government's focus on levee construction, maintenance, and inspection, particularly in the aftermath of disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Ike. Concerns also include the protection of threatened and endangered species, river health, and watershed restoration efforts across the country. Federal initiatives range from the Florida Everglades to the California Bay-Delta, with a growing demand for water supply projects. The demand for water supply projects, navigational improvements, and flood control projects in the California Bay-Delta region continues amidst controversy over water allocation for species protection, water quality, and various uses. Drought conditions and security threats to water infrastructure have further strained water resources. The 110th Congress left pending national water policy proposals, including climate change research and monitoring. The 111th Congress may address water resource issues, including federal reserved water rights, Indian water rights settlements, and licensing of nonfederal hydropower facilities. There is also discussion on establishing a national water commission to address federal water policy and coordination. Most large dams and water diversion structures in the US were built with the assistance of Reclamation or the Corps. Reclamation manages over 600 dams and reservoirs in 17 western states, providing water for irrigation and municipal use. The Corps operates numerous flood reduction and navigation projects nationwide, including thousands of miles of waterways and hydroelectric plants. The Corps constructed 9,000 miles of the nation's levees, but only maintains 600 miles. Congress authorizes Corps water resources activities in Water Resources Development Acts, with the most recent ones enacted in 2000 and 2007. The most recent Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) were enacted in 2000 and 2007. Interest in authorizing new studies and projects may lead to a WRDA bill in the 111th Congress, raising concerns about the Corps' backlog of projects and financial management. Funding for Corps water resources projects in the economic stimulus discussions lacks specificity. The lack of specificity in funding for Corps water resources projects in the economic stimulus discussions hinders analysis of potential efficiency, equity, and long-term economic growth and environmental effects. The universe of Corps authorized projects is diverse in purpose, size, and economic impact, with many projects being controversial and politically sensitive. Implementation of policy changes from WRDA 2007 may face congressional oversight. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and subsequent natural disasters have raised concerns about national flood risk and federal efforts to mitigate it. The distribution of federal funds for water resources projects and the division of responsibilities between local, state, and federal entities have come under scrutiny. Congressional reports and assessments may lead to policy changes in flood risk management. For more information on flood policy issues, refer to CRS Report RL33129, Flood Risk Management and Levees: A Federal Primer. The 111th Congress oversees Corps activities, including repair and fortification of Louisiana's hurricane protection system post-Katrina. Over $14 billion in emergency funds are used for levee construction, floodwalls, storm surge barriers, and pump improvements to reduce hurricane flooding risk in New Orleans to a 100-year level of protection. The 111th Congress oversees Corps activities, including repair and fortification of Louisiana's hurricane protection system post-Katrina. Corps facilities and their operation are central to debates over multi-purpose river management, with water resources management by the Corps being controversial in some cases. Reclamation has constructed and operated large, multi-purpose water projects since the early 1900s, such as Hoover Dam and Grand Coulee Dam. Construction authorizations for Reclamation projects slowed in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1987, the Bureau announced a new mission focused on environmentally sensitive water resources management. Increased population, prolonged drought, fiscal constraints, and demands for fish and wildlife, recreation, and scenic enjoyment have led to pressure to alter project operations. However, changes are controversial due to water rights, contractual obligations, and potential economic effects. Unlike the Corps, there is no regular authorization vehicle for Reclamation projects. Reclamation projects are considered individually, with occasional authorizations rolled into omnibus bills. Issues in the 111th Congress include economic stimulus legislation, San Joaquin River restoration, Title 16 projects, Central Valley Project oversight, Bay-Delta restoration, aging infrastructure, and climate variability effects on reservoirs. Congress may address oversight of Reclamation's mission and its role in western water supply, including funding for new rural water projects and water reuse technologies. Critical questions to consider include the agency's focus on water resource management and augmentation of water supplies in the West. The broader issue at hand includes critical questions about the future federal role in water resources development and management, the needs of western water managers from the Bureau, funding for new supply systems, environmental mitigation, and the revamping of existing projects to accommodate changing demands. The issue of whether there should be a National Water Commission or periodic water resource assessments received attention in the 110th Congress, with at least one bill reintroduced in the 111th Congress."
