    "content": "The \"Transportation Low Emissions Energy Plan 2020 Act\" aims to deploy 1,000,000 plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles by 2015. It emphasizes the need for electric recharging infrastructure and uniform standards for deployment. These vehicles offer benefits like emissions reductions and energy grid storage. The \"Transportation Low Emissions Energy Plan 2020 Act\" defines key terms like \"Plan\" as the national transportation low emissions energy plan and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Transportation. The Act also focuses on deploying 1,000,000 plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles by 2015, emphasizing the need for infrastructure and standards. The Secretary will establish a stakeholder-driven process to develop a national transportation low emissions energy plan within 18 months. The plan will project the need for electric vehicle refueling infrastructure, identify infrastructure needs, and aim for strategic deployment by 2020. Stakeholders involved will include heads of other Federal agencies. The Secretary will establish a stakeholder-driven process to develop a national transportation low emissions energy plan within 18 months. The plan will involve various stakeholders such as State and local officials, energy utilities, the vehicles industry, the freight and shipping industry, clean technology firms, the hospitality industry, the restaurant industry, highway rest stop vendors, and other stakeholders as determined by the Secretary. The plan will prioritize the development of standardized public charge access ports with wireless or smart card billing capability, as well as level I and level II charge port systems for electric vehicles. The Secretary will establish a stakeholder-driven process to develop a national transportation low emissions energy plan within 18 months. The plan will prioritize the development of standardized public charge access ports with wireless or smart card billing capability, as well as level I and level II charge port systems for electric vehicles. Additionally, the plan will focus on infrastructure that provides consumers with the lowest cost while providing convenient charge system access. The Secretary may designate a full-time LEEP coordinator within the Department of Transportation to oversee the development and implementation of the Plan, including regional pilot projects. The Secretary will establish a stakeholder-driven process to develop a national transportation low emissions energy plan within 18 months. The plan will prioritize standardized public charge access ports for electric vehicles. Additionally, a full-time LEEP coordinator may be designated to oversee regional pilot projects. The Secretary may establish 4 pilot projects to demonstrate electric drive vehicles and infrastructure in rural locations and commercial use. The projects will be carried out in different regions of the United States, with a focus on rural regions and freight issues. Financial resources will be coordinated for the regional pilot projects. The Secretary will coordinate financial incentives and resources for electric infrastructure delivery entities to participate in regional pilot projects. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to develop the Plan, pay the LEEP coordinator's salary and expenses, and carry out regional pilot projects."
