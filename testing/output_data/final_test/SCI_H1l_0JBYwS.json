    "content": "Spectral embedding is a popular technique for graph data representation, with regularization techniques proposed to improve quality for clustering tasks. This paper explains the impact of complete graph regularization on spectral embedding, showing that it focuses on the largest blocks, making it less sensitive to noise or outliers. Results on synthetic and real data demonstrate improved clustering scores with regularization. The generalized eigenvalue problem involves the spectral decomposition of the normalized Laplacian matrix for graph data representation. Spectral embedding can be seen as equilibrium states of physical systems and is used in modern machine learning, but it may yield poor results on real datasets due to disconnected graphs caused by noise or outliers. Regularization techniques are proposed to improve the quality of graph embeddings by increasing node degrees or adding constants to the adjacency matrix. This enables spectral embedding on large graphs with a sparse + low rank structure. The effects of regularization are explained through graph conductance and eigenvector perturbation, but the benefits remain complex. Graph regularization benefits are complex, but it forces spectral embedding to focus on larger clusters, reducing sensitivity to noise. Eigenvalues are characterized to quantify regularization impact. The paper discusses block models, aggregation, and presents main results in subsequent sections. The paper discusses graph regularization benefits, focusing on larger clusters and reducing noise sensitivity. It introduces block models and presents results on regularization for block models and bipartite graphs. The adjacency matrix A represents an undirected, weighted graph, with nodes partitioned into blocks with the same neighborhood. The adjacency matrix represents the graph with nodes grouped into blocks. The Laplacian matrix of the aggregate graph is derived from the diagonal matrix of block sizes. The solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem can be obtained from the aggregate graph. In the context of a graph with nodes grouped into blocks, the adjacency matrix A is related to the Laplacian matrix L\u03b1. For a regularized graph with added edges, the Laplacian matrix is defined as L\u03b1 = D\u03b1 - A\u03b1. In a block model scenario with disjoint cliques, the adjacency matrix A can be represented as ZZ^T, where Z is the membership matrix. The objective is to show that in this setup, the k-th dimension is significant. The spectral embedding in a graph with nodes grouped into blocks isolates the k \u2212 1 largest cliques using eigenvalues. The Laplacian matrix is positive semi-definite, with eigenvalues \u03bb \u2264 1. Solutions to the generalized eigenvalue problem exist for \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) in block models. The Laplacian matrix in a graph with nodes grouped into blocks is used to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for the aggregate graph. The K smallest eigenvalues satisfy a specific condition involving the eigenvalues and node degrees. The main result of the paper shows that the k \u2212 1 largest cliques of the original graph can be recovered from the spectral embedding of the regularized graph in dimension k. Theorem 1 states that the spectral embedding X of dimension k gives the k \u2212 1 largest blocks of the graph. The spectral embedding X of dimension k gives the k \u2212 1 largest blocks of the graph, with the eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues \u03bb j \u2208 (\u00b5 j\u22121 , \u00b5 j ) having the same sign within blocks. Theorem 1 can be extended to graphs with edges between blocks, allowing for recovery of cliques even with relaxed assumptions on block sizes. The spectral embedding of dimension k recovers the k \u2212 1 largest blocks of the graph, with eigenvectors associated with eigenvalues \u03bb j \u2208 (\u00b5 j\u22121 , \u00b5 j ) having the same sign within blocks. Regularization is crucial as \u03b5 \u2192 0 to prevent the initial graph from becoming disconnected. Degree correction can be achieved by varying node degrees within blocks, leading to a less sensitive spectral embedding. The spectral embedding in dimension k then identifies the k \u2212 1 largest blocks based on normalized weight. The spectral embedding of a bipartite graph can be represented using a biadjacency matrix. The regularization process can involve adding edges between all pairs of nodes or applying regularization directly to the biadjacency matrix. This helps prevent the graph from becoming disconnected and improves the spectral embedding results. The spectral embedding of a bipartite graph is represented by a biadjacency matrix. Regularization involves adding edges or directly applying it to the matrix to prevent disconnection and enhance spectral embedding results. The biadjacency matrix is block-diagonal with all-ones blocks on the diagonal, and the generalized eigenvalue problem is considered for the regularized graph. The eigenvalues associated with the generalized eigenvalue problem are ordered in a specific way. Solutions to the problem have certain properties, and the spectral embedding of dimension k reveals information about the graph's structure. The order of block pairs in the embedding depends on a parameter alpha. The order of block pairs in the spectral embedding depends on parameter alpha, with different values of alpha isolating block pairs based on different criteria. The impact of regularization on spectral embedding quality is illustrated through clustering tasks on synthetic and real datasets, with the first dimension of the embedding skipped as it is not informative. The code for reproducing these experiments is available online. Theoretical results of the paper are illustrated with a toy graph of 3 cliques. Spectral embeddings in dimension 1 isolate the largest cluster with regularization. Datasets used in experiments are described, including a Stochastic Block-Model with specific parameters. The dataset consists of newsgroup posts on 20 topics and a graph of hyperlinks between Wikipedia pages. Various metrics from clustering literature are used, including Homogeneity (H), Completeness (C), and V-measure score (V). Various metrics for evaluating clustering performance are discussed, including Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI), Modularity (Q), and Normalized Standard Deviation (NSD). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of clustering algorithms. The impact of regularization parameters on clustering performance is evaluated using the K-Means algorithm in a dimension 20 embedding space. Results show that regularization generally improves performance, with the optimal parameter value depending on the dataset and score function. The impact of noise on spectral embedding is tested by adding isolated nodes with self loops to the graph. Results show that without regularization, even 1% noise causes a drop in scores, leading to a trivial partition where all initial nodes are in the same cluster. Regularization in spectral embedding makes the embedding robust to noise by focusing on the largest clusters. The benefits of regularization were explained through a simple block model and extended to bipartite graphs. Future work includes exploring the impact of regularization on other tasks like link prediction and studying the effect of the regularization parameter. The impact of the regularization parameter on spectral embedding is explored through theoretical results. The proof of Theorem 2 is provided along with experimental results, showing the equivalence of Proposition 1 and Proposition 2. The generalized singular value problem is discussed, highlighting the relationship between singular vectors and values in the context of block matrices. The generalized singular value problem is equivalent to the generalized SVD of the regularized biadjacency matrix. The singular value \u03c3 = 0 has multiplicity n - K, while the eigenvalue \u03bb = 1 has multiplicity n - K. The eigenvalue 0 has multiplicity 1 due to the connected graph. If (x1, x2) is a pair of singular vectors for \u03c3, then the vectors x = (x1, \u00b1x2) are eigenvectors. The generalized singular value problem for the aggregate graph is discussed, focusing on eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The proof of Lemma 5 involves diagonal matrices and constants, leading to the conclusion. Lemma 6 follows a similar proof to Lemma 3, with threshold values from Lemma 5. Theorem 2 discusses eigenvectors associated with specific eigenvalues and their signs based on block sizes. In this section, experimental results are presented for different values of K in the clustering algorithm. Regularization generally improves clustering performance, with the optimal value of \u03b1 being dataset and metric dependent. For the NG and WS datasets, clustering remains trivial until a certain amount of regularization is applied. Preserving the bipartite structure of the graph leads to slightly better performance. The impact of regularization in the presence of noise for the NG dataset is also discussed. Regularization improves spectral embedding robustness to noise in NG dataset, similar to WS dataset."
