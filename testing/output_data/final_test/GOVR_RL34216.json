    "content": "Recent and projected large deficits have led to interest in proposals to reduce the tax gap and raise additional revenue. One proposal in the 110th Congress involves requiring brokers to report adjusted basis on publicly traded securities sold by individuals. This can help clarify capital gains and potentially increase tax revenue. Adjusted basis is the amount used to determine the cost of acquiring an asset for tax calculations, which may need to be altered from the original cost to account for additional expenses like brokerage fees. The IRS defines the tax gap as the amount of true tax liability not paid voluntarily and timely. For the 2001 tax year, the gross tax gap was $345 billion, reduced to a net tax gap of $290 billion by 2007. Brokers are required to report sales information to the IRS and customers annually. Brokers are currently not required to report adjusted basis to the IRS, limiting the IRS's ability to verify capital gains and losses reported by individuals. While brokers would face significant costs in reporting adjusted basis, taxpayers would benefit from reduced costs in calculating adjusted basis for securities sales. Third-party reporting, according to the IRS, increases voluntary tax compliance. For tax year 2001, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 38% of taxpayers with securities transactions misreported their gains and losses due to inaccurate reporting of basis. The rules for reporting basis are complex, including the \"first-in-first-out rule\" for stock sales. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 38% of taxpayers misreported gains and losses on securities transactions in 2001 due to inaccurate reporting of basis. A proposal to report basis on publicly traded securities was included in the President's FY2008 Budget and discussed in the Senate Finance Committee's draft proposal. The proposal was examined in a hearing on June 29, 2007, with written comments from private financial associations. Legislation in the 110th Congress regarding expanded information reporting to the IRS, including basis reporting on securities, is also described. The U.S. Treasury proposed expanding information reporting to the IRS to include basis reporting on security sales. Brokers would need to report adjusted basis, acquisition/disposition dates, and transfer relevant information to facilitate accurate reporting. Regulatory authority would be granted to implement specific rules and exceptions. The U.S. Treasury proposed expanding information reporting to include basis reporting on security sales. Brokers may be exempt from reporting certain information if unable to obtain it with reasonable efforts. Customers may provide basis information to brokers for transactions producing adjustments when the broker has no other way of knowing. Basis adjustment information applicable to all holders of a security class could be obtained from the issuer or a central repository. The reporting proposal would apply to securities acquired after December 31, 2008, with estimated revenue of $1.035 billion from January 1, 2009, through September 30, 2112. The President's FY2009 Budget proposed expanding information reporting to include basis reporting on security sales. Certain brokers would be required to report adjusted basis information for securities sales, with the IRS and Treasury Department having regulatory authority to implement rules. Acquisition and disposition dates for securities would also need to be reported. The proposed expansion of information reporting includes basis reporting on security sales, requiring brokers to report acquisition and disposition dates for securities to determine gains or losses for taxpayers. Brokers transferring securities must provide relevant information to the transferee, and regulations may establish a regime for customers to provide transaction information to brokers. Basis adjustments applicable to all holders of a particular class of securities would be available to brokers from the issuer. The reporting proposal for securities acquired after December 31, 2009, aims to increase compliance by requiring brokers to report information to the IRS for calculating gains or losses from securities sales. The Treasury estimated revenue of $1.203 billion from 2010 to 2013 and $7.480 billion from 2010 to 2018. The proposal would reduce compliance costs for some taxpayers, increase costs for brokers, and impose significant costs on the IRS. The proposal aims to relieve taxpayers from calculating basis adjustments for securities by requiring brokers to provide this information when securities are sold. This would reduce compliance costs for some taxpayers but increase costs for brokers. The IRS would also incur significant costs for altering forms, processing data, and storing data. The Senate Finance Committee drafted a proposal requiring brokers to report basis information to the IRS and customers for publicly traded securities. Some taxpayers may shift assets to avoid compliance costs, as details on which taxpayers and securities would be subject to reporting requirements are lacking. Extensive testimony and background documents are available for analysis of the draft proposal. The draft proposal from the Senate Finance Committee requires brokers to report customers' adjusted basis and holding period for applicable securities to the IRS. Penalties for non-compliance with reporting requirements remain the same. The proposal applies to securities acquired through various means. The proposal mandates brokers to provide written statements to other brokers with necessary information for new basis and holding period reporting requirements. It also introduces new reporting requirements for issuers affecting the basis of securities acquired after 18 months from enactment. Witnesses at the Senate Finance Committee hearing highlighted the need for brokers to have sufficient time, approximately two years after Treasury regulations are written, to implement the reporting requirements. Witnesses emphasized the need for financial intermediaries to develop new systems for reporting basis, while others would need to reprogram existing systems. The flexibility in reporting methods for basis was highlighted, with suggestions to maintain options like the \"first-in-first-out rule\" or specific identification rule. Some believed that requiring a standard rule like \"first-in-first-out\" would expedite IRS matching purposes. Two witnesses suggested that filing requirements should be based on the date of purchase, and brokers should not be held accountable for errors in data on adjusted basis reports. Some brokers lack basis records and rely on customers or third parties for information. Another witness opposed extending gross proceeds reporting to corporate customers, stating that the Secretary of the Treasury already has the authority to do so. One witness mentioned the need for an electronic system due to the high volume of securities transfers. Two witnesses argued for electronic transmission of transfer data and broad Treasury authority for reporting basis legislation. They suggested specifying issues in legislative language to reduce the need for Treasury discretion. Additionally, two witnesses proposed a two-week deadline extension for filing 1099 statements, as addressed in S. 636, the Reduce Wasteful Tax Forms Act of 2007. The Senate Finance Committee's proposal would significantly increase year-end processing costs for brokers and custodians, necessitating a two-week delay. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress focused on requiring broker reporting of a customer's adjusted basis in securities transactions. Representative Rahm Emanuel introduced H.R. 878, which would mandate broker reporting of customers' adjusted basis in securities transactions, with the Secretary of the Treasury issuing regulations for cases where brokers lack sufficient information. Senator Evan Bayh introduced S. 601 and Representative Charles B. Rangel introduced H.R. 3970, both focusing on broker reporting of customers' adjusted basis in securities transactions to the IRS. The bills aim to simplify reporting requirements and eliminate the individual alternative minimum tax. The bill mandates cost basis reporting by brokers for transactions involving publicly traded securities, including stock, debt, commodities, and derivatives. It applies to securities acquired after specific dates and is estimated to raise $4.27 billion over 10 years. Brokers must report the customer's adjusted basis and whether any gain or loss is long-term or short-term. Transferring brokers must provide a written statement to the transferee broker. The bill mandates cost basis reporting by brokers for publicly traded securities, changing the deadline for furnishing information statements to customers to February 15. Several other bills in the 110th Congress also proposed broker reporting of customers' basis to the IRS. President George W. Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 into law, which included a provision requiring brokers to report customers' adjusted gross basis and capital gains or losses on various assets to the IRS. This reporting provision was estimated to raise $6.67 billion in revenue by September 30, 2018. The initial applicable date for reporting customers' sales of corporate stock was January 1, 2011. The Senate Finance Committee's hearing on June 28, 2007, included representatives from financial associations who provided useful insights in their written comments. The Investment Company Institute emphasized the cost implications of a mandatory basis-reporting regime on fund investors and the need for sufficient time to address programming challenges. They also stressed the importance of maintaining flexibility in computing cost basis for mutual funds and their shareholders. The Investment Company Institute emphasized the importance of maintaining flexibility in computing cost basis for mutual funds and their shareholders, as well as the need for sufficient lead time to program systems for providing cost basis information to all shareholders. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) emphasized the need for flexibility in computing cost basis for mutual funds and shareholders. They recommended that filing requirements be prospective based on the date of purchase if cost basis data is not reported. The ICI also addressed complex recording issues related to internal transfers of shares in mutual funds and suggested that electronic transmittal could meet the written statement requirement for data on stock transfers. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) made five major recommendations. SIFMA strongly opposes extending gross proceeds reporting to corporate customers and recommends dropping the proposal. They recommend granting the Secretary of the Treasury broad regulatory authority to implement new reporting requirements and provide safe harbors. The new reporting regulations should be effective for securities acquired 18 months after Treasury regulations are finalized. The Clearing House Association L.L.C. expressed concerns about the Senate Finance Committee's Basis Reporting Proposal, stating that it would greatly increase year-end processing for brokers and custodians. They recommended incorporating S. 636 to delay the filing deadline for 1099 statements by two weeks. The Clearing House opposes the Senate Finance Committee's Basis Reporting Proposal, citing prohibitive costs and impracticality for financial institutions to report gross proceeds for securities sold by corporate customers. They argue that implementing this requirement would result in mismatches in reporting figures to the IRS and corporate customers, with no foreseeable benefit. Additionally, they claim that reporting adjusted basis and holding period information for certain securities would be challenging. The Clearing House opposes the Basis Reporting Proposal, stating that the requirement for transferring securities to brokers is inefficient, burdensome, and error-prone. They argue that a paper transfer system would be impractical due to the volume of transfers, advocating for an electronic system instead. Large banks would need to develop new information systems, causing delays. They propose a compliance effective date of either three years after the law's passage or two years after finalizing relevant Treasury regulations. The American Bankers Association (ABA) opposes the Basis Reporting Proposal, stating that banks serving in fiduciary capacities may not have direct access to necessary information for filing requirements. They argue that banks should receive information from Form 1099-B filers and be able to rely on third-party information without penalty. The ABA suggests the proposal be effective prospectively with sufficient implementation time. The ABA opposes the Basis Reporting Proposal, suggesting banks should receive necessary information from Form 1099-B filers without penalty. They recommend the proposal be effective prospectively with sufficient implementation time. The NAREIT requests brokers and mutual funds be given an additional two weeks to report dividend income to taxpayers on IRS Form 1099-DIV."
