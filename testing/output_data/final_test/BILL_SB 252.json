    "title": "SB 252",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 48412 of the Education Code is amended to allow persons 16 years or older, or in 10th grade for one academic year, to verify basic skills proficiency for a \"certificate of proficiency\" equivalent to a high school diploma. The State Department of Education will establish criteria for verification. The department will develop competency standards in basic skills taught in public high schools and conduct regular examinations in the fall and spring semesters to verify competency. Exams will be held on dates determined by the department to allow for timely notification of results before the semester ends in most school districts. The department may conduct examinations during summer recess or at other times as needed for eligible persons with religious convictions or physical handicaps. The department may charge a fee for examination applications to cover costs, not exceeding the cost of test renewal. Fees collected will be used for department expenses, with excess funds transferred to the General Fund. Examinees who qualify as homeless children or youth are exempt from the fee. The examinee must be under 25 years old for the scheduled examination and can prove their status as a homeless child or youth through a homeless services provider. The state board will establish rules for implementing this section. The state board will adopt emergency regulations to implement the provisions for homeless youth taking high school proficiency tests. The department will review the effectiveness of the examinations, with costs recovered through fees. The Superintendent will submit a report on the number of homeless youth taking the test in 2016-2018 by December 1, 2018. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of waiving fees for high school proficiency tests for homeless youth, estimated number of homeless youth taking the test in future years, recommendations for funding, administrative costs, and reimbursement to contractors. It also mentions the inoperative date for a report submission requirement and prohibits additional state funds for implementation. The Superintendent may charge a one-time fee for test registration, not exceeding $20 per person, to cover administration costs. Examinees must request duplicate certificates and result reports. Section 51421.5 of the Education Code prohibits contractors or testing centers from charging fees to examinees who are homeless youth under 25 years old and can verify their status through a homeless services provider. State funds will not be allocated for implementing the section that defines a \"homeless services provider\" as listed in the Health and Safety Code or any other entity qualified to verify housing status. The Superintendent may use surplus funds from the Special Deposit Fund Account to reimburse contractors for lost fees related to implementing the section. A contract for examinations must require acceptance of all examinees, including fee waiver recipients. The Superintendent must submit a report to the Legislature's committees by December 1, 2018. The Superintendent may use surplus funds to reimburse contractors for lost fees related to implementing the section. Recommendations for a permanent funding source to cover waived fees and projected administrative costs are included. Emergency regulations will be adopted for immediate implementation. The department will include a provision in memorandums of understanding with contractors for high school equivalency tests to absorb ongoing costs of fee waivers if surplus funds are depleted. Section 51421.5 of the Education Code prohibits contractors from charging fees to examinees who meet specific criteria. The provision allows homeless youth under 25 to receive fee waivers for high school equivalency tests. Verification of homeless status can be done by a homeless services provider. No additional state funds will be allocated for this purpose. The Superintendent will adopt emergency regulations for implementing fee waivers for high school equivalency tests for homeless youth. If surplus funds are depleted, ongoing costs will be absorbed by contractors. Effective July 1, 2019."
