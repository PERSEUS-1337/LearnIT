    "content": "The Act titled \"Child Opportunity Zone Family Center Act of 2000\" amends Title XI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to focus on coordinated services. Congress finds that growing numbers of children are harmed by influences outside of the classroom, such as poor nutrition, unsafe living conditions, abuse, violence, lack of healthcare, unemployment, and substance abuse. These factors negatively affect a child's ability to learn, and parents/caregivers often face heavy demands that impact their ability to meet all their children's needs. Access to health and social service programs in school-based community centers can help families address these challenges. Access to convenient and integrated services in school-based community centers can help families address the diverse needs of children and parents, including education, health, mental health, safety, and economic well-being.

The purpose of establishing child opportunity zone family centers near schools is to provide coordinated services that improve education, health, mental health, safety, and economic well-being of students. \"SEC. 11002.
