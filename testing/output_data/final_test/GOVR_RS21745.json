    "content": "The Sunni-Shiite differences stem from disagreements over the succession of Prophet Muhammad and leadership in the Muslim community. Initially, Abu Bakr was elected as the first caliph, but some supported Ali ibn Abi Talib. Ali's followers found his bypassing unacceptable. Some of Ali's followers believed that Abu Bakr and the succeeding caliphs were illegitimate, as they thought Ali was named as successor by Prophet Muhammad. Ali became caliph after the murder of Uthman, but was later assassinated. His son Hussein died in battle against Sunni forces. Ali's supporters became known as Shi'a, while others accepted his caliphate but opposed succession based on bloodline. The Sunni group, majority of Muslims, followed political succession based on bloodline to the Prophet. The caliphate declined as a religious and political institution after the 13th century, abolished in 1924 by Turkey's first President Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Sunni Islamist activists viewed the decline and abolition of the caliphate as a powerful symbol, advocating for a new caliphate based on \"pure\" Islamic principles. Some contemporary Sunni Islamist extremists, like Osama bin Laden, support the restoration of a new caliphate. The global Muslim community's diversity poses challenges to centralized Islamic leadership. Terrorism and violence among Muslims are often driven by political, social, and economic factors rather than theological differences. Sunni and Shiite groups may collaborate based on shared interests, but sectarian hatred can also fuel violence and hinder cross-sectarian cooperation. Members and supporters of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda exhibit regional and theological diversity, making it hard to identify shared motives. Sunni and Shiite Muslims refer to them as takfiris for denouncing those who don't accept their narrow interpretation of Sunni Islam. Despite differences, both sects share common traditions and beliefs in Islam. Islamic belief and practice revolve around abiding by revelations given to the Prophet by Allah and the hadith. Muslims follow the five pillars of Islam, including reciting the creed, praying five times a day, giving alms, fasting during Ramadan, and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Quran, sunna, hadith, qiyas, and ijma are the basic sources for Islamic jurisprudence. The primary function of religious leaders in Islam is to interpret Islamic law (shari'a) using sources like hadith, qiyas, ijma', and ijtihad. Sunni and Shiite Islam do not have codified laws but rely on similar sources for legal interpretation. Shiite hadith include sayings of divinely inspired imams, allowing more human reasoning in legal interpretation compared to Sunni. Sunnis believe in selecting the Muslim community leader based on communal consensus. The selection of the imam in the Muslim community is based on communal consensus, political order, and individual merits. Sunni Muslims do not elevate human beings to the status of prophets like Shiites do. Sunni Islam has a less elaborate religious hierarchy and allows lay persons to serve as prayer leaders. Sunnis and Shiites have subtle differences in their prayer practices but share a similar understanding of basic Islamic beliefs. Within Sunni Islam, there are four schools of jurisprudence offering alternatives. The four schools of jurisprudence in Sunni Islam offer alternative interpretations of legal decisions based on analogy and the sayings of the Prophet. In some secular countries, religious scholars' opinions serve as moral guidelines for Muslims. The four legal schools vary in their interpretations, including the Hanafi school founded by Abu Hanifa and prevalent in various regions, and the Maliki school founded by Malik ibn Anas in the Arabian Peninsula. Sunni Islam is divided into four main schools of jurisprudence: Hanafi, Maliki, Shaf'i, and Hanbali. These schools have different founders and are prevalent in various regions such as North Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia. The Ibadi sect, often mistaken as Sunni, is centered in Oman and East Africa, with beliefs similar to Sunni doctrine but distinct in its own right. Salafism and Wahhabism are Sunni puritanical movements seeking to purify Islamic practices. Salafism encompasses various positions on political and social issues, while Wahhabism is associated with Saudi Arabia's religious establishment. Both movements have politically quietist and extremist factions. \"Wahhabism, founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab, promotes a return to orthodox Islamic practices based on the Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad. It formed an alliance with the Saudi ruling family in the 18th century, leading to a close relationship. Wahhabism views Shiites and non-Wahhabi Muslims as heretics, with conservative interpretations. This movement gained prominence after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Shiite Islamic revolution in Iran.\" Saudi Arabia's ruling Sunni royal family began promoting their religious doctrine abroad after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and Shiite Islamic revolution in Iran. They have financed the construction of mosques, schools, and Islamic centers in many countries. The content of Saudi-funded programs varies from apolitical to activist, with many observers referring to them as \"Wahhabi.\" Non-Saudi Salafis are often labeled as \"Wahhabi\" by others, despite potential differences in ideology. Shiite Islam, practiced by 10-15% of Muslims worldwide, follows Ali as the first true leader. Imams, descendants of Ali, hold spiritual knowledge and leadership roles in the Shiite community. Shiite beliefs center around spiritual and political leadership passed down from Ali to imams. Imams focused on developing spirituality as Shiites lost political battles with Sunni rulers. When the line of imams ended, mujtahids gained the right to interpret religious knowledge, with the most learned known as ayatollahs. Shiite religious practice revolves around the remembrance of Hussein, martyred near Karbala, commemorated annually on Ashura. The Ashura ritual is a somber remembrance among Shiites, reinforcing religious traditions and practices. Twelver Shiism, prevalent in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, and Bahrain, follows a line of 12 infallible imams descended from Ali. The 12th imam, believed to have disappeared in the ninth century, is expected to return to lead the community. In the 20th century, a new \"activist\" trend emerged among Twelver Shiites in Iran and Lebanon, led by Ayatollah Khomeini. Ismailis, the second-largest Shiite sect, recognize only the first seven imams and historically pursued military and territorial power, establishing powerful ruling states. Today, Ismailis are scattered worldwide. The Ismailis, Zaydis, Alawites, and Druzes are sects of Shiite Islam with distinct beliefs and practices. Ismailis are prominent in Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan, while Zaydis are mostly found in Yemen. Alawites exist in Syria and Lebanon, with an eclectic mix of Christian and Islamic traditions. The Alevi in Turkey are an offshoot group with unique beliefs. The Alevi in Turkey and the Druze community are offshoot groups of Shiite Islam with unique beliefs. The Alevi are often confused with other Shiites but are well-integrated into Turkish society, speaking both Turkish and Kurdish. The Druze, originating in the 11th century, are concentrated in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Israel, with a faith that differs considerably from mainstream Shiite Islam."
