The Office of Employment Discrimination Complaints Resolution handles informal complaint resolution and investigates complaints. Final agency decisions can be reviewed, and unlawful employment discrimination is defined under this chapter. The Office of Employment Discrimination Complaints Resolution, as outlined in Chapter 8 of Title 38, handles informal complaint resolution and investigates complaints related to employment actions. This chapter does not supersede employees' rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act or their ability to raise discrimination allegations under collective bargaining agreements. The Office of Employment Discrimination Complaints Resolution, headed by a Director reporting to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, administers procedures for resolving complaints of unlawful employment discrimination within the Department. The Director also performs other functions as prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary employs administrative law judges within the Office for this purpose and other necessary personnel. The Secretary appoints administrative law judges considering diversity factors. The Director must have adequate resources. Detailed budget information must be included in documents submitted to Congress. The Director must provide a report on the Office's activities, including the number and nature of discrimination complaints received and resolved, timeliness of resolutions, and significant decisions and trends. The Director is also responsible for prescribing regulations. The Director is responsible for prescribing standards of timeliness, qualifications, training requirements, record-keeping, and conduct of investigations for the Office. Regulations must be consistent with those of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but shorter time periods may be prescribed for expeditious complaint resolution. The Office is responsible for counseling employees and applicants alleging unlawful employment discrimination. Complaints are resolved through informal investigation and conciliation. Unresolved complaints are assigned to an administrative law judge for further investigation. The administrative law judge determines if a complaint should be accepted for investigation. If the complaint is without merit, it may not be accepted. If accepted, the Director arranges for an investigation by Office employees or contractors, who then submit a written report of the results. The Director receives a written report of investigation results. If only a portion of a complaint is accepted, the investigation of the accepted portion may be suspended. The investigative report is shared with the administrative law judge, the complainant, and the Secretary. The judge can order additional investigation if needed. Final agency decisions and hearings are conducted for complaints of unlawful actions. The final agency decision on a complaint of unlawful employment discrimination is made by an administrative law judge if not resolved informally. The individual filing the complaint can request a hearing, which the judge will grant unless there is no genuine dispute on a material fact. The judge may conduct the hearing or refer it to a hearing examiner. Sec. 806. Review of final agency decisions allows individuals to appeal adverse decisions on unlawful employment discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or file a case in the appropriate US district court. The Secretary can also appeal adverse decisions within 30 days. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can act on appeals of unlawful employment discrimination within 30 days. Unlawful employment discrimination is defined as violations of specific laws including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Title 38, United States Code, is amended by inserting a new item after chapter 7. SEC. 3. TRANSITION. Chapter 8 of title 38, United States Code, added by section 2, applies to complaints of employment discrimination filed after a six-month period from the enactment of this Act.
