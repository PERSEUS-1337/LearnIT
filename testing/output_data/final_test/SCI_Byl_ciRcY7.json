    "content": "In machine learning, there is a belief that increasing margins over training data helps prevent overfitting. However, Breiman's dilemma challenges this notion, showing that improving margin distribution does not always reduce generalization error. This paper revisits Breiman's dilemma in deep neural networks using normalized margins. The dilemma is found to be related to the dynamics of normalized margin distributions, reflecting a trade-off between model expression power and data complexity. Efficient ways are derived to predict trends when data complexity is similar to model expression power. Efficient ways are derived to predict trends in generalization error by analyzing normalized margins in deep neural networks. Over-expressed models that uniformly improve training margins may lose predictive power and lead to overfitting. Margin, a key measurement in machine learning, characterizes classifier robustness and performance. It has historical significance in algorithms like perceptron and support vector machines. AdaBoost, an ensemble algorithm, shows resistance to overfitting by maintaining generalization error as training error decreases. Explanation for this resistance lies in the improvement of classification margins during boosting. The process focuses on improving classification margins in boosting algorithms, with a recent resurgence in margin theory in deep neural networks. However, enhancing margin distributions does not always lead to better generalization performance, as demonstrated by Breiman's algorithm arc-gv compared to AdaBoost. Breiman's dilemma highlights the challenge of balancing margin distributions and generalization error in boosting algorithms. Further research explores the limitations of margin theory in boosting, suggesting that maximizing margins may not always control model complexity effectively. In this paper, the authors revisit Breiman's dilemma in the context of deep neural networks. They analyze the normalized margin based bounds on generalization error using a 5-layer CNN trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results show overfitting occurring after about 10 epochs, despite the training error dropping to zero. The study revisits Breiman's dilemma in deep neural networks, analyzing normalized margin distributions to predict overfitting. Large margin dynamics around 10 epochs can forecast generalization error tendencies, aiding in early stopping to prevent overfitting. Increasing the channel number to c = 400 with about 5.8M parameters is also discussed. The study discusses Breiman's dilemma in deep neural networks, analyzing normalized margin distributions to predict overfitting. Increasing the channel number to c = 400 with about 5.8M parameters shows a similar overfitting phenomenon in generalization error. The key insight is the trade-off between model expression power and dataset complexity to endorse margin bounds and prediction power.

The analysis focuses on normalized margin distributions to predict overfitting, highlighting the relationship between training and test margins. Theorems 1 and 2 illustrate how phase transitions in margin distributions impact generalization error prediction and the use of quantile margins for better prediction power. Breiman's dilemma may occur when training and test margins undergo different phase transitions, leading to overfitting. Section 2 describes the method to derive linear inequalities for generalization bounds.

It emphasizes balancing these factors for predictability and avoiding Breiman's dilemma. Section 2 describes the method to derive linear inequalities for generalization bounds, with extensive experimental results using various datasets and neural networks. The study focuses on the Lipschitz bounded operators in neural networks, using ReLU activation and defining hypothesis mapping. It introduces the concept of margin error and ramp loss for prediction confidence evaluation. The study introduces the concept of margin error and ramp loss for prediction confidence evaluation, focusing on Lipschitz bounded operators in neural networks using ReLU activation. The central question is whether a proper upper bound can be found to predict the generalization error tendency during training, allowing for early stopping. The answer is both yes and no, as shown in Lemma 2.1 for multi-label classification. The study discusses the Rademacher complexity of function classes in neural networks with ReLU activation functions. It addresses the scaling problem and provides a lower bound for the Rademacher complexity term. The proposition highlights the behavior of the complexity term as the Lipschitz constant approaches infinity. Additionally, it mentions the behavior of estimator weights in logistic regression and general boosting algorithms when data is linearly separable. The study discusses the Rademacher complexity of function classes in neural networks with ReLU activation functions. It addresses the scaling problem and provides a lower bound for the Rademacher complexity term. The input of the last layer in a deep neural network is viewed as features extracted from the original input, and training the last layer is like logistic regression. The hypothesis space has no upper bound on L, and the complexity term Rn(HL) is computationally intractable. Normalizing the network helps address this issue. The Lipschitz semi-norm of a network is approximated by upper bound estimates, avoiding scaling and complexity computation issues. Theorem 1 provides a method to predict generalization error using training margin error of the normalized network. This approach bounds the normalized test margin distribution. The study investigates the relationship between training margin error and generalization error in normalized networks. By choosing appropriate parameters, the training margin error can predict the trend of generalization error. The results show that there exists a parameter \u03b3 that successfully captures this relationship on the CIFAR10 dataset. The key point is to prevent the complexity term of the normalized network from going to infinity by normalizing with a constant. However, it is questioned whether a reasonable \u03b3 with prediction power exists. The training margin error may fail to detect the minimum of generalization error when the network structure becomes complex enough, leading to potential overfitting. The key point is to prevent overfitting by questioning the existence of a reasonable \u03b3 with prediction power. The training margin error may fail to detect the minimum of generalization error when the network structure becomes complex enough. Theorem 2 introduces the concept of quantile margin \u03b3 q,f for a trade-off in choosing \u03b3. The text discusses the importance of choosing a quantile q \u2208 [0, 1] to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It highlights the relationship between \u03b3 q,t and \u03c4, emphasizing the trade-off in selecting \u03b3. The choice of q \u2265 0.9 is recommended for practical applications. The text introduces the importance of selecting a quantile q \u2265 0.9 to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It discusses the trade-off between large and small margins in improving generalization performance. The network and dataset used in the experiments include a basic CNN structure and more practical networks like AlexNet, VGGNet-16, and ResNet-18. The experiments involve using different network structures like AlexNet, VGGNet-16, and ResNet-18 with datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Mini-ImageNet to predict generalization error tendencies. The results show that linear bounds can effectively predict when sufficient training is reached or when overfitting occurs, based on margin error and quantile margin. In the experiments, different network structures like AlexNet, VGGNet-16, and ResNet-18 were used with datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Mini-ImageNet to predict generalization error tendencies. Linear bounds effectively predict training sufficiency and overfitting based on margin error and quantile margin. Training margin error and inverse quantile margin successfully predict generalization error tendencies. The training margin error and inverse quantile margin are closely related to the dynamics of training margin distributions. The dynamics of quantile margins can adaptively select \u03b3 for each epoch without access to the complexity term, showing stronger prediction power than fixed \u03b3. Generalization error curve has two valleys corresponding to local and global optima. In this section, the dynamics of training margin errors are explored with over-parameterized models. Experiments are conducted with increasing channel numbers in a CIFAR10 dataset, showing a transition from phase transition to monotone improvement in margin distributions. The text discusses the transition from phase transition to monotone improvement in margin distributions with over-parameterized models. It also highlights the rank correlations of dynamics between training and test margin errors for different CNN models. Additionally, it compares the normalized margin dynamics of training CNN(400) and ResNet18 on CIFAR100 and Mini-ImageNet datasets, showing a phase transition in the former. The training margin dynamics exhibit a phase transition, sacrificing large margins to improve small margins during training. ResNet18 shows over-representation power on CIFAR100 with a monotone improvement on training margins, but loses this power in Mini-ImageNet due to phase transitions in margin dynamics. This phenomenon is similar to Breiman's findings on boosting algorithms, where improving training margins does not guarantee small generalization error. In this study, the complexity of datasets was explored in relation to margin dynamics using ResNet18 as an example. While CIFAR100 did not show a phase transition, Mini-Imagenet exhibited a crossover. The choice of normalization factor estimates was noted to impact predictability range, with more accurate estimations extending this range. However, Breiman's dilemma persists when the balance between model expression power and dataset complexity is disrupted. Further experiments on this topic can be found in the appendix. In this paper, Breiman's dilemma in deep learning is discussed, along with its relation to the tradeoff between model expression power and data complexity. A new perspective on phase transitions in Lipschitz-normalized margin distributions is proposed. The importance of Lipschitz semi-norm in normalizing neural networks is highlighted, with a focus on estimating the Lipschitz constant bound. The text discusses estimating the Lipschitz constant bound for a convolutional operator with a kernel. Two methods are presented: using the 1-norm of the kernels as an upper bound and utilizing power iterations for a fast approximation of the spectral norm. Both methods have implications for generalization error prediction. In this section, the text focuses on estimating the upper bound of operator or spectral norm for ResNets. ResNet is composed of basic blocks with a shortcut structure. Batch normalization (BN) is used to rescale the input, and the rescaled operator for the convolution layer is calculated. The Lipschitz constants for activation and pooling can be determined beforehand. In ResNets, the Lipschitz constants for activation and pooling can be known beforehand. The shortcut structure in the basic blocks of ResNets requires separate treatment for the mainstream and shortcut paths. The Lipschitz upper bound is determined using spectral norm estimates of BN-rescaled convolutional operators. The training margin distribution improves uniformly after the first local minimum, leading to enhanced generalization without reducing error. The inverse quantile margin does not accurately reflect the global trend of generalization error. The inverse quantile margin may not accurately reflect the global trend of generalization error, but it can still indicate local tendencies. Lemma D.1 states that for bounded-value functions, with high probability, the Rademacher Complexity of the function class can be determined. The proof includes McDiarmid's inequality and Rademacher complexity to show that a certain function is a bounded difference function. The proof involves McDiarmid's inequality and Rademacher complexity to show that a function is a bounded difference function. Additionally, a contraction inequality for Lipschitz functions is introduced, along with a lemma to bound the Rademacher complexity term. The lemma BID8 bounds the Rademacher complexity term of R n (G) by R n (H). The proof involves assuming L \u03c3i = 1, showing that for each linear function in T (L/2), there exists a function in F with a certain property. Theorem 1 considers a normalized network and its relationship with a certain function. The lemma BID8 bounds the Rademacher complexity term of R n (G) by R n (H). The proof involves assuming L \u03c3i = 1, showing that for each linear function in T (L/2), there exists a function in F with a certain property. Theorem 1 considers a normalized network and its relationship with a certain function. Then, for any \u03b3 2 > \u03b3 1 \u2265 0, the proof of Theorem 2 shows the upper bound of the normalized margin and quantile margin for the network. The lemma BID8 bounds the Rademacher complexity term of R n (G) by R n (H). The proof involves assuming L \u03c3i = 1, showing that for each linear function in T (L/2), there exists a function in F with a certain property. Theorem 1 considers a normalized network and its relationship with a certain function. Then, for any \u03b3 2 > \u03b3 1 \u2265 0, the proof of Theorem 2 shows the upper bound of the normalized margin and quantile margin for the network. Therefore, \u03b6(f (x), y) \u2264 2 f (x) 2 = 2(M + L) =: M 1, and the quantile margin is also bounded \u03b3 q,t \u2264 M 1 for all q \u2208 (0, 1), t = 1, . . . , T. The remaining proof involves taking a sequence of k and \u03b3 k, and considering the probability for none of A k occurs. Fixing a q \u2208 [0, 1], for any t = 1, . . . , T, as long as \u03b3 q,t > 0, there exists a k \u2265 1 such that \u03b3k +1 \u2264 \u03b3 q,t < \u03b3k. The proof involves inequalities and transformations to conclude the result by transforming to \u03b4."
