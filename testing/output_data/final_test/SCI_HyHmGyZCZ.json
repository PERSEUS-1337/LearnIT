    "content": "Distributional Semantics Models derive word space from linguistic items in context by defining a distance measure between vectors corresponding to lexical entities. This work focuses on improving word embeddings and introduces a novel similarity metric applied on top of the word embeddings. Two methods for post-processing improvements to the baseline DSM vectors are compared: the counter-fitting method enforces antonymy and synonymy constraints, showing improved capability for judging semantic similarity, and the RESM method applies hubness reduction and relational knowledge to GloVe baseline vectors, providing a new ranking similarity definition. The study compares different methods for improving word embeddings, with the Paragram and cosine retrofitting method showing state-of-the-art results for the SIMLEX-999 gold standard. Counter-fitting corrects hubness, and relational knowledge is more crucial for semantic similarity than sense determination. Paragram hyperparameters are tailored to SIMLEX-999. The study highlights the importance of correcting word embeddings, with Paragram and cosine retrofitting methods showing superior results on the SIMLEX-999 gold standard. Many adjustments to word embeddings are necessary, and models with more parameters and hyperparameters tend to perform better. Distributional language models, like BID14 and BID19, use word embedding algorithms to measure word similarity. The cosine measure is commonly used, but ranking-based functions can outperform it. However, distributional models have limitations in achieving state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we address weaknesses in word embedding models by introducing post-process enhancement techniques. We define a novel similarity measure for language models, where similarity is inversely related to distance. The Euclidean distance is commonly used to measure similarity between words and their corresponding vectors. The text discusses different definitions of distance, including Euclidean and angular definitions, and compares cosine similarity to a measure of distance for high dimensional spaces. It mentions using three gold standards for evaluation: TOEFL, ESL, and SIMLEX-999. Other benchmarks like WS-353 and MEN do not measure model ability to reflect similarity. State-of-the-art models have reached human annotator performance on these evaluations. In information retrieval, document similarity can be expressed using ranking, requiring a rank similarity measure. BID25 introduced APSyn, a ranking-based similarity function that outperformed cosine similarity on ESL and TOEFL datasets. The RESM method was motivated by the NDCG measure for IR evaluation. BID12 investigated using context vectors in addition to word vectors from GloVe's output, leading to a different interpretation of their effect on cosine similarity. The best BID12 result for SIMLEX-999 is 0.438, slightly worse than Paragram Wieting et al. (2015) for WordSim-353 similarity and relatedness. The method of retrofitting word embeddings with synonymy relation information from WordNet and the Paraphrase Database 1.0 was successful in enhancing word embeddings. Hubness reduction, which addresses the concentration of distances in high-dimensional vector spaces, was also addressed by using ranking instead of similarity. This method requires more unlabeled source space data and is useful for cross-language or cross-modal applications.

Hubness reduction was addressed by using ranking instead of similarity, useful for cross-language or cross-modal applications. The Paragram vectors were further improved by joint retro-fitting and counter-fitting optimization. The language model is defined as a set of word representations, with each word represented by a vector. The algorithm presented focuses on obtaining optimized similarity measures for word embeddings in a vector space model. It involves refining the vector space, obtaining centroids, recalculating vectors, and using a ranking-based similarity function. The cosine retrofit algorithm is used to enhance word embeddings by considering cosine distance. The retrofit algorithm enhances word embeddings in a vector space model by using cosine distance and rotations of retrofitted vectors. It achieves significant improvement over the baseline method and includes post-process modifications to redefine the similarity measure. A lexicon of relations is defined to incorporate synonym knowledge into the model. The retrofit method improves word embeddings by moving vectors towards an average synonym using rotations in spherical space, preserving angular distance. Rotation matrices are used to calculate angles between words and their related words. The retrofit method improves word embeddings by rotating vectors towards average synonyms in spherical space, preserving angular distance. This method, known as generalized retrofitting, involves applying rotations to words and their related vectors, and taking an average of the original word vector and the rotated, related vector. Additionally, a localized centering approach is used to address hubness in high dimensional spaces by calculating centroids as the average vectors of k nearest neighbors for each vector. The authors in BID4 highlighted the connection between space skewness and vector hubness. Following the approach in BID7, vectors are recalculated using a specific formula. An empirical method is used to determine the hyperparameter gamma. A component ranking function is proposed as the similarity measure, based on the APSyn ranking function introduced in BID25. The vector v i is defined as a list of components, with the ranking r i obtained by sorting the list in descending order. APSyn is calculated based on the N components with the highest score. The APSyn similarity measure is calculated based on the N components with the highest score. Negative values of components are considered, and a ranking based similarity function is defined to preserve cosine properties. Parameters k and d determine the weighting and dimensionality of the space, with high k values emphasizing the most influential component for maximizing information gain. This measure is similar to infAP and infNDCG measures used in information retrieval. The Ranking based Exponential Similarity Measure (RESM) assigns equal weight to the top 10 results, with lower k values increasing the impact of lower ranked components. Polysemy is addressed through a differential analysis process, where the sense of words is discovered by analyzing their contexts. The RESM equation is similar to the cosine function. The RESM equation, similar to cosine function, scales with context and is used for ESL and TOEFL tests. The algorithm is implemented in C# and available for evaluation. Answering tests involves selecting from multiple choice candidates, not the entire dictionary. The RESM equation, similar to cosine function, scales with context and is used for ESL and TOEFL tests. The algorithm is implemented in C# and available for evaluation. Answering tests involves selecting from multiple choice candidates, not the entire dictionary. TOEFL and ESL are less demanding than SIMLEX-999. A question example in TAB0 highlights the problem of selecting the correct answer based on building materials. Differential analysis in similarity measure is applied using the unmodified vector space model trained on 840 billion words from Common Crawl data with the GloVe algorithm. The model consists of 2.2 million unique vectors with 300 components each. The model can be obtained via the GloVe authors website. GloVe refinement enriched with PPDB 1.0 relations called Paragram BID27 is also used. The paper discusses experiments with different methods for hubness reduction in ESL tests. The methods include localized centering (HR), retrofitting with a Paraphrase Database lexicon (RETRO), and cosine retrofitting (cosRETRO). While hubness reduction did not increase the number of correct answers, it improved the average rank of the correct answer. Combining results with and without localized centering yielded better outcomes. The heuristic method improved results by combining answers with and without localized centering. Semantic distributional methods operate on words or characters, with a major deficiency in rare word senses. Counter-fitting did not improve high-error word pairs in the SIMLEX-999 dataset. Pilehvar & Navigli's approach in sense recognition systems is based on WordNet's semantic network without pre-trained word embeddings. The DECONF method improved accuracy results for MEN-3K and RG-65 using word embeddings. Significant improvements were seen in TOEFL and ESL test sets, with the largest improvement in TOEFL test set using localized centering. Changing the similarity measure to RESM yielded the best results for the ESL question set. Each step of the algorithm contributed to enhancing the results, with varying significance depending on the test set. The results for APSyn ranking method using Glove vectors are presented in TAB3. Paragram with counter-fitting outperforms inter-annotator agreement for SIMLEX-999. Results for TOEFL and SIMLEX-999 in BID10 show lower accuracies. This work compares word embedding methods for TOEFL, ESL, and SIMLEX-999, with Paragram showing better results for SIMLEX-999. The Paragram with Counter-fitting method outperforms Glove based methods for SIMLEX-999. It achieves results similar to Paragram with Counter-fitting using cosine retrofitting. The method's success is attributed to its hyperparameters, as seen in TAB0 at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03487.pdf. The Spearman \u03c1 values for Paragram300 fitted to WS353 and SIMLEX-999 are 0.667 and 0.685, respectively. For WS-353, the values are 0.769 and 0.720. However, word embedding methods still lag behind dedicated methods for TOEFL and ESL, as shown in the work of BID13. The paper introduces lightweight techniques that significantly boost the performance of language models, particularly in semantic tasks like Semantic Textual Similarity and Multilingual Word Similarity. These techniques can also be applied to tasks like Community Question Answering and information retrieval systems. In this work, the idea of adding synonyms and similar terms to query terms before pseudo-relevance feedback is explored for query expansion in IR systems. Two categories of expansion methods are discussed: ontologies/lexicons and word embedding. Precision and accuracy of retrieval may deteriorate if closed words for expansion are not precise. Suggestions for improving similarity results include using multi-language methods, PPDB 2.0 for Paragram vectors, multi-sense methods, and recalibrating annotation results. To improve similarity results, recalibrate annotation results using state-of-the-art techniques."
