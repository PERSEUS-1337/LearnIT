    "content": "The federal government's debt is subject to a statutory limit set in 31 U.S.C. 3101(b), which Congress adjusts or suspends through legislation. Recently, legislation has suspended the debt limit with an increase made administratively at the end of the suspension period. The House adopted a rule at the beginning of the 116th Congress to automatically pass legislation suspending the debt limit when adopting the budget resolution. The House rule, similar to the \"Gephardt rule,\" allows for consideration of debt limit legislation without the new debt limit rule. The Senate does not have a comparable procedure. The report explains the current House debt limit rule and the legislative history of the former Gephardt rule. The House Rule XXVIII requires automatic engrossment and transmission of a joint resolution suspending the public debt limit when the House adopts the budget resolution. The new House debt limit rule differs from the former rule in timing and content. The new House debt limit legislation would suspend the debt limit without setting a specific new limit, allowing for flexibility in federal collections and past obligations. This rule does not affect the House Ways and Means Committee's jurisdiction over debt limit legislation. The Gephardt rule, established by P.L. 96-78, initially codified as Rule XLIX, provided for a temporary increase in the public debt. The House adopted legislation (H.R. 5369) to temporarily increase the public debt limit by a vote of 219-198 on September 26, 1979. The Gephardt rule aims to streamline the process of raising the public debt limit by incorporating it into the annual budget resolution, reducing time and votes required. The budget resolution sets the appropriate level of public debt but does not become law, necessitating subsequent legislation to change the statutory limit. The Gephardt rule streamlines the process of raising the public debt limit by combining it with the budget resolution. Originally requiring a joint resolution to change the temporary debt limit, it was later amended to reflect the permanent statutory limit. This change was made through H.Res. 241 in the 98th Congress. The Gephardt rule was modified to include a change to the permanent statutory debt limit. It was further amended to engross only one joint resolution with the current fiscal year's debt limit and the next fiscal year's limit as permanent. Representative Butler C. Derrick explained the rationale behind this change during the consideration of H.Res. 241 in the 98th Congress. The House reinstated the automatic engrossing process as Rule XXVII in the 108th Congress, which was later redesignated as Rule XXVIII in the 110th Congress. The rule was repealed at the beginning of the 112th Congress but was restored and revised more recently. The House reinstated the automatic engrossing process as Rule XXVII in the 108th Congress, later redesignated as Rule XXVIII in the 110th Congress. The rule was repealed at the beginning of the 112th Congress but was restored and revised in the 116th Congress. Table 1 provides information on joint resolutions changing the public debt limit engrossed and deemed passed by the House pursuant to the Gephardt rule during calendar years 1980-2010. The rule did not operate in all these years, being suspended or repealed in 11 of the 31 years between 1980 and 2010. The Gephardt rule was in effect for 20 years, originating 20 joint resolutions. The rule was modified in 1983 and remained in effect until 2010. In four years, the House and Senate did not agree on a budget resolution, so the automatic engrossment process was not used. Budget resolutions during this period contained debt limit amounts for multiple fiscal years. The Gephardt rule, in effect for 20 years, originated 20 joint resolutions. Modified in 1983, it allowed for multiple debt limit increases in the automatically engrossed joint resolutions. The Senate passed 16 of the 20 joint resolutions, with 10 passing without amendment and six with amendments. The resolutions passed without amendment were signed into law, while those with amendments required a House vote before being sent to the President. Between 1980 and 2010, a total of 47 public debt limit changes were signed into law, with the Gephardt rule originating less than a third of these changes. Over two-thirds of the changes enacted into law during this period originated through other procedures, each requiring a House vote. The rule allowed the House to avoid a separate vote on 10 of the 47 measures changing the debt limit that were ultimately enacted into law. Upon adoption of a concurrent resolution on the budget by the House, the Clerk prepares a joint resolution suspending the public debt limit. The House vote on the budget resolution also counts as a vote on the joint resolution, which is then passed by the House and sent to the Senate. The joint resolution states that the debt limit does not apply from the date of enactment until September 30. The rule allows the House and Senate to pass bills changing the public debt limit without following certain procedures. The term 'statutory limit on the public debt' refers to the maximum amount of obligations issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United States Code. The public debt limit refers to the maximum amount of obligations issued under title 31, United States Code. It is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and may be outstanding at any one time."
