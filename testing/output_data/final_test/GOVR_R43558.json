The group gained international attention for abducting almost 300 schoolgirls in April 2014 and pledging allegiance to the Islamic State in March 2015. Over 15,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram violence, with more than 6,500 deaths in 2015 alone. Regional forces, including those from Chad and Nigeria, have pushed back Boko Haram's territorial advances made from mid-2014 to early 2015. The conflict has caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing over 2.4 million people and cutting off humanitarian access to thousands. Boko Haram, a violent Islamist insurgent group, gained control of territory in northeastern Nigeria from mid-2014 to early 2015. Despite losing territory, they continue to carry out attacks in Nigeria and Cameroon. The group has shown the ability to target areas beyond their stronghold, including the Chadian capital. There has been a rise in suicide bombings, mostly carried out by women and children. Nigeria's President Buhari has been more proactive in countering Boko Haram compared to his predecessor. Goodluck Jonathan faced criticism for his response to Boko Haram, with debates on Nigerian security forces' control of reclaimed territory. Nigeria and Cameroon have been criticized for alleged abuses against civilians during counterinsurgency operations. U.S. officials are supporting regional counterterrorism programs to combat Boko Haram's impact on neighboring countries, with over $400 million in assistance provided to date. The U.S. has provided over $400 million in counterterrorism assistance for Boko Haram. Surveillance assets and personnel have been deployed to support regional efforts, with advisory support for Nigeria under consideration. The U.S. also supports programs to counter violent extremism in the region, including $30 million managed by USAID. Additionally, almost $200 million in humanitarian aid has been provided for the Lake Chad Basin area. Discussions are ongoing to strengthen U.S.-Nigerian security relations to combat Boko Haram's violent campaign. Boko Haram, a Sunni Islamic sect advocating strict Islamic law, emerged in the early 2000s in Nigeria. The group, also known as Jama'a Ahl as-Sunna Li-da'wa wa-al Jihad, believes Western education is forbidden. In 2015, they pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and rebranded as ISWAP. Boko Haram, originally known as Jama'a Ahl as-Sunna Li-da'wa wa-al Jihad, rebranded itself as the Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP). The group's leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was killed in 2009 during a clash with Nigerian security forces, leading to a period of apparent dissolution. However, Boko Haram resurfaced under new leadership in 2010, orchestrating a large prison break and potentially sending militants to insurgent training camps in the Sahel. Boko Haram, previously known as Jama'a Ahl as-Sunna Li-da'wa wa-al Jihad, rebranded as the Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP). The group formed ties with extremist groups like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) for training and weaponry. Attacks since 2011 include IEDs, car bombs, and suicide attacks, with women and children used as bombers since 2014. The organization is not monolithic, drawing support from a broader group beyond its core militants. Boko Haram, now known as ISWAP, draws support from young men in northeast Nigeria, southeast Niger, and northern Cameroon. Supporters may be motivated by frustration with disparities in law application, lack of development, and abusive security forces. The group's ideology rejects Western influence, democracy, and moderate Islam, combining an exclusivist interpretation of Islam with a \"politics of victimhood.\" Some fighters are lured by financial incentives. Boko Haram, now known as ISWAP, has an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 fighters, with some reports suggesting a larger force. The group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, may have been sidelined by Islamic State central leadership. There is speculation about a possible replacement from outside the region, but no significant change in tactics or targeting has been observed. Boko Haram, now known as ISWAP, has shown operational flexibility in its insurgency, shifting tactics from asymmetric attacks to conventional offensives. A splinter faction, Ansaru, emerged in 2012 due to disagreements with Shekau's leadership. Despite a purge in 2013, some Ansaru members may still collaborate with extremist groups in the Sahel region. Boko Haram, now ISWAP, shifted from asymmetric attacks to conventional offensives, losing territory in Nigeria but regaining some with regional forces. They now focus on soft targets in Nigeria and Cameroon, with the ability to move and conduct attacks across a wide area. They have also targeted the Chadian capital, N'djamena, in bombing incidents. Boko Haram's use of suicide bombers, including women and children, has significantly increased in the past year. The violence has led to a humanitarian crisis around Lake Chad, displacing over 2.4 million people. UNICEF reports that 1.3 million of the displaced are children, with over 9.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the region. More than one million displaced Nigerians have sought shelter in Maiduguri, despite ongoing bombings in the area. The Nigerian army's sweeping operations disrupt everyday life, with Boko Haram attacks damaging infrastructure and causing the closure of over 1,800 schools. More than 15,000 people have been killed by the group since 2009, with over 6,500 fatalities in 2015 alone. Nigeria saw a significant increase in terrorist deaths in 2014, with Boko Haram responsible for over 7,500 fatalities. Boko Haram has become the world's deadliest terrorist group, with attacks increasing in frequency and lethality since 2010. They target civilians in various locations and have also attacked infrastructure like cell phone towers and media outlets. Boko Haram has carried out deadly attacks in Nigeria and neighboring countries, targeting political leaders, clerics, and civilians. The group's assaults have resulted in high casualties, including a massacre in Baga that may have killed up to 2,000 people. The insurgency has led to a humanitarian crisis in the Lake Chad Basin region, with Nigeria's neighbors struggling to cope with the influx of refugees. The humanitarian crisis in Niger worsened by Nigerian refugees, lack of relief agencies, and criticism towards Cameroon for forcibly returning refugees. Boko Haram's attack on a U.N. building in Abuja in 2011 resulted in casualties and disrupted the region's economy. Boko Haram's increasing lethality and sophistication in attacks on local targets have raised concerns among U.S. national security officials. The group has pledged loyalty to the Islamic State leader, leading to fears of collaboration between the two extremist groups. Boko Haram's leader pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, potentially opening up recruitment and fundraising opportunities. However, the geographical distance between the two groups raises questions about the extent of operational ties. Reports of Boko Haram militants in Libya with IS factions suggest potential collaboration with other Islamist militants in North Africa. Analysts are uncertain about the impact of Shekau's pledge on the group's activities. Boko Haram's leader pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, potentially increasing their profile and collaboration with other Islamist militants in North Africa. Analysts question the impact on relations with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and associated groups in the region. The pledge may serve as a propaganda tool, with improved quality videos showing signs of IS expertise. Prior to pledging to IS, Boko Haram was allegedly cooperating with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Officials have identified Boko Haram as a threat to Western interests, with indications of sharing funds and materials with AQIM. There are concerns that Boko Haram aims for broader regional attacks, including Europe and the United States. Speculation suggests they may have acquired weapons from former Libyan stockpiles through AQIM ties. Boko Haram members Khalid al Barnawi and Abubakar Adam Kambar, linked to AQIM, were designated as Global Terrorists. Barnawi was captured in 2016, marking a significant arrest. Boko Haram, designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, poses a threat to Nigeria, the Lake Chad Basin, and international targets. The group's leader has threatened the United States, but no American citizens have been harmed. In 2015, Nigerian national Lawal Olaniyi Babafemi was sentenced to 22 years in a U.S. prison for supporting AQAP. Another Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, pled guilty to attempting to bomb a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009. In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped over 270 schoolgirls from Chibok. Despite warnings, security forces did not deploy, and only about 50 girls escaped. A video later showed around 130 girls in conservative dress, with the threat of being sold as slaves or brides by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau announced that the kidnapped girls from Chibok had been converted to Islam and would be released if Boko Haram fighters were freed. The United States provided support to Nigerian efforts to rescue the girls, deploying military personnel to Chad in May 2014. In late 2014, the operation of unmanned surveillance aircraft over northern Nigeria ended. In March 2015, the Pentagon confirmed no troops in Chad, as surveillance missions decreased. President Buhari approved a new investigation into the kidnapping in January 2016. Despite military efforts, none of the abducted Chibok girls have been returned, and their fate remains unknown. In March 2016, a woman arrested in Cameroon claimed to be one of the abducted girls. Since 2012, Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for attacks on schools in northern Nigeria, forcing over a million children out of school. Initially targeting property destruction, the group's assaults became more brutal in 2013, focusing on students and teachers. Boko Haram's leader threatened to burn secular schools and kill teachers, leading to low attendance rates, especially among women and girls. The Nigerian government and international aid agencies launched the Safe Schools Initiative in response to the Chibok attack and Boko Haram violence, with over 1,800 schools closed in Nigeria and neighboring countries due to the conflict. Boko Haram had previously abducted women and children in 2013, leading to a prisoner/hostage exchange. The kidnapping of Christian women by Boko Haram members in 2013 became a trend, with victims forced to convert to Islam or used as sex slaves. Over 2,000 women and girls were abducted since early 2014. Human Rights Watch highlighted the abduction of 300 children in 2014, most of them remain missing. There has been a rise in female suicide bombers, with 41.2% of Boko Haram-related incidents in 2014 carried out by them. In 2014, a significant number of Boko Haram-related incidents involved female suicide bombers, many of whom were children under 18. UNICEF reported that 1 in 5 suicide bombers since January 2014 were children, with three-quarters being girls. Reasons for this trend vary, including coercion, willingness, and sacrifice by families. Nigeria's former President faced criticism for his handling of the Boko Haram crisis. Nigeria's new President, Muhammadu Buhari, focused his campaign on improving security and tackling corruption. He replaced key military leaders with a more proactive approach towards countering Boko Haram, including relocating the army's headquarters and deploying more patrols in the region. The Nigerian army is conducting more strategic operations targeting Boko Haram's logistics routes, with improved morale under new leadership. Several former senior officials, including former President Jonathan's National Security Advisor, have been arrested on corruption charges. Investigations are ongoing for embezzlement of millions in defense contracts. President Buhari pledged to defeat Boko Haram by the end of 2015. President Buhari pledged to defeat Boko Haram by the end of 2015, declaring the group \"technically defeated\" in late December. However, analysts challenge the government's assessment, stating that Boko Haram's attacks on soft targets remain a significant threat. The military's control over reclaimed territory and the safe return of displaced persons are also subjects of debate. The displacement of over two million people by Boko Haram poses a significant challenge for the Buhari Administration. Insecurity and low oil prices have severely impacted local economies in the Lake Chad Basin area. President Buhari appointed a committee, led by a retired general, to oversee a reconstruction program for the northeast, with Aliko Dangote as a member. The Nigerian government's response to Boko Haram is hindered by lack of coordination, corruption, resource misallocation, and judicial system inefficiencies. The slow pace of the judicial system, limited databases, and lack of training for prosecutors and judges hinder the implementation of anti-terrorism laws in Nigeria. Reports of military abuses in some areas constrain donor support. Local communities have formed vigilante groups to protect themselves due to ineffective security force responses. The \"Civilian Joint Task Force\" (C-JTF) in Borno state has helped combat Boko Haram but faces accusations of human rights abuses. The government has not fully integrated them into formal security institutions. Boko Haram has expanded its attacks into neighboring countries since 2014. Chad experienced its first attacks in February 2015 after military operations against Boko Haram in Nigeria. The government declared a state of emergency in the Lake Region and tightened terrorism laws, executing suspects in August 2015. Chad was the first to ban burqas for Muslim women due to attacks by female suicide bombers. It hosts the headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force with over 8,700 troops, but its operational status is debated. Troop contributors operate independently under their national forces. Troop contributors in Cameroon operate independently under their national commands. Cameroon has faced numerous suicide bombings and guerilla attacks by Boko Haram, resulting in over 1,200 deaths in 2015. The military response in Cameroon has been criticized for human rights abuses, including torture, executions, and forced refugee returns. Local communities in Cameroon have formed self-defense groups to combat Boko Haram. Communities in Cameroon have formed \"self-defense groups\" to patrol Boko Haram-affected areas. The Cameroonian government praises these groups but urges them to focus on monitoring villages and leave more dangerous activities to security services. The U.S. views Boko Haram as a regional extremist threat in West Africa and has designated key individuals linked to the group as terrorists. The State Department issued a $7 million reward for information on the leader of Boko Haram in 2013. The U.S. government has designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and provided support to counter the group. Nigeria is seen as a strategically important country in Africa due to its large economy and population. The U.S. government has designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and provided support to counter the group. Nigeria, with a large Muslim population in the north, is a key country in Africa. Concerns persist about reported abuses by Nigerian security services and the government's limited efforts to address impunity. Despite shared concerns over terrorism, security cooperation is constrained due to perceived U.S. interference and dismissive attitudes from Nigerian officials. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs urges a more holistic approach to terrorism, linking it to regional and socioeconomic disparities contributing to Boko Haram recruitment. The U.S. government supports counterterrorism efforts against Boko Haram in Nigeria, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that addresses regional and socioeconomic disparities contributing to recruitment. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs highlights the importance of civilian protection, engagement, and international cooperation in combating extremism in the region. In support of counterterrorism efforts against Boko Haram in Nigeria and its neighbors, U.S. officials have increased security assistance to the Lake Chad Basin countries. Secretary of State John Kerry pledged to improve cooperation with Nigeria in tackling Boko Haram, acknowledging past challenges. The U.S. has allocated funds through the Global Security Contingency Fund and Counterterrorism Partnership Fund for the region, with plans to allocate $105 million in FY2016 and a request for $125 million in FY2017. The State Department has provided over $400 million in counterterrorism assistance to the Lake Chad Basin region, with Niger being the largest recipient of security aid. Chad and Cameroon have seen a substantial increase in military aid since 2014. Nigeria's military has received comparatively small counterterrorism assistance due to human rights concerns. The Obama Administration intends to increase cooperation with Nigeria's military, providing Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and over $30 million for counter violent extremism programs. The U.S. has also allocated $168 million in humanitarian aid for the Lake Chad Basin area and deployed military advisers to combat Boko Haram. In late 2014, the U.S. deployed 80 military personnel to Chad to locate kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls. In October 2015, 300 troops were sent to Cameroon for ISR operations with surveillance drones. President Obama stated it is a noncombat mission. By February 2016, around 250 troops were deployed. The Department of Defense is considering sending military advisers to Maiduguri, Nigeria. Reports of abuses by Nigerian military forces have limited donor support. The Leahy Laws have impacted U.S.-Nigerian security cooperation due to human rights violations by Nigerian security forces. Despite challenges, the State Department has approved assistance for Nigerian military and police units. Reports highlight abuses by security services in response to Boko Haram and crime. Amnesty International reports extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, arbitrary detention, and mistreatment by Nigerian security forces, with thousands of people linked to Boko Haram unlawfully killed. Allegations of torture during counterterrorism operations are common, and Nigeria was listed in the Trafficking in Persons Report for supporting armed groups recruiting child soldiers. Obama waived restrictions on foreign aid under the Child Soldier Prevention Act of 2008 to support Nigeria's military in countering terrorism, piracy, and oil bunkering. Nigerian officials have acknowledged abuses by security forces but few have been prosecuted. Nigeria has turned to Russia and China for defense equipment due to frustrations with the U.S. Media reports suggest strained relations between the two countries. In November 2014, Nigeria suspended advanced infantry training by U.S. Special Forces for an elite Nigerian army unit. U.S. officials remain concerned about reported abuses and their impact on military credibility and insurgency support. DOD aims to change Nigerian tactics towards Boko Haram. The DOD team deployed to Nigeria will analyze Nigerian operations and identify gaps for international assistance. The team includes U.S. military advisors who previously helped counter the Lord's Resistance Army in Central Africa. They could provide advice to help Nigerians act on intelligence about Boko Haram movements, but are cautious due to Nigeria's record of misuse of shared information. Recent reports of abuses by Cameroonian troops, including torture and summary executions of Boko Haram suspects, may impact U.S. assistance. Security force torture and abuse are significant human rights issues in Cameroon, with widespread impunity. Some Members of Congress have raised awareness of the Boko Haram threat and discussed the U.S. response. Congressional hearings have been held on the group's activities. The House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have held hearings on Boko Haram. Concerns have been raised about the lack of information on the group and its threat to U.S. interests. Legislation has been introduced to designate Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and condemn their attacks on civilians. Efforts have been made to hold Boko Haram accountable, with U.S. offers to assist in the search for the kidnapped girls. Legislation has been introduced to develop a regional strategy to eliminate the threat of Boko Haram and enforce the rule of law. The U.S. government designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in November 2013. The FTO designation Order 13224 aims to assist in investigating and prosecuting suspects associated with the group. It triggers asset freezing, travel bans, and criminalizes transactions with the organization. FTO status may prioritize U.S. security resources but does not require it. The designation is based on intelligence assessments and policy direction. It does not authorize direct U.S. military action against a terrorist group. Boko Haram funds its operations through criminal activities like bank robberies, kidnappings, and extortion. They also seized military equipment from the Nigerian army. Nigeria closed cattle markets suspected of funding the group, impacting the local economy. It is unclear how Boko Haram's allegiance to the Islamic State has affected its operations. Boko Haram's financing is unclear, with funding coming from local kidnapping operations and ransoms paid for foreign victims. Reports suggest over $3 million was received for a kidnapped French family in Cameroon. International sanctions may impact their kidnapping operations. Nigeria designated Boko Haram as a terrorist group in 2013. The British government designated Boko Haram and Ansaru as terrorist groups in 2013. Ansaru was named a \"Proscribed Terrorist Organization\" in November 2012 after kidnapping and murdering a British construction worker. Boko Haram was added to the U.N. Al Qaeda sanctions list in May 2014."
