    "content": "Recent studies have shown that attention modules can improve computer vision tasks by capturing global contexts and attending important features. A new Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) is proposed in this paper, which encourages neighboring channels to collaborate and produce a spatial attention map efficiently. Unlike other modules focusing on long-range dependencies, TAM utilizes point-wise group convolution to enhance model representational power and control signal flow. Empirical experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN datasets validate the effectiveness of TAM in achieving higher performance in a parameter-efficient manner. Advancements in attention modules have significantly improved performance in deep learning tasks such as machine translation, image generation, and object detection. The proposed attention module in this study led to a 2.3% and 1.2% accuracy improvement in ResNet50 and ResNet101 models with minimal parameter increase. The PyTorch implementation code is publicly available. Various attention modules have been developed for computer vision tasks, offering a balance between additional parameters and model performance. SENet, for example, captures global spatial information and channel-wise dependencies efficiently. The attention modules in deep learning have improved performance in tasks like machine translation and object detection. The SE module captures global spatial information and channel-wise dependencies efficiently. Other models like GENet, NLNet, and GCNet also enhance global feature context and channel-specific values. In this work, a new attention module is proposed to strengthen model representational power by incorporating nonlinearities between neighboring channels in a parameter-efficient manner. This module aims to capture inter-channel relations, in addition to contextual modeling, which is essential for an attention module's effectiveness. The proposed attention module captures inter-channel relations efficiently, deviating from capturing long-range spatial dependencies. It produces a single attention map by combining all channels, unlike previous studies that restore input channel dimensions. The proposed Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) uses light-weight point-wise group convolutions to learn inter-channel relationships efficiently, deviating from the trend of capturing global context. This design significantly boosts the performance of backbone networks with minimal parameter overhead, making it competitive with other attention modules. The Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) utilizes light-weight point-wise group convolutions to enhance inter-channel relations in the network. Through extensive experiments, the validity of TAM is proven, emphasizing the importance of inter-channel connections. The module repeats a pairing function to learn these relations, ensuring all channels are considered before applying 1x1 convolution and sigmoid activation. The Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) uses point-wise group convolutions to improve inter-channel relations in the network. By applying 1x1 convolution and sigmoid activation, one channel output is produced and then replicated through the channel axis to restore the original input dimension for recalibration. The model with g = 2 is illustrated in Figure 1. Point-wise group convolution is adopted for parametric efficiency, allowing the model to learn channel dependencies with fewer parameters and computations compared to ordinary point-wise convolution. The Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) uses point-wise group convolutions to enhance inter-channel relations in the network. By applying 1x1 convolution and sigmoid activation, one channel output is generated and replicated across the channel axis for recalibration. The model demonstrates improved efficiency in learning channel dependencies with fewer parameters and computations, leading to significant accuracy gains over baselines in experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN datasets. The module is attached to the last part of every residual block before addition, and experiments with varying group sizes show decreased errors with smaller group sizes. The Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) utilizes point-wise group convolutions to improve inter-channel relations in the network. It shows that reducing the group size leads to better performance in learning channel dependencies. However, a large group size degrades model performance, emphasizing the importance of keeping the number of channels interacting at a time small. The module, denoted as TAM, does not incorporate context modeling but focuses on enhancing channel information processing with fewer nonlinear operations. The Tree-structured Attention Module (TAM) improves inter-channel relations in the network by utilizing point-wise group convolutions. It is denoted as TAM with g = 2. Various backbone networks were tested on CIFAR-10/100 dataset, with top-1 error reported for CIFAR-10. Different architectures like ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNext50(8\u00d764d), and WideResNet(WRN)16-8 were experimented with to prove the module's generality. Standard preprocessing steps were followed, and weights were initialized following He et al. (2015a). Mini-batch size of 128, SGD with 0.9 momentum, and 10 \u22124 weight decay were used. Our model, utilizing point-wise group convolutions, outperforms baseline models and competes well with different attention modules. The parametric overhead of our module remains negligible regardless of backbone architecture depth, showing better performance with less than 1.5% overhead on ResNet50 and ResNext50. This supports the effectiveness of capturing inter-channel relations. The House Numbers(SVHN) dataset consists of 73,257 training and 26,032 test images of 32-by-32 RGB pixels with corresponding labels. No preprocessing is done except for normalizing images. Identical hyperparameters with CIFAR-10/100 training are used, training the model for 160 epochs and decaying the learning rate at epoch [80, 120]. Results show that some modules perform worse than the baseline network, possibly due to overfitting on a small dataset. Mean and variance of each activation are derived using ResNet50 on CIFAR-100 test dataset. The attention maps from TAM have zero variance, indicating they lack spatial discriminability and depend only on their location. TAM controls signal flow based on its placement, suppressing signals in earlier blocks and gradually allowing them in later stages. It preserves information for the later part of the network and allows more signals at the first block of each stage with spatial pooling. The attention maps from TAM lack spatial discriminability and depend on location. Signal flow is controlled based on placement, suppressing signals in earlier blocks and gradually allowing them in later stages. Activation values affect performance, with rapid decrease when first attention within a stage is disabled. Eliminating non-linearities within the module further investigates TAM's working mechanism. After training, TAM does not rely on activation functions, offering benefits to the network by providing more choices of various filters in the early and mid phases, and focusing on important filter weights in the last stage. TAM's average variances of convolutional filter weights in ResNet50 show higher values compared to other attention modules, indicating a focus on passing selected meaningful features to the classifier. The Tree-structure Attention module (TAM) focuses on important filter weights in the last stage, allowing learning of inter-channel relationships. TAM shows faster convergence speed during training due to its light-weight property. It acts like a static gate controlling signal flow, helps the network converge fast, and enables learning of interchannel relationships. TAM deviates from the current trend of capturing long-range dependencies in attention literature. The Tree-structure Attention module (TAM) utilizes light-weight point-wise group convolutions to enable communication between neighboring channels. It acts as a static gate controlling signal at a specific location, independent of input features. TAM allows higher variances in filter weights in early and mid phases, focusing on important filters in the last phase. Despite having few additional parameters, TAM delivers performance gains and offers a new approach to feature attention."
