The Congress finds that the political and economic crisis in Indonesia has led to a crisis of legitimacy of the Suharto regime. The regime controls a vast military network used to maintain control over a population suffering from job losses, inflation, food shortages, hunger, and political unrest. The Indonesian military has increased troops in urban areas and cracked down on the civilian population through lethal force, mass arrests, torture of prisoners, and disappearances of pro-democracy leaders. General Suharto seized control of the Indonesian government 32 years ago in a bloody coup that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Indonesians.

Human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, executions, disappearances, and torture, continue to escalate in urban areas. The United States will no longer support or supply Indonesia due to these atrocities.
