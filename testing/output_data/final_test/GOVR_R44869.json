This report provides a framework for understanding how relief might be pursued, discussing sources of policy changes post-financial crisis and legislative strategies available to Congress. It also addresses actions regulators and the Administration could take to provide relief without statutory change. Many financial reforms were adopted in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, aiming to address problems like financial instability and inadequate protection for consumers and investors. Critics argue that these reforms may have gone too far, with the burden of financial regulation now outweighing the benefits. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 was a significant source of post-crisis reform, making regulatory changes across the financial system. Regulators have issued final rules for about 75% of Dodd-Frank Act's requirements. Recent Congresses have debated amending the act, with minor changes enacted but no major changes so far. Other post-crisis regulatory changes stem from acts like the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which created the FHFA to regulate housing government-sponsored enterprises. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under FHFA conservatorship since 2008. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act created the FHFA to regulate housing government-sponsored enterprises, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship since 2008. International regulatory changes are influenced by the G-20 and FSB, which coordinate financial standard-setting processes. The G-20 serves as the primary forum for international economic cooperation. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) sets priorities for international financial standards with regulators from G-20 countries and international financial institutions. National financial authorities oversee rules for financial institutions and participate in standard-setting bodies, operating on a consensual basis without legal authority. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) collaborates with G-20 countries and international financial institutions to set priorities for international financial standards. Agreements made at international fora or by regulators at standard-setting bodies require domestic legislative or regulatory changes for implementation. The International Monetary Fund monitors national compliance with international financial standards. Basel III accords provide new prudential regulatory standards for banks, with U.S. banking regulators promulgating regulations to comply. The FSB, in coordination with the Basel Committee, oversees globally active financial institutions. Financial regulators, in coordination with international bodies like IOSCO and IAIS, designate global systemically important banks and insurers. U.S. regulators apply heightened standards to G-SIBs, while regulatory changes aim to harmonize policies globally. Regulators have broad authority to ensure financial institution safety and protect consumers. Post-crisis reforms often stem from regulatory discretion rather than statutory changes, as seen with the SEC setting new standards for money market mutual funds. The report discusses regulatory relief in financial services, focusing on different approaches to implementing relief proposals. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating the trade-off between the benefits and costs of regulation before providing relief. Financial regulation aims to enhance the safety and soundness of institutions and protect consumers. Financial regulation aims to enhance safety, protect consumers, and promote financial stability by issuing rules, supervising institutions, and taking enforcement actions. Regulators use various tools to achieve these goals, such as requiring companies to meet standards and obtain licenses. The specific objectives and methods of regulators vary by market, with a focus on risk management in banking regulation. The costs associated with government financial regulation, known as regulatory burden, can impact various entities including consumers, the government, and the economy. Regulatory burden can lead to increased prices for customers and reduced availability of credit, negatively affecting business investment and economic growth. Regulatory burden may manifest in different forms, impacting operating costs for financial institutions. Regulatory burden can take different forms, such as one-time or recurring operating costs and opportunity costs. Trade-offs may arise between reducing regulatory burden and potentially reducing the benefits of regulation, affecting various entities beyond just financial service providers. The concept of regulatory burden involves the costs associated with a regulation, which may not necessarily mean the regulation is undesirable. It can be contrasted with unduly burdensome, which considers the balance between benefits and costs. Policymakers evaluate these trade-offs and broader effects of regulations. When evaluating regulations, policymakers consider trade-offs and broader effects, such as impact on innovation, credit prices, and availability. Regulations can drive up costs for banks, leading to activity shifting to less regulated areas. However, stable regulations can reduce costs and increase credit availability. Congress provides regulators with authority for regulations and can amend or repeal it through legislation. Congress can amend or repeal regulations through legislation, providing relief to all financial services providers or specific groups. Regulatory relief can be enacted through the normal legislative process or the annual appropriations process. Special legislative procedures like the Congressional Review Act and reconciliation process are available for limited circumstances. H.R. 10, a regulatory relief package, was passed by the House on June 8, 2017. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) provides expedited procedures for Congress to invalidate federal agency rules with a simple majority vote in the Senate. This oversight tool allows for fast-track consideration of legislation that strikes down agency rules, limiting debate and amendments. Members of Congress have specified time periods to submit and act on joint resolutions of disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to invalidate federal agency rules with a simple majority vote. If a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, the rule in question \"shall not take effect.\" The CRA prohibits judicial review of any actions under the act. The CRA has successfully overturned one agency rule before the 115th Congress. The CRA has been used to overturn 14 rules in the 115th Congress, including the SEC's resource extraction rule. This rule required companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments for oil, gas, or minerals development. The focus initially was on overturning rules from the previous administration, but some members of Congress may still use the CRA to overturn future financial regulations. Some members of Congress may use the CRA to overturn future financial regulations, particularly those issued by regulators appointed by the previous Administration. The 115th Congress has considered changes to the CRA to facilitate the overturning of rules, including passing acts like the Midnight Rules Relief Act and the REINS Act. There are suggestions to use the budget reconciliation process for passing legislation providing regulatory relief. The reconciliation process allows Congress to expedite legislation related to budgetary goals, focusing on changes in direct spending, revenues, or the debt limit. Congress must first agree on an annual budget resolution with reconciliation instructions to specific committees. These instructions prompt committees to develop legislation within their jurisdictions. Once developed, the reconciliation legislation can be considered under expedited procedures in both the House and Senate. The reconciliation process in the Senate is crucial as it does not require a supermajority for cloture. Committees must follow reconciliation instructions to create legislation that meets specific budgetary goals. The content of reconciliation legislation is determined by the directed committees within their jurisdiction. The reconciliation process in the Senate allows for legislation to be passed with a simple majority vote. The content of reconciliation bills is restricted by the Byrd rule, which prohibits extraneous material. Any Senator can raise a point of order against such material, leading to its removal from the bill. The Byrd rule can be waived by a three-fifths majority vote. The Byrd rule in the Senate prohibits extraneous provisions that do not impact outlays or revenues, are outside committee jurisdiction, increase the deficit beyond the budget window, or recommend changes to Social Security. The rule can be enforced by any Senator through a point of order, leading to the removal of the provision from the reconciliation bill. The Senate's Byrd rule prohibits provisions in legislation that do not affect outlays or revenues. The budgetary impact of a provision determines if it is considered extraneous, even if it is incidental to nonbudgetary components. Determining which changes to financial regulation are extraneous is complex. The Byrd rule in the Senate prohibits provisions in legislation that do not impact outlays or revenues. Determining which changes to financial regulation are extraneous, and therefore prohibited in reconciliation, is complex. Legislation typically adjusts regulators' mandates or authority, but not their funding directly. Regulators like the SEC and CFTC set their own budgets, so changes in responsibilities may not necessarily affect their budget levels. Proposed regulatory reforms, such as adjusting regulators' responsibilities without directly impacting their budgets, may raise concerns under the Byrd rule in the Senate. For example, moving financial regulators' funding to the annual appropriations process could be considered extraneous as it involves authorizations of appropriations without providing budget authority. Some financial regulatory proposals may be eligible for inclusion in reconciliation if they are projected to have a budgetary impact. The Dodd-Frank Act created new fees on financial institutions to finance regulatory duties, which were scored by the Congressional Budget Office. The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new fees on financial institutions to fund regulatory duties, increasing general revenues. These fees finance the Orderly Liquidation Fund, Office of Financial Research, and Federal Reserve's supervisory responsibilities. Additionally, the Act affects the ability of the FDIC and Securities Investor Protection Corporation to borrow from the Treasury, impacting direct spending. The Dodd-Frank Act impacts direct spending by requiring the Federal Reserve to transfer funds to the CFPB and allowing the SEC to use fees for its operations outside the appropriations process. This affects the resources available to regulators for their specified duties. The Dodd-Frank Act affects regulators' resources for their duties. The Byrd rule applies to specific matters in reconciliation legislation, so even broad changes may be stricken if they violate the rule. For example, proposals to change the Fed's transfer to the CFPB have been paired with broader reforms, but if these reforms have no budgetary impact, they may not be included in reconciliation. The Dodd-Frank Act impacts regulators' resources. The Byrd rule applies to reconciliation legislation, so broad changes may be removed if they violate the rule. Appropriations legislation allows Congress to make changes to financial policy, affecting agencies' funding levels and capacity for rulemaking. SEC and CFTC are primarily funded through appropriations. Appropriations bills may include policy riders for financial regulators. Congress has included legislative language in appropriations bills that make changes affecting agencies that do not receive appropriations. Recent bills have made minor changes to the CFPB, Orderly Liquidation Authority, swaps regulation, and SEC's reserve fund. Some versions of the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill have included more significant changes to financial regulation, such as eliminating the CFPB's funding source. The CFPB's funding source and authorized appropriations were targeted for changes in a bill that also aimed to alter the leadership structure of the CFPB and delay a regulation on payday loans. The bill passed the House but was not taken up by the Senate. Financial policy is primarily implemented through regulations issued by federal financial regulators, not agencies directly influenced by the Administration. Regulatory relief provisions were added to the FY2016 FSGG bill in the Senate. Financial regulators have autonomy from the Administration and independence from partisan politics. They have the authority to issue, modify, or repeal regulations, but the process can be time-consuming and must follow mandated procedures. The majority of agency rulemakings must comply with certain requirements. The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to follow a notice and comment process for rulemaking, providing the public with an opportunity to comment. Proposed rules can be modified more easily than final rules, and financial regulators have several proposed rules that have not been finalized yet. Agencies may decide not to finalize proposed rules based on various factors. Regulators have the ability to modify regulations after they have been finalized, using their supervisory and enforcement powers to ensure compliance. Nonbinding guidance and supervisory letters can be issued to provide further explanation on adhering to regulations. These changes can subtly influence regulatory burden by altering how rules are complied with. Regulators can influence regulatory burden through supervision and enforcement powers, such as issuing guidance on compliance. High-profile examples include joint agency guidance on leveraged lending and legal settlements post-financial crisis that changed industry norms. The President's role in financial regulation is limited, with the ability to issue executive orders instructing agencies. The President's influence on financial regulation differs depending on the type of agency, with independent regulatory agencies having more autonomy. The President can nominate individuals with similar priorities to lead agencies and the Treasury Secretary chairs the Financial Stability Oversight Council. President Trump signed an executive order on February 3, 2017. President Trump signed an executive order on February 3, 2017, directing the Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to report within 120 days on laws and regulations hindering federal regulation of the US financial system. The order aimed to empower Americans in financial decision-making, prevent bailouts, promote economic growth, and enable American companies. President Trump's Executive Order 13371, issued on January 30, 2017, aims to make financial regulation efficient, competitive, and accountable. It requires agencies to identify two existing regulations to repeal whenever proposing a new one, without revising or repealing any specific regulation directly. President Trump's Executive Order 13371, issued on January 30, 2017, directs agencies to ensure that the total incremental cost of all new regulations finalized in fiscal year 2017 is zero, unless required by law or approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Any new costs must be offset by eliminating costs from at least two prior regulations, following the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable laws. The substance of an executive order must be based on presidential power vested by the U.S. Constitution or delegated by Congress. Financial regulators, as independent agencies, are not required to comply with executive orders like Executive Order 13371 for regulatory relief. However, some agencies may choose to voluntarily comply with certain executive orders. An example of a post-crisis regulation issued by the previous Administration, rather than an independent agency, is the Department of Labor's 2016 fiduciary rule. The fiduciary rule requires a uniform standard for broker-dealers and investment advisers giving financial advice on retirement accounts. President Trump directed the DOL to review the rule's impact on access to retirement information. The Treasury Secretary influences regulatory priorities through the FSOC, created by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FSOC, chaired by the Treasury Secretary, identifies financial risks and promotes market discipline. It has limited rulemaking authority and can designate nonbank financial institutions as systemically important. President Trump called for a review of the SIFI designation process, recommending a temporary pause on designations. Currently, AIG and Prudential are designated as SIFIs, subject to enhanced regulation. FSOC must review SIFIs' designations annually, with the chair having veto power in designation votes. De-designating a SIFI requires a two-thirds vote of FSOC, including the chair. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) to resolve failing financial firms, triggered by the Treasury Secretary with recommendations from the Fed and FDIC. President Trump called for a review of OLA in 2017. Financial regulators' leadership positions have fixed terms and are appointed by the President after Senate confirmation. Many recent reforms were approved by current agency leadership. The heads of financial regulators do not serve at the pleasure of the President and can only be removed if a \"for cause\" threshold is met. President Trump nominated Jay Clayton as chair of the SEC following Senate confirmation. Vacancies in these positions will allow for new nominations over time. President Trump's nominee, Jay Clayton, was confirmed as chair of the SEC in 2017. Vacancies remain for the chairs of the OCC and the CFTC, with nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. Some financial regulators are led by a single director, while others are led by a multimember board or commission with political affiliation requirements. These requirements may limit the President's selection of like-minded nominees."
