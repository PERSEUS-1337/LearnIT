Figures 1 and 2 compare the index during past recessions, showing that in the 2007-2009 recession, the index continued to decline even eight months after the recession started. In the 2007-2009 recession, the industrial production index declined for 10 months after the recession started. Comparing with past recessions, the index trended similarly, with economic activity increasing in July 2009. Despite tax incentives discussed, the December 2012 index remained below the December 2007 level. During the 2007-2009 recession, real investment growth declined severely in the fourth and fifth quarters compared to other recessions. About 85% of gross investment spending in 2011 was used for capital goods replacement. In 2011, 85% of gross investment spending replaced worn-out fixed assets, with the remaining 15% increasing the capital stock. The consumption of fixed assets as a percentage of gross nonresidential investment increased by 25 percentage points between 1970 and 2011. Net nonresidential investment as a percentage of GDP has been decreasing, falling from 4.1% in 1970 to 1.1% in 2011. Employment declined for 22 months after the 2007-2009 recession, with a lag in recovery compared to output. During the 2007-2009 recession, employment declined slightly over the first 9 months and then sharply over the next 12 months. 25 months after the start of the recession, employment was at 94% of the December 2007 level. During the 2007-2009 recession, employment declined slightly over the first 9 months and then sharply over the next 12 months. 25 months after the start of the recession, employment was at 94% of the December 2007 level. Comparing this recession with the 1973-1975 and 1981-1982 recessions, it took 8 months after the end of the recession for employment levels to start rising. However, as of December 2012, employment levels were still below the December 2007 level, indicating weakness in the labor market. The long-term unemployment rate has generally tracked the unemployment rate over the business cycle, reaching its peak a few months after the end of a recession. After the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, the long-term unemployment rate peaked 15 and 19 months after the recession ended. Currently, the long-term unemployment rate is at its highest level in 62 years, with over 3% of the labor force unemployed for six months or more. Tax incentives for new investment include investment tax credits and accelerated deductions for depreciation. The investment tax credit was introduced in 1962 and has been reinstated, temporarily increased, and made permanent over the years. It is often proposed as a counter-cyclical or economic stimulus measure. Accelerated depreciation allows for a faster deduction of investment costs. The investment tax credit was introduced in 1962 and made permanent in 1976. Economists noted distortions across asset types from the credit, leading to its repeal in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Accelerated depreciation is not used for counter-cyclical purposes due to complexity in treating different vintages of investment. An investment credit occurs the year of investment and is easier to compute when repealed. The partial expensing approach allows a fraction of investment to be deducted upfront, with the remainder depreciated. Temporary provisions for partial expensing were included in tax legislation in 2002 and 2003, with bonus depreciation in 2008 and 2009. The Obama Administration proposed 100% expensing for qualified capital investments. The Obama Administration proposed 100% expensing for qualified capital investments through the end of 2011, which was extended and expanded by P.L. 111-312 in December 2010. Bonus depreciation was extended to 2013 by P.L. 112-240. President also proposed increasing expensing to 100% in 2012, included in H.R. 3630, but not passed. Payroll tax relief was extended to 2012 by P.L. 112-96. The effectiveness of these business tax breaks as a stimulus depends on their impact. The success of business tax breaks as a stimulus depends on the effectiveness of investment subsidies in inducing spending. A business tax cut aims to stimulate investment by changing the cost of capital, but if there is little marginal stimulus or if investment is not responsive to price effects, most of the cut may be saved or used to pay down debt. Business tax cuts increase the incentive to invest, making them counter-cyclical devices. Investment incentives like expensing for small businesses can be counter-cyclical, but they are often phased-out, creating a disincentive to invest. The overall incentive effect is ambiguous, and studies on the investment tax credit show uncertainty. Time series studies have found little relationship between tax credits and aggregate investment. Criticisms include the possibility of interventions during economic slowdowns. A recent micro data study found elasticity in investment changes related to user cost. The elasticity for equipment investment is -0.25, while a study by Cummins, Hassett, and Hubbard found a higher elasticity of -0.66. Both estimates suggest inelasticity in induced spending compared to cost. The higher estimate reflects advancements in statistical identification. However, it is uncertain if this elasticity applies during downturns when firms have excess capacity. Firms may respond more to changes in cost during normal or high-growth periods. The timing of investment stimulus may be too slow to be effective, especially during low growth periods. Evidence suggests that temporary tax incentives like bonus depreciation have little impact on business investment. Firms without taxable income may not benefit from such incentives. In a study, it was found that firms did not always elect bonus depreciation for eligible investments, possibly due to losses and loss carry-overs making the subsidy ineffective. The incentive effect of bonus depreciation was small, reducing the user cost of capital by only about 3%. Adjustment costs and compliance issues may have outweighed the benefits of bonus depreciation for many firms. The effectiveness of bonus depreciation as a short-term economic stimulus is questioned by studies. House and Shapiro found a small overall effect on the economy due to limited investment categories and small incentives. Cohen and Cummins reported that most firms indicated bonus depreciation had no impact on investment timing. Hulse and Livingstone found mixed results, weakly supportive of an effect. Tax incentives for equipment may have limited effects in stimulating investment in the short run due to planning lags and slow technology changes. Firms increase investment when they expect output to rise or when the cost of investment decreases. This can lead to more capital use relative to labor. Business tax subsidies may not be as effective in encouraging investment. The analysis suggests that a business tax subsidy may not be the best choice for fiscal stimulus due to uncertainty in stimulating aggregate demand. Temporary investment subsidies are more effective in the short run, as permanent ones may distort investment allocation. Investment subsidies aim to increase spending and employment, with capital and skilled labor being complements in the production process. Increasing capital tends to increase demand for skilled labor, while capital and unskilled labor are substitutes. Investment incentives could reduce demand for less-skilled workers, with effects on wages or employment levels. Studies show that investment subsidies benefit capital equipment producers through higher prices and slightly increased wages for workers in the industry. Investment incentives may reduce demand for less-educated workers and increase demand for highly educated workers and those in capital goods industries. Employment and wage subsidies aim to boost employment by lowering a firm's wage costs, which include wages, benefits, hiring expenses, and taxes. Subsidies can take various forms, such as subsidizing earnings or work time, and can target specific groups of workers. Employment subsidies, like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and New Jobs Tax Credit (NJTC), aim to incentivize hiring from disadvantaged groups or exceeding previous employment levels. These tax credits help reduce firms' wage costs and boost employment. The FUTA wage base increased by 50%, with a maximum credit of $2,100 per new employee. The credit was reduced by the employer's income tax deduction for wages. The total credit was capped at $100,000, limiting the expansion to 47 new employees per firm. The credit could be carried back three years and forward seven years. Wage subsidies have been analyzed since the 1930s, with limited empirical estimates of their effects. In the analysis of wage subsidies, various economists have differing views on its effectiveness in increasing employment. Pigou believed it could work but might be mishandled, while Kaldor and Layard/Nickell suggested temporary wage subsidies could be effective during high unemployment. In the US, employment subsidies like NJTC and TJTC have been evaluated, with the latter being replaced by WOTC. The NJTC was designed as a counter-cyclical measure to boost employment post-recession. The NJTC was enacted in May 1977 to boost employment after the 1973-1975 recession. The credit applied to employment greater than 102% of the previous year's level, with firms receiving a tax credit of 50% of wages paid up to $4,200 per new eligible worker. The credit had a $110,000 cap, benefiting small firms the most. Large firms with substantial employment growth may not have had a marginal incentive. The credit was allowed against income tax liability, limiting its use for firms with inadequate tax liability. The NJTC was evaluated using responses from a federal survey of for-profit firms. Perloff and Wachter found that firms aware of the tax credit had 3% faster employment growth. However, only 34% of firms knew about the credit, potentially biasing the results. Bishop focused on the construction and distribution industries, estimating the NJTC's impact on employment to be between 150,000 to 670,000 jobs. The NJTC was evaluated for its impact on employment in various industries. Perloff and Wachter found that firms aware of the tax credit had faster employment growth, but only 34% of firms knew about it. Bishop estimated the NJTC's impact on employment to be between 150,000 to 670,000 jobs, with varying results across industries. Tannenwald's analysis of private firms in Wisconsin concluded that the NJTC did not meet expectations and had a higher per job cost compared to public service employment programs. Emil Sunley argues that the tax credit's complexity and timing gap between hiring decisions and eligibility deterred some firms from utilizing it. The subsidy was found to favor already growing firms, potentially widening geographic job creation disparities. A report commissioned by Congress expressed skepticism about the subsidy's effectiveness, noting that only one-third of firms were aware of it, with only 20% qualifying for it. The Labor/Treasury study questioned the effectiveness of the subsidy, with only 2.4% of firms making a conscious effort to hire because of it. The National Federation of Independent Businesses survey showed that 1.4% to 4.1% of employers were affected by the subsidy. Concerns were raised about the timing of the studies and the potential for the credit to shift employment rather than increase aggregate employment. The Tax Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC) provided a wage subsidy to firms for hiring eligible workers, but studies show mixed results on its effectiveness. While it improved employment outcomes for nonwhite youth, at least 70% of the tax credits were claimed for hiring workers who would have been hired even without the subsidy. Programs targeted to narrow socioeconomic groups may not significantly increase employment levels. Incremental tax credits have the potential to increase employment, but with limitations. Incremental tax credits have the potential to increase employment, but in practice, they may not be as effective as desired. Reasons include complexity, lack of awareness, and the primary influence of product demand on hiring decisions. The Obama Administration proposed a $5,000 business tax credit against payroll taxes for every new employee hired in 2010, with a $500,000 cap per firm. Small businesses increasing wages or hours would also receive a credit. The proposal aimed to address limitations of the NJTC by allowing quarterly claims and eligibility for all firms against payroll taxes. Nonprofits and startups would be eligible for half the credit, costing an estimated $33 billion. Senators Baucus and Grassley proposed the HIRE Act, which included tax incentives for hiring and retaining unemployed workers. The Act, signed into law in March 2010, would cost $13 billion over 10 years. The first incentive was forgiveness of the employer's share of the 2010 payroll tax for qualified workers hired after the proposal's enactment. Verifying eligibility for these incentives was challenging. The HIRE Act proposed tax incentives for hiring and retaining unemployed workers, costing $13 billion over 10 years. Employers faced challenges in verifying eligibility for incentives, including payroll tax forgiveness and a business credit for retaining qualified workers. Nonprofit firms with little or no tax liability may not fully benefit from these incentives. The proposed job creation tax credit aimed to address flaws in existing incentives by offering a refundable credit equal to a percentage of additional taxable payroll. This credit would benefit both unprofitable firms and nonprofits, with estimated job creation of 2.8 million in 2010 and 2.3 million in 2011, at a budgetary cost of no more than $15 billion per year. President Obama proposed a new $447 billion tax cut and spending package on September 8, 2011. The package includes over half in tax cuts and the rest in spending increases, larger than the 2008 stimulus but smaller than the 2009 stimulus. Labor demand elasticity estimates were used to predict job creation, with 1.4 million jobs in 2010 and 1.1 million jobs in 2011 if the elasticity was 0.15. Note that these estimates may vary during a recession. The American Jobs Act, introduced in response to President Obama's proposal, includes tax cuts and spending increases. The bill focuses on providing tax relief for businesses, such as cutting employer payroll taxes and extending expensing deductions. It also includes a tax credit for hiring long-term employees. The American Jobs Act includes tax cuts for businesses like cutting employer payroll taxes and extending expensing deductions. It also offers a $4,000 tax credit for hiring the long-term unemployed and tax credits for hiring unemployed veterans. S. 1917 proposed similar payroll tax changes but was defeated in the Senate. The effectiveness of these tax incentives is debated, with concerns about the impact on hiring during times of low demand. The payroll tax proposals did not include employer side tax benefits, with news reports suggesting a possible extension of the employee reduction to the employer side. The House proposal also did not contain employer side provisions for the payroll tax cut. Ultimately, the employee side payroll relief was extended but allowed to expire as scheduled. Investment and employment subsidies may not be as effective in increasing economic activity, with a deficit-financed fiscal stimulus being more impactful in the short term. In the short term, fiscal policies like increased government spending, transfers to local governments, and tax cuts for low to middle income earners can have a significant impact on employment. However, the long-term costs of higher deficits need to be considered, as unsustainable deficits could lead to a continual rise in national debt relative to output, potentially causing investors to stop financing it."
