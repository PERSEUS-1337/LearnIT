    "content": "A \"lame duck\" session of Congress occurs after the election for the next Congress but before the current Congress's term ends. It involves the sitting Members of the existing Congress, not those of the new Congress. The term originates from 18th century Britain, referring to bankrupt businessmen. In current American usage, a President or Members of Congress are considered \"lame ducks\" after their successor has been elected or when they are not seeking reelection. This term also applies to Members who have been defeated or did not gain reelection until the new Congress starts. A \"lame duck\" session of Congress occurs after the election for the next Congress but before the current Congress's term ends. A lame duck session of Congress occurs after the election for the next Congress but before the current Congress's term ends. Since 1935, there have been 21 lame duck sessions, with an increase in occurrences from 1999 through 2016. The report discusses data from the 20th and 21st centuries separately to present the differences between the two periods. The Constitution originally stated that Congress's regular sessions began annually on the first Monday in December and ended on March 4 of odd-numbered years. Congressional elections were generally held in November of even-numbered years, with new Congress terms starting in the following March. However, new Congress sessions often didn't convene until the following December, continuing until the summer of the next even-numbered year before adjourning until the next regular session prescribed by the Constitution. The Twentieth Amendment aimed to change the timing of Congress sessions to avoid lame duck sessions. Congress would convene its first session as early as March, with the odd-year December session as the second session and the even-year December session as the third session. The Twentieth Amendment aimed to prevent lame duck sessions by changing the timing of Congress sessions. Lame duck sessions can still occur under specific circumstances, such as through previously enacted laws, recesses spanning elections, leadership authority, pro forma sessions, or presidential proclamations. These methods illuminate the constitutional arrangements that allow for lame duck sessions. The Twentieth Amendment aimed to prevent lame duck sessions by changing Congress session timing. Lame duck sessions can still occur through various methods, highlighting constitutional arrangements. Congress can adjourn sine die without the President's involvement, authorizing it through a concurrent resolution. Congress authorizes a sine die adjournment by concurrent resolution, allowing both houses to adjourn without the President's involvement. In an election year, Congress may schedule an additional session before the new Congress term begins, but since 1935, it has not convened a lame duck session as a new session. Instead, Congress typically recesses its existing session to reconvene within the constitutional term. Congress authorizes a recess in the same way it authorizes a sine die adjournment by adopting a concurrent resolution. A recess does not terminate the existing session of Congress, unlike a sine die adjournment. The phrase \"lame duck session\" is used to refer to any post-election meeting of the old Congress, even though it does not designate a distinct third session. Lame duck sessions may occur when the House or Senate leadership reconvenes the chambers if necessary. Since 1935, Congress has included contingent authority for the leadership to reconvene the House and Senate in concurrent resolutions for session recess or sine die adjournment if the public interest requires. This authority can be used to return early from a recess spanning an election, resulting in a lame duck session. The Twentieth Amendment has prevented this action from being taken. Contingent authority can also be used to reconvene after a sine die adjournment, with the adjournment becoming definitive only if the leadership does not exercise this authority before the next session of Congress convenes. The Speaker of the House has reconvened the chamber in post-election lame duck sessions in 1998 and 2008. Leadership may call Congress back to avoid a \"pocket veto\" if the President vetoes a bill while Congress is not in session. If the last regular session of a Congress adjourns sine die, the veto automatically becomes final. The President can use a \"pocket veto\" by not returning the bill. Contingent authority allows Congress to reconvene to override the veto, reducing the chance of a pocket veto. Lame duck sessions can occur if Congress continues to meet after an election, typically holding pro forma sessions for formality. The term \"pro forma session\" refers to a daily session of a chamber that satisfies the constitutional prohibition against adjourning for more than three days without substantive business. This report considers daily sessions as pro forma if they stand alone with no session on the preceding or following day. Pro forma sessions can prevent pocket vetoes and recess appointments, ensuring Congress remains in session. The Constitution allows the President to fill vacancies during Senate recesses, but pro forma sessions during election breaks prevent such recesses. Pro forma sessions during election periods prevent recess appointments, extending lame duck sessions until the next Congress convenes. The President can also call Congress into a special session on extraordinary occasions, starting a new session if it occurs after adjournment but before the next Congress term. This special session has not happened since the Twentieth Amendment. If the President calls Congress back during a recess, the existing session resumes, as seen in 1947 and 1948 when President Truman did so. Lame duck sessions were called sporadically by Congress from 1935 to 1998, with 12 sessions held. They were more frequent around World War II and in the late 20th century. In 1954, only the Senate returned to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy, and in 1998, only the House returned to consider the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. During the 20th century, lame duck sessions were held by Congress from 1935 to 1998. These sessions typically lasted less than two months and often used recesses or pro forma sessions. The longest session was the 76th Congress, which lasted from November 7, 1940, to January 3, 1941. The House reconvened in 1998 to consider the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The 91st Congress had a 48-day lame duck session in 1970, focusing on spending measures and President Nixon's legislative program. The shortest session was in 1948, lasting only one day to close the session. Other short sessions were held for specific purposes, such as the Senate meeting for two days in 1994 to implement the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In 1998, the House met for three days to address President Clinton's impeachment. The House and Senate have pro forma sessions and internal recesses, especially during holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. The number of daily sessions after the election is a better measure of session length. On average, the House convened in 16 daily sessions after the election, while the Senate averaged 18 days. Since 2000, the House and Senate have had varying numbers of daily sessions following an election. Since 2000, the House and Senate have consistently reconvened after elections, focusing on spending provisions during lame duck sessions. The breaks after elections have averaged 40 days, with some starting in mid- or late September. The chambers have diverged on five occasions in their use of identical forms to span the election break. The House and Senate have diverged in their use of recesses or pro forma sessions to span election breaks since 2000. The Senate has increasingly used pro forma sessions, while the House has continued to rely on recesses alone. This marks a change from the early period when the Senate used recesses alone before every lame duck session from 1948 through 1994. The House has relied on recesses to span election breaks, while the Senate has used pro forma sessions. Lame duck sessions typically start in mid-November, with earlier starts when both chambers use pro forma sessions. The average adjournment dates for the House and Senate are December 20 and December 17, respectively, but there is a trend towards later adjournments. The House and Senate have seen a trend towards later adjournments for lame duck sessions since 2000. The average length of lame duck sessions has increased, with the House spanning 37 calendar days on average and the Senate 33. The number of days in daily sessions is a more meaningful indicator of legislative activity, with the House averaging 14 days and the Senate 18 during lame duck sessions. Since 2000, lame duck sessions have seen an increase in the number of days spent in daily sessions. The House and Senate have convened for an average of 19 days and 25 days respectively in the most recent sessions. In 2008, the Senate held pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by President George W. Bush. Both chambers have been active in negotiating spending or revenue provisions since the 2010 lame duck session. The average length of election breaks has decreased in both chambers since 2000. Comparing the 20th and 21st century lame duck sessions shows similarities and differences in legislative activity. Since 2000, the average length of election breaks has decreased in both the House and Senate. The difference in election breaks is partly attributed to the 1948 session, which had a notably long break of 145 days. Excluding 1948, the average election break has still become shorter, with a decline of 14 days in both chambers post-1998. The House has extended its lame duck sessions by an average of 10 days, while the Senate's sessions have shown no significant change. The average number of days in daily sessions following elections has remained relatively stable for both chambers. Since 2000, the House and Senate have shown little change in their lame duck sessions, with adjournments in January in four of the past five election years. The House's use of recesses, pro forma sessions, and contingent sine die adjournments did not change in frequency, while the Senate increased its use of pro forma sessions and decreased its use of recesses. The Senate has increased its use of pro forma sessions before lame duck sessions, with a rate of 56% compared to 18% previously. There have been 21 lame duck sessions since 1935, often used to address urgent concerns such as war or military issues. The only post-1998 session without pro forma sessions was in 2004 when both the Senate and President were from the same party. In the years 2002-2016, lame duck sessions focused on government funding and reauthorizations. The 76th Congress in 1940 was dominated by international concerns, with President Roosevelt requesting a large defense program and Congress enacting significant defense measures. During the longest session in history up to that point, the 76th Congress in 1940 focused on defense measures, appropriations, a military draft, income tax revisions, and related measures. Congress met regularly until January 3, 1941, with limited meetings per week. Little was undertaken during the lame duck period following the November 1940 elections, with few major new proposals sent to Capitol Hill until the 77th Congress convened in January. In 1942, Congress remained in session continuously through the election, adjourning on December 16. After a narrowed Democratic majority, Congress declined action on a war powers bill and a bill to expand the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Other pending issues included national service legislation and setting a ceiling on net personal income through the tax code. In 1942, Congress passed legislation to adjust overtime pay for government workers and provide for the military draft of 18- and 19-year-old men. Quorums became difficult to obtain by mid-December, leading to a recess before the start of the 78th Congress in January 1943. Congress later recessed for national party conventions and elections in 1944. In September 1944, Congress began a recess and returned in November until December. This marked the first separate meeting during the lame duck period after the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment. Issues debated included military training, War Powers Act extension, Social Security tax increase, and congressional reform. Postwar reconstruction and domestic programs were also discussed, with some issues deferred to the next Congress. During the 80th Congress in June 1948, various legislative actions were taken, including military training, monetary agreements, trade act changes, and Social Security system adjustments. Some measures, like a rivers and harbors bill and a pay increase for postal workers, were left incomplete. The Congress recessed with plans to reconvene in December, but President Truman called for an extraordinary session to address urgent priorities. Edward R. Stettinius Jr. was confirmed as Secretary of State during this period. During the 80th Congress in June 1948, various legislative actions were taken, including military training, monetary agreements, trade act changes, and Social Security system adjustments. President Truman called for an extraordinary session to address urgent priorities. Congress met briefly on December 31 for the shortest lame duck session under the Twentieth Amendment, approving measures to extend the life of the Hoover Commission and the Special Small Business Committee. New Members were sworn in, and the Korean War situation was critical. During the lame duck session of the 80th Congress in late November 1950, amidst the critical Korean War situation, President Truman presented 18 proposals to Congress, including urgent measures like aid to Yugoslavia and additional defense and atomic energy appropriations. During the lame duck session of the 81st Congress in 1950, Congress approved rent control extension, famine relief for Yugoslavia, defense appropriations, excess profits tax, and civil defense program. Efforts for statehood for Alaska and Hawaii were abandoned. The 81st Congress adjourned on January 2, 1951, and the 82nd Congress convened the next day. During the lame duck session of the 81st Congress in 1950, Congress approved various measures. In 1954, the Senate reconvened to consider the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy for improprieties in his inquiry into communist influence. The Senate approved the censure resolution on December 1 and adjourned on December 2. During the lame duck session of 1970, Congress focused on pending legislation including electoral reform, welfare reform, occupational safety, equal rights for women, and funding for the supersonic transport plane. Despite staying in session from November 16 to January 2, 1971, Congress failed to approve many Administration proposals, including the Family Assistance Plan. President Nixon criticized the session for not meeting his expectations. During the lame duck session of 1970, Congress focused on passing two appropriations bills, a foreign aid measure, the Clean Air Act Amendments, and a major housing bill. President Nixon vetoed four bills, including a federal manpower training bill. The session was marked by Watergate investigations, Vice President Agnew's resignation, and President Nixon's resignation and succession by President Ford. During the lame duck session of 1970, Congress focused on passing key legislation despite the Watergate investigations and President Nixon's resignation. In the following session in 1974, Congress reconvened to address legislative priorities, including approving Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President. President Ford presented a long list of legislation to be passed before the session ended in December. Congress approved the Rockefeller nomination, overrode presidential vetoes on important bills, and nullified an agreement giving Nixon control over his Administration's tapes and papers. During the lame duck session of 1980, Congress approved a trade reform bill giving the President broad authority, established a federal policy for non-nuclear energy research, and passed legislation for continuing appropriations for federal agencies. Despite large Republican gains on election day, Congress postponed budget matters until the session. In November and December 1980, Congress adopted a budget resolution, reconciliation measure, and five regular appropriations bills. During the lame duck session of 1980, Congress approved a trade reform bill, established a federal policy for non-nuclear energy research, and passed legislation for continuing appropriations for federal agencies. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan urged congressional leaders to reconvene Congress after the congressional election to consider unresolved appropriations bills. The Senate met from November 30 to December 23 and the House from November 30 to December 21, with Congressional leaders indicating they would finish nine of 10 outstanding bills. During the lame duck session of 1980, Congress completed four out of 10 outstanding money bills by the end of December. A large continuing resolution was passed to fund the remaining government operations, but a $5.4 billion jobs program was removed due to the President's veto threat. The Senate faced acrimonious sessions with frequent filibusters, including a contentious one over increasing the gasoline tax, which was approved two days before Christmas. Congress also approved a 15% pay raise for Members and passed a nuclear waste disposal bill, but an immigration reform bill stalled. In 1994, Congress recessed on October 8 and reconvened on November 29 to pass a bill implementing a new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The bill had strong support but was delayed by opponents in the Senate during the regular session. In a lame duck session, the House passed the bill on November 29 and the Senate on December 1 before adjourning sine die. In 1998, the House and Senate adjourned sine die on October 21. The House planned to reconvene in December to consider President Bill Clinton's impeachment. Speaker Newt Gingrich announced his resignation due to unexpected Republican losses. The House convened on December 17 to discuss impeachment resolutions and support for the armed forces in the Persian Gulf. On December 19, the House adopted impeachment Articles I and III. On December 19, the House impeached a President for the first time since Andrew Johnson in 1868. They also appointed House managers for the Senate impeachment trial before adjourning sine die. The 2000 lame duck session was marked by a prolonged presidential election and short election break. Congress passed short-term continuing resolutions while negotiating FY2001 appropriations measures, finally agreeing on December 15. During the lame duck session in 2000, Congress passed the omnibus appropriations bill and adjourned sine die. They also cleared several acts and sent a bankruptcy reform measure to President Clinton, who pocket vetoed it. In 2002, Congress returned to finish work on appropriations bills and create the Department of Homeland Security, a top priority for President George W. Bush. The House and Senate passed similar versions of the DHS bill before agreeing on the final version. In 2002, Congress passed the Department of Homeland Security bill, along with other significant measures like the Defense Authorization Act and Intelligence Authorization Act. The government was funded at FY2002 levels through January 11, 2003, due to a continuing resolution. Only the Defense Appropriations bill and Military Construction Appropriations bill were completed by Congress in 2002. President Bush signed the DHS bill into law on November 25. Congress convened a lame duck session in 2004 to address appropriation bills and the debt limit. In a post-election environment, Congress cleared an omnibus appropriations measure limiting domestic discretionary spending. They also reauthorized the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, placed a moratorium on internet taxation, and authorized satellite television systems to carry network programming. However, disagreements prevented reauthorizations on welfare reform, a highway bill, and the assault weapons ban. Congress used a freestanding measure to raise the debt limit. During the lame duck session, the Administration persuaded House conferees to accept modifications in provisions to consolidate intelligence activities under a new national director, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The House and Senate approved the conference report and adjourned sine die. Following an election that gave Democrats prospective control of Congress, they reconvened to consider FY2007 appropriations bills and passed funding extensions through December 8 and February 15, 2007. Congress also cleared tax benefit extensions. In February 2007, Congress passed legislation for tax benefit extensions, trade agreements with undeveloped countries and Vietnam, nuclear power development with India, U.S. Postal Service overhaul, Veterans Affairs funding, and confirmed Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. The 110th Congress reconvened in November 2008 with Democrats gaining wider majorities in both the House and Senate. The lame duck session after the 2008 election saw limited legislative activity, with Congress focusing on financial system disruptions and providing aid to automakers. Congress had previously passed a $700 billion aid package for the financial industry before the election. During the lame duck session after the 2008 election, Congress considered legislation to assist America's automakers. The House passed H.R. 7321, providing $14 billion in loans, but Senate opposition prevented a vote. President Obama later provided $13.4 billion in loans. Congress then had pro forma sessions in December and adjourned sine die in January. The Senate engaged in pro forma sessions during the 2010 election break to prevent recess appointments. Once back in session, high-profile bills received action. During the lame duck session, Congress enacted several high-profile bills, including the National Defense Authorization Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The Senate confirmed 19 federal judges, and negotiated the extension of revenue provisions such as the 2001 and 2003 income tax cuts. Additionally, Congress passed a bill to extend these provisions for two years, implement a temporary payroll tax reduction, and provide jobless benefits for 13 months. FY2011 appropriations were left incomplete, with Congress resorting to a series of continuing resolutions to fund government operations until March 4, 2011. During the lame duck session, Congress passed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act (H.R. 847) to provide health benefits to first responders exposed to toxic materials after the 9/11 attacks. The Senate also ratified the New START arms control treaty with Russia and confirmed 66 civilian nominations, including 16 federal judges. Additionally, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act, the National Defense Authorization Act, and the Intelligence Authorization Act. During the lame duck session, Congress focused on negotiations over expiring tax and spending policies, passing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) to address revenue provisions and extend certain benefits. ATRA also postponed the Budget Control Act of 2011 sequestration until March 1, 2013. Regular appropriations bills were not addressed during this session. During the 2014 lame duck session, Congress debated supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. The Senate passed a bill, but the House postponed consideration. The session followed an election where the GOP gained control of Congress. An omnibus appropriations bill, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, remained unresolved. During the 2014 lame duck session, Congress debated an omnibus bill, the \"CRomnibus,\" which funded multiple agencies through FY2015 and provided continuing appropriations for DHS. The Senate passed H.R. 83 on December 13, avoiding a government shutdown. Congress also passed the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 39) and the Tax Increase Prevention Act (H.R. 5771), which included tax credits for research and development. Additionally, the No Social Security for Nazis Act (H.R. 5739) was approved, along with the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014 (H.R. 4194) and the Chesapeake Bay Accountability and Recovery Act of 2014 (S. 1000).

Failed legislation during the session included bills on trade negotiating authority, Keystone XL pipeline approval, terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization, and online commerce taxes. The 2016 election resulted in Republican Party control of the White House, House, and Senate, leading to Congress reconvening on November 14 to address appropriations, Iran sanctions, medical research funding, and national defense issues. During the 2016 lame duck session, Congress passed several key bills including the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, the 21st Century Cures Act for medical research funding, and the National Defense Authorization Act. President Obama allowed the Iran sanctions bill to become law without his signature. The Cures Act authorized funding for medical research and an accelerated review process for new drugs and devices. The NDAA was approved after a conference committee resolved differences between the House and Senate versions. Additionally, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 extended funding from a previous bill. The Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 (H.R. 2028) extended funding for government agencies except military construction and Veterans Affairs, addressing the Flint, Michigan water crisis. Senate approval was delayed due to disagreements, but the resolution was passed on December 9, funding the government through April 28, 2017. The Senate confirmed 17 executive nominations during a 20-hour session. During the lame duck session, the Senate confirmed 17 executive nominations.
