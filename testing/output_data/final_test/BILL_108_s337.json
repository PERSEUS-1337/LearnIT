Regulation of CCA-treated wood requires disposal in a lined landfill with a leachate system to prevent arsenic contamination of groundwater. The Administrator, in consultation with the Consumer Products Safety Commission, will publish a risk assessment of CCA-treated wood by March 15, 2003, following recommended methodology by Scientific Advisory Panels. The United States Environmental Protection Agency organized panels in October 2001 to address the prohibition of production of CCA-treated wood. Regulations were to be promulgated for the cessation of production within 60 days of enactment and to prohibit production thereafter. The United States Environmental Protection Agency organized panels in October 2001 to address the prohibition of production of CCA-treated wood.
