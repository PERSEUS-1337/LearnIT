The Act titled \"Reducing Waste in National Parks Act\" focuses on establishing recycling programs and reducing the sale of water in disposable plastic bottles in units of the National Park System. Regional directors are required to consider costs, benefits, waste reduction, and infrastructure for bottle refill stations when deciding to eliminate the sale of water in disposable plastic bottles. The Act \"Reducing Waste in National Parks Act\" requires regional directors to consider various factors when deciding to eliminate the sale of water in disposable plastic bottles, including contractual implications, operational costs of bottle refill stations, availability of BPA-free containers, impact on concessioner sales revenue, water availability in concession food service operations, visitor education, and input from the National Park Service Office. The Act requires consideration of factors like input from the National Park Service Office of Public Health, feasibility of signage for bottle refill stations, safety concerns for visitors, and input from concessioners. Units that already don't sell disposable plastic water bottles can continue this practice. The superintendent of a National Park unit can choose not to sell disposable plastic water bottles if they submit an evaluation within 180 days. Each regional director must develop a visitor education strategy on water availability and recycling programs. They should also strive for continuity within the National Park System. The regional director must implement a recycling program for disposable plastic bottles consistently throughout the National Park System units. They should also conduct bi-annual evaluations to assess public response and visitor satisfaction with water availability. The regional director must implement a recycling program for disposable plastic bottles in National Park System units and conduct bi-annual evaluations on visitor satisfaction with water availability, buying behavior, public safety, and bottle collection rates. The evaluation must be submitted to the Director of the National Park Service and the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"regional director concerned\" refers to the regional director of the region where the unit is located, working with the unit's superintendent."
