These technologies can potentially remove up to 95% of CO2 emissions from industrial sources like power plants. The process involves a CO2 source facility, a sequestration site, and pipelines for transportation. Studies show optimism about the maturity of pipeline technology for CO2 sequestration. Studies show varying opinions on the need for significant investments in CO2 pipeline infrastructure for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in the United States. Some studies suggest that most CO2 sources are near sequestration sites, reducing the need for large pipeline networks. However, other regionally-focused studies indicate that substantial CO2 pipeline requirements could pose a challenge for CCS implementation in certain areas. The uncertainty surrounding CO2 pipeline needs introduces complexity to overall CCS cost estimates and may hinder capital investment in electricity generation. In the 110th Congress, there is a focus on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in electricity generation. There is a growing perception that a national CCS program may require a network of CO2 pipelines. The Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Study Act of 2007 (S. 2144) and America's Climate Security Act of 2007 (S. 2191) aim to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such pipelines. The Carbon Capture and Storage Technology Act of 2007, introduced by Senator John Kerry, requires evaluation of cost-efficient ways to integrate CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires recommendations for CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. This report examines uncertainties in CO2 pipeline requirements for CCS in the United States. The report discusses key factors influencing CO2 pipeline configuration for major power plants, emphasizing the importance of coal-fired plants as initial candidates for CCS due to their significant CO2 emissions. It highlights the implications of uncertain pipeline requirements for evolving federal policies on carbon control and the challenge of establishing a cost-effective CO2 pipeline network. In the context of CCS, predicting pipeline routes is challenging due to uncertainty about geological formations' suitability for CO2 sequestration and their proximity to emission sources. Analysts suggest storing captured CO2 in centralized reservoirs initially to reduce leakage risks. The Department of Energy estimates that the United States has enough capacity to store CO2 for tens to hundreds of years in specific formations like saline aquifers. Large-scale CO2 experiments are needed to gather detailed data on potential sequestration reservoirs, as policy discussions envision various scenarios for a CO2 pipeline network development. If CO2 can be sequestered near emission sources, a decentralized CO2 pipeline network may evolve. A decentralized CO2 pipeline network may develop with individual facilities connecting directly to nearby sequestration sites. Alternatively, a centralized network of interconnected long-distance pipelines could be established, including high-capacity trunk lines. Another scenario involves CO2 sequestration at active oil fields for enhanced oil recovery. The Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) is part of a network of state agencies, universities, and organizations assessing CCS approaches. The configuration of CO2 pipeline networks and associated costs will impact which CCS policies best serve the public interest. Different scenarios for CO2 pipeline development in the MRCSP region are outlined, considering varied CO2 sources and potential sequestration sites. The Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) has identified key CO2 sources and geologic formations suitable for carbon sequestration in its seven-state region. The region includes 11 coal-fired power plants emitting over 9 million metric tons of CO2 annually. The Rose Run sandstone is identified as a potential carbon sequestration site. The Rose Run sandstone, identified by the MRCSP as a potential carbon sequestration site, could allow for CO2 injection sites near power plants. If viable, some plants may inject CO2 directly below their facilities, reducing CCS pipeline requirements. A hypothetical pipeline layout assumes a 25-mile reserve area for each plant's sequestration site within the Rose Run formation. The plant is connected to the sequestration field by a trunk pipeline capable of carrying peak CO2 output. Smaller pipelines distribute CO2 to injection wells. The longest trunk pipeline is 32 miles, with an average of 11 miles. Capital costs for an 11-mile pipeline with a capacity of 10 million tons annually would be around $6 million. Levelized cost would be approximately $0.10 per ton of transported CO2. The Rose Run formation, identified as a potential sequestration site, may have limitations due to its low permeability and thickness. Geologists suggest that not all emitted CO2 in the region can be efficiently sequestered there. Additionally, injecting pressurized CO2 into the formation could potentially induce minor earthquakes along undetected faults. Faults and fractures may offer additional sequestration capacity but can also act as permeable conduits. The Rose Run formation may not be suitable for large-scale CO2 sequestration due to potential leakage pathways through faults and fractures. If the goal is to sequester CO2 from all major sources in the region, alternative sites like unmineable coal beds, oil and gas fields, and the Mount Simon sandstone may need to be considered. The MRCSP region includes unmineable coal beds that may be suitable for CO2 sequestration, potentially increasing natural gas availability through enhanced coal-bed methane recovery. However, the capacity for storing CO2 in coal beds is limited compared to the Rose Run sandstone, and the feasibility of this method is untested. Environmental concerns may arise from removing groundwater prior to injection, and coal swelling from CO2 injection could reduce storage capacity. The MRCSP region includes oil and gas fields with potential for CO2 sequestration, but their capacity may not be sufficient to store emissions from power plants over a 30-year period. The MRCSP region's oil and gas fields may not have enough capacity to store power plant emissions over 30 years due to challenges like multiple pipeline networks, historical boreholes, and leakage risks from old wells. This could increase CO2 transportation costs and complexity, reducing the economic CCS sequestration potential in these fields. The Mt. Simon formation is a potential CO2 sequestration site in the MRCSP region due to its larger capacity and less fractured nature compared to other formations. Hypothetical CO2 pipelines may be needed to transport CO2 from major power plants to the Mt. Simon formation. The Mt. Simon formation is a potential CO2 sequestration site in the MRCSP region. A 25-mile diameter reserve area is needed for each plant's sequestration site, with pipelines ranging from 130 to 294 miles in length. Estimated capital costs for the pipelines range from $70 million to $180 million, with an average cost of $150 million. The average levelized cost would be approximately $2.00 per ton of transported CO2. The number of pipelines needed depends on the proximity of plants to sequester their emissions. The Mt. Simon formation in the MRCSP region requires large, integrated CO2 pipeline networks to link multiple sources together. Future work may suggest locating sequestration sites in thicker parts of the formation to accommodate the high volumes of CO2 generated by power plants, necessitating longer pipelines. The Mt. Simon scenario is less favorable in terms of cost and siting requirements compared to the Rose Run scenario, but it may not be the worst case scenario in overall pipeline requirements. The MRCSP pipeline scenarios highlight important policy considerations such as CO2 pipeline costs, siting challenges, and differences in sequestration potential among regions. CO2 transportation costs are influenced by pipeline length, which varies based on sequestration site viability. Different assumptions about sequestration sites in the MRCSP region can lead to significant differences in CO2 pipeline lengths and capital costs. CCS schemes have potential variability in CO2 pipeline costs due to various factors. The IPCC estimates total costs of CO2 mitigation at $31-$71 per ton of CO2 avoided for a new coal power plant, with pipeline costs ranging from $0 to $5 per ton. Recent steel price increases could push pipeline costs above this range. Despite accounting for a modest share of carbon control costs (7%-16%), national deployment of CCS technology could result in billions of dollars in CO2 pipeline costs. CO2 pipeline costs could reach billions of dollars, posing challenges for power plants in securing financing and regulatory approval. For example, a proposal for a new coal-fired power plant in Minnesota was rejected due to the high cost of a 450-mile CO2 pipeline to an EOR site in Alberta, exceeding $635 million. This highlights the importance of minimizing costs while achieving environmental objectives in CCS schemes. The rejection of a costly coal-fired power plant project in Minnesota due to high CO2 pipeline costs may impact regional electricity supply. Analysts debate whether future CO2 pipeline costs will be offset by new power plant construction near sequestration sites. However, recent network cost models suggest that electricity transmission costs generally outweigh CO2 pipeline costs in new construction. Analysts have concluded that a power system with significant amounts of CCS requires a large CO2 pipeline infrastructure. Siting approval for CO2 pipelines is regulated by states and may face public opposition, especially in populated or environmentally sensitive areas. Siting approval for CO2 pipelines may be facilitated by easements for infrastructure like gas pipelines. Questions arise regarding easement holders' rights, compensation, and the ability to sell or lease easements to CO2 pipeline companies. Challenges increase with larger, interconnected pipeline systems crossing state lines. A widespread interstate CO2 pipeline network may require new federal initiatives. Transporting CO2 to distant locations can incur significant costs for carbon control. Transporting CO2 to distant locations can impose significant additional costs on a facility's carbon control infrastructure. Facility owners may seek regulatory approval for multiple sequestration sites near their facilities, leading to competition for favorable locations like the Rose Run formation. The prioritization of sequestration sites and competition for them could create economic disparities among facilities. Identifying and validating sequestration sites must consider CO2 pipeline costs to fully understand the economics. Proposals like S. 2323 aim to evaluate CO2 capture, sequestration, and transportation costs for understanding the economics of potential sites. Challenges may arise in identifying, permitting, and monitoring localized sequestration reservoirs for widespread CCS implementation. Geologists recognize varying carbon sequestration potential across different regions in the United States. For example, a study found that geologic sequestration may not be feasible in North Carolina but could be viable if CO2 is transported elsewhere for storage. If national CCS policies are implemented, states like North Carolina may face challenges due to limited sequestration potential and high CO2 emissions from coal or natural gas. The Duke study estimated a $5 billion cost to build an interstate pipeline network for transporting CO2 from North Carolina to sequestration sites in other states. Some stakeholders are concerned about the high costs and extensive pipeline requirements for states lacking geological formations suitable for large-scale CO2 sequestration. Some stakeholders are concerned about high CO2 transportation costs potentially increasing electricity prices in regions with limited sequestration potential. This could particularly impact states like Massachusetts, which already have high electricity prices. The distribution of CO2 transportation costs across the United States and its implications for regional economies may become an issue for Congress. Efficient development of public infrastructure is crucial for policymakers in the context of a national CCS program. In the context of a national CCS program, there are uncertainties about the cost and configuration of CO2 pipelines needed to meet environmental goals. Understanding ways to minimize the cost and environmental impact of this infrastructure may benefit all stakeholders. Questions about the development and allocation of sequestration capacity under a national CCS policy are raised, including how individual companies may have to spend to transport their CO2 depending on where it needs to go. Access to viable sequestration reservoirs for CO2 source facilities remains unclear. The development of a national CO2 pipeline network raises uncertainties about access, timing, and conditions for facilities. Congressional attention is needed to refine policy decisions that could impact billions of dollars in capital investment."
