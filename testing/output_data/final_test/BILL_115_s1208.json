    "content": "The Act titled \"Strengthening the Department of Homeland Security Secure Mail Initiative Act\" defines terms such as Hold for Pickup service, Signature Confirmation service, Immigration Examinations Fee Account, Postal Service, and Secretary of Homeland Security. It also addresses the offering of Hold for Pickup and Signature Confirmation services under the Secure Mail Initiative. The Secretary will offer Hold for Pickup or Signature Confirmation services for documents sent under the Secure Mail Initiative, with a fee set to cover all costs and administration fees. The Secretary will allocate fees collected for immigration services to cover costs and administration. The Postal Service may create regulations to minimize service costs. The Postal Service must notify the Secretary of any changes to the Hold for Pickup or Signature Confirmation services. If a private carrier can offer better service and value than the Postal Service, the Secretary may discontinue Postal Service use and contract with the private carrier. The Secretary may enter into a contract with a private carrier for document delivery under the Secure Mail Initiative if the carrier offers similar services to Hold for Pickup and Signature Confirmation. The Secure Mail Initiative allows a person to elect a service by paying a fee to a private carrier for document delivery. The fee covers the full contracting and administrative costs, with collected fees deposited into the Immigration Examinations Fees Account. The Secure Mail Initiative allows individuals to choose a service by paying a fee to a private carrier for document delivery. A report must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, detailing the implementation of requirements, the fees imposed, and the frequency of service usage. The Act directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to offer the option for individuals receiving documents through the Secure Mail Initiative to choose delivery via Hold for Pickup or Signature Confirmation services by the United States Postal Service."
