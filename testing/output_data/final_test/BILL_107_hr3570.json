    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lewis and Clark Voyage of Scientific Discovery Act\" and includes a Long-Term Monitoring Program. Establishment of a program at the River Studies Center in Missouri to monitor biological and chemical characteristics of the Missouri River, its interrelationship with hydrology and geomorphology, and assess biota and water quality. Collaboration with the United States Geological Survey for program development. The program at the River Studies Center in Missouri will consult with various stakeholders and provide scientific information to guide the management of the Missouri River, including monitoring biota and water quality. The program at the River Studies Center in Missouri focuses on investigating cause and effect relationships, identifying methods to conserve fish and wildlife, establishing a baseline for future activities, and creating a database on Missouri River biota. The database includes information on threatened or endangered species, habitats, and water quality, and is made readily available to the public. The Secretary of the Interior is required to report on the program every 3 years. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Director of the US Geological Survey, must review and adjust the objectives of the program at the River Studies Center in Missouri every 3 years. A report on the environmental health of the Missouri River must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of the Interior is also required to enter into contracts with Indian Tribes along the Missouri River for environmental restoration tasks that complement existing activities. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $6,500,000 for fiscal year 2002\n- $8,500,000 for fiscal year 2003\n- $15,100,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2016\n- Allocation of funds: \n  - Not more than 25% of funds to be directed to the River Studies Center in Missouri in fiscal year 2002. In Missouri, funding allocation for the River Studies Center increased from 25% in 2002 to 65% after 2003. At least 50% of funds post-2003 go to the Center, with the rest supporting monitoring activities by State fish and wildlife agencies in the Missouri River basin. $1,500,000 annually is earmarked for threatened and endangered species under the Secretary of the Interior. The funding allocated for the River Studies Center in Missouri increased significantly after 2003, with a portion supporting monitoring activities by State fish and wildlife agencies in the Missouri River basin. Funds are authorized for the Secretary of the Interior and State agencies to conduct investigations on endangered fish, including pallid sturgeon response to reservoir operations. State agency funding will be used to contract for field data collection and support field operations for the monitoring program. The focused investigations component will be funded through a competitive process. The directors of State fish and game agencies, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, will prioritize information needs for Missouri River fish and wildlife. They will issue a request for proposals to organizations with Missouri River expertise and select proposals for funding."
