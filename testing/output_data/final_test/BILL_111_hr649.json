    "content": "The \"Ultrasound Informed Consent Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes the addition of a new section titled \"TITLE XXX--INFORMED CONSENT\" with defined terms. The term 'abortion' is defined as the intentional termination of an unborn child's life or a woman's pregnancy, with exceptions for live birth, preserving child's life, removing ectopic pregnancy, or addressing specific circumstances. An 'abortion provider' is someone legally qualified to perform abortions under Federal and State laws. The term 'unborn child' refers to a human at any stage before birth, 'woman' is a female human regardless of age, and 'unemancipated minor' is a minor under parental control as per State law. \"Requirement of informed consent for human subjects.\" Prior to performing an abortion, providers must comply with ultrasound requirements including performing an ultrasound, explaining the results, displaying the images to the patient, and providing a medical description of the images. The ultrasound requirements for abortion include checking for fetal cardiac activity, external members, and internal organs. Women are not required to view the ultrasound images and neither the provider nor the woman will face penalties for refusing to do so. \"Exception for medical emergencies.\" The provision exempts abortion providers from certain regulations if the abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury related to the pregnancy. The provider must certify the medical conditions supporting this decision in the woman's medical file to avoid penalties for falsification. Penalties under section 3004 for non-compliance with this title apply. \"Penalties for failure to comply with this title are outlined in section 3004.\" An abortion provider who willfully fails to comply with this title may face civil penalties in federal court. The Attorney General can initiate a civil action for non-compliance. For a first offense, a court can impose a civil penalty of up to $100,000 and notify the state medical licensing authority. Repeat offenses result in higher penalties and further notifications to the state medical board. The court can assess a civil penalty of up to $250,000 against an abortion provider for willful violations of the law. A pregnant woman or her guardian can also file a civil action for damages against the provider for any violations. SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act does not override any State law that requires greater disclosure on abortion than what is outlined in this Act.\n\nSEC. 4. SEVERABILITY.\n\nThe provisions of this Act are separable, and if any part is deemed unconstitutional, it will not affect the rest of the Act."
