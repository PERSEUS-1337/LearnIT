The study also explores the utility analysis of intermediate-layer network architectures for point cloud processing, emphasizing the visualization and diagnosis of representations in deep neural networks. Our study explores the utility of intermediate-layer network architectures in diagnosing the information-processing logic of DNNs. Quantitative evaluation of representations has been conducted in recent studies to understand neural networks better and guide model compression. The information-bottleneck theory explains the trade-off between information compression and discrimination power in neural networks. The method extends the technical foundation of Ma et al. (2019) to diagnose DNNs by quantifying input information discarding during layerwise forward propagation. It computes the entropy of input information given a specific feature of an intermediate layer, assuming similarity between features representing the same object concept. The conditional entropy of input information given a specific feature is calculated, considering maximum perturbation added to X following the maximum-entropy principle. The method quantifies input information discarding in DNNs during layerwise forward propagation by computing the entropy of input information given a specific feature of an intermediate layer. It decomposes the overall entropy into point-wise entropies, where each point's entropy quantifies how much information can be discarded. Two metrics are used: information discarding (measured at the point level) and information concentration, which is based on the former. The study focuses on information discarding in DNNs, analyzing their ability to maintain task-related input information and discard irrelevant data. Adversarial attacks are performed against incorrect classes to measure adversarial robustness. The neighborhood inconsistency metric evaluates a DNN's ability to assign similar attention to neighboring points during feature computation.

Architecture 1 reweights features based on local density information. Architecture 1 reweights features using local density information, while Architecture 2 reweights features based on local coordinates. Architecture 3 focuses on multi-scale contextual information to extract features at different scales. Architecture 3 concatenates multi-scale features to obtain f using a function for feature extraction. Architecture 4 focuses on orientation information using a special convolution operator. Hypothesis 1 suggests that Architecture 1 increases adversarial robustness, based on the performance of PointConv. Studies compare PointConv, PointNet++, and Point2Sequence. The text discusses the comparison of different versions of PointConv, PointNet++, and Point2Sequence networks with and without Architecture 1 modules. Architecture 1 is added or removed at specific nonlinear transformation layers in each network for evaluation. Architecture 1 is added behind the last nonlinear transformation layer in Point2Sequence. Architecture 2 in PointConv increases rotation robustness. Comparative studies are conducted on PointConv, PointNet++, and Point2Sequence with and without Architecture 2 modules. In PointConv, different versions include PointNet++ with Architecture 2 added after specific layers, Point2Sequence with Architecture 2 added after the last layer, and Architecture 3 for increased robustness and consistency. The comparative studies on Point2Sequence and PointNet++ involve multi-scale contextual information encoding. PointNet++ utilizes Architecture 3 for feature extraction at three scales, while Point2Sequence concatenates features of 4 scales in the baseline network. The hypothesis is based on PointSIFT's rotation robustness due to Architecture 4. Experimental studies were conducted to verify the hypothesis that Architecture 4 improves rotation robustness in DNNs. Results showed that Architecture 2 and Architecture 4 led to lower rotation non-robustness values, indicating improved performance. See Appendix F for classification accuracy details. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we applied it to diagnose six widely used DNNs trained on three benchmark datasets. Four comparative experiments were conducted, including analyzing DNNs using five metrics and verifying the effects of different network architectures on rotation robustness, adversarial robustness, and neighborhood inconsistency. A new dataset was generated to analyze the information concentration of DNNs. The curr_chunk discusses the generation of background data for point cloud classification datasets. It mentions the steps taken to create the background and the release of the dataset. Additionally, it introduces an entropy-based method for quantifying information discarding in specific object feature spaces. The method involves adding random noise to the feature space for point cloud processing. The curr_chunk discusses extending the entropy-based method to point cloud processing by selecting the same set of points as contexts. Experiment 1 quantifies the representation capacity of DNNs by measuring information discarding, concentration, rotation robustness, and neighborhood inconsistency. PointNet and Point2Sequence show higher values of information discarding compared to PointConv and PointSIFT. Experiment 2 focused on rotation robustness, with Architecture 2 and Architecture 4 showing improvements. Experiment 3 examined adversarial robustness, with Architecture 1 and Architecture 3 enhancing this aspect. Additionally, Architecture 3 demonstrated increased adversarial robustness with a higher scale number of features. Experiment 4 investigated neighborhood inconsistency. In Experiment 4, the effects of neighborhood inconsistency were verified using k-NN search to select 16 neighbors for each point. Networks with Architecture 3 generally had lower neighborhood inconsistency, and DNNs with features from more scales exhibited lower inconsistency. The study confirmed the utility of specific network architectures for 3D point cloud processing, including rotation robustness, adversarial robustness, and neighborhood inconsistency. Architecture 2 and Architecture 4 improved rotation robustness, while Architecture 1 and Architecture 3 enhanced adversarial robustness. Architecture 3 was particularly effective in reducing neighborhood inconsistency. In this Appendix, detailed comparative studies on network architectures for 3D point cloud processing are provided. Sections B to G cover various aspects such as the use of a special element-wise max operator, DNNs, different versions of DNNs for comparison, extending entropy-based methods to point cloud processing, accuracy comparisons, and related work on learning interpretable representations. The element-wise max operator is highlighted for aggregating neighboring points' features into a local feature. In this section, the element-wise max operator is used to aggregate neighboring points' features into a local feature. Different DNNs like PointNet++, PointConv, Point2Sequence, and PointSIFT are briefly introduced for comparative studies. The SA module consists of the Sampling layer, Grouping layer, MLP, and Maxpooling layer. It selects a subset of points using farthest point sampling, constructs local regions, transforms features, and encodes them into local features for the upper SA module. The baseline network of PointConv is composed of five blocks, each consisting of a Sampling layer, Grouping layer, MLP, Architecture 1, Architecture 2, and Conv layer. Sampling layer uses farthest point sampling to select points, Grouping layer finds neighboring points, and MLP transforms features into higher dimensions. PointConv utilizes density information and local 3D coordinates to reweight features learned by MLP, followed by a 1x1 convolution for output computation. Point2Sequence involves multi-scale area establishment, area feature extraction, encoder-decoder feature aggregation, local region feature aggregation, and shape classification. Farthest point sampling algorithm is used to define centroids of local regions in Point2Sequence. Point2Sequence utilizes X = {x j } to define centroids of local regions {N(j)}. Different scale areas {A(j) \u2208 R d} are processed by MLP and Maxpooling layers. A feature sequence f is aggregated into a d-dimensional feature rj using an LSTM network with an attention mechanism. A 1024-dimensional global feature is aggregated from all local region features for shape classification. The network architecture details can be found in Table 9. PointSIFT (Qi et al., 2018) introduces Architecture 4, a special orientation encoding unit, within a hierarchical structure similar to PointNet++. This unit learns an orientation-aware feature for each point by selecting 8-nearest points from eight octants. Unlike unordered operators, Architecture 4 is an ordered operator that processes features of neighboring points residing in a 2x2x2 cube. The features of 8-nearest neighboring points are described in a 2x2x2 cube for local pattern analysis. Different versions of PointNet++ are compared, including variations in architecture and layers such as Sample and Group. The three-stage operator Conv oe is used for convolution along the x, y, and z axes. The three-stage convolution Conv oe is used for convolution along the x, y, and z axes in PointNet++. Architecture 4 learns orientation-aware features for each point x i, which are then fed to SA modules for contextual information extraction. Different versions of PointNet++ are compared, including Architecture 1, Architecture 2, Architecture 3, and Architecture 4. Architecture 1 reweights the output of MLPs with learned weights. The study compared different architectures in PointNet++. Architecture 1 reweighted MLP outputs, Architecture 2 added modules after MLPs, and Architecture 4 added a module before the last layer for rotation robustness testing. Architecture 1 had 16 hidden units in two layers, Architecture 2 had 32 hidden units in a single layer. Architecture 4 learned orientation-aware features for contextual information extraction.
