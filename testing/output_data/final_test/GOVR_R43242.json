    "content": "Some Members of Congress and policy experts claim that countries like China and Japan are purposefully weakening their currency to boost exports, which harms U.S. producers and jobs. Concerns about currency manipulation persist even after the global financial crisis, with some policymakers worried about unfair trade advantages. Economists are divided on the significance of \"currency manipulation.\" Some Members of Congress are skeptical about the significance of \"currency manipulation\" and its impact on the U.S. economy. Legislation has been enacted to address concerns about exchange rate policies of other countries, with provisions included in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (P.L. 114-125) included provisions on currency manipulation. Debates on exchange rates have arisen in the 115th Congress regarding NAFTA and the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement. This report discusses current global exchange rate debates, how exchange rates function, specific disagreements, existing frameworks for addressing currency disputes, and policy options for Congress. Exchange rates are used to convert one currency into another. For example, in January 2018, one U.S. dollar could be exchanged for 0.83 euros, 112 Japanese yen, or 0.74 British pounds. Consumers use exchange rates to calculate the cost of goods produced in other countries. The value of a currency relative to another is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is significant, with trading averaging $5.1 trillion per day in April 2016. Demand for currencies is influenced by international capital flows and government policies. Exchange rates impact trade flows by affecting the price of exports and imports. When a currency depreciates, exports become cheaper for foreigners and imports become more expensive for domestic consumers, leading to an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. Conversely, when a currency appreciates, exports become more expensive for foreigners and imports become cheaper for domestic consumers, resulting in a decrease in exports and an increase in imports. Exchange rates impact international investment in two ways. Firstly, they determine the value of existing overseas investments. When a currency depreciates, the value of investments denominated in that currency falls for overseas investors, and vice versa. For example, a U.S. investor holding a German government bond denominated in euros would see the value of the bond in U.S. dollars decrease if the euro depreciates. Secondly, exchange rates affect the flow of investment across borders. Exchange rates impact the flow of investment across borders by shaping investors' future expectations about currency value. If a currency is expected to depreciate, overseas investors may be reluctant to invest in assets denominated in that currency. Conversely, an appreciating currency makes assets denominated in that currency more attractive to overseas investors. Some governments \"float\" their currencies, allowing the price to fluctuate based on supply and demand. Some countries allow their currency to fluctuate based on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. Others fix their exchange rate to another currency or commodity, using policies to control the value. Central banks may intervene to maintain the set price. Fixed rates offer more certainty in transactions but can pose challenges. Floating exchange rates provide more unpredictability in international transactions and may deter trade and investment, but make it easier for the economy to adjust to economic conditions. Many countries opt for a hybrid policy, allowing their currency to fluctuate while taking action to prevent significant deviations from a target value. The optimal choice depends on the country's characteristics and level of interconnectedness. In the early 1970s, the United States abandoned its peg to gold and floated the dollar, leading to other countries floating their currencies as well. In 2016, 36% of countries had floating currencies, including major ones like the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. Some countries manage their currency value more than others, with 42% using a \"soft\" peg in 2014. In 2014, 42% of countries used a \"soft\" peg, allowing exchange rate fluctuations within a desired range, while 13% used a \"hard\" peg, anchoring the currency's value more strictly. No large country uses a hard peg. Exchange rate misalignment occurs when the actual rate differs from its fundamental value, with overvaluation and undervaluation being the outcomes. Some economists debate currency misalignment based on exchange rate differences between government-set rates and market rates. Governments with fixed exchange rates may have misaligned currencies, while floating currencies are seen as less likely to be misaligned. Others argue that even floating currencies can be misaligned if their value deviates from long-term economic fundamentals. Economists disagree on determining an equilibrium exchange rate based on economic fundamentals, with various models used to calculate misalignments. Disagreements over exchange rate policies heightened post-global financial crisis, with Brazil's finance minister declaring a \"currency war\" in 2010. A \"currency war\" has erupted in the global economy, with concerns about exchange rates persisting despite the recovery. Disagreements arise over whether countries are intentionally devaluing their currency to gain a trade advantage. A weak currency can boost exports and job creation in the export sector but may harm exporters in other countries by making their goods relatively more expensive. Domestic firms producing import-competing goods may also struggle to compete. Some economists view efforts to boost exports through a weaker exchange rate as \"unfair\" to other countries and a type of \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policy. This view is rooted in the experience of countries devaluing their currencies in the 1930s to boost exports during times of high unemployment and negative economic conditions. The devaluations in the 1930s, known as \"competitive devaluations,\" were seen as detrimental to international trade and exacerbated the Great Depression. Some economists argue that currency wars and competitive devaluations post-2008 financial crisis may not necessarily be bad for the global economy, as they can stimulate short-term economic growth through expansionary monetary policies. Currency interventions may not result in a net change in exchange rate levels and can help boost global economic growth. Weak currencies in one country can benefit consumers and businesses in other countries by making imports cheaper and lowering production costs. The competitive devaluations of the 1930s are argued to have helped end the Great Depression, contrary to popular belief. Concerns have been raised about countries engaging in interventions in foreign currency markets to weaken their currencies. Governments can use mechanisms like selling domestic currency for foreign currency to devalue their currency. The foreign currency is usually invested in foreign assets, such as government bonds. Concerns have been raised about currency interventions, particularly by China, to maintain an undervalued currency against the U.S. dollar. This practice has also been observed in other countries like Switzerland. The Chinese government tightly manages the value of the renminbi (RMB) against the U.S. dollar, leading to accusations of unfair trade advantages and contributing to the U.S. trade deficit with China. China's currency, the RMB, was pegged to the U.S. dollar from 1994 to 2005, then moved to a managed peg system. The RMB appreciated by over 20% against the dollar between 2005 and 2015, with the Chinese government implementing various policies to manage this. The Chinese government managed the appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar through various policies, including printing yuan and selling it for U.S. currency and assets like government bonds. Capital controls were also used to limit RMB buying and selling. This led to a significant increase in foreign exchange reserves from $659 billion in 2005 to $3.9 trillion in 2014. Some economists believe this indicates the RMB was kept undervalued compared to a freely floating currency. Policymakers and analysts have questioned if the yuan is still undervalued against the dollar. In 2015, the IMF stated that the yuan is no longer undervalued against the U.S. dollar. China's central bank announced more market-oriented RMB parity values. China sold foreign exchange reserves to prevent currency depreciation due to slower growth rates. The currency depreciated in 2015 and 2016 but appreciated in 2017. Treasury Department estimates show reduced interventions in the foreign exchange market in 2017 to support the RMB value. Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea have intervened in currency markets in recent years to weaken their currencies. Japan's interventions in 2010 and 2011 were supported by other G-7 countries due to a crisis in Japan. New Zealand intervened in May 2013 to stem the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. South Korea has also intervened to hold down the value of the won, with estimated net purchases of $9 billion in 2017. In recent years, Switzerland, Taiwan, and 20 other countries intervened in currency markets to manage their currencies. Switzerland intervened to limit the Swiss franc's appreciation during the Eurozone crisis but resumed allowing it to float freely in 2015. Taiwan intervenes more frequently to resist the appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar. According to a study, 20 countries aggressively intervened to keep their currencies undervalued from 2003 to 2013. Several countries, including China, Japan, and Singapore, have been actively intervening in foreign exchange markets to lower the value of their currencies. Economists have different views on the consequences of these interventions, with some arguing that it boosts exports at the expense of other countries. A study by economists at the PIIE estimated that currency interventions have increased the U.S. trade deficit by $200 billion to $500 billion per year and cost the U.S. economy between 1 million and 5 million jobs. The United States lost 1 million jobs between 2009 and 2014 due to interventions in foreign exchange markets. Some economists doubt that these interventions have negative effects on other countries, arguing that they do not significantly impact overall employment or output levels. They also question the long-lasting effects of currency interventions on exchange rates, suggesting that international capital flows and other economic fundamentals play a larger role in determining exchange rate levels. Some economists argue that currency interventions may or may not be fair policies, as they can have varying effects on exchange rates. Factors to consider include whether the government intervenes to strengthen or weaken its currency, with \"two-way\" interventions possibly indicating a pegged exchange rate close to its equilibrium value. On the other hand, \"one-way\" interventions (always selling domestic currency) may suggest a different motive behind the government's actions. Interventions to sustain a currency below its fundamental value can be periodic or sustained. Periodic interventions can smooth short-term fluctuations and build reserves, while sustained interventions may distort the global economy. Governments can either increase domestic money supply or sterilize interventions. Unsterilized interventions allow money supply to increase, while some countries like China do not allow this. When countries intervene in currency markets, they can choose to sterilize the intervention by selling government bonds to offset the increase in money supply. This can impact domestic demand and inflation in the medium term, potentially affecting exchange rates. The exchange rate falls due to government intervention in foreign exchange markets and expansionary monetary policies. Monetary policy involves controlling the money supply by adjusting interest rates and buying/selling government bonds. Increasing the money supply can devalue a currency, as seen with the British pound. Emerging markets like Brazil criticized the US, UK, and Eurozone for their expansionary monetary policies post-2008 financial crisis. US policymakers also raised concerns about Japan's monetary policies in 2012-2013. In late 2012 and early 2013, the US, UK, and Eurozone implemented expansionary monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis. This included cutting interest rates and using quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. Quantitative easing involves expanding the money supply through government purchases of assets, such as government bonds. Some emerging markets criticized these policies, arguing that they devalued their currencies. Expansionary policies in developed countries caused their currencies to depreciate against emerging markets. For instance, Brazil's real appreciated by over 25% against the dollar due to quantitative easing. This led to Brazil imposing capital controls to prevent further appreciation. Policymakers argue that the monetary policies were aimed at combating recession domestically, with currency effects being unintended consequences. During a Senate Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, emphasized that the Federal Reserve is not involved in a currency war or targeting the value of the U.S. dollar. Monetary policy is used to achieve domestic economic objectives such as high employment and price stability. Concerns of emerging markets about the effects of quantitative easing have subsided as developed countries roll back expansionary monetary policies. Brazil's real has weakened substantially against the U.S. dollar, prompting concerns from the government about the real becoming too weak. In August 2013, concerns were raised about the weakening Brazilian real, leading to intervention in foreign currency markets to strengthen the currency. Emerging-market economies discussed the potential impact of quantitative easing policy changes at the September 2013 G-20 summit. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe implemented \"Abenomics\" to boost the economy, focusing on expansionary monetary policies, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms. Japan's central bank implemented expansionary monetary policies in 2013, aiming to double the monetary base and increase its holdings of government bonds. This loose monetary policy led to a sharp depreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. Concerns were raised by other countries about the weakening yen, with Russia expressing worries in 2013. In 2013, concerns were raised about Japan's weakening yen, with warnings from the Russian central bank and China's sovereign wealth fund. South Korea's finance minister also expressed concerns about the impact on their economy. Members of Congress raised concerns about Japan's currency policies in the context of the proposed TPP. The IMF estimated the yen was \"moderately overvalued\" in January 2012. In January 2012, the IMF estimated that the Japanese yen was \"moderately overvalued.\" Japan's monetary policies aim to combat deflation, not manipulate currencies. Controversy over exchange rate policies eased in 2016 and 2017 as the yen strengthened. Debate exists over whether expansionary monetary policies have negatively impacted other economies. Most economists agree that expansionary monetary policies in developed countries are designed to stimulate domestic economies and may cause prices to rise in the medium term. This could lead to little effect on the real exchange rate, even if the nominal exchange rate falls in the short term. Inflation in these countries remains low, and some argue that these policies stimulate domestic consumption and investment. Some economists argue that expansionary monetary policies stimulate domestic consumption and investment, leading to higher imports from other countries. The net effect of quantitative easing on trading partners can be positive, as seen with substantial output gains from the first round of easing in the US. The question of whether these policies are \"fair\" or \"unfair\" in the context of \"currency wars\" arises, with a debate on the appropriateness of countries adopting such policies to combat domestic recessions, even if it may adversely affect sectors in other countries in the short run. Some economists argue for expansionary monetary policies to address economic recessions, while others emphasize the need for a holistic approach considering potential negative spillover effects on other countries. Concerns about currency manipulation have led to legislation addressing this issue, such as the \"Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988.\" The \"Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988\" was enacted as part of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 in response to concerns about the U.S. dollar appreciation and trade deficits. The act requires the analysis of foreign exchange rate policies annually, in consultation with the IMF, to determine if manipulation is occurring for unfair trade advantages. If manipulation is found in countries with currency and trade surpluses with the U.S., negotiations are initiated through the IMF or bilaterally. The Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988 requires the Treasury Secretary to negotiate exchange rate adjustments to eliminate unfair trade advantages. The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on currency policies of major trade competitors and testify as needed. The Act was enacted in response to concerns about the U.S. dollar appreciation and trade deficits. Since the 1988 Trade Act, the Treasury has identified China, Taiwan, and South Korea as currency manipulators. Congress addresses currency manipulation in trade promotion authority legislation, granting the President authority to enter trade agreements under expedited procedures. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 granted \"fast track\" authority. The Trade Act of 1988 granted \"fast track\" authority to the President and required a report to Congress on trade agreements, including efforts to achieve international exchange rate equilibrium. The Trade Act of 2002 renewed this authority and prioritized addressing exchange rate issues in trade agreements, including mechanisms to examine currency manipulation by foreign governments. Several free trade agreements were negotiated under the 2002 version of the Trade Act. The 2002 Trade Act prioritized addressing exchange rate issues in trade agreements, with several FTAs negotiated. The 2015 Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act includes objectives on currency manipulation in trade agreements. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act addresses currency manipulation through provisions to enhance engagement on exchange rates and economic policies with major trading partners. The Act also includes negotiating objectives on establishing accountability against unfair currency practices through various means. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act includes new reporting requirements for Treasury on macroeconomic and currency exchange rate policies for major trading partners of the United States. If a country with a significant trade surplus fails to correct currency undervaluation after a year of engagement, the President can take actions such as prohibiting financing from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act allows the President to take actions such as prohibiting financing from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation for countries with significant trade surpluses that fail to correct currency undervaluation after a year of engagement. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act allows the President to take actions, including prohibiting financing for countries with significant trade surpluses that do not correct currency undervaluation. The Act also establishes a Monitoring List for major trading partners and creates an Advisory Committee on International Exchange Rate Policy. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act allows the President to take actions to address currency manipulation. A committee of nine members, appointed by the President, focuses on international monetary stability and exchange rate policies. The IMF, with 188 member countries, plays a role in monitoring exchange rate policies. The IMF, including the United States, have commitments to refrain from manipulating exchange rates for unfair trade advantage. Member countries can choose their exchange rate system but must promote economic growth and financial stability. The IMF monitors exchange rate policies to prevent manipulation. The IMF, including the United States, have commitments to refrain from manipulating exchange rates for unfair trade advantage. Member countries can choose their exchange rate system but must promote economic growth and financial stability. An IMF Decision from 1977, updated in 2007 and 2012, outlines criteria for determining exchange rate manipulation for unfair competitive advantage. Violations could result in restrictions on IMF funding, voting rights suspension, or expulsion. IMF has never publicly cited a member for such violations. The IMF has never publicly cited a member country for currency manipulation. Countries like the United States have participated in informal forums to coordinate economic policies, such as the Plaza Accord in 1985 and the Louvre Accord in 1987, to intervene in currency markets. Small groups of countries have also executed coordinated interventions in foreign exchange markets to shape the relative value of currencies. Coordinated interventions in foreign exchange markets by small groups of advanced economies, like the G-7 countries, have occurred on an ad hoc basis to influence currency values. Recent discussions at G-7 and G-20 meetings have emphasized a commitment to market-determined exchange rates and refraining from competitive devaluation. The G-20 countries pledged to refrain from competitive devaluation in 2013, reiterated in subsequent meetings. Analysts and lawyers are exploring if WTO provisions allow recourse against countries undervaluing currency. The WTO, with 159 member countries, enforces rules through dispute settlement. The WTO has a mechanism for enforcing rules through a dispute settlement process, but there is debate on whether WTO agreements address currency manipulation. Some argue that an undervalued currency should be considered an export subsidy under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Some argue that intentional undervaluation of a country's currency may not qualify as an export subsidy under WTO agreements due to the lack of mention of currencies in the agreement on subsidies. The debate also considers whether undervaluation is industry-specific, as required for countervailing measures, and if it violates the provision in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade regarding exchange actions. Some analysts argue that intentional undervaluation of a currency may be considered protectionist and go against the intent of the GATT. The language in the agreement is debated for its relevance to current exchange rate systems. The issue of currency manipulation falls under contested jurisdiction at the WTO, leading the US to address concerns in FTA negotiations like the TPP. The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) included a joint declaration on unfair currency practices, focusing on commitments to avoid manipulation, transparency, and multilateral dialogue on exchange rates. It did not have enforceable rules against currency manipulation. President Trump withdrew from the TPP. President Trump withdrew the United States from the TPP in January 2017. The other 11 TPP countries continued with the CPTPP trade agreement in March 2018 without the currency side agreement. The renegotiation of NAFTA includes combatting currency manipulation as an objective, with a potential nonbinding side agreement to avoid devaluation for competitive purposes. U.S. concerns about currency manipulation do not target Mexico and Canada, but the side agreement could set a global precedent for future trade agreements. The Administration announced negotiations for a currency side agreement with South Korea as part of the KORUS FTA modifications. South Korea's interventions in foreign exchange markets have prompted disclosure of more information. Concerns about currency manipulation, particularly by China, persist, with President Trump expressing worries about exchange rate policies of other countries. No formal labeling of a country as a currency manipulator has been done by the Treasury Department. Some Members of Congress and policy experts have proposed more assertive action on currency manipulation, but there is debate among economists on how to determine a currency's value. The Treasury Department has not officially labeled any country as a currency manipulator. An undervalued currency can have mixed effects on the U.S. economy. While it may harm some import-sensitive firms and exporters, it benefits other sectors by making imports cheaper. Labeling a country as a currency manipulator could lead to retaliation and potentially trigger a trade war or higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government. Stricter international rules on currency manipulation could also constrain U.S. monetary policy. Some argue that the United States should treat currency manipulation as an actionable subsidy under U.S. law, allowing for countervailing duties on imports from countries with undervalued currencies. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address this issue. Some argue for countervailing duties on imports from countries with undervalued currencies, citing difficulties in determining currency manipulation and potential violations of WTO rules. Currency manipulation is primarily done through intervention in foreign exchange markets. The text discusses countervailing currency interventions in foreign exchange markets to counteract interventions by other countries. This involves selling domestic currency for foreign currency to weaken the domestic currency. The United States could conduct countervailing interventions by buying the other country's currency with U.S. dollars. These interventions aim to offset the impact on exchange rates. Countervailing currency interventions are proposed as a policy option to address concerns about exchange rate policies directly. These interventions in foreign exchange markets aim to avoid questions about WTO-compatibility and have no budgetary costs. However, they may be less feasible for countries like China that restrict access to assets denominated in their domestic currency. In 2015, Congress debated enforceable provisions on currency in trade agreements within the context of the TPA. While the final legislation allows for enforceable provisions as a remedy against currency manipulation, it is not required. Members of Congress may push for enforceable provisions in trade negotiations, such as NAFTA and KORUS. Disagreements may arise on how exchange rate disputes would be resolved. The IMF and WTO are suggested for handling exchange rate disputes due to their clear commitments and enforcement mechanisms. Congress could urge action on currency issues at these institutions and seek rule changes for clearer resolution. Addressing currency disputes in international organizations may garner broad support. Currency disputes in international institutions like the IMF and WTO may face obstacles, such as political sensitivity and the need for multilateral consensus. Exchange rates are crucial in the global economy, impacting trade and investment flows. Tensions over exchange rate policies have increased post-2008 financial crisis, with concerns about governments manipulating rates for trade advantage. The effects of exchange rate policies are nuanced, creating winners and losers. Formal responses to tensions over exchange rates have been through discussions at G-7 and G-20 meetings. The IMF and U.S. Department of the Treasury have not taken formal action on current disputes over exchange rates. Debates exist on why formal action has not been taken at these institutions. Addressing currency disputes is complex due to the difficulty in estimating a currency's true value. The 114th Congress tackled currency manipulation through TPA and customs legislation. Policymakers considering action on exchange rate disputes have various options, including countervailing duties, interventions in foreign exchange markets, provisions in trade agreements, and urging the Administration to address the issue more forcefully at international institutions."
