The text chunk discusses the amendment to Section 8332 of title 5, United States Code, allowing individuals with 5 or more years of creditable civilian service to receive credit for service performed between December 31, 1965, and January 1, 1987. Employees or Members can deposit an amount equal to deductions from basic pay for the service period. The text discusses the deposit required for full retirement credit for service as an employee or Member. If the deposit is not made in full, retirement credit is allowed but the resulting annuity will be reduced. Survivors can also make the deposit. The Office will accept the appropriate certification. The Office will accept certification from the appropriate Secretary regarding service and compensation for employees or Members seeking credit. Credit for service under this subsection cannot be granted under another retirement system. Applications for retirement credit must be submitted within 2 years of the effective date. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations to carry out the Act and amendments within 12 months of enactment. The regulations will include provisions for applying the amendment to employees or Members eligible for an annuity under specific conditions. The regulations prescribed under subsection (b) will apply to annuity entitlement based on separation from service after the effective date. An exception exists for annuities based on separations occurring after enactment but before the effective date of implementing regulations, requiring recomputation for eligible individuals. Upon receipt of an appropriate application before the deadline, the Office of Personnel Management will recompute the annuity amount for individuals entitled to an annuity based on separation from service after the enactment of this Act but before the effective date of regulations.

Upon receipt of an application, the Office of Personnel Management will adjust annuity amounts to account for section 8332(o) of title 5, United States Code. Any changes will only apply to amounts accruing after the application is received. SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION AND ASSISTANCE.
