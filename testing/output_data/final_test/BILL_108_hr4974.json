    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Post 9/11 Health Protection Act of 2004\". The Congress acknowledges the heroic actions of individuals during the 9/11 disaster and the health consequences they faced due to environmental exposures. Research shows a direct link between these exposures and adverse health effects such as bronchial hyperactivity, persistent cough, and increased risk of asthma. Research has shown a direct link between environmental exposures during the 9/11 disaster and adverse health effects such as bronchial hyperactivity, persistent cough, increased risk of asthma, and lower birthweights in infants. Additionally, individuals exposed to asbestos have an increased future risk of mesothelioma. The intensity of exposure to airborne pollutants is positively related to the severity of pulmonary symptoms. The effects of 9/11 are still being felt today by all New Yorkers and Americans. Research has shown that the smoke, dust, and debris from the 9/11 disaster have caused various health issues such as respiratory problems, birth defects, and cancer. Among firefighters and iron workers involved in cleaning and recovery efforts, many have experienced persistent cough, bronchial hyperactivity, phlegm production, and wheezing. Exposure to asbestos in the rubble at ground zero has posed health risks, including lung cancer and mesothelioma. Pregnant women near ground zero inhaling toxins resulted in delivering infants who were smaller-for-gestational-age. Researchers described the pollutants as a toxic cocktail with potential long-term effects. The pollutants at ground zero have been linked to various health issues, including heart disease and chronic disorders. Many rescue workers still suffer from respiratory problems, skin rashes, nausea, and anxiety years after the attacks. Dr. Rafael de la Hoz highlighted the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among emergency respondents. Dr. Rafael de la Hoz found that 75% of day workers at Mount Sinai Medical Center have upper airway diseases, with some experiencing aggravated asthma, back pain, and psychological issues like post traumatic stress syndrome.
