    "title": "SB 1226",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4652.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require entities receiving payments from regional centers to contract with an independent accounting firm for an audit or review of their financial statements if they receive more than $500,000 but less than $2,000,000. This also applies to work activity program providers receiving less than $500,000. Entities receiving payments from regional centers must obtain an independent audit of their financial statements if they receive $2,000,000 or more during the fiscal year. This requirement excludes payments made at usual rates and does not apply to certain governmental agencies or universities. The entity must provide the audit report to the regional center within nine months of the fiscal year end. Regional centers must review audit reports for issues impacting services and take action if resolutions are inadequate, including termination of vendorization. They must notify the department of qualified opinion reports within 30 days and submit all audit reports for review. The department will compile data on vendor compliance and publish it annually. An independent review of financial statements by an accounting firm includes inquiries about accounting principles, transaction procedures, analytical procedures, budgetary actions, and compliance with accounting standards. An independent review report on financial statements must certify compliance with AICPA standards, represent management's statements, conduct inquiries and analytical procedures, and confirm no material modifications are needed for GAAP conformity. (g) The department will not consider rate adjustment requests from entities funded by regional centers solely for compliance with this section.\n(h) An entity subject to independent review of financial statements may request a two-year exemption if no issues impacting regional center services were found in the prior year's report. An entity subject to independent review of financial statements may apply for a two-year exemption from the audit requirement if certain conditions are met. The regional center will grant exemptions based on the outcome of the prior year's audit. The regional center must report annually to the department on any exemptions granted. Section 4652.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code requires entities receiving payments from regional centers to contract with an independent accounting firm for a financial audit or review. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2018, unless a later statute extends the date. Entities receiving payments from regional centers must obtain an independent review report if they receive between $500,000 and $2,000,000, and an independent audit if they receive $2,000,000 or more. This requirement is in accordance with Section 4652.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code and will be repealed on January 1, 2018, unless extended by a later statute. Entities receiving payments from regional centers must provide independent audit or review reports to the vendoring regional center within nine months of the fiscal year end. Regional centers must review and address any issues identified in the reports, taking appropriate action if necessary. Regional centers must notify the department of qualified opinion reports or significant issues impacting services within 30 days. They must also submit independent audit reports for review, with data compiled and published annually on vendor compliance. Independent financial statement reviews must cover accounting principles and practices. An independent review report must cover procedures for recording transactions, analytical procedures, budgetary actions, financial statement preparation, and working papers. The certification in the review report includes adherence to AICPA standards, management representations, limited scope compared to an audit, and no material modifications needed for GAAP conformity. Requests for rate adjustments by entities funded by regional centers for compliance with regulations will not be considered by the department. An entity may apply for a two-year exemption from the independent review report requirement if no issues were found in the prior year's report that impact regional center services. Another entity can apply for an exemption from the independent audit requirement if the prior year's audit resulted in an unmodified opinion or an unmodified opinion with additional communication. The regional center may grant a two-year exemption if the prior year's audit had a qualified opinion that was not material. The entity must address audit issues regardless of the exemption. The regional center must report any exemptions granted annually. This section will be effective on January 1, 2018."
