    "content": "Distributional effects are a key focus in tax policy debates. Economic analysis can estimate the distribution of the tax system but cannot provide normative analysis. Normative analysis in economics often focuses on efficiency and can help understand desirable distributions and implications of different assumptions on the optimal tax burden distribution. The first section of the report discusses different philosophies on tax burden distribution and their implications for the tax system. The curr_chunk discusses the justifications for a progressive tax system and the distributional effects of tax changes. It addresses how to pay for government goods and whether the tax system should be used for income redistribution. The optimal tax burden depends on the degree of redistribution desired. Public goods, like defense and roads, require taxes for funding. These goods benefit individuals collectively and may not be efficiently provided by the private market. Taxes are necessary to finance public goods and quasi-public goods with positive external effects. The distribution of tax burden among society's members is classified as progressive, proportional, or regressive based on the behavior of the effective tax rate. Federal taxes fall into all three categories, with payroll tax being initially proportional, then regressive. Excise and sales taxes are generally... The tax system includes progressive income tax, regressive excise and sales taxes, and proportional corporate income tax. Fairness is judged based on horizontal and vertical equity criteria, ensuring equal tax liability for same capacity to pay and increasing liability with ability to pay. The tax system includes progressive income tax, regressive excise and sales taxes, and proportional corporate income tax. Fairness is judged based on horizontal and vertical equity criteria, ensuring equal tax liability for same capacity to pay and increasing liability with ability to pay. The application of both depends critically on definitions of \"capacity to pay,\" which is difficult to determine for families of different size and characteristics. Even under a regressive tax system, a higher-income taxpayer may pay higher taxes in dollar terms than a lower-income taxpayer. The share of tax paid to income decreases, but a regressive system could still satisfy principles of vertical and horizontal equity. Traditionally, tax payments can be assigned based on the benefit principle or the \"ability-to-pay\" principle, with the benefit principle linking tax burden to government service benefits. The benefit principle of taxation links tax burden to the value individuals receive from public goods. Higher-income individuals may have a greater willingness to pay for social goods due to their higher income and property to protect. The distribution of taxes under this principle can be regressive, proportional, or progressive depending on income and price elasticities. It is challenging to estimate these elasticities, especially for national level expenditures. Some studies suggest that income elasticity exceeds price elasticity in municipal and local education spending, supporting progressive taxes. International evidence shows tax shares increase with income, with high-income countries having higher tax and expenditure shares. The \"ability-to-pay\" principle implies higher incomes should pay more, based on the diminishing marginal benefit of income assumption. The ability-to-pay principle suggests that higher incomes should pay more in taxes, based on the diminishing marginal benefit of income assumption. Equal sacrifice measures include equal absolute sacrifice, equal proportional sacrifice, and equal marginal sacrifice. Equal absolute sacrifice would imply proportional taxation if the marginal benefits of income fell proportionally with income. The principle of equal marginal sacrifice suggests a steeply progressive tax system, collecting the least valued dollars in the economy. Progressivity does not depend on the rate at which the value of a dollar declines with income. The ability to pay criterion does not justify regressive, proportional, or progressive taxes without further information on welfare nature and exact standards. The equal marginal sacrifice principle implies extreme progression in tax systems. Redistribution as a public good can enhance efficiency, despite the usual conflict between equity and efficiency objectives due to tax distortions. Redistribution can be seen as a public good where higher and middle income individuals benefit from helping the poor. This redistribution is under-supplied in an open economy, justifying the need to redistribute based on the welfare of the rich. Additionally, some redistribution serves as insurance when private markets fail, with a social safety net acting as a form of insurance. The social safety net acts as insurance when private markets fail, providing benefits like unemployment compensation, need-based transfers, and retirement benefits. Philosophical approaches to just income distribution include the endowment, utilitarian, and egalitarian approaches. The endowment approach suggests people should receive what they earn. The endowment approach advocates for people to receive what they earn, with variations allowing for redistribution of excess profits and assets. It supports differences in income based on effort, risk-taking, and innate ability, but not inherited wealth. The benefit principle and progressive taxation align with the endowment philosophy. The endowment approach supports differences in income based on effort, risk-taking, and innate ability, but not inherited wealth. It may not advocate for redistribution, which could lead to individuals limited by circumstances of birth suffering poverty. The utilitarian approach to welfare maximization suggests redistributing income to benefit those who can gain the most from it, potentially leading to a highly progressive tax system. The utilitarian approach to welfare maximization suggests redistributing income to benefit those who can gain the most from it, potentially leading to a highly progressive tax system. In contrast, the egalitarian approach advocates for equal happiness for everyone, but practical implementation is challenging due to the lack of objective measures for welfare and the reality of individual differences. The egalitarian approach to welfare suggests equalizing income to maximize the welfare of the poorest individual, known as the \"maximin\" or \"Rawlsian\" criteria. This involves aggressive redistribution to raise the happiness levels of those who enjoy income less. In the Rawlesian system, a 100% marginal tax on the rich would not work due to reduced work effort. The tax should be raised just enough for maximum revenue distribution. Utilitarian welfare functions do not consider differences in work effort and risk-taking. Redistributing income to lower-income individuals may be appropriate. In the context of redistributing income, differences in income arising from innate capabilities or inherited wealth can impact the optimal level of risk-taking in an economy. Taxing risky projects could make risk-taking irrelevant to economic decisions, affecting the efficient operation of the economy. The analysis suggests that income redistribution may be appropriate, but the U.S. tax system engages in little means-based redistribution. Social welfare philosophies and the benefit principle support progressive taxation, but the criteria for charging for public goods may not always align with this. The U.S. tax system may need to offset regressive state and local taxes to avoid overall regressiveness. Various organizations, both public and private, produce distributional tables to analyze income distribution and tax policies. Analyses of income distribution and tax policies vary in methodology, including how income is defined, tax units are ordered, and which taxes are included. Different organizations conduct distributional analyses over various time periods and types of taxes, presenting effective tax rates for comparison. Effective tax rates indicate progressivity, proportionality, or regressivity based on how they change with income levels. The practical meaning of \"income\" is discussed, including various types mentioned on tax forms. Different entities may have their own definitions of income. Economic income, encompassing all sources, is the best descriptor of access to economic resources, but accounting and tax concepts may not exactly match it due to statutory exclusions like pre-tax benefits for employees. Employees can use pre-tax dollars for insurance through their employers, representing income for consumption. However, these transactions are not included in gross income for tax purposes. Distributional analyses use measures like adjusted gross income (AGI) to estimate comprehensive income. The Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis used Family Economic Income (FEI) as a measure in a 1999 paper, defining income as the sum of consumption and change in net-worth, known as Haig-Simons income. This measure includes cash and non-cash income. The Treasury's Office of Tax Analysis used Family Economic Income (FEI) as a measure in a 1999 paper, defining income as the sum of consumption and change in net-worth. This measure includes both cash and non-cash income, such as imputed rent on owner-occupied homes. However, the definition of income was modified to include pension benefits and exclude non-cash transfers like Medicare benefits due to data limitations. The analysis of income measures used by different organizations varies, with some using broader measures than others. The choice of income measure is influenced by data availability and technical considerations, as well as the types of taxes being distributed. The Brookings Urban Tax Policy Center now uses both economic income and cash income measures. When distributing taxes, using an expanded AGI or cash income measure is simpler but can be misleading due to accruing gains in assets. Reporting distributions based on population shares reduces measurement problems. Dollar amounts provide concreteness to distribution tables, with the overall tax burden appearing higher when measured as a share of AGI. Comparing AGI and FEI measures for 2000 shows a difference in size: $5,649 billion versus $8,419 billion. The relationship between AGI and FEI measures is likely to persist over time. It is preferable to use comprehensive income measures for distributional analysis. Researchers face questions on how to measure the unit of analysis and account for differences in tax unit composition. The unit may be the family, household, or taxpayer unit. In distributional analysis, researchers debate on how to classify units for income comparison. Some argue for not adjusting for unit size, assuming equal income needs regardless of family size. In distributional analysis, researchers debate on how to classify units for income comparison. Some argue for not adjusting for unit size, assuming equal income needs regardless of family size. The standard of living for one person is often considered the same as for four persons, which is not realistic. Adjusting for household size can be done by dividing the burden by the number of persons, but this fails to recognize economies of scale larger households enjoy. Various adjustment methods exist between these extremes. In distributional analysis, researchers debate on how to classify units for income comparison. Various adjustment methods exist between not adjusting for unit size and adjusting for household size. One method orders households by ability to pay, another normalizes income by expressing it in terms of the applicable poverty level. These ordering procedures and unit measures may not significantly impact the overall qualitative pattern of effective tax rates. Economic incidence of taxes is another important factor in distributional analysis. The economic incidence of taxes in distributional analysis reflects that tax burden may not be solely on taxpayers legally responsible for paying. Assumptions about tax incidence vary across market segments and time, impacting quantitative results. Researchers make assumptions due to the complexity of calculating precise shares in every case. Variations in income, unit definition, and incidence assumptions lead to different results in each case. The economic literature on tax system implications shows that while quantitative results may vary, the distributional effects of corporate tax depend on investor and worker responses. All taxes, including individual income and payroll taxes, rely on behavioral responses. If savings and labor supply are not significantly affected by taxes, the burden falls on the individual paying them. Different taxes are allocated based on consumption or income, with excise taxes being an exception. The burden distribution estimates from different sources for 2000, 2005, and 2006 are not precisely comparable due to methodological differences and timing discrepancies. Table 4 differs from Table 3 in that tax rates are based on cash income for the TPC rather than economic income, resulting in more similar tax rates. All sources depict a similar qualitative picture about the progressivity of the tax system. The federal tax burden distribution is progressive, with the lowest quintile facing single-digit effective tax rates and the highest quintile facing rates close to or above 25%. Tax rates rise more slowly at the top of the distribution. Data from the Joint Committee on Taxation shows consistent patterns in tax burden across income levels. The federal tax system includes payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes. The federal tax system includes payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes. Income taxes are divided into individual taxes on wage income, passive capital income, and profits of unincorporated businesses, along with a flat rate tax on corporate profits. The distribution of the tax burden depends on the mix of taxes within the system, with different degrees of progressivity or regressivity. Tables show the distribution of the tax burden by type before and after changes in 2001-2003. The federal tax system includes payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes. Income taxes are divided into individual taxes on wage income, passive capital income, and profits of unincorporated businesses, along with a flat rate tax on corporate profits. The distribution of the tax burden depends on the mix of taxes within the system, with different degrees of progressivity or regressivity. Tables show the distribution of the tax burden by type before and after changes in 2001-2003. The way families are ordered affects tax rates, with CBO placing larger families in the lowest quintile based on ability to pay, while Treasury orders by income. This results in larger benefits for large families from the earned income credit, impacting tax rates differently in CBO and Treasury analyses. Updated numbers in Table 9 show similar patterns in tax types from CBO, with changes due to the 2001 tax cuts and income shifting across brackets. The federal tax system includes various types of taxes such as payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes. The distribution of the tax burden varies depending on the type of taxes, with different levels of progressivity. Tables illustrate the distribution of tax burden before and after changes in 2001-2003. The individual income tax rate ranges from negative for the lowest quintile to around 20% for the top 1%. Earned income credit can result in subsidies for lower-income levels. Payroll taxes increase slightly and then decrease, with lower rates at the bottom due to a higher proportion of retired individuals. The tax system includes payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes with varying levels of progressivity. Payroll taxes are lower at the bottom due to more retired individuals, and higher at the top due to a dollar ceiling, making it regressive. Effective rates of payroll taxes are higher for the bottom quintiles compared to income tax. Corporate income tax rates increase with income, with higher rates for the top income brackets. The progressivity of corporate tax is due to capital income allocation to higher-income individuals. The tax system includes payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes with varying levels of progressivity. Excise taxes' effective rates vary between research organizations, with the Treasury depicting it as proportional and the CBO showing it as regressive. Consumption taxes are regressive due to declining consumption with income. The estate tax is the most progressive, mainly paid by high-income individuals. The distribution changes over time are also important. The tax system includes payroll, income, excise, and estate taxes with varying levels of progressivity. The distribution changes over time are important, especially after recent tax law changes. Table 10 shows historic effective rates for selected years, indicating a progressive tax system. Table 11 examines the current and projected burden around recent tax changes. Tax rate cuts are still being phased in. The tax rate cuts from 2004 to 2008 are still being phased in, with 2008 being the last year for lower capital gains and dividend taxes. The original 2001 tax cut is fully phased in by 2010, and as scheduled, no tax cuts would be effective in 2014. Effective tax rates are higher in 2014 due to bracket creep, affecting lower quintiles more. Legislative changes have benefited higher-income groups the most, especially with the estate tax. The estimates in Table 11 reflect current federal law, with the actual pattern of tax changes depending on future decisions regarding the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. The tax burden analysis includes consideration of the impact of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, addressing the alternative minimum tax, and factoring in state and local taxes. The overall state and local taxation system is found to be regressive for non-elderly taxpayers, attributed to flat income tax schedules, reliance on sales taxes, and other factors. The state and local tax system is regressive due to flat income tax schedules, reliance on sales taxes, and excise taxes. States and localities face competition in choosing their tax structure, making it difficult to have steeply progressive taxes. The federal government plays a role in ensuring overall progressivity in the combined U.S. tax system. The discussion in this report has focused on the tax burden analysis at a single point in time. However, an alternative view suggests that the cumulative lifetime tax burden is a better representation. Lifetime tax burden is the total of all taxes paid each year during one's lifetime. Individual income typically increases over time and then decreases after retirement. This results in a diverse mix of taxpayers in the lowest percentile, including younger individuals, retirees, and mid-career low-income earners. It is important to consider the different impacts of tax policies on these groups, as redistributing the tax burden from higher to lower quintiles may affect younger taxpayers and retirees differently. The analysis focuses on the distribution of lifetime tax burden, considering how different tax policies impact various groups like younger taxpayers and retirees. The intergenerational fairness and national debt implications are also highlighted, with a discussion on the value of money to individuals based on income levels. The analysis considers the distribution of lifetime tax burden, emphasizing the impact of tax policies on different groups like younger taxpayers and retirees. It discusses intergenerational fairness, national debt implications, and the value of money based on income levels. The time value of money principle complicates the assessment of tax liabilities over a lifetime, affecting the progressivity of the tax system. The report examines the challenges in characterizing changes to tax systems and comparing their progressivity. Various progressivity indices have been proposed, but none are entirely satisfactory, leading to different conclusions about relative progressivity. Distributional effects of tax cuts can be perceived differently based on the chosen measures. The distributional effects of tax cuts can be perceived differently based on the chosen measures. Some measures include the share of taxpayers benefitted, percentage reduction in taxes paid, tax cut as a percentage of income, distribution of the tax cut by income class, and average tax cut. The choice of distributional measure can influence how a tax change is viewed in terms of favoring lower-income individuals over higher-income ones. Three quarters of beneficiaries have cash income below $80,000, making the tax cut appear not targeted at high-income individuals. The distribution of the tax cut by income class may seem fairly equal across income classes, except for the lowest group. The tax cut may seem fairly equal across income classes, but a proportional cut in income taxes benefits high-income individuals more. Measuring the percentage reduction in tax liability does not reveal the effect on income equality. It is important to distinguish between absolute and relative measures when discussing the impact on income inequality. Tax reductions per unit provide information on the absolute size of a tax benefit across income classes. Comparing the distribution of the tax benefit with the population distribution shows that a 10% tax cut benefits higher-income individuals disproportionately, leading to increased income inequality. These measures help understand how a tax cut affects income without being misleading. Tax cuts tend to favor higher-income individuals due to their larger proportion of income and tax payments. Absolute measures show this bias, while relative measures examine how tax benefits impact income distribution. Higher-income individuals receive higher absolute tax cuts, but not higher cuts as a percentage of income. Refundable tax provisions benefit different income classes proportionally. The best method for measuring the effect of tax cuts on inequality is to examine the percentage change in disposable income. Across-the-board proportional tax cuts increase inequality, with higher-income individuals benefiting more. Different measures have been used to report tax cuts, illustrated by data from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. The 2001 tax cut was a multi-year phased tax cut that sunsets after 2010. Data from various sources show that the tax cut favored lower-income individuals, with the largest percentage changes at lower income levels. The 2001 tax cut favored lower-income individuals, with the largest benefits seen in the highest income class. Data from CBO on percentage changes in after-tax income and tax liability show conflicting patterns. Table 15 displays the percentage increase in after-tax income based on CBO data. The analysis approximates the effect of the 2001 tax cut by comparing 2010 and 2011. The 2001 tax cuts phased out before 2010, with the highest income classes receiving the largest percentage changes in after-tax income. Data from Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ) show the distribution of the tax cut, with almost 40% going to the top 1% of individuals. The CTJ data include the effect of the cut in estate taxes, unlike the JCT and CBO data. The distributional impact of the 2003 tax cut, as shown in Table 17, is skewed towards the rich, with the top 1% receiving higher benefits, likely due to the estate tax. The Treasury Department's analysis focuses on the percentage change in individual income taxes, using cash income as the measure, unlike their previous study which used economic income. The Treasury analysis in Table 17 shows the distributional effects of the 2003 tax cut, focusing on percentage changes in individual income taxes using cash income as the measure. The lower income distribution had negative taxes due to refundable items like the child credit and earned income credit. This made it challenging to compare with other changes, especially since the under $30,000 class likely represents about 40% of the population. The distributional effects of the 2003 tax cut were analyzed using cash income as the measure. The lower-income individuals benefited from refundable items like the child credit and earned income credit. The analysis by the Brookings-Urban Tax Policy Center showed a different perspective, focusing on the change in after-tax income. Various statistics, including the average tax change among income quintiles, were presented for comparison purposes. The Treasury table shows that lower-income groups gained very little from the tax change, with the lowest quintile seeing only a one-dollar average tax change. Despite the table suggesting a 15% benefit for this group, the percentage change in after-tax income indicates otherwise, with an average gain of about $20 for the under $30,000 group. This discrepancy highlights how percentage changes in tax liability can be misleading, especially for lower-income individuals with small or negative tax liabilities."
