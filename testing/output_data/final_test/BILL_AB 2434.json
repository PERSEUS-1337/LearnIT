    "title": "AB 2434",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of universal participation in postsecondary education in California for a well-informed citizenry, diverse workforce, and strong economy. Communities of color now make up the majority of high school students in the state, with Latino students comprising the largest percentage. Despite outreach programs and other efforts, historically disadvantaged groups like communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ students, and individuals from low-income communities remain underrepresented in higher education in California. The state's commitment to higher education has shifted towards incarceration, with a significant increase in general fund expenditures on corrections from 2003 to 2010, despite only a 1 percent growth in the prison population. The Public Policy Institute of California projects a shortage of 1,100,000 college graduates by 2030 if enrollment rates do not increase. Since 2012, California lacks a coordinating body for postsecondary education, hindering long-term planning. The Governor recognizes the need for better coordination in higher education policy. To ensure accessibility to higher education, California plans to establish a Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education to make public universities and colleges tuition-free and affordable for all students by 2030. The commission will focus on improving access and affordability in postsecondary education for Californians. The Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education in California will consist of nine public members representing diverse backgrounds, appointed by the Governor, Senate Committee on Rules, and Speaker of the Assembly. The Governor may appoint a temporary chairperson for the first meeting, with the commission then electing a permanent chairperson. The Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education in California follows the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act. Members serve without compensation but receive reimbursement for expenses. Those affiliated with educational institutions cannot serve on the commission. An office is established to implement the commission's duties. The office established to implement the duties of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education in California may consult with higher education segments and stakeholders, receive necessary information, and be under the direct control of an executive director. The commission appoints an executive director at a fixed salary, designates a state agency for administrative services, and reviews reports from various educational entities. The commission will hold public hearings in diverse regions to gather input from various underserved groups in public postsecondary education for the purpose of formulating recommendations. The commission will study the need for a public postsecondary education system in California to ensure universal access and participation for all high school graduates. This includes identifying current enrollment capacity and the additional slots needed to graduate 1,100,000 residents by 2030 to meet economic demands. The commission will determine the need for additional campuses in public postsecondary education segments to accommodate enrollment demands and ensure diversity in student populations. The commission aims to ensure equity for historically disadvantaged groups and determine increased investments in public postsecondary education to support universal access for all Californians. This includes identifying expenditure requirements and recommending additional revenue sources. The commission is tasked with analyzing the resources needed to establish an affordable and tuition-free education system in California's public postsecondary environment, prioritizing support for students with low incomes. This includes assessing not only tuition and fees but also additional college costs like books, supplies, housing, and transportation. The analysis will consider federal, state, and campus-based financial aid to determine the extra resources required to support low-income and underrepresented California resident students. The Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education will publish its report by March 31, 2018, and close by June 30, 2018. Upon repeal, all documents will become property of the State Archives. This chapter is in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. The Legislature aims to explore new ways to enhance higher education policy in California. Section 66010.6 of the Education Code is repealed."
