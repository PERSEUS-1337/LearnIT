    "content": "The Access Board published ADAAG guidelines in 2004, providing guidance on play areas, lodging, and communication requirements. These guidelines are not legally binding until adopted by the Department of Justice. In 2008, the DOJ proposed adopting parts of the guidelines but they were not released for publication. In 2009, the White House issued a memorandum halting the submission of proposed regulations to the Federal Register. The Department of Justice withdrew draft final rules from OMB review in response to a memorandum from the White House in 2009. There is uncertainty about new proposed regulations, but incoming officials will have rule-making options under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Access Board guidelines could increase accessibility, but concerns were raised about their impact on existing structures. The DOJ added \"safe harbor\" provisions for titles II and III of the ADA to address concerns about the potential impact on existing structures. Title II requires access to programs for individuals with disabilities, while title III covers accessibility for places of public accommodation. The \"safe harbor\" provision ensures that public entities are not required to modify existing facilities to reflect incremental changes in the proposed standards. The proposed regulations for title III of the ADA include a \"safe harbor\" provision for small businesses, ensuring compliance with accessibility changes that are readily achievable. The DOJ is considering exemptions for public accommodations with play or recreation areas from certain requirements. The proposed regulations for titles II and III of the ADA define service animals as dogs or other domestic animals trained to assist individuals with disabilities. Examples include guiding the blind, assisting during seizures, and retrieving medicine. The term excludes farm animals, wild animals, and emotional support animals. Assistance for individuals with psychiatric, cognitive, and mental disabilities is included, but animals solely for emotional support are not considered service animals. The ADA regulations require public entities and accommodations to allow service animals for individuals with disabilities, unless it fundamentally alters their services. Exceptions for removing a service animal include if it is out of control, not housebroken, or poses a direct threat to others. The animal must be directly related to the individual's disability. The ADA regulations require public entities and accommodations to allow service animals for individuals with disabilities. The animal must be individually trained, under the control of its handler, and have a harness or leash. The entity may ask about the work the animal has been trained to perform. There should be no special fees for the service animal, but charges may apply for damages caused. The Justice Department noted complaints about wild or exotic animals being used as service animals. The Justice Department distinguishes between \"comfort animals\" for emotional support and \"psychiatric service animals\" for specific tasks under ADA regulations. They acknowledge situations where emotional support animals may be permitted in residential and employment settings. Since the ADA's enactment in 1990, there has been a significant increase in mobility aids for individuals with disabilities. The DOJ distinguishes between \"comfort animals\" and \"psychiatric service animals\" under ADA regulations. They require public entities and accommodations to permit individuals with mobility impairments to use various devices in pedestrian areas. This includes wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, crutches, canes, braces, and other similar devices. Reasonable modifications must be made to allow the use of power-driven mobility devices unless proven otherwise. The ADA requires public entities and accommodations to allow individuals with disabilities to use mobility devices unless it would fundamentally alter services. Policies must be in place for the use of power-driven mobility devices based on various factors. Public entities can inquire about the necessity of a power-driven mobility device but not about the disability itself. The DOJ solicited comments on accommodating different types of power-driven mobility devices without asking about the person's disability. The proposed regulations include provisions on program accessibility for various facilities and institutions, as well as requirements for accessible seating and communications. The title III proposed regulations include provisions on ticketing for accessible seating, play areas, swimming pools, and communications. Accessibility requirements for lodging and education housing are also covered, along with a new provision for examinations to limit burdensome requests for documentation by testing entities."
