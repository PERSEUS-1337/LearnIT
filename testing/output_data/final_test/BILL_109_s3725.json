Additionally, guidelines will include a penalty increase of 2 to 8 offense levels for defendants who use violence during a drug trafficking offense. SEC. 201. INCREASE IN SENTENCE FOR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN DRUG OFFENSE. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to increase offense levels for defendants who play a leadership role in drug trafficking activities and exhibit super-aggravating factors. The defendant may face increased offense levels if they were involved in drug trafficking activities and had knowledge of the illegal enterprise, maintained an establishment for manufacturing or distributing controlled substances, or distributed drugs to vulnerable individuals such as minors or pregnant individuals. The defendant may face increased offense levels if they were involved in drug trafficking activities, such as bribing law enforcement officials or importing controlled substances into the United States, or if they committed the offense as part of a criminal livelihood. SEC. 202 limits the sentence for defendants with a lesser role in the offense. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure that defendants with a minimal role in drug offenses are not given a base offense level exceeding 32. Additionally, there will be a further 2-level reduction for defendants meeting specific criteria related to their involvement in the illegal activity. The defendant may have acted impulsively, out of fear, friendship, or affection, leading to an offense they were unlikely to commit otherwise. SEC. 203. ELDERLY, NONVIOLENT PRISONER PILOT PROGRAM. The Elderly, Nonviolent Prisoner Pilot Program defines terms like \"crime of violence,\" \"designated facility,\" \"Director,\" and \"eligible prisoner\" as individuals over 65 years old serving non-violent sentences for at least 10 years or half their term. The Elderly, Nonviolent Prisoner Pilot Program sets criteria for eligibility for home detention, including no prior convictions for violent crimes, no history of violence, no escape attempts, and no violent infractions while in prison. The pilot program established by the Director includes placing eligible elderly, nonviolent prisoners in designated facilities for home detention. The term \"term of imprisonment\" encompasses multiple terms ordered to run consecutively or concurrently, treated as a single aggregate term for this program. The pilot program established by the Director places eligible elderly, nonviolent prisoners on home detention until their sentence expires. Prisoners are placed on home detention within specific timeframes based on their eligibility status. The pilot program places eligible elderly, nonviolent prisoners on home detention until their sentence expires. Violation of home detention terms results in return to previous custody. The Director will contract an organization to monitor prisoner progress during the 3-year release period. The organization must submit an annual report to the Director and Congress on the pilot program, evaluating its effectiveness in transitioning eligible prisoners from incarceration to the community and the cost savings to the Federal Government. SEC. 204. EMERGENCY AMENDMENT AUTHORITY; EFFECTIVE DATE. The United States Sentencing Commission has the authority to make emergency amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines to achieve consistency with other provisions and laws. Amendments must be promptly promulgated. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on the same date as the Act itself. The Act and its amendments will apply to offenses committed 180 days after the Act's enactment, with no retroactive application except for section 203."
