    "content": "The \"Open Wireless Internet Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for an open access spectrum auction. Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include an open access spectrum auction for nationwide broadband competition. The auction will issue nationwide licenses for two bands of frequencies, each consisting of 20 megahertz of unpaired contiguous spectrum. The initial band will be between 2155 and 2180 megahertz. The Open Wireless Internet Act of 2008 mandates the FCC to conduct auctions for two bands of spectrum, with the second band below 3 gigahertz and not part of the recovered analog spectrum. The initial auction for the first band must begin within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Open Wireless Internet Act of 2008 requires the FCC to conduct auctions for two bands of spectrum. The second auction for an additional unpaired contiguous spectrum of 20 megahertz below 3 gigahertz must be completed within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The FCC must ensure licensees do not cause harmful interference and are protected from adjacent spectrum interference by establishing technical rules consistent with standards bodies for the 2110-2170 MHz band. The Commission will conduct a study on potential harmful interference between spectrum bands in the 2110-2170 MHz band, including receiver overload, out-of-band emissions, and mobile-to-mobile interference for voice and data services. The study will also assess the mitigating effect of handset filters in adjacent spectrum bands. The study required under subclause (I) will reflect real deployment conditions and actual equipment in adjacent spectrum bands. The Commission will commence the study within 60 days of the Open Wireless Internet Act enactment, seeking input from the National Telecommunications experts. The Commission will adopt technical rules to protect licensees of spectrum from harmful interference based on a study involving experts from the National Telecommunications Administration and other organizations. The Commission will promulgate service and auction rules for licenses issued to ensure nationwide broadband services and promote specific goals. Rules and regulations will be established to require certain conditions for the use of auctioned spectrum licenses. Licensees must provide always-on wireless Internet services within 2 years of receiving the license and cover at least 95% of the US population within 10 years. They must also offer a data service faster than 200 kilobits per second for free to consumers and public safety users. The spectrum must be used by authorized public safety users without charges and must adhere to principles allowing access to lawful content, any application, and legal devices on the network. The text chunk discusses the conditions for offering free data services on a wireless network, including the requirement to filter obscene material for underage users. The text chunk outlines the conditions for providing open access to wireless networks for consumer devices, including offering free data services using advanced technologies to promote broadband competition and affordability. The Commission will review the requirement for free data services speed. The Commission will evaluate increasing the speed of free services under subparagraph (F) every 3 years, considering consumer demand and technological advancements. Any modifications to these requirements must be approved by Congress. Additionally, a biennial broadband spectrum utilization report will be conducted starting in March 2009. The Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration will jointly review competitive market conditions for broadband availability and affordability, as well as spectrum utilization. They will provide Congress with a biannual report on their findings, focusing on efficient use of spectrum bands. The Commission and the Administration will consider technological advances in spectrum use, public safety, and national defense in their recommendations. They will also suggest reallocating underutilized spectrum to promote broadband availability and affordability. The Commission and the Administration will recommend reallocating spectrum to promote broadband availability and affordability, including any necessary statutory changes within 24 months."
