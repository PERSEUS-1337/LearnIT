The \"Integrating Behavioral Health Through Technology Act of 2016\" defines key terms such as Administrator, certified EHR technology, and eligible behavioral health facility, including psychiatric hospitals and community mental health centers. The \"Integrating Behavioral Health Through Technology Act of 2016\" defines eligible behavioral health facilities as those accredited by recognized national accrediting agencies for mental health and substance abuse treatment. The Integrating Behavioral Health Through Technology Act of 2016 establishes a pilot program for eligible professionals and behavioral health facilities to receive incentive payments for adopting certified EHR technology. The pilot program gives preference to States with a health information exchange including behavioral health data. Eligible professionals must demonstrate adoption of certified EHR technology to receive incentive payments. The pilot program provides incentive payments to eligible professionals and behavioral health facilities in selected States with a health information exchange. The payment amounts may be comparable to those under specific sections of the Social Security Act. The pilot program, established under this section, will last for a maximum of 5 years. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 18 months after the program ends, evaluating its effectiveness in promoting the use of certified EHR technology and sharing behavioral health information. The report will also include best practices for adoption and recommendations for increasing participation. Eligible professionals and behavioral health facilities nationwide can participate in the pilot program to adopt certified EHR technology and exchange behavioral health information. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2017 through 2022 to fund the program."
