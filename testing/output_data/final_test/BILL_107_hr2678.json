    "content": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Digital Tech Corps Act of 2001\" highlights the urgent need for high-skill workers in the government's information technology workforce due to upcoming retirements and a lack of qualified workers in the private sector. In January 2001, the General Accounting Office identified the Federal Government's human capital management as a high-risk problem. Despite efforts to increase flexibility in employment practices, compensation issues hinder recruitment for Government agencies. Failures in the employment process are leading agencies to consider outsourcing as a short-term solution, disrupting the balance between government and contractor management. To address this crisis, creating an ongoing exchange effort to share talent and expertise is crucial. An exchange effort aims to share talent, expertise, and management advances between businesses and government agencies. SEC. 2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE PROGRAM. Amends title 5, United States Code to add CHAPTER 37--INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE PROGRAM. The text outlines definitions and provisions related to the assignment of employees between government agencies and private sector organizations under the Information Technology Exchange Program. Sec. 3702 of the Information Technology Exchange Program outlines the general provisions for the assignment of eligible employees between government agencies and private sector organizations. Eligible employees are those at the GS-12 level or above in the field of information technology management, considered exceptional performers, and expected to take on increased responsibilities. The term 'transfer' refers to the movement of an employee between an agency and a private sector organization. The Information Technology Exchange Program allows eligible employees at the GS-12 level or above in information technology management to participate. Agencies must establish a plan with written agreements for the terms of the assignment, including a requirement for the employee to serve in the civil service for a period equal to the length of the assignment. The Information Technology Exchange Program allows eligible employees at the GS-12 level or above in information technology management to participate in assignments for up to 1 year, extendable for another year. Employees failing to fulfill the agreement may be liable for expenses to the United States. Assignments can be terminated at any time for any reason by the agency or private sector organization. The Chief Information Officers Council may assist in administration, including maintaining candidate lists and mentoring relationships. The Information Technology Exchange Program allows GS-12 level or above employees in IT management to be assigned to private sector organizations for up to 1 year, extendable for another year. Employees may receive supplemental pay if the private sector rate is higher than their federal pay. The Information Technology Exchange Program allows GS-12 level or above employees in IT management to be detailed to private sector organizations for up to 1 year, extendable for another year. During the assignment, employees may receive supplemental pay if the private sector rate is higher than their Federal position. Additionally, they are entitled to various benefits and rights under different chapters, including retention, leave accrual, life insurance, health benefits, and retirement coverage. During the assignment, necessary deductions and contributions are made for coverage and benefits, deemed creditable under the system. However, service with a private sector organization may not count towards Federal retirement benefits. Retention of rights and benefits under chapter 81 is ensured, with employment considered as working for the United States. Any payments received from the private sector organization do not affect coverage. During an employee's assignment to a private sector organization, the agency they are detailed from will make contributions for retirement and insurance purposes. The private sector organization may reimburse for travel expenses, but any payments or benefits received from the organization will be credited against any compensation payable under chapter 81. An employee assigned on detail to a private sector organization is subject to the same terms and conditions as a Federal agency employee. Reimbursements for travel expenses will be credited to the agency's appropriation. The employee remains under the Federal Tort Claims Act and can accrue annual and sick leave as if still working for the agency. An employee transferring to a private sector organization can retain accumulated annual leave and sick leave benefits. Employees from private sector organizations can be transferred to an agency and appointed under certain conditions. Employees transferring to a private sector organization can retain leave benefits. They may be appointed to an agency without following competitive service rules, entitled to pay as per relevant laws, and considered agency employees except for specific benefits. Employees detailed from a private sector organization to an agency under subsection (a)(2) are not entitled to agency pay unless it exceeds their private sector pay. They can still receive pay and benefits from their original organization and are considered agency employees for certain purposes. Employees detailed from a private sector organization to an agency under subsection (a)(2) are considered agency employees for specific purposes outlined in various statutes and regulations, and are subject to presidential regulations. Employees detailed from a private sector organization to an agency under subsection (a)(2) may have their supervision governed by agreement. The agency may or may not reimburse the employee's pay during the assignment. If the private sector organization fails to continue contributions to employee benefit plans, the agency may cover these contributions. Employees detailed from a private sector organization to an agency under subsection (a) who suffer disability or die due to injury sustained while on duty will be treated as agency employees for compensation purposes. Any payments or benefits received from the private sector organization will be deducted from any compensation payable under chapter 81. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for the implementation of this chapter. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for part III of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting after the item relating to chapter 35 the following: SEC. 3. ALLOWABILITY OF COSTS. The Information Technology Exchange Program allows for the exchange of information technology professionals. The Federal Acquisition Regulations Council must amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation within 120 days to recognize allowable training and education costs for employees participating in the program authorized by section 2. These costs include salary, fringe benefits, moving, and travel expenses, and can be treated as indirect costs for accounting purposes. The Federal Acquisition Regulations Council must amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation within 120 days to recognize allowable training and education costs for employees participating in the program authorized by section 2. These costs can be allocated exclusively to the contractor's Federal Government contracts or charged directly to fixed price or time and material contracts. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow the head of an agency to accept voluntary service for the United States under chapter 37 of this title.
