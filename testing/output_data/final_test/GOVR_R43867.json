    "content": "The Clean Water Act (CWA) was enacted in 1972 to address water quality issues caused by pollution runoff from various sources. The law aims to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters by regulating both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. The Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972 aims to achieve zero discharge of pollutants and provide federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers federal programs, while state and local governments play key roles in implementing water quality protection measures. The act set goals to make waters \"fishable and swimmable\" by 1983 and eliminate pollutant discharge into navigable waters by 1985. Considerable progress has been made in controlling pollutants discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants, especially in controlling conventional pollutants. However, progress has been mixed in controlling toxic pollutants, which can harm human health and the environment even in small amounts. Efforts to control nonpoint source pollution are more recent compared to point source pollution. According to data from EPA and states, a significant percentage of river and stream miles and lake acres do not meet water quality standards. EPA has conducted national aquatic resource assessments, revealing poor conditions in U.S. stream miles and nutrient pollution impacting aquatic species. A 2016 assessment found degraded benthic macroinvertebrate communities in 31% of the nation's lakes due to nutrient pollution. Nutrient pollution is a widespread issue in the United States, affecting one-third of lakes with excess nitrogen and two-fifths with excess phosphorus. Chemical contaminants have led to fish-consumption advisories in 95,000 lakes and 544,000 river miles, with mercury levels posing a growing concern. Coastal waters show a mix of fair and good health, with one-third rated as good. In most coastal waterbodies, sediment quality and biological condition are good, but fish tissue samples show contamination from pollutants. A 2016 survey assessed the ecological condition of wetlands, revealing that less than half have healthy plant communities. The Water Quality Act of 1987 was the last major amendment to the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act was last amended in 1987, with authorizations for some programs expiring in the 1990s. Despite criticisms from industry, the act has been successful in achieving its goals and continues to be implemented by EPA, states, and citizens. Criticism of the Clean Water Act comes from various groups, including developers and property rights advocates who see federal regulations as costly intrusions on private land-use decisions. States and cities support water quality programs but oppose potential new unfunded mandates. Environmental groups call for strengthening the law to address remaining water quality issues, despite progress made since its passage 40 years ago. Analysts agree that significant water pollution problems persist, with debates on necessary solutions and potential new legislation. Key water quality issues include implementing existing laws, achieving unmet goals, preventing regression in progress, and determining federal involvement in clean water infrastructure. Efforts to amend the Clean Water Act have stalled due to disagreements on necessary changes and tradeoffs between economic sectors. Congress has focused on narrow bills to extend or modify selected Clean Water Act programs due to factors like technical uncertainty, governmental responsibilities, and economic costs. Legislative attention has shifted towards oversight and criticism of EPA regulatory activities, with the Senate not taking up comprehensive proposals. The 112th and 113th Congress enacted bills amending the Clean Water Act, including extending moratoriums for certain vessels and authorizing funds for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin program. Additionally, legislation was passed exempting silviculture activities from CWA permits and providing a moratorium on vessel permitting. In the 114th Congress, a bill (P.L. 114-162) was enacted to authorize appropriations for the National Estuary Program through FY2021. Two key issues in recent Congresses and likely to be prominent in the 115th Congress are regulatory protection of wetlands under the Clean Water Act and water infrastructure financing. The debate on how to protect wetlands and regulate activities in wetlands has focused on the CWA permit program. The CWA Section 404 permit program requires permits for disposal of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, including wetlands. It is a key federal tool for wetlands protection, but criticism has arisen for being intrusive and burdensome. The challenge is to address these criticisms while still achieving wetlands protection goals within the CWA framework. The CWA Section 404 permit program, administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is central to controversy surrounding the definition of \"waters of the United States\" and wetlands protection. EPA can veto permits that do not meet requirements, while other agencies have limited roles in permitting decisions. Tension exists between wetlands regulation and landowners' desire for property development. The conflicts over wetlands regulation have been addressed in administrative and judicial proceedings due to tensions between wetlands protection and landowners' desire for property development. Controversies include federal jurisdiction, impacts on private property, permit procedures, and the roles of federal agencies and states. One issue of contention is whether isolated waters should fall under Section 404 jurisdiction. The Supreme Court rulings in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Rapanos v. United States addressed the extent of jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, specifically regarding isolated waters and wetlands. These cases challenged the authority of the Corps and EPA over certain waters, leading to debates on the scope of the 404 permit program. The Supreme Court rulings in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Rapanos v. United States addressed the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The Court's decision in June 2006, led by Justice Scalia, clarified the standard for determining whether wetlands are covered by the CWA. Justice Kennedy joined the plurality in vacating lower court decisions and remanding the cases for further consideration. The Supreme Court rulings in SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Rapanos v. United States clarified federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The decisions led to more case-by-case determinations and ongoing litigation, with pressure on the Corps and EPA to provide clarity through rulemaking. The full impact on wetland regulatory protection remains unclear, leading to varying interpretations in subsequent court cases. States now bear the responsibility to protect affected wetlands. Environmentalists believe that the Supreme Court misinterpreted congressional intent in the SWANCC and Rapanos rulings, shifting responsibility for protecting wetlands to states and localities. Industry groups welcomed the decisions, with federal courts interpreting them narrowly or broadly, affecting regulatory jurisdiction. EPA and the Corps issued guidance post-rulings for CWA jurisdictional determinations, criticized by environmental groups for limiting protected waters. The Obama Administration proposed new guidance in 2011 to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands under the Clean Water Act. This generated controversy as critics argued about inconsistencies and delays in obtaining permits for developers. The 2011 proposed guidance on regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters under the Clean Water Act sparked controversy due to concerns about federal overreach and the impact on regulated entities. The draft guidance was not finalized, and in 2013, EPA and the Corps withdrew it for revision. In 2014, a proposed rule aimed at clarifying CWA jurisdiction was released but faced criticism for being a federal overreach. The EPA and Corps issued a final rule in 2015 to define the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. The rule faced legal challenges and a nationwide stay was issued in October 2015. The 2015 revised rule clarifies the regulatory status of surface waters in isolated places and seasonal streams, along with nearby wetlands. It identifies which waters are jurisdictional and requires a case-specific evaluation for others. Tributaries to navigable waters are jurisdictional per se under the final rule. The final rule newly defines \"tributary\" and establishes boundaries for what is considered \"adjacent\" waters. Some waters would require a case-specific evaluation for federal jurisdiction, while others would be considered jurisdictional if they have a significant nexus to a jurisdictional water. The final rule also excludes certain types of waters from CWA jurisdiction. The final rule excludes certain types of waters from CWA jurisdiction, including groundwater, some ditches, stormwater management systems, and groundwater recharge basins. Existing statutory exclusions for farming, ranching, silviculture practices, and maintenance of drainage ditches remain unchanged. The rule aims to clarify CWA jurisdiction in line with Supreme Court rulings and agency expertise. The controversy surrounding the Court's rulings on CWA permits has focused on the need for case-specific evaluations due to uncertainty over the act's geographic scope. The Corps and EPA aimed to clarify jurisdictional questions in their rule, but faced criticism for being vague and ambiguous. Despite defending the rule, officials acknowledged the need for clarification in the final version. In response to criticisms, the EPA and Army made changes to the final rule undergoing interagency review in 2015. The final rule aimed to define tributaries more clearly, limit protection of ditches, and simplify definitions to identify protected waters under the CWA. The goal was to make jurisdictional determinations more predictable and timely. Legal challenges were filed against the 2015 rule by industry groups, states, and environmental groups, testing the agencies' interpretation of CWA jurisdiction and compliance with laws. Petitions for review were filed in federal district and appellate courts, with cases consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit placed a nationwide stay on the 2015 rule, leading to ongoing legal complexities and uncertainties regarding federal jurisdiction over wetlands. Congressional committees have held oversight hearings seeking clarification on the rulings. Legislation has been introduced to address uncertainties regarding federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters raised by Supreme Court rulings. Stakeholders agree that Congress must clarify important issues left unsettled by the rulings, but disagree on the specifics. Environmental advocates argue that legislation is needed to reaffirm Congress's original intent when the Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972. Critics question the constitutionality of proposed legislation expanding federal authority over CWA jurisdiction, leading to confusion. Developer and other groups favor stricter regulations on waters and wetlands. EPA and the Corps' efforts to revise Rapanos guidance and regulations have sparked controversy and congressional attention. Legislative provisions have been included in appropriations bills to prohibit funding for activities related to the 2011 draft guidance and proposed \"waters\" rule. Congressional interest remains strong in the 114th Congress. In the 114th Congress, there was strong congressional interest in the impacts of the 2014 proposed rule on state and local governments. Hearings were held by various committees, and several bills were introduced to either prohibit finalizing the rule or outline procedures for a new rulemaking. This included joint resolutions of disapproval and appropriations bill limitations. President Obama vetoed a joint resolution (S.J.Res. 22) related to the rule in January 2016. In the 114th Congress, there was strong interest in the impacts of the 2014 proposed rule on state and local governments. Several bills were introduced to prohibit finalizing the rule or outline procedures for a new rulemaking, including joint resolutions of disapproval and appropriations bill limitations. President Obama vetoed a joint resolution related to the rule in January 2016. FY2017 funding bills for EPA and the Corps included provisions, but none were enacted. Standalone legislation like H.R. 1732 and S. 1140 failed to advance. Bills amending the CWA jurisdiction were not enacted, but interest in modifying the \"waters of the United States\" rule remained high in 2016 and is likely to continue in 2017. Wastewater infrastructure is crucial for achieving the CWA's water quality objectives. Since 1972, Congress has provided over $94 billion in financial aid for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction to meet the Clean Water Act's requirements. State and local governments have also contributed over $25 billion for these projects. However, there is still a high funding need of an additional $271 billion over the next 20 years for construction purposes. Federal funds cannot be used for operation and maintenance of facilities, which are funded locally. The estimated funding needed for wastewater infrastructure over the next 20 years is $271 billion, with $198 billion for treatment and collection systems, $48 billion for sewer overflow corrections, $19.2 billion for stormwater management, and $6.1 billion for recycled water distribution. The documented needs have decreased by 20% since 2008, attributed to completed projects, challenges in obtaining project documentation, and states limiting survey efforts. The largest decreases were in secondary treatment, CSO corrections, and stormwater management needs. In the 2012 survey, EPA reported increased funding needs for conveyance system repair and recycled water distribution. Needs for conveyance system repair increased by $3.8 billion, or an 8% increase, while needs for recycled water distribution increased by $1.1 billion, or a 21% increase. Several states reported large increases in funding needs between 2008 and 2012, including Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, and New Mexico. The 1987 Clean Water Act amendments extended funding programs for sewage treatment projects and initiated grants for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds. This program allowed for loans to be repaid by recipients, creating a sustainable source of financing for wastewater treatment construction. The 1987 Clean Water Act extended funding programs for sewage treatment projects and introduced State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) to assist in transitioning to full state and local financing by FY1995. SRF monies can be used for various activities, including providing loans for project costs, refinancing debt obligations, and offering loan guarantees for localities. Despite the success of SRFs, large funding needs have delayed the shift to full state responsibility, making SRF issues a priority in recent Clean Water Act reauthorization discussions. Since the inception of the Clean Water Act in 1987, State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) have been utilized to meet the act's standards and requirements. States have used approximately 4% of clean water SRF funds for nonpoint pollution management and estuary projects. Congressional oversight has focused on reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities, with attention on future funding needs and the role of the SRF program. Despite some criticism, the SRF program's basic approach is well supported. The Clean Water SRF program has been used as a model for the Drinking Water SRF program established in 1996. Congress has continued to provide SRF capitalization grants to states, totaling $41 billion since 1987. Recent Administration budget requests and enacted appropriations for SRF capitalization grants are summarized in Table 1. One ongoing concern is the impact of funding water infrastructure projects on small communities. Small communities struggle to participate in the SRF loan program due to factors like narrow tax bases, limited access to capital, and high borrowing costs. Congress is interested in addressing the special needs of small towns through grants or special loan programs. There are concerns about the allocation of SRF funds, prioritizing projects, and funding high-cost projects. The EPA is concerned about funding for high-cost projects dealing with sewer overflows and stormwater runoff, estimating a nationwide cost of nearly $64 billion. Wastewater utilities also seek assistance for operational vulnerabilities and protection against terrorist attacks. EPA issued a policy in 2010 to encourage conservation and provide long-term funding for infrastructure. The EPA is working with water utilities to promote planning processes that reflect public health, water quality, and conservation of natural resources. They are targeting funding to projects focusing on system upgrades, full life cycle costs, and alternative approaches. In 2015, the EPA established a Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center to provide financial guidance and technical assistance for communities. The act's water infrastructure program is widely supported both inside and outside Congress, but proposals for new federal spending have not advanced due to focus on reducing federal spending. Various factors have hindered the legislative process, including opposition to higher authorization levels and disputes over prevailing wage requirements. The Davis-Bacon Act's application to water infrastructure projects, including disputes over clean water SRF grant allocation, has sparked controversy. Supporters argue it stabilizes local construction industries, while critics claim it increases costs and hampers competition. The Act requires prevailing wages for workers on federal construction projects, impacting SRF-funded projects since 1987. The Davis-Bacon Act applied to \"first use\" state monies from the SRF until FY1994, when requirements expired. The recent issue is whether to restore these requirements, which have been attached to SRF funds since 2009. Another issue is the allocation of SRF capitalization grants among states, which impacts winners and losers. The existing statutory allotment for clean water infrastructure has not been revised since 1987, leading to winners and losers in funding allocation. Policymakers are exploring various options, including the SRF program and a national infrastructure bank, to address challenges in providing water infrastructure services. There is no consensus on a single policy, with many advocating for a combination of options to expand financing. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program was created in the 113th Congress to provide credit assistance for water projects. Proponents argue that WIFIA offers financing advantages by providing low U.S. Treasury rates to projects that struggle to obtain financing. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program was established to provide credit assistance for water projects, offering financing advantages to projects that have difficulty obtaining financing. EPA and the Corps were authorized $175 million each over five years for assistance, with projects needing to be $20 million or larger in costs to be eligible. EPA has been preparing for the program's implementation, releasing rules in November 2016 to clarify provisions and establish guidelines for the application process. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program aims to address questions about eligible projects, selection criteria, ranking system, and project creditworthiness. Congress provided appropriations in FY2015 and FY2016 for EPA to prepare for the program, but $20 million was appropriated in December 2016 to start making loans. Additionally, P.L. 113-121 included provisions amending water infrastructure provisions of the Clean Water Act, especially the Title VI SRF program. Several provisions in P.L. 113-121, including extending SRF loan repayment, allowing states to make subsidized loans, and expanding SRF-eligible projects, were included in recent legislation. These amendments to the Clean Water Act are the first since 1987, but did not address all long-standing Title VI issues. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act did not address key Title VI issues such as reauthorizing clean water SRF grants, state-by-state allocation of grants, and prevailing wage requirements. EPA has proposed numerous regulations since 2009 to implement the CWA, drawing both criticism and support from legislators. Critics accuse the EPA of overreaching its authority and underestimating the economic impacts of pollution control regulations. Congress has conducted oversight and introduced bills to limit the agency's authority. Environmental groups support the EPA's efforts, emphasizing the benefits of new regulations for economic activity and job creation. In the 114th Congress, scrutiny of EPA initiatives continued, including water quality issues like mountaintop coal mining in six Appalachian states. This practice involves removing mountain tops to recover coal seams, leading to excess spoil burying streams. The Obama Administration took steps to reduce environmental impacts of mountaintop mining in Appalachia, which critics say destroys stream water quality and wildlife habitat. The mining industry argues that mountaintop mining is necessary for coal mining in the region. The Administration's actions have been controversial with industry and Members of Congress. Legislation in the 114th Congress, such as H.R. 912 and H.R. 6411, aims to address controversies surrounding mountaintop mining. H.R. 912 proposes a moratorium on coal mining permits until health studies are conducted, while H.R. 6411 seeks to narrow the definition of \"fill material\" under the Clean Water Act. This could lead to stricter regulations under CWA Section 402 for discharges not eligible for a Section 404 permit. Section 402 discharge requirements are more restrictive than those for Section 404, some discharges permitted under Section 404 cannot be authorized under Section 402. Supporters want to make it harder to use Section 404 for environmentally harmful activities. Critics argue that economically important activities like coal mining may not meet the stricter limitations of a Section 402 permit, making them infeasible. EPA's controversial 2011 veto of a CWA Section 404 permit for the Spruce No. 1 mine in West Virginia drew attention, as it was issued after the Army Corps permit. In 2012, a federal court overturned EPA's veto of the Spruce No. 1 mine permit, but an appeals court upheld EPA's authority to veto permits. Bills were introduced in Congress to limit EPA's veto power. Clean water policy issues are regularly addressed in annual appropriations acts. EPA's FY2016 budget requested $8.6 billion. The Administration's FY2016 budget requested $8.6 billion for EPA, including funding for clean water SRF grants, surface water protection, and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. Increases were sought for various water quality grant programs. Final appropriations for EPA were part of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees' bills. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided funding for EPA, including $1.394 billion for clean water SRF grants, $30 million for water infrastructure projects, and $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The Administration's FY2017 budget requested $8.3 billion for EPA, with $979.5 million for clean water SRF grants. The FY2017 budget request for EPA included $979.5 million for clean water SRF grants, a decrease from the previous year. Congressional hearings criticized the proposed decrease, leading to differing funding amounts in appropriations bills. The House passed a bill with $1.0 billion for clean water SRF grants, while the Senate proposed $1.35 billion. However, Congress did not reach a final agreement on EPA funding. The Senate did not take up the bill, and Congress did not reach a final agreement on an EPA funding bill before the start of FY2017. However, a continuing resolution was passed on September 28 to extend FY2016 funding levels through December 9, 2016. Another continuing resolution extended funding levels from December 10, 2016, through April 28, 2017. The Administration's FY2017 budget included a $15 million request for EPA to begin making WIFIA loans, with the first appropriation of $20 million included in P.L. 114-254."
