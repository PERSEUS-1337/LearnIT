    "content": "Somatic cancer mutation detection at ultra-low variant allele frequencies (VAFs) is a challenge due to current methods requiring high depth of coverage for detection. A new method using spatial representation for convolutional architecture enables variant detection at VAFs independent of sequencing depth, allowing detection of cancer mutations even at VAFs as low as 10x-4^, >2. The method enables detection of cancer mutations at ultra-low variant allele frequencies (VAFs) independent of sequencing depth, down to 10x-4^, >2. Validated on simulated and clinical cfDNA plasma samples, it introduces somatic whole genome mutation calling for liquid biopsy in bioinformatics and personalized medicine. Cancer mutations provide crucial information on evolutionary history and personalized therapeutics. Cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) is a transformative platform for early-stage cancer screening and residual disease monitoring. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) found in plasma cfDNA correlates with tumor burden and changes in response to treatment. ctDNA can be detected even in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, potentially transforming diagnosis and treatment. However, the fraction of ctDNA in cfDNA is typically low, especially in low disease-burden contexts. The detection of cancer through cfDNA in low disease-burden settings poses challenges due to ultra-low VAFs compared to sequencing depth. Somatic mutations, mainly SNVs, occur at a frequency of 1-100 per million bases and are identified through sophisticated tools comparing sequencing reads in cancer and germline DNA. These statistical methods are essential for mutation identification. The statistical methods used for somatic mutation detection in cancer samples require multiple observations of the variant to distinguish true mutations from sequencing artifacts. Mutect is a state-of-the-art somatic mutation caller that uses Bayesian classifiers to identify true cancer variants. However, these methods face challenges in detecting mutations in ctDNA due to low variant allele frequencies (VAF) below 1%. Increasing sequencing depth can help in detecting mutations, but it is limited by the proportion of tumor DNA in the sample. In low disease-burden cfDNA settings, locus-centric mutation callers struggle with ultra-low VAFs. To address this, a novel \"readcentric\" approach using a convolutional neural network classifier called Kittyhawk was developed to distinguish true somatic cancer mutations from sequencing artifacts in low tumor fractions. The study focuses on detecting somatic cancer mutations in sequencing reads, utilizing distinct signatures to discriminate between mutations and sequencing errors. The methodology was applied to ctDNA detection of NSCLC due to the high mutation rate and clinical need for sensitive detection methods in NSCLC. The study utilized whole-genome sequencing to analyze NSCLC patients with high mutation rates and tobacco-related mutational sequences. Additionally, Melanoma patients were included to train a separate model. Libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq Nano kit, sequenced on an Illumina HiSeqX sequencer, and processed for mutation calling. Target depth was assessed for accurate results. The study used whole-genome sequencing to analyze NSCLC and Melanoma patients. Libraries were prepared with Illumina TruSeq Nano kit, sequenced on Illumina HiSeqX, and processed for mutation calling. Target depth of sequencing was greater than 40X. Reads with true cancer mutations or sequencing artifacts were curated, and a spatially-oriented representation of reads was created to capture alignment and genomic context. The study utilized whole-genome sequencing to analyze NSCLC and Melanoma patients, with libraries prepared using Illumina TruSeq Nano kit and sequenced on Illumina HiSeqX. Reads were curated for true cancer mutations or sequencing artifacts, and a spatially-oriented representation of reads was created to capture alignment and genomic context, including details on insertions, deletions, skipped positions, and soft-clipped bases. The alignment process involved using \"N\" to indicate insertions in the reference and deletions in the read sequence, as well as implementing soft masking to exclude regions of the read with potential sequencing inaccuracies. When designing a model for somatic mutation classification, it is crucial to recognize the sources of signal. True mutations are expected to have a higher base quality (BQ) regardless of their position in the read. The read base, reference base, and alignment string at the position of a true mutation are likely to be independent of the read alignment. True somatic mutations are spatially invariant, while sequencing errors are influenced by the position on the read. Some errors may exhibit positional invariance, such as sequencing artifacts caused by mis-mapping containing repetitive sequences or specific motifs. Our model must accurately represent spatial invariance in true somatic mutations and errors due to mapping, while maintaining a model of declining base quality along the read. To address this, we use an 8-layer convolutional neural network inspired by the VGG architecture. By convolving over all features at a position using a perceptive field of size three and applying max-pooling after two successive convolutional layers, we aim to capture the invariance in mutations. After two successive convolutional layers with max-pooling, our model retains important features in small spatial areas. This architecture maintains spatial invariance and captures a \"quality map\" by collapsing the read fragment into 25 segments. The output is fed into a sigmoid fully connected layer for final classification, using a logistic regression layer to retain positional features. The model, filters, and training scheme are named Kittyhawk, representing the first use of a read representation capturing genomic context and alignment. The model, named Kittyhawk, utilizes a read representation that captures genomic context, read sequence, and quality scores. Training was done using minibatch stochastic gradient descent with specific parameters. The model architecture includes successive convolutional layers with max-pooling to maintain spatial invariance and capture important features. The output is fed into a sigmoid fully connected layer for final classification. The CNN model named Kittyhawk utilizes convolutional layers with batch normalization and dropout for lung cancer dataset analysis. Evaluation on a validation dataset shows high F1-score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, indicating accurate mutation discrimination capabilities. The CNN model Kittyhawk accurately discriminates tumor cancer variant reads vs. sequencing artifact containing reads independently of coverage depth. It was tested on NSCLC and melanoma samples, achieving F1 scores of 0.92 and 0.71 respectively, showcasing its ability to learn specific signatures for high accuracy discrimination. The CNN model Kittyhawk achieves an F1-score of 0.71 on the melanoma sample, showing sensitivity but lower precision and specificity. It has learned mutation patterns for tobacco-exposed lung cancer and a general sequencing artifact pattern applicable to both tumor types. The tri-nucleotide context frequency differences were measured between true cancer mutation variant reads and sequencing artifact containing reads from lung cancer and melanoma patient samples. Tobacco-related lung adenocarcinoma samples exhibit high enrichment in C>A transversions, consistent with tobacco-related mutational signature. The study tested the CNN model Kittyhawk's ability to learn specific sequence contexts prevalent in tumor mutational data. High correlation was found between the model prediction and tri-nucleotide enrichment in lung cancer samples, indicating potential accuracy in classification independent of sequence context. The study tested the CNN model Kittyhawk's ability to learn specific sequence contexts prevalent in tumor mutational data. In a similar analysis with melanoma samples, a positive correlation between trinucleotide context and model predictions was observed, but it was lower than in lung cancer data. This led to the decision to train a separate model for detecting melanoma-related mutations, which showed high performance in validation datasets. The CNN model showed high performance in detecting melanoma-related mutations in validation datasets, with a lower F1 score in NSCLC data. The model's performance is independent of coverage and VAF, making it suitable for low disease-burden cancer detection. To test low frequency mutation detection, simulated plasma samples were generated with varying tumor mixtures. True cancer variant reads were re-labeled for accuracy. The study compared the performance of Kittyhawk, Mutect, Strelka, and SNooPer in detecting low VAF mutations. Kittyhawk showed consistent enrichment across different tumor fractions, outperforming the other methods. Mutect and Strelka's performance decreased with lower tumor fractions, unlike Kittyhawk. In low VAF mutations, Mutect and Strelka struggle to detect mutations at tumor fractions below 1%, while SNooPer can only make calls at 1% tumor fraction. Current mutation detection tools rely on multiple supporting reads for mutation calling, making Kittyhawk a more effective alternative for filtering in massively diluted cfDNA samples. In the clinical setting of cfDNA, the method's robustness was evaluated using patient samples and a control sample. True somatic mutation variants were defined using matched tumor and germline DNA. Kittyhawk classified reads as cancer variants, with false positives identified as reads not overlapping with tumor/normal mutation calls. This conservative approach accounts for potential spatial differences between cfDNA and tumor mutations. Kittyhawk's approach on patient-derived cfDNA detected 114-132 somatic SNVs out of 11,825-15,103 sSNVs in matched tumors, indicating ctDNA dilution to less than 1% in early stage cfDNA. It also identified 45-76 mutations in a benign lung nodule plasma sample, distinguishing malignant from benign samples and filtering out 90-93% of noise. Mutect yielded no variants in plasma samples, highlighting the challenge of ultra-low tumor fraction in cfDNA mutation calling. The prevailing mutation calling paradigm in cfDNA is challenged by ultra-low tumor fractions. Traditional mutation callers rely on observing cancer variants in multiple overlapping reads, but in ultra-low fractions, only a single mutated read may be present. To address this, a new read-centric approach using convolutional neuronal network learning is proposed, incorporating sequencing read information for improved mutation calling. The algorithm captures nucleotide sequence data in a spatial representation for image analysis, providing a 30-fold enrichment independent of variant allele fraction or coverage depth. It can detect tumor fractions as low as 10^-4 and uses a fully connected sigmoid layer to capture position in the read. Other architectures may be better for capturing relative position. The algorithm excludes extra information from read-pairs that could determine the strand of origin. The DNA fragment size distribution of ctDNA differs from other cfDNA. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are effective in using length as a feature in bioinformatics. Integrating an RNN instead of logistic regression could improve performance. The framework Kittyhawk can be adapted for mutation detection in low pass genome sequencing. A read-centric approach can be integrated with traditional locus-centric methods. Kittyhawk is the first somatic mutation caller designed for ultra-low allele frequency settings, where only a single supporting read is available for mutation identification in liquid biopsy. It uses a novel read representation and architecture to capture informative features, paving the way for non-invasive cancer screening and prognosis. The training scheme aims to detect true somatic mutations with high sensitivity and reject sequencing artifacts. Applied to ctDNA detection of NSCLC due to clinical need and high mutation rate. Used NSCLC and Melanoma WGS data for learning. Libraries prepared with Illumina TruSeq Nano kit. The Nano library preparation kit was used to prepare libraries for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeqX sequencer. Reads with true cancer mutations were curated using a consensus of mutation callers. The study curated true cancer mutation variant reads by identifying mutations in germline DNA samples and filtering out sequencing artifacts and rare germline SNPs. This was done to enable discrimination against sequencing artifacts and ensure the accuracy of the data. The study filtered out germline SNPs and sequencing artifacts to curate true cancer mutation variant reads. Variants with base quality scores below 20 and mapping qualities below 40 were excluded. 5-10% of reads per patient were held out during training. During somatic preprocessing, tumor and normal DNA sequencing data undergo alignment to the GRCh37 human reference genome using BWA, duplicate reads are marked with NovoSort, indels are realigned, and base recalibration is done with GATK. Basic DNA sequencing metrics are assessed using Picard tools. 201,730 reads per patient are held out for validation during training. During preprocessing, DNA data is analyzed using various tools (MeanQualityByCycle, CollectBaseDistributionByCycle, CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics, CollectInsertSizeMetrics, CollectGcBiasMetrics, CollectOxoGMetrics, FlagStat, ErrorRatePerCycle) for quality assessment. For WGS experiments, bedToolsCoverage and custom R scripts are used to calculate sequencing depth, while GATK CalculateHsMetrics and DepthOfCoverage are used for exomes and panels. Outlier detection is performed to identify samples needing manual review, with Conpair BID23 used for tumor-normal pair analysis. Autocorrelation BID46 is computed to assess coverage uniformity in sequencing data. We adapt WGS data by generating intervals with a window size of 1kb every 10kb along the genome, calculating read depth using Picard HsMetrics, and computing Autocorrelation. Somatic SNVs are called by muTect, Strelka, and LoFreq, while indels are called by Strelka, Pindel BID45, and Scalpel BID36. SNV and indel callers were chosen based on internal benchmarking on synthetic data. Structural variants are detected using tools like NBIC-seq, Crest BID41, Delly BID37, and BreakDancer BID25. We use tools like NBIC-seq, Crest, Delly, and BreakDancer to detect structural variants in WGS data. EXCAVATOR is used for detecting copy-number variants, with a \"contemporary normal\" sample like NA12878 when a matched normal sample is not available. PDX samples undergo additional preprocessing steps. Prior to the preprocessing pipeline, mouse reads are removed by aligning the data to a combined reference genome of mouse and human. A multi-step filtering process is used for SNVs and indels, with custom filtering scripts for Pindel and Scalpel. Variants meeting specific criteria are retained for each caller. The pipeline removes triallelic positions, filtering out common variants in specific genes for human samples and variants in dbSNPv138 for mouse samples. The resulting set of SNVs and indels is filtered with variants seen in dbSNPv138 and Mouse Genome Project (v3). Unified allele counts (UAC) are introduced to address discrepancies in ref/alt allele counts. Variants are annotated for their effect using tools like snpEff, MutationAssessor, and FATHMM Somatic for human samples, and snpEff for mouse samples based on ENSEMBL annotations. SVs and CNVs are filtered and annotated using in-house scripts and bedtools. SVs called by Crest, Delly, and BreakDancer are merged if they share at least 50% reciprocal overlap. After merging SVs with at least 50% reciprocal overlap and matching breakpoint orientations, breakpoints are annotated with CNV changepoints from NBIC-seq and validated with SplazerS. This step increases confidence in true SV breakpoints and removes germline SVs. SV filtering is crucial to eliminate false positives caused by overlooked germline SVs in the normal sample. SV filtering is essential to eliminate false positives caused by overlooked germline SVs in the normal sample. Germline variants are annotated and filtered through overlap with known SVs and an in-house blacklist. Prioritization is based on calls by multiple tools or confirmed by CNV changepoints and split reads. SV/CNV annotations include gene overlap and potential effects on gene structure. Crest-only calls are kept in the high confidence set for their specificity. The final segmentation of CNVs involves merging adjacent targets with the same normalized mean read count to identify deletions, amplifications, or copy-neutral events. Annotations include overlap with germline variants and cancer-specific events, utilizing in-house scripts and tools like bedtools for filtering and annotation. The curr_chunk discusses cancer-specific annotation, including overlap with genes and potential effects on gene structure. It also mentions the annotation of sequence features within breakpoint flanking regions and the classification of CNVs based on size. Additionally, it mentions the return of caller-ready BAM files for tumor and matched normal samples, as well as the output of SNVs/indels in various formats."
