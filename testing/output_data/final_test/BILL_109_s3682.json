    "content": "The \"America's Opportunity Scholarships for Kids Act\" aims to support students from low-income families attending schools identified for restructuring, allowing them to attend private or public schools outside their district or receive supplemental educational services. The Act defines terms like \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", \"Secretary\", and \"State educational agency\" according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An \"eligible entity\" can be a local educational agency, State educational agency, or nonprofit organization. An \"eligible student\" is a student from a low-income family attending a school identified for restructuring. Eligibility criteria for students identified for restructuring under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 include enrolling in the school, attending for the previous school year, transferring to the school for the remainder of the current school year, or receiving a scholarship in a preceding year. The term \"low-income family\" refers to a family whose income does not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line, or 220 percent for students participating in the program for a second or subsequent year. The \"poverty line\" is defined as the official poverty line set by the Office of Management and Budget for a family of the size involved. Private provider refers to a for-profit or nonprofit organization offering supplemental educational services approved by the State educational agency. Supplemental educational services are defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The program authorized by SEC. 4 is for private providers to offer supplemental educational services approved by the State educational agency. The Secretary shall award grants to eligible entities on a competitive basis to support projects providing scholarships for eligible students to attend private or public schools of their choice, or to receive supplemental educational services annually. The scholarship duration rule states that eligible entities receiving grants under the Act can only award scholarships to eligible students for the first school year they are eligible for restructuring, and for each subsequent school year until the final grade taught at the identified school. The Secretary may award grants under this Act for up to 5 years, prioritizing entities serving students in schools identified for restructuring, informing parents about school options, and providing scholarships to help with costs. To be considered for a grant under this Act, eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary with a plan to recruit private schools, local educational agencies, charter schools, and private providers to meet student demand for school admission. The application must include necessary information as required by the Secretary. The eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary with a plan to recruit schools and providers to meet student demand for admission. The application should include school information and how the entity will work with schools and local educational agencies. The eligible entity must identify schools and the local educational agency to locate parents of eligible students, ensuring compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. The entity must also plan how eligible students can continue to participate in the project in subsequent school years if their schools receive restructuring under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The eligible entity must outline how funds will be used, ensure fair selection of students, inform parents about choice opportunities, and guarantee schools receiving students comply with regulations. The eligible entity must prioritize between scholarships and supplemental educational services, address renewal of support for students, and may reserve up to 5% of the grant funds. The Act allows for up to 5% of grant funds to be reserved for administrative expenses and initial implementation costs in the first year. The funds are to be used for providing scholarships to eligible students. The Act allows for grant funds to be used to pay for tuition, fees, transportation expenses, and supplemental educational services for eligible students, with scholarship and costs limits per student per school year. The Act allows grant funds to cover tuition, fees, transportation, and educational services for eligible students, with a limit of $3,000 per student per school year. Eligible entities must prioritize scholarships for private or public school attendance outside the student's home district, then use remaining funds for educational services. Payments are made to parents of participating students. Each eligible entity receiving a grant under this Act must submit a final report on the project's results, including academic achievement of students. Students receiving supplemental educational services under this Act cannot receive other similar services under a different education act. Each eligible entity receiving a grant under this Act must collect and report performance information for a national evaluation. The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of the program's impact on student achievement and report the results to Congress. SEC. 5. NONDISCRIMINATION. An eligible entity or school participating in a project under this Act cannot discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The prohibition of sex discrimination does not apply to a school operated by a religious organization if it conflicts with their beliefs. Parents have the choice to enroll their child. The Act allows for single-sex schools or activities to be offered and enrolled in, funded under the Act. Neutrality provisions from the Education Amendments of 1972 apply. The Act does not affect the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Religious schools can exercise employment rights consistent with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Act of 1964 allows religious schools to maintain their teaching mission, religious symbols, and references, even if they receive funds under the Act for an eligible student chosen by their parent. The Act of 1964 allows religious schools to maintain their teaching mission and religious symbols, even if they receive funds for an eligible student. Scholarships provided under this Act to a student are considered assistance to the parent, not the school. The scholarship amount is not treated as income for tax purposes or eligibility for other federal programs. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 and necessary sums for the following 4 years."
