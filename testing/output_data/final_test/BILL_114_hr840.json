The number of engineering degrees awarded to African-American women has declined since the late 1990s. Half of all STEM jobs do not require a 4-year college degree and pay an average of $53,000 per year. STEM jobs pay $53,000 per year on average and offer opportunities for workers with certificates or associate degrees. Only 1/5 of the Federal Government's $4.3 billion annual spending on STEM education supports training below the baccalaureate level. Underrepresented minorities make up only 3 out of 10 professionals in STEM fields. STEM workers earn more than non-STEM counterparts. \"Afterschool programs have higher participation rates among African-American, Hispanic, and Native American children compared to the national average. Girls participate equally to boys. This presents an opportunity to engage underrepresented populations in STEM fields and careers.\" The grant program is authorized. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities on a competitive basis to carry out programs in STEM fields for women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds at elementary and secondary school levels. The goals include encouraging interest, providing hands-on learning opportunities, and supporting classroom success in STEM disciplines. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities for STEM programs at elementary and secondary school levels. Grants will support career preparation and education opportunities in STEM fields. Grants are limited to a 5-year period and require an application with specific information. The grant funds will be used for STEM programs at elementary schools to support the success of women, girls, underrepresented minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds.
