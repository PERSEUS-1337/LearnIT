    "content": "The Black Lung Benefits Act Amendments of 1993, also known as the \"Black Lung Benefits Act,\" includes special provisions for claims procedures. This Act amends the Black Lung Benefits Act by adding a new part called \"PART D--SPECIAL PROVISIONS\" which includes section 441 on claims. The Black Lung Benefits Act Amendments of 1993, also known as the \"Black Lung Benefits Act,\" includes provisions for claims related to death or total disability of a miner due to pneumoconiosis. If specific conditions are met, such as positive medical tests indicating pneumoconiosis or respiratory disease severity, the miner is presumed to be totally disabled by or to have died because of pneumoconiosis. The Black Lung Benefits Act Amendments of 1993 establish criteria for claims related to death or total disability of a miner due to pneumoconiosis. If medical evidence shows a severe impairment in oxygen transfer or a respiratory disease preventing coal mine work, the miner is presumed to be disabled. The claimant is not required to prove these criteria by a preponderance of evidence. The Black Lung Benefits Act Amendments of 1993 provide criteria for claims related to death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis. If a miner worked 10 or more years in a coal mine and presents evidence of pneumoconiosis, there is a rebuttable presumption that it arose from coal mine employment. Affidavits from co-workers can be accepted as proof of employment if Social Security records are incomplete. If a miner cannot prove 10 years of coal mine employment, they can still prove pneumoconiosis is due to coal mine work. The Black Lung Benefits Act Amendments of 1993 establish criteria for claims of death or total disability from pneumoconiosis related to coal mine employment. The presumption of total disability can be rebutted with evidence that the miner is still able to do their coal mine work or comparable gainful work. The Secretary of Labor can provide limited evidence in rebuttal of the presumption. The Secretary of Labor may submit limited evidence to supplement claims of death or total disability from pneumoconiosis related to coal mine employment. The presumption of total disability can only be rebutted with clear and convincing proof that the miner's condition did not arise from coal mine employment. \"SEC. 442. APPLICATION OF SECTION 441.\" The Secretary of Labor will review all claims filed under part C to determine eligibility under the presumption of section 441(a), regardless of previous denials or awards of benefits. Claimants will be promptly notified of the review process. The Secretary will review all claims under part C for eligibility based on section 441(a) presumption. Claimants cannot submit additional evidence unless the Secretary deems it necessary. If evidence on file does not meet eligibility criteria, claimants can provide additional evidence. The Secretary cannot supplement evidence during the review process. If a claim is determined to meet eligibility requirements under section 441(a), the individual will be awarded benefits prospectively and retroactively from January 1, 1974, if they have not received benefits and are eligible. Claims not subject to special review under subsection (a). Benefits eligible under sections 441 or 442 will be paid from the fund. Judicial review is outlined in section 444. \"A claimant denied benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act can petition for review in the United States District Court. The Secretary of Labor will be referenced instead of the Secretary in the Social Security Act, and there is no time limit for petitioning if the denial was due to a regulation violating federal law.\" A petition for review under this section may not be denied because the claimant has not exhausted administrative remedies. SEC. 445. SURVIVORS AND DEPENDENTS. The Secretary awards benefits to survivors or dependents of deceased miners under specific conditions: if the miner worked 25 years in coal mines, if the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis, if the miner was receiving benefits for pneumoconiosis at the time of death, or if a claim for benefits was pending with sufficient medical evidence of impairment. The section defines survivors and dependents eligible for benefits under specific conditions, including those who filed claims under part C after the enactment of the Act or whose claims under part B or C are eligible for review under section 442. The section outlines provisions related to multiple claims, appeals by the Secretary, and reopening claims under the Act. It allows claimants to file additional claims without showing a material change, restricts the Secretary from appealing certain decisions, and limits the reopening of claims without evidence of fraud. SEC. 3. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. Amends the Social Security Act to include benefits payable under the Black Lung Benefits Act. SEC. 4. BENEFIT REPAYMENTS. Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act is amended to include a provision stating that if a claimant receives benefits under a claim before final adjudication, and is later found ineligible, they will not be required to repay the benefits received. The amendment to Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act states that claimants who receive benefits before final adjudication and are later found ineligible will not have to repay the benefits received. If repayment is required, the Secretary will refund the amount repaid by the claimant. SEC. 5. WIDOW'S BENEFITS. A widow of a miner receiving benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act will not lose eligibility if she remarries. The widow is entitled to benefits regardless of the length of marriage to the miner. Any regulations disqualifying a widow who remarries or imposing a minimum marriage period will be void. Widows entitled to benefits under this provision must file a claim within 3 years of the enactment of this Act."
