    "content": "The Children's Health Care Quality Act, also known as the Pediatric Quality and Performance Measures Program, aims to advance new quality and performance measures for children's health care. This program is added to Title XIX of the Social Security Act. The Children's Health Care Quality Act establishes a program to develop new quality and performance measures for pediatric care, ensuring evidence-based measures are available for improving care and outcomes for children. The Children's Health Care Quality Act establishes a program to develop quality and performance measures for pediatric services, including identifying existing evidence-based measures and opportunities for new measures. The Secretary will consult with States, pediatric hospitals, pediatricians, and other health professionals in this process. The Children's Health Care Quality Act establishes a program to develop quality and performance measures for pediatric services. The Secretary will consult with pediatric health professionals, national organizations representing consumers and purchasers of children's health care, experts in pediatric quality and performance measurement, and organizations involved in consensus on evidence-based measures of health care. Grants or contracts will be awarded for the development, validation, and testing of new quality and performance measures for providers of pediatric services. The Children's Health Care Quality Act establishes a program to develop quality and performance measures for pediatric services. The Secretary will award grants or contracts to eligible consensus entities for the development of evidence-based measures for pediatric care. The Children's Health Care Quality Act establishes a program to develop quality and performance measures for pediatric services. Eligible entities include organizations with expertise in pediatric quality measures, health care providers working with accrediting organizations, and national pediatric organizations collaborating to improve pediatric care. The Children's Health Care Quality Act establishes a program for developing pediatric quality measures. Eligible consensus entities, including voluntary consensus standards organizations, work on evidence-based measures. The Secretary can update measures based on consensus organization recommendations or new evidence. Additionally, pediatric consumer assessment measures may be added to the CAHPS Hospital Survey conducted by AHRQ. The Director of AHRQ will add consumer assessment measures for hospital services for children to the CAHPS Hospital survey. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 for this purpose. Title II of the Social Security Act authorizes grants to states for demonstration projects transforming the delivery of pediatric care. The Secretary will establish demonstration projects in multiple States to improve health care services for children under title XXI. Projects will focus on health information technology systems and last for 4 years. States must show commitment to transforming pediatric care to be eligible for grants. The Secretary will establish demonstration projects in multiple States to improve health care services for children under title XXI. Projects will focus on developing health information technology systems, including technology acquisition, electronic health record development, data standards development, and software development for pediatric hospital and physician services. Additionally, projects will implement model systems and evaluate their impact on the quality, safety, and costs of care. Disease management projects will provide provider-based care management for children with chronic conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness of provider-based management models in promoting better care and reducing adverse health outcomes. Evidence-based quality improvement projects will focus on implementing evidence-based approaches to improving efficiency. The curr_chunk focuses on implementing evidence-based approaches to improve efficiency, safety, and effectiveness in delivering hospital care for children. It includes evaluating successful models of these approaches at other institutions and assessing their impact on quality, safety, and costs of care. The chunk also mentions piloting evidence-based quality and performance measures for children's health care services to enhance quality and delivery of care. The Secretary will establish uniform metrics, collect data, and conduct evaluations for each demonstration project category related to children's health care. Consultation with experts, participating States, pediatric provider organizations, health care consumers, and other relevant entities will be done. Evaluation and reporting on the outcomes will also be conducted. The Secretary will evaluate and report on the demonstration projects, including recommendations for expansion and broader implementation of successful approaches in delivering medical assistance to children. The Secretary may waive certain requirements to carry out the projects, and amounts paid to a State under this section are in addition to Federal payments. The additional funds provided to States for participating in demonstration projects are separate from Federal payments under section 1903(a) and cannot be used for the State share of expenditures. These funds are designated for State and provider expenses related to the projects, including administrative costs and other eligible expenditures determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may determine appropriate appropriations of $10,000,000 for each fiscal year 2009 through 2013 for carrying out this section. The Comptroller General will report on a demonstration project evaluating quality and performance measures for children's inpatient hospital services. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress with recommendations for a demonstration project to assess quality and performance measures for children's inpatient hospital services. This project aims to differentiate quality, identify best practices, and establish a basis for payment rewards. The report will also determine the agency responsible for overseeing the project and the number of participating entities. The report will determine the necessary number of hospitals and volume of children's cases for the demonstration project, as well as the required States and geographic locations. It will also outline funding administration alternatives and consistency requirements for measures. The report will determine requirements for consistency in measures, metrics, and risk adjustment for a demonstration project across hospitals and State lines. It will also consider infrastructure requirements for public reporting of quality and performance measures for children's inpatient hospital services at national and State levels, estimating the cost of the project. Additionally, suggestions for existing measures to be evaluated under the demonstration project will be included in the report. The report will suggest evidence-based measures for pediatric inpatient conditions, including high volume, high cost, high morbidity, and high-risk cases. These measures should be feasible to collect, include risk adjustment when necessary, and have consensus within the pediatric hospital community. The Comptroller General will consult with national associations of pediatric hospitals, experts in pediatric quality measurement, voluntary consensus standards organizations, and the Department of Health and Human Services to determine existing evidence-based measures for pediatric inpatient conditions. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with states and other purchasers, are involved in the procurement of healthcare items and services."
