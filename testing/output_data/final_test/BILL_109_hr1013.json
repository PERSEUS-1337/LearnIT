    "content": "The Act titled \"Product Safety Notification and Recall Effectiveness Act of 2005\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds that the Consumer Product Safety Commission conducts around 300 recalls of hazardous consumer products annually. The Commission heavily relies on media and retailers to alert consumers about unsafe products due to limited contact information from manufacturers. Only about 7 percent of consumer products have known consumer contact information. The Consumer Product Safety Commission emphasizes the importance of direct consumer contact for product recalls. Companies with consumer purchase data can effectively notify consumers of recalls. The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff found that simplified product registration cards accompanying products like small household appliances and child safety seats in motor vehicles increase consumer participation in recalls. This aims to improve recall effectiveness and reduce deaths and injuries from defective products. The Consumer Product Safety Commission aims to improve recall effectiveness by requiring manufacturers to include product safety owner cards with certain consumer products or develop electronic registration for first purchasers. They also encourage creativity in notifying consumers about product recalls. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms from the Consumer Product Safety Act, including \"covered consumer product\" which includes juvenile products, small household appliances, and other products deemed appropriate by the Commission. Juvenile products are durable items for children under 5 years old, such as cribs. The Act defines juvenile products as durable items for children under 5 years old, including full-size cribs, toddler beds, high chairs, bath seats, gates, playpens, strollers, walkers, swings, child carriers, bassinets, cradles, and children's toys. The term \"product safety owner card\" refers to a standardized product identification card supplied with a consumer product by the manufacturer. The term \"small household appliance\" refers to consumer products like toasters, toaster ovens, blenders, food processors, coffee makers, and similar items. These products come with a product safety owner card that only requires minimal personal information from the consumer for recall purposes. Rule requiring system to provide notice of recalls for certain consumer products. The Commission will promulgate a rule requiring manufacturers of covered consumer products to establish a system for notifying consumers of recalls. This system must include product safety owner cards, Internet registration, or other specified methods to create a database for recall notifications. Alternative methods may involve online product registration and consumer information databases. The Commission will require manufacturers to implement electronic methods like bar codes or embedded chips to inform consumers about product recalls. The rule must align with the Commission staff proposal titled \"Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled Purchaser Owner Card Program\". Deadlines for issuing proposed and final rules are set at 90 and 270 days respectively after the enactment of the Act."
