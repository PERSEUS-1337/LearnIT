    "content": "Section 203 of the Federal and Administrative Services Act of 1949 is amended to include a new subsection allowing Native Americans the opportunity to repurchase surplus real property. The definitions of 'administrator' and 'base closure law' are provided within this subsection. The Realignment Act of 1990, Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1993, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994, and other laws govern the disposition of real property related to military base closures or realignments. The term 'depreciated value' refers to the replacement cost of a building minus all forms of depreciation. 'Native American Trust Organization' is defined as an organization that holds land in trust for Native Americans. 'Notice of intent to repurchase' is a written notice. The term 'notice of intent to repurchase' is a written notice from a Native American Trust Organization to the Administrator indicating the intention to repurchase qualified property at fair market value. Qualified property refers to surplus property acquired by the Federal Government from a Native American Trust Organization in Hawaii. The term 'trust fund' refers to the Shared Appreciation Trust Fund established under paragraph (5). No qualified property can be disposed of under any other provision if determined surplus within 90 days. Native American Trust Organizations can repurchase surplus property acquired by the United States at fair market value. Organizations can submit a list of properties to the Administrator to qualify for repurchase. The Administrator notifies Native American Trust Organizations of surplus property determinations. Organizations can repurchase qualified properties within 90 days of notice. The United States offers to sell qualified property to Native American Trust Organizations if they fail to repurchase within 90 days. If no timely notice or contract is made, disposal will be handled under other provisions. The Administrator may dispose of qualified property if there is a failure to repurchase within 90 days. A Shared Appreciation Trust Fund can be established in the Treasury of the United States to hold transferred amounts and interest earned. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers proceeds from the sale of qualified property to a trust fund, equal to the difference between the sale proceeds and the amount paid for the property. The interest on the consideration for the acquisition of qualified property is calculated annually at a determined rate. The trust fund corpus is invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury can only withdraw income from the trust fund for specific uses described annually. The Treasury withdraws income from the trust fund annually to fund activities related to Native Hawaiian education, health scholarships, and healthcare. The Native American Trust Organization owns property generating trust funds for specific purposes. Qualified property is exempt from certain laws regarding homeless assistance and base closure."
