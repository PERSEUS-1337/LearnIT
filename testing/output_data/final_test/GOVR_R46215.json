    "content": "Since the 1960s, Congress has passed measures to authorize and fund international family planning activities to provide access to contraceptive methods and services. This assistance aims to support broader U.S. international development priorities by addressing poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth in developing countries. Effective family planning is dependent on economic and social change, as well as the delivery of services, and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. The U.S. authorizes assistance for voluntary population planning programs to address the impact of population growth on development. This includes providing family planning information and services, supporting natural family planning methods, and conducting relevant demographic research. Family planning programs have evolved to include a wide range of reproductive health issues beyond contraception, such as female genital mutilation and gender-based violence. This broader scope is reflected in the categorization of activities as reproductive health/family planning assistance. The United States is the largest donor to international family planning programs, providing $575 million annually. Despite consistent funding, these programs face congressional debate over concerns about indirect support for abortion and cultural appropriateness. This report focuses on the scope and impact of U.S. bilateral international family planning programs. The U.S. bilateral international family planning programs, administered by USAID, aim to provide women with information and services for informed contraceptive decisions and healthy reproductive systems. Around 885 million women worldwide want to avoid or delay pregnancy, with 24% lacking access to these services. Access to family planning is crucial for safe motherhood, as bearing children too closely, early, or late can pose risks. Improving access to family planning services has benefits for children's health, women's empowerment, and sustainable growth. Critics of international family planning programs are concerned about U.S. funds indirectly supporting abortion or sterilization. Some argue that foreign assistance for contraceptives is an imposition on local cultural or religious norms. Since U.S. bilateral FP/RH programs were launched in 1965, they have evolved to reflect changes in global health priorities and emphasize the link between development and gender. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 first authorized research on family planning issues, and in 1965 Congress authorized USAID to create contraceptive distribution programs through the Office of Population. Initial programs focused on procuring contraceptive supplies for distribution in developing countries. Critics question the allocation of specific resources for FP/RH programs instead of broader women's health programs or other development priorities. Since the launch of U.S. bilateral FP/RH programs in 1965, USAID has expanded international family planning assistance to include programs on fertility, reproductive and women's health, and maternal and child health. The programs evolved from focusing on procuring contraceptive supplies to advancing women's status and empowerment. USAID reorganized the program into an Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH) to reflect changing attitudes and development strategies. Family planning activities under USAID's FP/RH programs are administered through the Office of Population and Reproductive Health (PRH) within the agency's Global Health Bureau. PRH sets technical and programmatic direction, distributes FP/RH commodities and services through contracts with NGOs, and oversees implementing partners. The programming focuses on six priorities, including supporting healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy and advancing community-based delivery of services. The USAID FP/RH programs focus on priorities such as deploying community health workers, ensuring contraceptive supplies, providing access to surgical sterilization and long-acting contraceptives, integrating FP/RH with HIV/AIDS and maternal health programs, and addressing policy areas like child marriage and gender-based violence. USAID works with partners to fund programs for family planning and reproductive health, including delivery of services, contraceptive supply, and biomedical research. In FY2018, USAID donated 28 million male condoms to developing countries through implementing partners. USAID utilizes biomedical and social science evidence to improve family planning services globally. They partner with national governments and implementing partners to conduct surveys on health attitudes and behaviors in various regions. USAID also offers technical assistance in areas such as performance and quality improvement and health communication. Health communication strategies are used by USAID to educate women and families on contraception, birth spacing, and GBV prevention. They support behavior change campaigns and community health promoters to raise awareness on reproductive health services and the risks of FGM/C. USAID also provides support for policy analysis and planning to improve FP/RH policies and women's health outcomes. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of Kenya's health policies and contraceptive distribution programs to impact fertility rates. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of programs is crucial for understanding the effects of services provided with U.S. government assistance. Integration of family planning/reproductive health (FP/RH) and maternal child health (MCH) activities is emphasized, as access to family planning services can prevent maternal deaths. MCH programs serve as an entry point for promoting awareness and access to family planning services, especially during the post-natal period. Evidence suggests that women have an increased desire to plan or prevent future pregnancies, with USAID supporting integration of FP/RH and MCH services in various countries. USAID funds separate MCH and FP/RH programs, with a focus on issues like adolescent sexual health and GBV. In India, USAID FP/RH funds support programs for GBV survivors. In 2018, USAID supported family planning and reproductive health programs in over 40 countries. In 2018, USAID supported bilateral family planning and reproductive health aid programs in over 40 countries, with a focus on \"priority\" countries in Africa with low rates of modern contraceptive use and high maternal mortality rates. Priority countries are selected based on need, national commitment, and potential for U.S. government support. Top recipients of U.S. FP/RH assistance in 2018 included Nigeria. In 2018, USAID provided bilateral family planning and reproductive health aid programs in over 40 countries, with top recipients being Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania. Additionally, USAID allocated $2 million or less annually to support FP/RH programs in 18 countries with a need for family planning services. Ukraine also receives USAID FP/RH funds as part of a strategy to support the country against Russian aggression. USAID has a country graduation process for FP/RH assistance to transition countries off U.S. foreign aid and prioritize funding allocation. USAID's \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" policy framework aims to strengthen partner countries' development agendas. Countries receiving family planning assistance can \"graduate\" upon meeting criteria like a contraceptive prevalence rate of 51% and fertility rate below 3.1 children per woman. Additional factors are considered for graduation readiness. Countries meeting criteria but lacking implementation capacity may still receive aid. USAID evaluates government funding for contraception procurement and health ministry capacity for program management. USAID evaluates countries' readiness for graduation based on various indicators, including access to family planning methods, limited USAID subsidies, and quality of care standards. So far, 25 countries have graduated, with Brazil being an example in 2000 due to increased investment in family planning and economic growth. Partners in Brazil focused on improving access to healthcare and reducing legal barriers for importing medical supplies. This effort led to an increase in contraceptive prevalence rate from 34% in 1970 to 72% in 2000. After graduation, USAID reallocates resources based on need, as seen with the formation of the Ouagadougou Partnership in 2011. The partnership involving the government of France, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Hewlett Foundation aims to improve access to family planning services in francophone West Africa. Bilateral FP/RH assistance is primarily funded through the Global Health Programs (GHP) account, with smaller amounts from other accounts like the Department of State Economic Support Fund (ESF) for select countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Jordan. In FY2017, Afghanistan received $20 million in FP/RH funding. In FY2017, Afghanistan, a USAID FP/RH priority country, received $20 million in bilateral family planning assistance through the ESF. Enacted funding levels for international FP/RH aid have remained consistent over the past decade. The absence of foreign assistance authorization legislation has made annual consideration of foreign aid appropriations the primary venue for debating international family planning and reproductive health policy, including controversies like the Mexico City Policy/Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance. Members of Congress have varying perspectives on funding for contraceptive provision and family planning in developing countries. Debates in the 116th Congress have also focused on issues such as the role of faith-based contractors in USAID programs and language surrounding sexual and reproductive health services. Controversies have arisen over how these services are described in government documents. The 116th Congress may focus on three key areas regarding U.S. support for international family planning and reproductive health efforts: restrictions under the MCP/PLGHA, funding levels in appropriations bills, and program reforms in pending legislation. The Mexico City Policy requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they will not promote abortion. The policy has been lifted and reinstated through Executive Orders by various Presidents since 1984. The Mexico City Policy, reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001 and expanded in 2003, was rescinded by President Obama in 2009. The Trump Administration reinstated and expanded the policy to include all U.S. global health assistance, renaming it Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA). Advocates urge Congress to codify the policy to prevent future revocations, while detractors call for legislation to prevent its imposition through Executive Order. Some international FP/RH program advocates raise concerns about compliance issues and confusion with the expanded MCP/PLGHA policy, stating that it has made programs cumbersome and ineffective. Field reports suggest that providers may not be aware of restrictions due to the policy being \"embedded\" in funding agreements like \"fine print,\" creating barriers to care. Advocates of the policy argue that it closes loopholes and is necessary for compliance. The State Department acknowledged confusion over the MCP/PLGHA policy's impact on program effectiveness and committed to a review in 2018. However, as of February 2020, no plans for a second review had been announced. Congress could mandate the review through legislation or conduct oversight activities. Recent debates have focused on where and how international family planning funding should be allocated, with $575 million appropriated for FY2020. Advocates argue for doubling funding to make services accessible to all women in need. Advocates push for increased funding of $1.5 billion to make family planning and reproductive services accessible to all women in need, citing the detrimental effects of consistently flat funding on U.S. global development goals. Opponents question the demand for international family planning services and suggest reallocating resources to other development activities, citing religious and moral controversies in some countries. Increased donor funding for international family planning programs may lead to improved contraceptive use and maternal health outcomes. Questions have been raised about the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these programs compared to other types of U.S. assistance. Data shows positive impacts in some countries, but attributing results solely to U.S. programming is debated due to various influencing factors. Congress may need to assess funding levels based on need, potential impact, and alignment with strategic goals and foreign policy objectives. Integration of FP/RH and MCH programs is not common due to separate funding sources, which results in separate program administration. Proponents argue that combining these services can improve women's access to contraception, maternal health outcomes, and health system capacity. However, opponents raise concerns about potential loss of congressional control and the need to respect local cultural norms when integrating services. In some contexts, service integration could be detrimental to MCH activities if associated with less socially acceptable family planning programs. Aid-recipient countries may resist integration when separate government health units administer international FP/RH and MCH services. Concerns have been raised that embedding FP/RH programs in MCH services could limit USAID programs addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health, CEFM, GBV, and obstetric fistula. Congress may consider formally integrating FP/RH and MCH funding streams to enhance program efficacy. In the 116th Congress, there are pending proposals related to international FP/RH programs. H.R. 661, the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Act of 2019, aims to expand the Mexico City Policy to include all global health assistance. H.R. 1581 and S. 707, the Reproductive Rights are Human Rights Act of 2019, seek to include discussions on human rights in countries receiving U.S. development and security assistance. The bills in the 116th Congress aim to include discussions on reproductive rights in countries receiving U.S. development and security assistance. This includes promoting access to contraception, safe pregnancy and childbirth services, safe abortion services, preventing maternal deaths, and addressing discrimination and violence against women and girls in health care settings. The reports would also include data on maternal deaths and the government's response to these issues."
