The delivery of oil from Canada through the Keystone XL pipeline is in the national interest to reduce dependence on foreign sources and create employment opportunities. The State of Nebraska has approved the Keystone XL pipeline reroute after considering Nebraskans' concerns and finding minimal environmental impacts. The Department of State and Federal agencies conducted extensive studies on the pipeline's technical, environmental, social, and economic impacts, concluding that it will not affect crude oil production from the oil sands. The Department of State found that the Keystone XL project will have minimal impact on crude oil production from the oil sands and will result in a small increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of State found that the Keystone XL pipeline project would have no significant impacts on land and water resources along its proposed route. The transportation of oil via pipeline is deemed the safest and most effective method, with a strong safety and environmental protection record. The Department of State determined that the Keystone XL pipeline would have minimal environmental impact and high safety standards, similar to the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 before congressional action. The Federal regulatory process remains a significant obstacle to a project aimed at reducing oil imports from insecure foreign sources, similar to the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 before congressional action.
