    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Board of Education amends Section 33039 of the Education Code to develop guidelines for teacher evaluation procedures and distribute them to school districts. Article 14 is added to Chapter 3 of Part 25 of Division 3 of the Education Code, outlining Common Evaluation System Provisions. Common Evaluation System Provisions include various measures of pupil progress and achievement, such as state-adopted assessments, school-developed assessments, pretest and posttest data, English language proficiency assessments, and industry-recognized career technical education assessments. The employing authority must use a minimum of three rating levels for evaluating certificated employees. Two rating levels must identify employees meeting specific criteria. Other evaluation measures include portfolios of work, surveys from parents and pupils, written reports from observations, and progress on local control and accountability plan outcomes. Employees who require additional support and training to improve their performance or conduct, or who have refused to participate in mandatory corrective action, may receive an unsatisfactory rating. This rating level is applicable to specific circumstances outlined in the evaluation process. If a certificated employee receives a specific rating on an evaluation, they must participate in the California Peer Assistance and Review Program for Teachers. The school district must consider the employee's eligibility for professional development and prioritize their access to training supported by legislative funds, including state academic content standards and services for English learners. The governing board of a school district must establish standards for pupil achievement and evaluate certificated employee performance in relation to those standards. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code. The evaluation of certificated employee performance includes monitoring pupil progress towards standards, instructional techniques used, adherence to curricular objectives, and creating a suitable learning environment. The governing board of a school district defines job responsibilities for certificated noninstructional personnel and evaluates their performance. Results from the California Peer Assistance and Review Program may be included in evaluations. Evaluation of certificated employee performance does not involve standardized test norms. The governing board of a school district has the authority to develop additional evaluation guidelines. Evidence of pupil progress can include various assessments such as state-adopted tests, district-developed assessments, and English language proficiency tests, among others. The employing authority must use a minimum of three rating levels for evaluating certificated employees, with at least two levels identifying those needing additional support to improve their performance. This evaluation process includes industry-recognized career technical education assessments, portfolios of work and projects, pupil performances, and surveys from parents. Employees may face consequences such as reassignment, suspension, or adverse action for unsatisfactory performance, refusal to participate in corrective action, or failure to undergo required training. The evaluation and assessment of certificated employees must be documented in writing and provided to the employee at least 30 days before the end of the school year. The employee has the right to respond in writing, which will be added to their personnel file. A meeting between the employee and evaluator must be held before the end of the school year to discuss the evaluation. Evaluation and assessment of certificated noninstructional employees on a 12-month basis must be reduced to writing and provided by June 30. The employee has the right to respond in writing, which becomes a permanent attachment to their personnel file. A meeting between the employee and evaluator must be held before July 30 to discuss the evaluation. Certificated personnel must be evaluated annually for probationary employees, biennially for those with permanent status, and every five years for highly qualified personnel with over 10 years of experience, as long as previous evaluations met or exceeded standards and both parties agree. Withdrawal of consent is allowed at any time. The evaluation of certificated personnel includes recommendations for improvement if necessary. If an employee's performance is unsatisfactory, they will be notified in writing and given specific recommendations for improvement. The employee will be evaluated annually until they receive a positive evaluation or are separated from the district. The evaluation of certificated personnel may require participation in a program to improve performance and pupil achievement. If a district is part of the California Peer Assistance and Review Program for Teachers, employees with unsatisfactory ratings must participate in the program. The district must prioritize the employee's eligibility for professional development, including training on state academic content standards and services for English learners, to assist the employee as required by law. The governing board may exclude hourly certificated employees and substitute teachers from this section. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
