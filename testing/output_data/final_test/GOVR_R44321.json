    "content": "In recent years, efforts have been made to create a more diverse military workforce. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission was established by Congress in 2009 to evaluate policies for promoting minority members in the Armed Forces. Despite progress, women and racial/ethnic minorities still lack representation in top leadership roles. President Obama issued an Executive Order in 2011 to address this issue. Barack Obama's Executive Order called for diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce, while Congress reaffirmed a commitment to diversity in the military. The importance of diversity in acquiring military capabilities was highlighted in the 2015 National Military Strategy. The U.S. military emphasizes the importance of diversity in enhancing warfighting capabilities by attracting, developing, and retaining the right people at every level. The Department of Defense's pursuit of a diversity management program aims to broaden the pool of high-quality recruits and retain individuals who can fill required roles. Definitions of diversity and equal opportunity have evolved over time, influenced by changes in law and policies towards inclusion of various demographic groups in military service. Since 2009, Congress and the Department of Defense have made significant changes to laws and policies regarding diversity and inclusion in the Armed Forces. This includes allowing openly gay individuals to serve and recognizing their same-sex spouses as dependents. The Department of Defense has made changes to allow openly gay individuals to serve and recognize their same-sex spouses as dependents, opened combat assignments to women, and lifted restrictions on transgender troops serving. Some argue these changes are happening too quickly, while others believe they reflect broader societal shifts and will strengthen the military. The report discusses the value of diversity in organizations and outlines DOD's policies and processes for managing diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity. The report examines the evolution of diversity and inclusion in the Armed Forces, current demographic composition, legislative issues, and the importance of workforce diversity in military personnel management. Many argue that diversity is a core value in society and organizations should seek it regardless of its impact on performance metrics. From a human resource perspective, diversity is studied for its impact on group dynamics, cohesion, and effectiveness. Studies have shown mixed findings on the impact of diversity on these factors, with some suggesting it is beneficial for organizational success while others argue it might be harmful. The Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces defines military cohesion as the development of a strong bond within a unit where members share common values, conform to group norms, focus on group activities and goals, and become dependent on each other for mission completion and survival. Military cohesion is seen as a positive attribute that enhances teamwork and performance under stressful conditions, leading to benefits such as increased job satisfaction, retention, and better discipline outcomes. Recent studies of group cohesion focus on two ways that group cohesion develops: social cohesion and task cohesion. Social cohesion refers to the extent to which group members like each other, prefer to spend time together, enjoy each other's company, and feel emotionally close. Task cohesion, on the other hand, is the shared commitment among members to achieving a goal that requires collective efforts. Interpersonal relationships that lead to social cohesion have been found to be important in group dynamics. Behavioral research shows that social cohesion is more easily established among individuals with similar backgrounds and experiences. Teams with high social cohesion experience less conflict and have stronger support networks, aiding in stress management. In the military, homogenous units are believed to develop stronger bonds, providing psychological benefits and enhancing unit resiliency in stressful environments. Shared experiences contribute to task cohesion, which is crucial for group success. Shared experiences can contribute to task cohesion, which is a stronger predictor of group performance than social cohesion. Integrated training in military units can build task cohesion. Studies show that diversity in small groups leads to better problem solving, innovation, and decision-making due to a broader range of perspectives and experiences. Diversity initiatives in the military aim to create a more efficient and flexible force. Some argue that a diverse military force can be more efficient and flexible, while others believe that demographic \"in-groups\" can negatively affect group productivity. Cultural biases and interpersonal friction within units are cited as potential distractions from performance under stress. The impact of diversity on group performance remains debated, but there is a link between diverse groups and leadership effectiveness. The focus in workforce management has shifted from diversity acquisition to diversity management, emphasizing building organizational culture and policies to attract a diverse workforce. The military values diversity for reasons related to the civil-military relationship, which involves civilian leadership, civil society, and military servicemembers. The civil-military relationship is explained as a trinity of civilian leadership, civil society, and military servicemembers. Civilian leadership decides how to resource and employ the military, influenced by civilian society. The strength of the relationship between civil society and the military affects a society's willingness to engage in conflict and provide resources. Disconnect between military leadership and society may question civilian leadership legitimacy. In 2015, less than 1% of Americans were serving on active duty, compared to 8.6% in World War II. In the context of the civil-military relationship, diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity initiatives are important for building stronger relationships across all groups. Diversity focuses on variations in traits, while inclusion pertains to organizational culture promoting respect and belonging. Equal opportunity is related to legal contexts. DOD revised its policies in June 2015 to expand classes of protected individuals covered by military equal opportunity definition to include sexual orientation. This was influenced by congressional actions between 2008 and 2011, including the creation of the Military Leadership Diversity Commission. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission (MLDC) developed a uniform definition of diversity for the Department of Defense (DOD) in 2011. President Obama's Executive Order 13583 in the same year called for a government-wide initiative on diversity. DOD's 2012 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan aligned with OPM's goals, focusing on diversity management throughout the workforce life-cycle and the role of leadership in creating an inclusive environment. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission (MLDC) developed a uniform definition of diversity for the Department of Defense (DOD) in 2011, aligning with President Obama's Executive Order 13583. The 2012 Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan focuses on diversity management and the role of leadership in establishing an inclusive organizational climate within the DOD. The plan includes new definitions of diversity and diversity management, emphasizing the importance of diverse characteristics and attributes in enhancing DOD capabilities and achieving mission readiness. The strategic plan does not set targets or quotas for underrepresented groups and prioritizes diversity without compromising military readiness. The Department of Defense (DOD) does not establish official diversity targets based on demographic profiles but aims for the force to reflect the U.S. population. DOD has Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) programs for civilian and military employees, following civil rights laws. Military equal opportunity policies align with civilian laws, but some regulations do not apply to military service. The military is governed by different regulations than civilian employment. Uniformed servicemembers' rights are derived from the Constitution, statutes like the UCMJ, DOD and service-level policies, and Executive Orders. Congress sets qualifications for service, allowing the military to deny opportunities based on physical standards and age. For example, commissioned officers must be physically qualified and meet age requirements. The military has specific regulations for service qualifications and enlistment eligibility. The Secretary of Defense can establish policies for DOD employees, including equal opportunity and nondiscrimination regulations. In 2015, the MEO definition was aligned with civilian EEO standards, and protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation were expanded. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized inclusivity for mission success. In 2016, the MEO definition was updated to include gender identity in protections against discrimination and harassment for military servicemembers. Harassment in the military includes sexual harassment, hazing, intimidation, and disparaging remarks based on protected characteristics. Diversity management and equal opportunity programs are overseen by DOD. The Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODMEO) oversees diversity and equal opportunity programs in the military, including research, training, and complaint resolution. It was established in 1994 and is responsible for promoting diversity in the DOD workforce. ODMEO also provides oversight for various programs such as the DOD Diversity and Inclusion Management Program and the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI). The Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI) provides oversight and guidance for MEO programs in the military. Established in 1971 as the Defense Race Relations Institute (DRRI), it evolved to address diversity and equal opportunity issues in the DOD. DEOMI offers various courses for equal-opportunity advisors, counselors, and program managers across all military departments. DEOMI provides oversight and guidance for MEO programs in the military, offering courses for equal-opportunity advisors, counselors, and program managers. The Research Directorate administers the Defense Equal Opportunity Climate Survey (DEOCS) to help commanders gauge morale, identify issues, and improve organizational culture. The survey measures factors related to organizational effectiveness, equal opportunity, sexual harassment perceptions, and sexual assault prevention and response. The DEOCS is used at the unit level to assess command climate. In recent years, legislative initiatives have enhanced requirements for command climate surveys, particularly in response to concerns about responses to sexual harassment/assault reports. Military departments manage diversity programs independently, with MEO training and resolutions handled at the unit level. Commanders are responsible for creating inclusive environments, with senior leader accountability assessed through DEOCS and evaluations of character and organizational climate/equal opportunity on performance reviews. The Navy evaluates character on senior enlisted evaluations for E7-E9's, with ratings ranging from \"Greatly Exceeds Standards\" to \"Below Standards\" based on diversity integration. The history of Military Equal Opportunity shows exclusion of protected classes from military participation. Integration in the military is influenced by political, social, and cultural contexts. The military's treatment of demographic groups has been influenced by political, social, and cultural contexts. Racial minorities faced segregation until the mid-20th century, with concerns about discrimination persisting despite policy changes. During the 1800s and 1900s, racial minorities were recruited into the military for practical manpower needs. This included Free Men of Color and Choctaw Native Americans in the War of 1812, and approximately 186,000 black Americans serving in the Union Army during the Civil War. Congress authorized the creation of permanent \"colored\" units and the recruitment of Native American scouts after the Civil War. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, racial minorities were recruited into the military for manpower needs. The Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson case in 1896 upheld racial segregation laws, leading to segregation in the armed services. Black soldiers made up 11% of the Army in World War I and 13% of conscripts, while Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans were mostly drafted as \"whites\". Black soldiers were often assigned unskilled jobs but also served as frontline combat troops. In World War II, separate draft calls were issued for black soldiers. During World War II, the War Department issued separate draft calls for black and white servicemembers, maintaining segregated training and unit assignments. Black soldiers accounted for 5% of the Infantry and less than 2% of the Air Corps, while making up 15% of the Quartermaster Corps and 27% of unassigned detachments. Black servicemembers represented 7.2% of the total military force in 1945 but only 0.6% of officers. During WWII, black servicemembers accounted for 7.2% of the military force but only 0.6% of officers. Asian-Americans faced confusion in draft lists, with Chinese Americans estimated at 20,000 serving. Japanese Americans were suspected, but 6,000 Nisei served in various roles, including combat. During WWII, black servicemembers accounted for 7.2% of the military force but only 0.6% of officers. Asian-Americans faced confusion in draft lists, with Chinese Americans estimated at 20,000 serving. Japanese Americans were suspected, but 6,000 Nisei served in various roles, including combat. In the war, about 3,700 linguists served in combat. A segregated unit of about 4,500 Japanese-Americans within the 442d Regimental Combat Team fought in Italy and Central Europe. In response to racial violence, President Harry Truman issued an Executive Order establishing the President's Committee on Civil Rights in 1946. The commission advocated for full racial integration within the military, a ban on discrimination based on race or color, and merit-based officer commissions and promotions. President Truman issued Executive Order 9981 in 1948, declaring equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed services regardless of race, color, religion, or national origin. The order also established the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Forces to assess the impact of integration on military efficiency. Some military leaders were hesitant about the change due to concerns about potential inefficiencies. The Fahy Committee's 1950 report found that existing segregation policies in the military were causing inefficiencies through unfilled billets, training backlogs, and less capable units. They advocated for equality of treatment and opportunity to improve the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Military departments changed their policies regarding minority races between 1949 and 1950 to reflect the committee's recommendations. The Fahy Committee's recommendations and President Truman's Executive Order led to changes in military policies regarding minority races, aiming for equality of treatment and opportunity. The Korean War accelerated racial integration in the services due to manpower needs, leading to the assignment of black soldiers in white combat units. Army leaders were initially hesitant to change official policies towards integration. Lt. General Edward M. Almond opposes integration in the military, believing it weakens efficiency and is a political solution. He argues that understanding differences between human elements is crucial for combat effectiveness. Scientific studies conducted by the Army concluded that integrated units performed well, debunking the belief that segregation was beneficial for military effectiveness. The military began to integrate in the 1950s, with the Army and Marine Corps ending segregation in basic training and unit assignments. By 1954, the last all-black active duty unit was abolished. However, segregation persisted in some Reserve and National Guard units until the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy authorized the President's Committee on Equal Opportunity in the Armed Forces in 1962 to address discrimination in the military. The commission chaired by Gerhard A. Gesell addressed equal opportunity in the Armed Forces, focusing on improving policies and procedures for equality of treatment and opportunity. They found a need to enhance recruitment, assignment, and promotion practices for black servicemembers to achieve equal treatment. The commission highlighted the hardships faced by black servicemembers and their families in communities with segregation and discrimination in various aspects. They found that base commanders were not actively addressing racial discrimination, leading to daily humiliation and degradation for black servicemembers. Key recommendations included improving recruitment, assignment, and promotion practices for equal treatment. The commission recommended expanding the installation commander's role in addressing discrimination, tying officer performance ratings to equal opportunity efforts, implementing mandatory training programs, forming biracial community groups, allowing economic sanctions on discriminatory businesses, establishing equal opportunity offices, and issuing a new DOD policy against racial discrimination. One year after the DOD's policy issuance, the federal government passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. DOD responded with a new policy for processing servicemember requests for legal action under the new law. Despite these efforts, the 1960s saw conflict abroad and social unrest at home, with the deployment of combat troops to Vietnam and concerns about disproportionate drafting and assignments of black soldiers. During the Vietnam War, there was a perception that black soldiers were disproportionately drafted, sent to high-risk combat units, and suffered higher casualties. This perception was fueled by statistics showing that blacks made up a significant portion of enlisted Army personnel losses. The National Advisory Commission on Selective Service highlighted the lack of black representation in draft boards. However, studies conducted after the war found little evidence of widespread institutional racism in draft and casualty statistics. During the Vietnam War, black soldiers faced perceived bias in draft deferments and inductions based on socio-economic factors. Racial discrimination led to violent incidents at military installations, culminating in the 1971 riots at Travis Air Force Base. In 1971, after the riots at Travis AFB, DOD established the Race Relations Education Board and the Defense Race Relations Institute. Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird then created a Task Force to address racial discrimination in the military justice system. The Task Force found evidence of discrimination towards racial minorities in the military justice system, proposing legislative changes to ban discrimination. However, this recommendation was not adopted, and the UCMJ currently lacks specific provisions against discrimination. Anti-discrimination policies and the All-Volunteer Force in 1973 helped alleviate racial tensions in the military. The All-Volunteer Force in 1973 helped ease racial tensions in the Armed Forces. Concerns about treatment and opportunities for racial minorities persist. The military's racial composition has remained largely unchanged, with two-thirds identifying as white and one-fifth as black. The percentage of Hispanic servicemembers has doubled since 1997, reflecting the growth of the Hispanic population in the US. Hispanic youth have shown a higher propensity for enlistment compared to white or black counterparts. In 2017, nonwhite servicemembers made up one-third of all active duty enlisted personnel. Asian and Hispanic servicemembers are underrepresented in the military, while blacks are overrepresented. Racial and ethnic minorities are also underrepresented in the officer corps and senior leadership positions. Hispanic servicemembers are underrepresented in the officer corps and senior leadership positions, with only 8% in the officer corps and less than 2% as General/Flag officers. While Hispanics make up nearly 18% of the U.S. population, they account for 8% of post-secondary degree holders, which is a requirement for most officers. The promotion system for senior military leaders is generally fair, but disparities exist where whites have more favorable outcomes than African Americans or Hispanics. Racial and ethnic minority officers are less likely to achieve early career milestones correlated with promotion prospects. Racial diversity among senior military leaders is influenced by factors such as career field preferences and assignment policies. Studies show that African American cadets tend to prefer Combat Service Support branches, while white cadets lean towards Combat Arms branches. Additionally, racial minorities, especially African Americans, are underrepresented in Special Operations Forces due to structural and perceptual barriers. Women have played a role in supporting and serving in the U.S. Armed Forces since the Revolutionary War. Laws and policies regarding women's service have evolved over time, with restrictions on occupations repealed in 1993. However, women were still excluded from units or occupations involved in direct ground combat until 2013. In 2013, the DOD removed the Direct Ground Combat and Assignment Rule, allowing women to serve in all combat jobs without exceptions. During WWI, Army and Navy nurses served abroad in various medical roles, but were not eligible for retirement or veterans' benefits. The Navy enlisted around 13,000 women for clerical positions with equal pay and benefits to men. Before WWII, there was little interest in integrating women into other military occupations due to traditional attitudes. In 1928, Major Everett S. Hughes proposed integrating women into the Army due to technological advancements. Despite his recommendations, separate structures for women and men were maintained. In 1941, legislation for a women's auxiliary in the Army was introduced by Representative Edith Nourse Rogers, but it was not approved until after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Congress then established the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in 1942. During WWII, women's roles in the Armed Forces expanded to include various specializations such as airplane mechanics, air traffic controllers, and pilots through programs like the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). Over 350,000 women served in the Armed Forces during the war, with the establishment of female divisions in the Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps. Women in the WASP program were not officially part of the armed services and did not receive military benefits until 1977. Following WWII, Congress passed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, making women a permanent part of the military. However, the legislation imposed limitations such as excluding women from combat roles and setting quotas for their enlistment. Despite women accounting for nearly 30% of the civilian workforce, they were restricted in rank and required parental consent for enlistment under 21. The law did not provide equal treatment for women in the military. In 1951, Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall established the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) to advise on women's recruitment, retention, and well-being in the Armed Forces. The 1960s and 1970s saw increased integration of women in the military due to the equal rights movement and the shift to an All-Volunteer Force in 1973, aiming to eliminate discriminatory treatment of women. The integration of women in the military was seen as a catalyst for gender equity in the civilian sector. Legislation passed between 1963 and 1980 addressed gender discrimination in the workforce, including the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1967, Congress removed restrictions on female officers' careers, allowing for equal promotion rules and crediting service as a nurse in the armed services. The first women Brigadier Generals for the Army were appointed. In the 1970s, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was passed by Congress, aiming to ensure equal rights under the law regardless of sex. However, the ERA was never ratified, partly due to concerns about potential conscription of women into the armed forces. Additionally, policies regarding servicewomen's military benefits and eligibility for military service were changed during this time. In the 1970s, policies were changed to grant female servicemembers equal benefits and opportunities in the military. This included reducing the age of consent for women, allowing women to attend military academies, and opening ROTC to women. By 1975, women made up about 5% of the active duty force. A 1978 DOD study highlighted the benefits of recruiting more women, citing improved quality and cost savings. The report highlighted the tradeoff in recruiting between high quality females and low quality males. Women are generally smaller, weigh less, and are physically weaker than male recruits, but they are brighter, better educated, score higher on aptitude tests, and are less likely to have disciplinary issues. In the 1970s, policies were changed to grant female servicemembers equal benefits and opportunities in the military, leading to an expansion of military occupations open to women in the early 1990s. Congress removed restrictions on women's assignment to combat aircraft in 1991. The commission on Women in the Armed Services recommended retaining restrictions on women's assignment to direct ground combat and Special Operations roles. They were divided on female assignments to combat aircraft and surface combatants, ultimately allowing women to serve on combat vessels but not enacting restrictions on combat aircraft assignments. Congress did not enact restrictions on women's assignment to combat aircraft in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The military faced issues with sexual harassment in the 1990s, highlighted by the Tailhook scandal in 1992. An independent investigation identified 90 victims and a lack of leadership in handling the incidents. Admiral Frank Kelso acknowledged institutional problems within the military. In the 1990s, the military faced sexual harassment issues, with incidents at military schools and training facilities raising alarm. A study found that between 93% to 97% of academy women experienced sexual harassment. A scandal at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1996 resulted in charges. The scandal at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland led to charges against 12 male officers and trainers for sexual assault of female servicemembers. Concerns about sexual harassment and assault in the military persist despite the integration of women. DOD rescinded ground combat restrictions for women in 2013, with full implementation expected by January 1, 2016. The military was directed to review all closed occupations and units for entry and assignment standards, with recommendations due by September 30, 2013. On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter ordered all combat jobs to be open to women. This decision followed extensive studies on unit cohesion, women's health, equipment, and international experiences. Female participation in the civilian and military workforce has been steadily rising over the past 50 years. Currently, women make up over 15% of the DOD's active duty force, with varying percentages across different branches of the military. Despite representing almost 20% of officers, women hold less than 10% of the highest leadership positions. The disparity in female representation in General and Flag officer ranks, accounting for less than 10% of the highest leadership positions, may be influenced by limits on women's assignments to combat-related roles. Retired Air Force General Lester L. Lyles highlighted how this exclusion hinders women's promotion potential, as they are not credited for combat arms experience crucial for consideration in senior flag ranks. The military's lack of lateral entry means G/FO officers typically have over 30 years of service, with today's eligible females likely entering service before restrictions were lifted in 1985. Females eligible for G/FO rank likely entered service before restrictions were lifted on women serving in combat roles. It may take time to see the effects of current policy changes. Retention rates for women in the military may also impact the percentage of women in top positions. Military women have cited limited occupational roles, harassment concerns, and family obligations as reasons for leaving the service. Female participation in the military is influenced by the number of occupations open to women, propensity to serve, and desire to serve in specific branches. Men generally have a higher propensity to serve, with women more inclined towards the Navy or Air Force. In youth polls from 2001 to 2010, around 8% of young women expressed interest in military service compared to 18% of men. In FY2015, approximately 21% of DOD active component applicants were women, with the Navy having the highest percentage of applicants at 28%. In the early 1990s, gay individuals were prohibited from serving in the Armed Forces due to DOD regulations and military justice laws. During World War II, those with \"homosexual proclivities\" were disqualified from the military draft, and in 1953, President Eisenhower issued an Executive Order prohibiting federal employees from participating in certain groups. In 1972, gay rights advocacy groups called for an executive order to allow homosexuals to serve in the military and upgrade previous discharges to honorable status. In the late-1970s, a study recommended maintaining the ban on gays in the military. In the late-1970s, a study group recommended maintaining the ban on gays in the military. The group proposed including specific phrases in DOD directives on personnel separations and suggested that individuals with homosexual tendencies receive an honorable discharge. These recommendations formed the basis for a new DOD policy in 1981, stating that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The 1981 DOD policy banned gays in the military, citing adverse effects on discipline, morale, and security. Attempts to engage in homosexual acts led to mandatory discharge. In the 1990s, advocacy groups pushed to rescind the policy, arguing it violated civil rights. Maintaining the policy was seen as necessary to prevent disruptions in the military. In the early 1990s, there were efforts to overturn the DOD policy banning gay servicemembers. Resolutions were introduced in Congress, estimating the high cost of discharging individuals for homosexuality. President Clinton, during his campaign, expressed support for allowing openly gay individuals to serve in the military and later ordered studies on how to implement this change. President Clinton ordered studies to reform the DOD policy banning gay servicemembers. The Military Working Group recommended maintaining the status quo, while RAND's findings suggested sexual orientation should not determine military service. The proposal to allow openly gay individuals to serve sparked controversy with the military, the public, and Congress. Hearings resulted in a consensus to prohibit DOD from asking about homosexuality when recruiting. President Clinton announced a \"don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue\" policy in 1993 regarding homosexuality in the military. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 codified DOD's policies on gay individuals, citing concerns about morale, discipline, and unit cohesion. The FY1994 NDAA included a provision known as \"don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT), which prohibited questioning servicemembers about their sexuality. The law outlined grounds for discharge related to homosexual conduct, stating that individuals should not be asked about their sexual orientation. Critics of \"don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT) argued that it harmed gay, lesbian, and bisexual servicemembers, leading to ethical dilemmas and inconsistent separation policies. They also believed it deterred qualified individuals from joining the military. Supporters of DADT argued that only a small portion of the force was affected. Approximately 13,000 individuals were separated from the military under DADT from FY1994 to FY2009. Between 2005 and 2009, efforts were made to repeal DADT, aiming to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in the armed forces. Approximately 13,000 servicemembers were discharged under DADT from FY1994 to FY2009, accounting for less than 0.1% of the total force. President Barack Obama announced plans to repeal the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy in 2010. The Secretary of Defense established a working group to review implementation issues, and enforcement policies were changed to limit discharge authority for homosexual conduct. In 2010, a federal court ruled DADT unconstitutional. The DOD released findings supporting the repeal, stating minimal risk to military readiness. Secretary Gates urged Congress to act on repealing DADT. In December 2010, the House and Senate passed legislation to repeal DADT, which was signed into law by the President. The repeal allowed gay servicemembers to serve openly and marry their same-sex partners, but federal benefits were not recognized for same-sex marriages under DOMA. On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Windsor that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional, allowing for the extension of military benefits to same-sex couples. The Department of Defense issued a new policy granting all benefits to same-sex couples married before or on June 26, 2013, with an effective date of June 26, and for those married after, benefits would be effective from the date of marriage. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across the United States, allowing for recognition of same-sex military couples in states that previously banned such marriages. However, not all states have nondiscrimination laws protecting individuals based on sexual orientation, leading to potential challenges for gay servicemembers and their spouses. The military does not track data on gay or bisexual servicemembers. A 2010 RAND study estimated 2.2% of men in the military identify as gay or bisexual, lower than the general population. 10.7% of military women self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. In 2014, the Department of Justice announced protection of Title VII extends to discrimination based on gender identity. Title VII applies to DOD civilians, not military personnel, regarding transgender status. The medical definition of \"transgender\" applies to individuals who do not conform to their physical gender at birth. DOD policies previously disqualified individuals with transgender conditions. The DOD policies previously disqualified individuals with transgender conditions, including exhibitionism, transvestism, voyeurism, and other paraphilias. Servicemembers could be separated based on a diagnosis of a mental disorder, which included psychosexual, transsexual, and gender identity conditions. The policy effectively banned entry of those who had undergone sex reassignment surgery or had a psychiatric history of certain conditions. Military discharges could be authorized for existing servicemembers with psychiatric disorders, but separation was not required. The DOD policy allows discharge of servicemembers with severe mental health disorders. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced a review of policies on transgender service, creating a working group to study implications of allowing transgender persons to serve openly. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness was appointed as decision authority for administrative discharges of those with gender dysphoria or who identify as transgender. RAND Corporation was asked by DOD to assess the health care needs, readiness implications, and experiences of foreign militaries regarding transgender servicemembers. RAND found that the impact of including transgender servicemembers would be minimal and recommended policy changes. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that transgender Americans can serve openly without fear of discharge. DOD implemented a new policy in 2016 allowing transgender servicemembers to transition while serving. Training and an implementation handbook were provided to assist with the process. Plans were announced to admit transgender recruits by July 1, 2017. Defense Secretary James Mattis delayed the decision to accept transgender recruits, citing the need to evaluate the impact on readiness and lethality. President Trump's directive reverted policy to pre-2016, prohibiting transgender individuals from joining the Armed Forces and halting spending on sex reassignment. Defense Secretary James Mattis delayed the decision to accept transgender recruits and announced that current policy for serving servicemembers will remain in place until final guidance is issued. The Defense Secretary delayed the decision on accepting transgender recruits and stated that current policy for serving servicemembers will remain until final guidance is issued. A Central Coordination Cell was designated to assist in implementing the interim guidance. Two lawsuits were filed against the government by transgender servicemembers. Data on transgender individuals in the military and general population is lacking. Estimates suggest transgender individuals make up 0.1% to 0.5% of the total U.S. population. The 2016 RAND study estimated that there are approximately 2,450 transgender personnel in the active component and 1,510 in the selected reserve, making up less than 0.2% of the total force. The First Amendment of the Constitution allows individuals of all religions to serve in the military, with protections for religious beliefs. Military equal-opportunity policies recognize the rights of servicemembers to observe their respective religions without discrimination. Religious accommodation requests in the military are handled at the unit level, with regulations specifying five main areas for accommodation: worship practices, dietary practices, medical practices, uniform standards, and grooming standards. Military leaders are instructed to approve these requests unless they would negatively impact mission accomplishment or other military requirements. The Armed Forces also has a Chaplain Corps for religious support. The Armed Forces Chaplain Corps consists of clergy endorsed by recognized ecclesiastical agencies, providing support to servicemembers of all faiths. Chaplains must conduct religious services weekly and adhere to military and endorsing agency rules. Religious diversity in the military mirrors the U.S. population, with 70% identifying as Christian and less than 2% as Jewish or Muslim. Less than 2% of active servicemembers identify with Judaism, Islam, or other non-Christian religions, which is consistent with the U.S. population. Non-Christian faiths may be underrepresented in the military. Congress has used its authority to establish criteria for recruitment, promotion, and separation based on demographic characteristics. Recent legislative efforts focus on improving demographic diversity data for servicemembers. Some studies show that diversity in top management teams positively impacts organizational outcomes. Diversity in leadership is crucial for attracting and retaining a diverse workforce. African American troops lost confidence in the military due to lack of representation in command positions during the Vietnam Era. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission was created to evaluate and address the lack of racial and gender diversity in senior leadership positions in the Armed Forces. Despite increased demographic diversity in the military, the commission found that leaders are not as diverse as the nation they serve. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission was established to address the lack of diversity in senior leadership positions in the Armed Forces. Recommendations were made to improve diversity and inclusion, with subsequent implementation through law and policy changes. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required the development of a diversity in military leadership plan, emphasizing the reflection of the diverse U.S. population in senior officers and enlisted personnel. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated data reporting on diversity in the military, including rank, promotions, and reenlistment by gender and race. Congress may extend this requirement past 2017. Some believe data reporting helps monitor diversity progress, while others argue it may pressure military leaders to meet informal diversity targets, potentially compromising the merit-based promotion system. The U.S. service academies, including USNA, USAFA, and USMA, play a significant role in officer commissions. Members of Congress nominate candidates for appointment, raising questions about the demographic representation of the academies. Congressional interest in diversity at the academies has increased in recent years. In 2014, females accounted for 56% of postsecondary enrollment in degree-granting institutions. Women's enrollment in service academies has increased over the years. Concerns have been raised about discrimination or favoritism towards different demographic minorities at the academies, with a 2003 report showing some minority students feeling the overall atmosphere for racial minorities was poor, especially African-Americans. Approximately 25% of African-Americans and 40% of women at service academies perceived discriminatory treatment. Gender discrimination and sexual harassment are also prevalent issues, with 29% of women and 5% of men experiencing gender discrimination, and 48% of women and 12% of men experiencing sexual harassment in the 2015-2016 academic year. Congress has been monitoring these prevalence rates since FY2007. The FY2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill directed a study on social representation at service academies, revealing lower graduation rates for black and Hispanic officer candidates compared to white counterparts. Asian candidates had higher or similar graduation rates. Racial minorities had higher graduation rates than at other elite civilian universities, but women had lower rates. Changes have been made to create a more inclusive environment. Congress may conduct further reviews on demographic diversity. In recent years, Congress has shown interest in DOD's handling of discrimination and harassment claims, especially sexual harassment. Before 2013, DOD did not systematically track or report sexual harassment complaints. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 required the Secretary of Defense to report on substantiated incidents of sexual harassment involving Armed Forces members. DOD has since developed a system to comply with this requirement. The Department of Defense has developed a report on substantiated incidents of sexual harassment in the Armed Forces, as required by recent legislation. Command climate assessments are now mandated within 120 days of an officer assuming command and annually thereafter, with a focus on responses to allegations of sexual harassment and assault. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 includes provisions for enhanced compliance, reporting, and dissemination of command climate assessment results. Section 1721 and 1751 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 require commanding officers to conduct organizational climate assessments to ensure proper management of sexual assault allegations and create a safe reporting environment. Failure to maintain a positive command climate can result in relief from command positions. The FY2014 NDAA required a review of ODMEO to evaluate its relationship with SAPRO in sexual harassment cases and assess its resources for tracking and addressing these cases. Research suggests that sexual harassment and assault are closely linked, leading to calls for unified policy and oversight. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the existing definition of sexual harassment in the military, noting that it is often treated as a violation of equal opportunity policy rather than as a behavior contributing to sexual assault. The oversight of sexual harassment complaints should remain separate from sexual assault due to different reporting processes and legal implications. A 2017 RAND report found that the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODMEO) lacks resources to oversee service policy compliance and implementation related to sexual harassment. The report highlighted the lack of a sexual harassment strategic plan in the Office of Diversity Management and Equal Opportunity (ODMEO). It suggested opportunities for coordination between offices to optimize resources and cautioned against consolidating OSD policymaking authority under a single office. There are no laws prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military, with recent policy shifts allowing openly serving transgender servicemembers to continue serving. The DOD is reviewing policies regarding transgender servicemembers who may reveal their gender identity later. Some in Congress propose legislation to protect transgender servicemembers from involuntary separation or denial of reenlistment. Concerns about privacy and comfort in close quarters are raised by those advocating for a ban on transgender service. No enacted provisions currently address these issues. Some concerns about transgender servicemembers include potential impacts on unit cohesion and significant medical costs for care such as counseling, hormone replacement therapy, and gender reassignment surgery. Foreign militaries with transgender service policies have not shown adverse effects on cohesion, but initial resistance and hostility have been reported. Proponents argue that TRICARE already covers certain medical procedures for other conditions. The Department of Defense (DOD) estimates that annual TRICARE costs for counseling per transgender member would be approximately $1,000 per year and annual hormone therapy/laboratory costs would be $3,000. RAND estimated that total health care costs to DOD associated with gender-transition treatment for active component members would be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million. Genital reassignment surgeries are not available through the military direct care system, but the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides medically necessary care to intersex and transgender veterans. The cost of transgender individuals serving in the military ranges from $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually. Opponents argue that it may impact readiness and deployability due to medical treatment, while proponents point out that other medical conditions also affect deployability. DOD policies require servicemembers to maintain health, fitness, and medical readiness, reporting any issues to their chain of command. Medical standards must be met for military accession. Separation may occur during initial training if a medical condition hinders completion. The 2016 transgender policy allows current servicemembers to serve but restricts gender transition during the first term of service. The 2016 RAND study found that less than 0.1% of the force is affected. The 2016 RAND study found that less than 0.1% of the force would seek transition-related care that could potentially disrupt deployment. Opponents argue that a ban on transgender service could impact unit readiness and personnel costs. Discharging transgender servicemembers could lead to skill gaps in units, but the lack of data on their numbers and specialties hinders analysis. Some are concerned that implementing transgender policies may disrupt units and require diversity training. The Congress may defer or delegate authority to DOD for policies regarding transgender servicemembers. Alternatively, Congress could draft legislation affecting Administration policy for the Armed Forces. Oversight could include monitoring DOD's new policies' impacts on cost, readiness, and unit cohesion. Recent interest in Congress involves rights of conscience and religious accommodations for military personnel and chaplains. The DOD policy prohibits adverse personnel actions based on servicemembers' conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs unless it threatens good order and discipline. The NDAA required the DOD Inspector General to investigate compliance with these regulations and report on incidents involving these beliefs. The DOD Inspector General found 398 incidents between 2011 and 2014 where servicemembers contacted regarding religious rights of conscience. No instances were found where commanders forced chaplains to act against their beliefs. 60% of contacts were related to command climate issues, including discrimination, forced engagement in religious practices, and suppression of religious expression. Religious accommodation requests were not consistently addressed within established timeframes. The DOD Inspector General found issues with addressing religious accommodation requests within established timeframes. DOD indicated policy changes to address these issues, including reviewing approval timelines, allowing waivers to remain until revoked, and establishing a working group for data collection. The report highlighted the need for a diverse force reflective of the Nation, suggesting consideration of broader demographic characteristics. Data suggests imbalances in geographical distribution of recruits, with the South contributing the most new recruits per capita. This disparity may be due to a higher concentration of military installations in the South. Legislative priorities related to defense manpower, pay, and benefits can vary depending on the concentration of military-connected constituents in a district. Recent data indicates that recruits from middle-income families make up the majority of new recruits, with underrepresentation from both the lower and upper income quintiles. Family connection to the military is a significant predictor for propensity to serve, with over 25% of new recruits in 2015 having at least one parent who served in the military. Approximately 80% of new recruits in 2015 have at least one family member who served in the military, with those whose parents had a military career showing the highest propensity for service. Concerns have been raised about this trend potentially creating a separate group of citizens responsible for military service. Efforts have been made to diversify the military workforce, resulting in a more inclusive environment with a higher percentage of women and racial minorities in service and leadership roles. The military has implemented policies to monitor discrimination and improve equal opportunity. There are debates on whether more should be done to promote diversity and inclusiveness in the military. Proponents argue that a diverse force can be more efficient in modern warfare, as the pool of eligible candidates becomes more racially and ethnically diverse. The military is becoming more diverse in terms of race and ethnicity, while women are increasing their workforce participation and educational attainment. It is believed that a broadly representative military force is essential for upholding national values and loyalty to the government. Advocates for diversity in the military argue that it should reflect the shifting demographics of society to ensure equal opportunities for historically underrepresented groups. Some argue for equal opportunity protections in the military to compete with private sector employers. Concerns exist about discrimination based on religious beliefs or sexual orientation. Diversity initiatives may impact military effectiveness and merit-based systems. The military should reflect the nation's social and cultural norms. Some argue that the military should reflect the nation's social and cultural norms, with the popular will for social change driving DOD policies. Concerns exist about the inclusion of certain demographic groups affecting unit cohesion and readiness, particularly in elite combat units. They believe that unique mission requirements justify some exclusions in military service eligibility. Congress will likely face these issues as it sets standards for the U.S. Armed Forces in the 21st century."
