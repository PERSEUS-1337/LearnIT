    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Congress finds that international terrorism poses a serious threat to the United States, impacting vital interests. The Constitution grants Congress the power to punish crimes against the law of nations and impose penalties for supporting terrorist organizations. International terrorism also affects U.S. commerce by disrupting trade, market stability, and travel for both American citizens and foreign visitors. Foreign terrorist organizations raise significant funds outside the United States for conduct directed at the United States. Imposing civil liability along the causal chain of terrorism is necessary to deter the flow of money to these organizations. This was recognized in a court case by Judge Richard Posner. The Seventh Circuit emphasizes that damages are less effective against terrorists and their organizations compared to their financiers. Suits against financiers can disrupt the terrorists' funding, and the statute of limitations for such claims must be extensive due to the long-term impact of terrorist financing. The reasoning of the Second Circuit undermines important counter-terrorism policies by providing undue protection to those supporting terrorist organizations and depriving victims of justice. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 states that all states must refrain from supporting terrorist acts and ensure that those involved are brought to justice. No state has the discretion to finance or sponsor terrorism knowingly. The United States holds individuals or entities accountable for providing support to terrorists who threaten national security. Victims of terrorist attacks in the US have the right to pursue civil claims against those who knowingly support terrorism. The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants with the fullest possible basis to seek relief against persons or entities that have provided support to foreign organizations engaging in terrorist activities against the United States. SEC. 3. FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. Exceptions to Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code, include seeking money damages against a foreign state for physical injury, death, property damage in the US caused by the tortious act of the foreign state, its officials, or employees. This encompasses claims related to extrajudicial killing, terrorism, or providing support for such acts. The text chunk discusses exceptions to claims for contribution or indemnity arising from certain acts, excluding claims related to discretionary functions, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and other specified actions. It also includes definitions for subsection (a)(5). The text chunk provides definitions for terms related to subsection (a)(5) and specifies that the amendments made shall apply to all pending and future proceedings. SEC. 4. AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY FOR CIVIL ACTIONS REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS. In an amendment to Section 2333 of title 18, liability can be asserted against individuals who committed acts of international terrorism or those who aided, abetted, provided support, or conspired with them. Additionally, civil actions seeking recovery under this chapter are not subject to dismissal based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction or failure to meet certain requirements. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to all pending and new proceedings. It does not affect a foreign state's immunity under other laws. The district courts will have jurisdiction over individuals aiding international terrorism or providing support for acts of terrorism that result in harm to U.S. nationals. This applies to all ongoing and new legal proceedings. SEC. 6 amends Section 2337 of title 18, United States Code, stating that no action can be taken against the United States, its agencies, or officials acting within their official capacity or legal authority under section 2333. The effective date applies to all pending and new proceedings. Section 2335 of title 18, United States Code is amended to increase the imprisonment term from four years to 15 years. The amendments apply to all pending and new proceedings. Any dismissed civil action under section 2333 may be refiled within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or the amendments made by this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act or amendments, or their application to other persons or circumstances, will not be affected."
