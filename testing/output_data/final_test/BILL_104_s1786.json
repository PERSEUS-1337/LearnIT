    "content": "DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDED TO CERTAIN MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE VETERANS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will enter into an agreement for a demonstration project where the Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services provided to covered veterans. The project will be carried out in two to four Veterans Integrated Service Networks. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will budget and expend on health care services in each Veterans Integrated Service Network participating in the demonstration project. The Secretary may not be reimbursed for services provided until the amount expended exceeds the budgeted amount for that network. The agreement between the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services ensures that the cost to the Medicare program for services provided in the project does not exceed the usual Medicare costs. The project's authority will expire three years after its start date. Reports on the project must be submitted to Congress annually. The report on the project must include the number of covered veterans receiving health care, benefits to veterans, cost shifting among VA medical care programs, cost shifting to the Medicare program, and the project's impact on access to health care facilities and medical staff capabilities. The report on the project must include an assessment of the effects of continuing the project on the Department's overall budget for health care, the budget of each Veterans Integrated Service Network covered by the project, and expenditures from the Medicare trust funds under title XVIII. The report on the project must include an assessment of the effects on the Department's budget for health care, Veterans Integrated Service Network budgets, and Medicare trust fund expenditures. It should also analyze lessons learned and any other relevant information deemed appropriate by the Secretaries. The Comptroller General will review and report to Congress on any cost increases for the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services due to the project. Covered veterans are defined as those entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII. Covered veterans are defined as any veteran entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act who is eligible for health care under chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, for a reason other than a service-connected disability."
