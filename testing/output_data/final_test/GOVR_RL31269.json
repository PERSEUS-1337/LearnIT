    "content": "The Refugee Act of 1980 established a uniform procedure for refugee admissions and provided federal assistance for their resettlement in the United States. A refugee is defined as a person outside their country unable to return due to persecution based on various factors. The Refugee Act of 1980 established a procedure for refugee admissions and federal assistance for resettlement in the United States. The Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration coordinates the U.S. refugee program, while USCIS makes final eligibility determinations. Refugees are processed and admitted from abroad, with asylum granted on a case-by-case basis to those physically present in the U.S. After one year, refugees must apply to adjust to lawful permanent resident status. Refugees in the United States must apply to adjust to lawful permanent resident status. The President sets the annual refugee admissions numbers after consulting with Congress. A report is submitted to Congress with proposed refugee ceilings and regional allocations for the upcoming fiscal year. The U.S. refugee program was impacted by the 9/11 attacks, leading to a review of security procedures and temporary suspension of refugee admissions. Following the 9/11 attacks, security procedures were reviewed, refugee admissions were briefly suspended, and enhanced security measures were put in place. This led to a significant decrease in refugee admissions, with numbers dropping to historically low levels in the years following the attacks. Admissions eventually rebounded, exceeding 70,000 in FY2009 and FY2010, but saw a decrease in FY2011 and FY2012 due to new security requirements. Refugee admissions increased in FY2013, attributed to the efforts of various partners involved in the U.S. refugee program. In FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015, refugee admissions fell just under each year's 70,000 ceiling. The FY2016 refugee ceiling was 85,000, and actual admissions that year were just below that number. The refugee ceiling for FY2017 was set at 110,000 by President Barack Obama. However, President Donald Trump issued executive orders in January and March 2017 limiting refugee admissions. The 2017 executive order revoked its predecessor and suspended the refugee admissions program for 120 days. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the suspension to take effect, except for those with a bona fide relationship with the U.S. The suspension lasted from June 26, 2017, to October 24, 2017, with total refugee admissions in FY2017 reaching 53,716. In FY2017, total refugee admissions reached 53,716. President Trump set the FY2018 refugee ceiling at 45,000, prioritizing asylum cases over refugee cases to address backlogs and security concerns. President Trump issued an executive order on refugee admissions in October 2017, allowing for the resumption of the program with special measures for certain categories of refugees posing potential threats. The order directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to assess and address risks posed by refugees, with annual reviews to determine any necessary modifications or terminations. The executive order issued by President Trump in October 2017 allowed for the resumption of the refugee admissions program with special measures for certain high-risk nationalities. The Department of Homeland Security implemented additional security enhancements and screening for refugees from these countries during a 90-day review period specified in the order. The Department of Homeland Security implemented additional security measures for certain high-risk nationalities in the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to prevent fraudulent entry into the United States. Refugee admissions for FY2018 were half the ceiling of 45,000, the lowest since the program's establishment in 1980. The FY2019 refugee ceiling is set at 30,000, the lowest level in recent years. The FY2019 refugee ceiling is set at 30,000, the lowest in the history of the program. President Trump signed the Presidential Determination on October 4, 2018, allocating the ceiling among regions worldwide. There is no unallocated reserve in FY2019, with regional allocations covering approved refugees and new cases. The FY2019 refugee ceiling is set at 30,000, the lowest in the history of the program. An unallocated reserve is to be used if a need arises for refugee slots in excess of the allocated numbers. The FY2019 consultation document does not specify the nationalities of expected refugees, creating uncertainty about their home countries. Regional allocations for FY2019 can be compared to previous years, with Africa allocated 11,000 refugee admissions numbers. In FY2019, regional admissions levels are as follows: Africa - 11,000, East Asia - 4,000, Europe and Central Asia - 3,000, Latin America and the Caribbean - 3,000, Near East/South Asia - 9,000. PRM manages refugee cases and utilizes NGOs or RSCs for processing. Priority 1 of refugee processing involves refugees referred to the U.S. program by UNHCR, U.S. embassy, or NGOs due to compelling protection needs. All nationalities are eligible for this priority. Priority 2 covers groups of special humanitarian concern to the United States. Priority 2 of the U.S. refugee program includes specific groups defined by nationalities, clans, or ethnicities. Unlike Priority 1 cases, individuals under Priority 2 can access the program without a referral. Some Priority 2 groups are processed in their country of origin, while others, like Burmese in Thailand, are processed outside their country. Another group, Iraqis associated with the U.S., can be processed in Iraq or outside the country. Priority 3 involves family reunification cases based on an affidavit of relationship filed by a relative in the U.S. The Priority 3 program in the U.S. refugee program is limited to designated nationalities. For FY2019, processing is available to nationals of 15 countries. Qualifying family members include spouses, unmarried children under age 21, and parents of refugees or asylees admitted to the U.S. The program was suspended in 2008 due to fraud concerns but resumed in 2012 with new requirements. The Priority 3 program in the U.S. refugee program resumed in October 2012 with new requirements for DNA evidence of parent-child relationships. U.S.-based relatives must be at least 18 years old and file within five years of being granted asylum or admitted as a refugee. USCIS adjudicates refugee cases, and individuals must meet refugee criteria, not be resettled elsewhere, have humanitarian concern, and be admissible to the U.S. Refugee adjudications are now handled by USCIS officers in the Refugee Corps. To be admitted to the United States as a refugee, individuals must meet refugee criteria and be admissible under immigration law. Certain grounds of inadmissibility, such as health-related and security-related reasons, can affect the admission process. Health-related grounds may include having a communicable disease of public health significance, while security-related grounds focus on national security concerns. Some grounds of inadmissibility can be waived for humanitarian reasons or to ensure family unity. In 2008, Congress removed HIV infection as a health-related ground of inadmissibility for refugees entering the United States. The CDC also revised its regulations on the medical examination of aliens to no longer consider HIV infection a \"communicable disease of public health significance.\" Terrorism-related grounds of inadmissibility have been included in immigration law since 1990. The terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility have been amended over the years to lower the threshold for alien support of terrorist activities. Giving material support to a terrorist organization can render an alien inadmissible. The Secretary of State and DHS Secretary have discretionary waiver authority over certain terrorism-related grounds. Both have granted exemptions to certain individuals. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, expanded the discretionary authority of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of DHS to grant waivers of terrorism-related grounds of inadmissibility. Specific groups were exempted from being considered terrorist organizations based on past acts. This Act limited the application of INA's terrorism-related provisions for certain groups. Prospective refugees must clear all security-related grounds of inadmissibility to enter the United States under the INA. According to a USCIS fact sheet on refugee security screening, prospective refugees must pass all required security checks for approval. USCIS has discretion to deny refugee status for national security reasons. The screening process includes biometric and biographic checks at various stages, such as after the RSC interview, before departure to the U.S., and upon arrival at a port of entry. The executive orders issued by President Trump in March and October 2017 called for a review of U.S. refugee admissions processes to enhance security measures. The FY2019 consultation document highlighted that prospective refugees undergo thorough screening with increased data collection and higher levels of security checks. The \"Lautenberg Amendment\" enacted in FY1990 requires higher security screening for applicants, particularly for former Soviet and Indochinese nationals seeking refugee status in the U.S. Applicants must prove credible fear of persecution as a protected category member with close family in the U.S. This standard differs from the INA's requirement of establishing individual persecution fears for refugee status. The Lautenberg Amendment, regularly extended in appropriations acts, includes the Specter Amendment for Iranian religious minorities. The Amendment was extended through FY2018, but not yet for FY2019. The HHS ORR administers a transitional assistance program for dependent refugees and asylees. The refugee resettlement program, established in 1980, provides assistance to refugees, asylees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and other humanitarian groups. Funding for ORR programs in FY2018 totaled $2.051 billion, including transitional and medical services, and social services for refugees. The ORR programs in FY2018 included transitional and medical services, social services, and targeted assistance for refugees. Refugee cash assistance and medical assistance are provided to needy refugees who are ineligible for mainstream federal assistance programs. Refugees are now subject to time limits for receiving benefits from federal assistance programs, unlike before the 1996 welfare reform act. RMA benefits are based on the state's Medicaid program, and RCA payments are based on the state's TANF program. Time limits on refugee eligibility for major public assistance programs are summarized in Table 3."
