    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998\". Congress finds that too many law enforcement officers die from gunshot wounds, with a significant number being killed by firearms. The introduction of modern bulletproof materials has helped decrease the number of officers killed, with studies showing that bullet-resistant materials saved the lives of over 2,000 officers between 1985 and 1994. The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law enforcement officers by providing them with armor vests, as too many officers die from gunshot wounds. The Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements reports a public safety crisis in Indian country due to rising violent crime rates. The Act aims to save lives of law enforcement officers by providing them with armor vests, as many officers die from gunshot wounds. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance is authorized to make grants for the purchase of armor vests for law enforcement officers. Grants will be used to buy one vest per officer in a jurisdiction, with preference given to those with the greatest need based on officer access and mandatory wear policies. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance authorizes grants for armor vests for law enforcement officers. Qualifying states or local governments must have a violent crime rate at or above the national average. Funding allocation is based on a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 5% of the total grant amount. Matching funds for a program cannot exceed 50% unless approved by the Director. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance can waive the non-Federal contribution requirement for a program in cases of fiscal hardship. At least half of the funds awarded must go to units of local government or Indian tribes with fewer than 100,000 residents. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State, Indian tribe, or unit of local government must submit an application to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance. The application must be signed by the appropriate authority and contain the required information. Grants can be renewed every 3 years, and regulations must be followed within 90 days of the application date. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance must create regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement the application requirements for grants under this Act. SEC. 5 prohibits the use of prison inmate labor for manufacturing equipment or products by entities receiving financial assistance from this Act. SEC. 6 provides definitions. The term \"armor vest\" under this Act refers to body armor that meets NIJ Standard 0101.03 or exceeds its specifications with permission from the officer's department. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states and various territories. The term \"qualifying State or unit of local government\" refers to any State or local government that has applied for a grant meeting specified requirements. The term \"Indian tribe\" has the same meaning as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. SEC. 7.
