    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Voluntary and Equitable Grazing Conflict Resolution Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument created unique regulatory and statutory overlays, and compensating lessees who voluntarily waive their grazing leases would provide new economic opportunities. There is support for a fair resolution of grazing conflicts from ranching, environmental, and local communities. The land exchange authorized under this Act is in the public interest as it furthers the protective purposes of the Monument, provides consolidated land ownership, improves land management, decreases costs, and resolves public conflict. The waiver of grazing leases is not a reflection on the legal or ecological merit of grazing within the Monument or proposals to limit grazing permits in Oregon or other states. Certain portions of the Monument are designated accordingly. The Act aims to designate certain portions of the Monument as wilderness to preserve the wilderness experience for future generations, maintain cattle ranching, retire grazing leases, and protect ecological diversity and recreational opportunities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Bureau of Land Management land\" refers to approximately 40 acres of land under the Bureau of Land Management's jurisdiction in the Monument. The term \"grazing allotment\" includes various grazing areas in the State. A \"grazing lease\" is a document allowing the use of a grazing allotment for commercial livestock grazing. The \"land exchange map\" is titled \"Box R Ranch Land Exchange.\" The terms defined in this section include \"Landowner\" as Box-R Ranch, \"Lessee\" as a livestock operator with a grazing lease, \"Livestock\" excluding recreational animals, \"Monument\" as Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, and \"Range development\" as structures on grazing allotments for domestic livestock. The curr_chunk defines terms such as \"Rowlett parcel\" as a 40-acre private land, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" as Oregon, \"Wilderness\" as Soda Mountain Wilderness, and \"Wilderness map\" as the map of Soda Mountain Wilderness. The curr_chunk introduces the Voluntary Grazing Lease Waiver Program. The Voluntary Grazing Lease Waiver Program allows the Secretary to offer compensation to a lessee in exchange for waiving a grazing lease. If accepted, the grazing lease is terminated, and the associated grazing allotment is permanently retired from livestock grazing use. The Voluntary Grazing Lease Waiver Program offers $300 per authorized animal unit month as compensation for waiving a grazing lease. If a lessee waives only the Monument portion of a grazing lease, the Secretary will construct and maintain a fence to exclude livestock from that area. If a grazing allotment is jointly leased, all lessees must agree to waive the grazing lease. The Secretary will construct and maintain a fence at Federal expense to keep livestock within a reduced area of the grazing allotment if all lessees do not exercise the option to waive the grazing lease. The Secretary will permanently retire certain allotments from livestock grazing use and will not issue new grazing leases for specific areas within the Monument. The Secretary will permanently retire certain allotments from livestock grazing use within the Monument. A lessee can waive a grazing lease within 3 years of the Act's enactment and forfeit any claim to range developments on the allotments. Lessees can also donate grazing leases to the Secretary at any time. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary will not authorize any new allotments for livestock grazing on Monument land. SEC. 5. LAND EXCHANGE. In order to protect and consolidate Federal land within the Monument, the Secretary may offer to exchange Bureau of Land Management land for the Rowlett parcel with the Landowner. If the Landowner accepts, the Secretary will convey all rights of the United States in the Bureau of Land Management land to the Landowner within 70 days. Surveys approved by the Secretary will determine the exact acreage and legal description of the exchanged lands, with the Secretary responsible for covering survey costs. (c) Conditions.--The conveyance of Bureau of Land Management land and the Rowlett parcel under subsection (a) shall be subject to valid existing rights and title approval standards. The conveyance of Bureau of Land Management land is subject to applicable laws and regulations. The exchange of land authorized under this section within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management is exempt from requiring additional regulations by the Secretary or being subject to notice and comment provisions of section 553 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 6. SODA MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS. Approximately 23,000 acres of Monument land are designated as wilderness under the Wilderness Act, forming the \"Soda Mountain Wilderness.\" The Secretary is required to submit a map and legal description of the wilderness to the Senate and House Committees. The map and legal description will have the same legal force. The Secretary must submit a map and legal description of the wilderness to Congress, with any corrections made by the Secretary noted. The map and legal description will be available for public inspection at specific Bureau of Land Management offices. The Wilderness area will be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act, with necessary measures allowed for fire, insect, and disease management activities. Livestock grazing and range development in the Wilderness established before the enactment of the California Wilderness Act of 1984 are permitted to continue under specific guidelines outlined in the Wilderness Act and the report of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives report accompanying H.R. 2570 prohibits grazing of domestic livestock in the Wilderness upon retirement of grazing leases. The Act does not affect the State's jurisdiction over fish and wildlife management on public land. It does not establish a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the Wilderness. The Act does not establish a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the Wilderness. Activities outside the Wilderness boundary are not precluded by the fact that they can be seen or heard from within the Wilderness. SEC. 7. EFFECT. This Act does not affect the authority of Federal agencies to modify grazing permits without compensation, authorize eminent domain, create property rights in grazing permits on Federal land, set a precedent for buyout programs, or impact existing water rights. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for compensation to lessees waiving grazing leases and for fence construction and livestock control near the Monument. $2,000,000 for compensation and $1,500,000 for fence construction, with $150,000 allocated annually for preventing livestock from entering Federal land. No funds for administrative costs. Amounts available until expended."
