    "content": "ENERGY INFORMATION FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. Requirement of Benchmarking and Disclosure for Leasing Buildings Without Energy Star Labels. Amendments to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 include renovating leased spaces for energy efficiency, benchmarking under a recognized online platform, and implementing cost-effective improvements in lighting, windows, and HVAC systems. The text chunk discusses the requirement for benchmarking and disclosure of energy consumption data for leased spaces that do not have Energy Star labels. Federal agencies leasing such spaces must provide energy consumption information to building owners, unless privacy laws or tenant responses prevent access to utility data. The Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with the EPA, must complete a study on the impact of state and local benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The study will analyze programs where utilities provide building energy consumption information to owners of multitenant buildings, identify best policy approaches for improving energy efficiency, and consider compliance rates and costs on building owners, utilities, and tenants. The study will analyze systems providing aggregated energy consumption information to multitenant building owners, considering the impact of public utility commissions and State privacy laws. It will also address exceptions to compliance in existing laws for building owners unable to access whole building energy information, and the treatment of buildings with multiple uses, no baseline information, or high energy intensities. The study will cover various aspects such as energy intensities in different sectors, implementation practices, safety of benchmarking tools against cyber attacks, and international experiences with building benchmarking laws. The Secretary will submit the findings to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives. The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with relevant agencies, will create and maintain a database for storing public energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings, including data on building benchmarking, energy disclosure, ratings, and certifications. The Secretary of Energy will maintain a database for public energy-related information on buildings, including benchmarking, ratings, and certifications. Stakeholder input will be sought for effectiveness, and reports will be submitted to relevant committees every 2 years. The Secretary of Energy will submit a report to the Senate on progress in complying with energy-related information requirements."
