Prohibition on providing direct US assistance, loan guarantees, or debt relief to specified governments including Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, and governments of countries hosting attacked US diplomatic facilities. Secretary of State required to submit a list of attacked diplomatic facilities to Congress. Beginning 90 days after the enactment of this Act, the President may certify to Congress that a government is cooperating fully with investigations into attacks on US diplomatic facilities and has arrested or extradited individuals involved in such attacks. The United States Government requests improvements in diplomatic facility security and local security measures to prevent future attacks. All individuals involved in attacks have been identified and are in US custody. Request to suspend prohibition on foreign assistance is subject to certain conditions. The President may request Congress to suspend foreign assistance prohibition for a Government upon certification. However, for Pakistan, certain conditions must be met, including the release of Dr. Shakil Afridi from prison and dropping of criminal charges against him. For purposes of this subsection, a joint resolution introduced within 60 days of a request to suspend foreign assistance prohibition must be approved by Congress. The resolution shall have no force or effect after being referred to the relevant committees in each House of Congress. In the Senate, if a committee has not reported a joint resolution within 20 days of the submission date, 30 Senators can petition to discharge the committee, and the resolution will be placed on the calendar for consideration. In the Senate, if a committee fails to report a joint resolution within 20 days, 30 Senators can petition to discharge the committee, and the resolution will be placed on the calendar for consideration. Subsequently, a motion can be made to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution, with all points of order waived and no amendments allowed. In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between those favoring and opposing it. Further debate limitations can be motioned, but certain actions like amendments or postponements are not allowed. A final vote on the resolution will take place in the Senate. In the Senate, after limited debate on a joint resolution, a final vote on passage will occur without debate on appeals of the Chair's decisions. Certain procedures do not apply in the Senate. The procedures specified in paragraph (4) or (5) do not apply to a joint resolution after 60 session days from the submission date or if the request was submitted within 60 session days before Congress adjourns until the next session. After 60 session days from the submission date, a joint resolution must be passed within 15 session days of the next Congress convening. If the other House receives a joint resolution before passage, specific procedures apply, including no referral to a committee. The House receiving the joint resolution follows its usual procedure as if no resolution had been received from the other House. The President must submit a report to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, analyzing the use of unsecured advanced weaponry in the Benghazi attack. This section does not authorize the use of military force."
