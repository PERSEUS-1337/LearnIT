    "title": "SB 353",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The 2015 Realignment Legislation, also known as the Justice Reinvestment Act, aims to reduce recidivism among criminal offenders by providing adequate funding to local governments. California must reinvest its criminal justice resources in community-based corrections programs and evidence-based practices to improve public safety. Realigning low-level felony offenders to community-based corrections programs can improve public safety outcomes and aid in their reintegration. However, local governments lack resources for adequate bed space, evidence-based programs, and treatment options, hindering the effectiveness of the 2011 Realignment Legislation. Additional funding is needed to meet the needs of offender populations shifted by the legislation. The 2011 Realignment Legislation aims to manage criminal justice populations more cost-effectively, reinvesting savings in evidence-based strategies for public safety. The Legislature intends to use state savings to provide local governments with flexibility and funding to manage new offenders in the best interest of public safety. Chapter 6.4 (Section 30030) of the Government Code establishes the Realignment Reinvestment Fund for realigned offenders. The fund, located in the State Treasury, is continuously appropriated for the exclusive use of this chapter. Beginning in 2016, the Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, annually calculates the net savings to the state from the 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety for the previous fiscal year and estimates the savings for the current fiscal year. If there are savings, the calculations are made by subtracting specific amounts for each fiscal year. The Director of Finance calculates the net fiscal impact of the 2011 Realignment Legislation on the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, excluding other fiscal impacts. The Director of Finance calculates the net fiscal impact of the 2011 Realignment Legislation on the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, excluding other fiscal impacts. This includes expenditure reductions and cost increases related to public safety. The Director of Finance calculates the net fiscal impact of the 2011 Realignment Legislation on the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, excluding other fiscal impacts. This involves summing allocations from various accounts and subtracting $453 million for the fiscal year being analyzed. The Controller transfers funds from the General Fund to the Realignment Reinvestment Fund based on net savings estimates, starting from the 2015-16 fiscal year. The Controller annually allocates funds from the Realignment Reinvestment Fund to counties and city and counties based on the average daily population of realigned offenders under each county's supervision for the preceding fiscal year. The allocation is done by September 1 each year. In each county treasury, a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account is established to receive allocated funds for implementing this chapter. Each county's local Community Corrections Partnership must recommend a comprehensive community-based corrections plan to the county board of supervisors to enhance the outcomes of the 2011 Realignment Legislation. The plan can include various programs such as mental health, substance abuse, transitional housing, job placement, improved supervision strategies, community-based punishment, increased law enforcement staffing, county jail operations, assessment of offenders, and supervision for certain offenders. The supplemental community-based corrections plan for realigned offenders includes an assessment of existing services, identification of high-risk areas, and a local action strategy for swift and graduated responses to crime. The supplemental community-based corrections plan for realigned offenders includes a schedule of proposed programs with funding amounts, an accounting of new crimes by offenders, and an evaluation of existing services and gaps. Programs must be evidence-based, coordinate actions between counties and cities, and provide data for measuring success. The plan for funding programs for realigned offenders must include specific objectives, outcome measures, and accounting for all participants. Outcome measures should include arrest rates, completion of probation and community service, and costs of the program. To assess program effectiveness, counties must report annually on funded programs and outcomes to the Board of State and Community Corrections. The reports should include quantification of per capita costs and use specified program outcome criteria. The Board of State and Community Corrections compiles local reports on program expenditures and outcomes annually, submitting a report to the Governor and Legislature by March 15 each year. The report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. The supplemental community-based corrections plan must be approved by an executive committee of each county's Community Corrections Partnership, which includes key officials. If a plan has been previously approved, it must be reviewed annually and updated as necessary. The supplemental community-based corrections plan must be approved by the county board of supervisors with a four-fifths vote, or it will go back to the Community Corrections Partnership for further consideration. The plan must be submitted to the Board of State and Community Corrections by October 15 each year for funding allocation by the Controller. Funds allocated under subdivision (c) must be used by June 30 of the following fiscal year. Failure to meet this requirement will result in unspent funds being returned to the Controller for deposit in the Realignment Reinvestment Fund. The Director of Finance, in consultation with the Legislative Analyst, develops an estimate of cost savings from the 2011 Realignment Legislation for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation each year. The report is submitted to relevant legislative committees for consideration of additional funds up to the amount of cost savings identified. Moneys allocated from a Realignment Reinvestment Services Account must be used exclusively for services in the county's supplemental community-based corrections plan. These funds are meant to supplement existing services, not replace any funding for law enforcement services or programs. Recipient entities cannot use these funds for administrative overhead costs exceeding 1 percent of their allocation. The Realignment Reinvestment Services Account funds must be used for services in the county's community-based corrections plan. Recipient entities can only charge up to 1 percent of their allocation for administrative overhead costs. The moneys in the Realignment Reinvestment Services Account must be used exclusively as required by this chapter. Funds cannot be transferred or commingled with other funds, except for necessary transfers to the general fund. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
