    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency proposed two regulatory options for Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) to address health and environmental risks. One option involves listing CCRs as a \"special waste\" under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, allowing EPA to regulate its disposal from generation to final disposal. The EPA proposed two regulatory options for Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs). One option involves listing CCRs as a \"special waste\" under Subtitle C of RCRA, creating federal standards enforceable by EPA but likely adopted and enforced by individual states. The second proposal would establish national standards for landfills and surface impoundments receiving CCRs under Subtitle D of RCRA, similar to those for municipal solid waste landfills but tailored to address specific issues related to CCR management. The EPA proposed two regulatory options for Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs). The Subtitle C option would create federal standards enforceable by EPA but likely adopted and enforced by individual states. The Subtitle D option would establish national standards for landfills and surface impoundments receiving CCRs, enforced by states that choose to adopt them. Comments on the proposal came from industry groups, environmental and citizen groups, state agency representatives, individual citizens, and some Members of Congress. Concerns include implementation costs, energy prices, and CCR recycling opportunities. The primary concerns regarding the EPA's Subtitle D proposal for Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) stem from the lack of authority to enforce them. Environmental and citizen groups doubt that all states would adopt the proposed regulations, potentially leading to promulgation without implementation. Various legislative options have been suggested in response, including directing the EPA to regulate CCRs under Subtitle C or Subtitle D, and the introduction of the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273). The Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act (H.R. 2273) was passed by the House on October 14, 2011, and introduced in the Senate (S. 1751) on October 20, 2011. It would amend Subtitle D of RCRA by adding Section 4011 for the management and disposal of coal combustion residuals. Legislative provisions similar to H.R. 2273 are included in Title V of H.R. 4348, which extends federal funding for surface transportation programs. The Senate agreed to an amendment on April 24, 2012, to substitute the language of the Senate-passed bill (S. 1813) for the House-passed language in H.R. 4348. This led to the debate over the provisions of the proposed Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act in the transportation reauthorization legislation conference. The report provides background information on the provisions in H.R. 2273, S. 1751, and Title V of H.R. 4348, focusing on issues related to state adoption and implementation of the proposed CCR permit program. The proposal includes a unique permit program in federal statute, based on RCRA requirements and existing regulations for municipal solid waste management. It does not allow EPA to create new regulations for the program, drawing from EPA's 2010 Subtitle D proposal for CCR landfills. This report identifies key elements of proposed and existing regulatory requirements under Subtitle D for nonhazardous solid waste management. It distinguishes between EPA and state agency authorities, summarizes MSW landfill regulations, and compares details of regulatory requirements applicable to MSW landfills with the proposed CCR permit program. The focus of this report is the legislative proposal to amend Subtitle D of RCRA and the CCR permit program that would be created. In 2010, 45% of electricity in the US was generated from coal, producing 130 million tons of CCRs, a significant waste stream. The management of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) at power plants can lead to the accumulation of large volumes of waste, with potential risks highlighted by incidents like the one at TVA's Kingston plant. Cleanup efforts are ongoing and costly, drawing attention to the need for proper CCR management to prevent catastrophic releases. EPA has identified leaching as a common threat associated with CCR management. The EPA has found that leaching of contaminants, such as heavy metals, from coal combustion residuals (CCRs) can lead to surface or groundwater contamination. CCR management is largely unregulated at the federal level, with over 40 toxic constituents potentially present in CCRs. The presence of toxic constituents does not automatically indicate a risk to humans or the environment. The risk of contaminants from coal combustion residuals (CCRs) depends on human exposure pathways, such as direct discharge to water or leaching in landfills. EPA analyzes potential risks and documented damages to human health and the environment. The EPA has identified potential risks and damages associated with coal combustion residuals (CCRs) disposal and use. In 2000, the EPA proposed regulating CCRs as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA when land disposed. They considered developing national standards with a contingent hazardous waste listing for CCRs. The EPA proposed regulating coal combustion residuals (CCRs) as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA due to potential risks from improper management. Data showed threats to human health and the environment when CCRs were not controlled, leading to a revised determination to exclude CCRs from hazardous waste regulation. The EPA decided to exclude coal combustion residuals (CCRs) from hazardous waste regulation under Subtitle C but acknowledged the need for national regulations under Subtitle D for CCR disposal due to potential risks to human health and the environment. Despite improvements in industry practices, there were still concerns about inadequate controls in landfills and surface impoundments, particularly in groundwater monitoring. EPA identified gaps in state regulatory programs as well. After identifying gaps in state regulatory programs and concerns about mismanagement of coal combustion residuals (CCRs), the EPA proposed revising its determination to list CCRs as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA in 2009. This decision came after a decade of study and debate over the regulation of CCRs. EPA submitted a draft proposal to OMB for review, aiming to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste under existing authority. EPA found high risks of human exposure to carcinogens like lead, selenium, and arsenic in unlined landfills and surface impoundments when coal combustion residuals (CCRs) are deposited. The use of composite liners was deemed safe, but clay liners' reliability, especially in surface impoundments, was questioned. EPA updated its list of damages to include proven and potential cases of contamination in surface and groundwater. The EPA documented damages to surface and groundwater, including 40 cases of potential damage from improper CCR management. Adverse effects on human health, plants, and wildlife were noted. Recent incidents like the Kingston release highlighted risks of catastrophic releases due to structural failures in surface impoundments. Inconsistencies in state requirements were found, with many states lacking minimum liner and groundwater monitoring standards for landfills and impoundments. The EPA found significant gaps in state regulatory programs for the disposal of CCRs, with many surface impoundments lacking minimum liner and groundwater monitoring standards. Most existing facilities are old and unlikely to have necessary protections, posing risks to surface and groundwater. The EPA found that older disposal facilities for coal combustion residuals (CCRs) lack necessary protections like liners and groundwater monitoring. In 2004, EPA reported that a significant percentage of CCR landfills and surface impoundments did not have these safeguards. Despite an average life expectancy of 31 years, these facilities are likely to continue operating without proper protections. EPA's final proposal in 2010 did not yet decide on revising regulations for CCRs as hazardous waste under Subtitle C. The EPA debated whether to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) as hazardous waste under Subtitle C or establish national criteria under Subtitle D. Industry argued against the hazardous waste label to avoid stigmatizing beneficial uses of CCRs. EPA has the authority to directly enforce the Subtitle C option but can only encourage states to enforce the Subtitle D option for CCR landfills and surface impoundments. Under both regulatory options, owners and operators of CCR landfills and surface impoundments would be required to implement protective measures that are largely similar. A significant difference between the two options would be in EPA's authority to enforce the standards directly or to require states to enforce them. Under the Subtitle C option, EPA would have direct enforcement authority with regard to waste management requirements. States authorized to implement Subtitle C programs would need to comply before the rules become effective. Under the Subtitle D option, individual regulated facilities would need to implement standards within six months of promulgation. EPA would not have direct enforcement authority but states or citizens could enforce the standards through RCRA citizen suit authority. States are encouraged to enforce the standards, and the Subtitle D approach is supported by state regulatory agencies and industry groups. Industry groups argue that labeling the material as \"hazardous\" or regulating it under Subtitle C requirements would be costly and burdensome, while current state regulation of CCRs is deemed protective enough. Environmental and citizen groups oppose the Subtitle D approach, citing EPA's waste characterization studies showing the toxicity of CCRs and the lack of enforcement authority. The Subtitle D option for managing CCRs would not address EPA's risk assessments and damage case assessments. It may lead to inconsistent state requirements and reliance on citizen suits for enforcement. EPA would lack authority for financial assurance for cleanup under this proposal. The proposed CCR permit program would incorporate waste management standards from EPA's Subtitle D regulations. The proposed amendment to RCRA focuses on state authority to enforce standards for facilities receiving nonhazardous solid waste. EPA has limited authority for a specific waste category under Subtitle D, with criteria for MSW facilities and state permit programs. EPA enforces MSW criteria in states with inadequate permit programs. Under Section 4010 of RCRA, EPA promulgated federal standards for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills to protect human health and the environment. Criteria include groundwater monitoring, facility location requirements, and corrective action provisions. The EPA's criteria for MSW landfills include national technical standards for various aspects such as location restrictions, operating criteria, design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure/post-closure care, and financial assurance. These criteria apply to facilities receiving predominantly dry wastes and do not cover facilities accumulating liquid wastes like surface impoundments. The EPA's criteria for MSW landfills include national technical standards for location, operation, design, groundwater monitoring, closure, and financial assurance. States without approved permit programs must adopt these criteria to prevent open dumps. EPA enforces MSW landfill criteria in non-permit states. The \"permit program\" outlines the requirements and procedures for regulating solid waste disposal facilities under the MSW landfill criteria in 40 C.F.R. Part 258. It includes details on permit application components, state requirements for program adequacy, and enforcement of facility compliance. EPA mandates in 40 C.F.R. Part 239 for MSW permit program adequacy determination are also specified. The curr_chunk discusses state laws and procedures for ensuring facility compliance with MSW landfill criteria, EPA's procedures for determining program adequacy, and EPA's authorities in states with inadequate permit programs. It also mentions specific requirements for EPA's determination of state program adequacy. The EPA enforces federal MSW landfill criteria at facilities in states without adequate permit programs. Once a state has an approved permit program, it is responsible for enforcing the standards and issuing permits. The permit demonstrates compliance with federal and state MSW landfill criteria. EPA's authority under Subtitle D is limited in requiring states to adopt, implement, and enforce federal standards for non-MSW waste. EPA has the authority to develop criteria for hazardous household waste (MSW) facilities and assess state permit programs for compliance. For nonhazardous solid waste like CCRs, EPA can only build upon state-enforced open dumping regulations. EPA cannot mandate state solid waste permit programs for other types of solid waste under Subtitle D. In a June 2010 proposal, EPA planned to establish Subtitle D standards for sanitary landfills under its existing authority. The proposal under Section 4004 of RCRA aims to establish criteria to prevent adverse effects on health or the environment from disposal facilities like CCR landfills and surface impoundments. It would add standards for the receipt of coal combustion residuals in these facilities, defining CCR landfills as disposal sites for CCRs that are not land treatment facilities, surface impoundments, or other specified locations. Landfills also include piles, quarries, and large-scale fill operations. CCR landfills are sites for coal combustion residuals that are not land treatment facilities, surface impoundments, or other specified locations. They include sand and gravel pits, quarries, and large-scale fill operations. CCR surface impoundments are designed to hold CCRs with free liquids and are not injection wells. These units receive CCRs sluiced with water and wastes from air pollution control devices. EPA's regulatory proposal aligns more closely with criteria for MSW landfills. The proposed CCR standards align closely with criteria for MSW landfills but have significant differences related to ensuring protection from CCR disposal. Requirements include placing new disposal facilities above the natural water table, avoiding wetlands and fault zones, and not locating in seismic impact zones or unstable areas. New or existing disposal facilities in unstable areas would be subject to closure or required to have a composite liner. Existing surface impoundments must have solids removed and be retrofitted with a composite liner within five years. Facilities must operate in accordance with regulations similar to those under the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Fugitive dust controls and liquid run-off/run-on control specific to CCR disposal facilities are required. If implemented, CCR facilities failing Subtitle D standards would violate RCRA's open dumping prohibition. EPA lacks direct enforcement authority over individual facilities, only able to encourage states to adopt and enforce the criteria. States could develop their own regulations and permitting programs using their solid waste laws. EPA cannot require states to enforce the standards or develop federal approval procedures for state adoption. EPA proposes self-implementing CCR management standards to address potential non-compliance issues. Limited enforcement mechanisms are in place, with public availability of compliance information for citizen enforcement. The EPA proposes self-implementing CCR management standards with limited enforcement options. A legislative proposal would create a permit program for the management and disposal of CCRs under an amendment to RCRA. States could choose to adopt a CCR permit program, with EPA required to implement it in states that decline. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA requires states to notify EPA of their intent to implement a CCR permit program within six months of enactment. States choosing to implement the program must submit a certification to EPA within 36 months. States must maintain an approved MSW landfill permit program or be authorized to implement the federal hazardous waste management program under Subtitle C of RCRA to adopt the program. EPA is not directed to promulgate specific criteria for owners and operators of CCR structures. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA requires states to notify EPA of their intent to implement a CCR permit program within six months of enactment. States must submit a certification to EPA within 36 months. EPA is not directed to promulgate specific criteria for owners and operators of CCR structures. States would be directed to apply \"Minimum Requirements\" to their permit programs, including selected elements of EPA's June 2010 proposal and certain \"revised criteria\" from 40 C.F.R. Part 258. Each state could choose not to apply certain criteria to its permit program. EPA would provide written notice and opportunity to remedy any issues. EPA would identify deficiencies in state permit programs, collaborate with states to set deadlines for remedying deficiencies, and could implement a CCR permit program if states fail to address deficiencies within the agreed-upon deadline. EPA is authorized to act if states decline to implement the program or notify EPA of their decision not to continue implementation. The proposed amendment to RCRA allows states to adopt stricter regulations for Coal Combustion Residuals (CCRs) and EPA will defer to states in regulating CCRs. CCRs are materials generated from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels. The EPA regulatory determinations pertain to the management of coal combustion wastes co-managed with other wastes from coal combustion. The Coal Combustion Residuals Permit Program is a state-approved system for managing and disposing of coal combustion residuals in structures like landfills or surface impoundments. Revised criteria ensure the protection of human health in MSW landfill units. The proposed amendment to RCRA would establish a state-based permit program under Subtitle D using MSW landfill requirements as a basis. Unlike other environmental laws, Congress would create a unique permit program without specifying legal standards for EPA to develop. Regulatory standards would typically be directed by Congress to meet specified protection levels. The EPA is required to allow public comment on regulatory proposals before finalizing federal agency standards. Congress may give the EPA authority to enforce standards or require states to do so. Most federal environmental standards are enforced by states with EPA authorization. Congressional directives on environmental standards can be broad and subject to interpretation by the EPA. The EPA is mandated to develop landfill criteria to protect human health and the environment, with specific requirements for groundwater monitoring, location restrictions, and corrective action. Industry groups, state agencies, and some Members of Congress have criticized EPA for exceeding its regulatory authority, particularly in developing standards for greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Opponents criticize EPA for overreaching regulatory authority in proposing to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste under Subtitle C. The creation of a CCR permit program under the proposed RCRA amendment aims to give states discretion in managing CCRs, potentially limiting EPA involvement. Uncertainty remains on whether a state's regulatory standards for CCR landfills would differ significantly from current standards under the proposed Section 4011 permit program. Regulatory requirements for the permit program are outlined in Section 4011, but implementation details are still unclear. The proposed Section 4011 outlines a permit program for managing CCRs, comparing it to existing MSW landfill regulations. The federal regulatory framework for MSW management includes national criteria, state permit programs, and EPA enforcement. EPA's Subtitle D proposal and proposed Section 4011 of RCRA aim to manage CCRs with a permit program, but lack federally enforceable standards for owners and operators. The MSW landfill regulations include national criteria, state permit programs, and EPA enforcement. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA lacks federally enforceable standards for owners and operators of CCR structures, unlike the MSW landfill regulations which include national criteria and EPA enforcement. Key directives are missing in Section 4011 that would require states to apply standards directly to CCR structures. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA lacks federally enforceable standards for owners and operators of CCR structures. The Permit Program Specifications in Section 4011 apply certain requirements to the CCR permit program, including minimum requirements, revised criteria, and program limitations set by the state. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA does not have federally enforceable standards for owners and operators of CCR structures. Program limitations allow states to determine which requirements are necessary for CCR management in their state. The minimum program specifications apply to the CCR permit program as deemed necessary by the state, focusing on management and disposal of CCRs in structures within the state. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA does not have federally enforceable standards for owners and operators of CCR structures. States can determine necessary requirements for CCR management. The program specifies criteria for CCR surface impoundments, drawn from EPA's June 2010 proposal. Each structure must meet design, construction, and other specifications. The proposed Section 4011 of RCRA outlines requirements for CCR structures, including containment of CCRs based on engineering standards. High hazard structures may require corrective action if deficient. New structures must have a base 2 feet above the water table. The proposed legislation outlines requirements for CCR structures, including containment based on engineering standards. It is unclear if states would be required to apply the specifications to owners and operators of CCR structures. If states choose to apply the permit program specifications, they would differ significantly from EPA's criteria for addressing risks associated with improper CCR disposal. The proposed legislation outlines requirements for CCR structures, including constructing new landfills with composite liners, closing non-compliant structures, and implementing weekly inspections. However, it lacks specific compliance deadlines similar to those for MSW landfills. States would need to certify a program within three years, but no timeline is set for full compliance. The proposed legislation for CCR structures lacks specific compliance deadlines similar to those for MSW landfills. States must certify a program within three years, but no timeline is set for full compliance. The term \"structures\" under Section 4011 is broadly defined as landfills, surface impoundments, or other land-based units that may receive coal combustion residuals. States have discretion to define \"structures\" more broadly without a detailed definition in statute. States have discretion to define \"structures\" broadly without a detailed definition in statute. This includes units designed to hold free liquids or cover a specific land area. Other land-based units that may receive CCRs could include land applications for structural or embankment fill. It is unclear when a state may adopt a CCR permit program with compliance standards for owners and operators. The implementation of a CCR permit program would apply compliance standards to owners and operators of CCR structures. States may vary in their application of standards, and a comparison of potential protection is provided in Table A-1. The program broadly applies MSW landfill criteria but allows states to apply them as needed. The proposed amendment to RCRA introduces a CCR permit program that differs significantly from the MSW permit program. States were required to adopt a permit program for MSW facilities to comply with criteria, while a CCR permit program would manage coal combustion residuals disposal. The proposed amendment to RCRA introduces a CCR permit program for the management and disposal of coal combustion residuals in structures within a state. States must adopt this program, which differs from the MSW permit program for compliance with criteria. EPA details the required components of a state permit program application, necessary state authorities, and processes to ensure facility compliance with MSW landfill criteria. EPA may withdraw approval of a state's permit program, leading to potential enforcement of criteria at facilities in that state. The proposed Section 4011 introduces a CCR permit program for coal combustion residuals management in structures within a state. States must certify to EPA that their program meets Permit Program Specifications within 36 months of enactment. The certification requirements are similar to those of a state MSW permit program, but Section 4011 lacks provisions comparable to Part 239 regulatory requirements. This omission suggests that directives for an adequate MSW permit program may not apply to the adoption or implementation of a CCR permit program. The proposed Section 4011 introduces a CCR permit program for coal combustion residuals management in structures within a state. States must certify to EPA that their program meets Permit Program Specifications within 36 months of enactment. The program requires owners and operators of CCR structures to obtain a permit and operate in accordance with permit conditions by a certain deadline. Absent explicit directives, a state implementing a CCR permit may not necessarily have to require permits for all CCR structures. A state adopting a CCR permit program must meet specific requirements within 36 months. It is unclear how states with approved MSW permit programs will adapt their laws and procedures for CCR management. EPA's role in state adoption of a CCR permit program differs significantly from its role in the MSW permit program. The adoption and implementation of a CCR permit program differ significantly from an MSW landfill permit program. EPA's role in state adoption of the proposed CCR permit program involves providing notice and an opportunity to remedy deficiencies if a state does not meet program requirements. The EPA's role in state adoption of the proposed CCR permit program involves providing notice and an opportunity to remedy deficiencies. States must address identified deficiencies within a reasonable deadline set by the EPA, with implementation of a CCR permit program by the EPA if deficiencies are not resolved after the deadline and any judicial review is completed. EPA is not required to assess other elements of a state's CCR permit program or the adequacy of state regulatory programs in minimizing risks associated with improper waste disposal. The EPA's role in state adoption of the proposed CCR permit program involves providing notice and an opportunity to remedy deficiencies. States must address identified deficiencies within a reasonable deadline set by the EPA, with implementation of a CCR permit program by the EPA if deficiencies are not resolved after the deadline and any judicial review is completed. EPA is not required to assess other elements of a state's CCR permit program or the adequacy of state regulatory programs in minimizing risks associated with improper waste disposal. Programs are adequate to minimize risks associated with improper accumulation and disposal of CCRs. EPA must approve a state's MSW permit program and could have a role in its future implementation, including the ability to withdraw its adequacy determination. Table B-1 in Appendix B lists the required elements in Part 239 and identifies relevant requirements included or excluded in the proposed Section 4011 of RCRA for MSW permit program comparison. EPA proposed national standards for CCR accumulation and disposal facilities to ensure minimized contaminant leaching and groundwater monitoring. States do not. EPA's proposal under Subtitle D and legislative proposals to amend RCRA aim to address concerns regarding the lack of consistent protective measures for CCR surface impoundments. The key question is whether these proposals would change current state practices. Both proposals do not impose federally enforceable standards on owners and operators of CCR facilities. Instead, states would have the discretion to adopt, implement, and enforce the national standards as they see fit. The legislative proposal to amend RCRA would create a CCR permit program giving states discretion in applying new regulatory standards to existing facilities. State agencies argue their current programs sufficiently address CCR management, making it unlikely for states to implement significantly different programs without federal directive. Comparison of existing and proposed disposal facility criteria shows potential changes in regulatory standards. The EPA proposed new standards for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, with requirements including location restrictions, operating criteria, design criteria, groundwater monitoring, closure, and financial assurance. The most significant differences between the standards relate to the regulation of surface impoundments, with specific protections for liquid disposal not included in Part 258 due to restrictions on bulk liquid disposal in MSW landfills. The EPA's proposed Subtitle D standards for CCR landfills and surface impoundments include requirements to address issues unique to managing CCRs, such as the accumulation of liquids in surface impoundments. The proposed amendment to RCRA does not aim to create standards for owners and operators of CCR landfills and surface impoundments. The specifications for a coal combustion residuals permit program include revised criteria that apply to CCR structures, with states having the discretion to determine which criteria to apply. Permit Program Specifications in Table A-1 identify similarities and differences from EPA's June 2010 proposal for CCR landfills and surface impoundments. States can choose to apply the proposed Section 4011 Permit Program as needed. The discretion given to states to apply the proposed Section 4011 Permit Program Specifications to CCR structures raises questions about the comparability of a state's CCR permit program to an approved MSW permit program. Implementing a CCR permit program would differ significantly from an MSW permit program due to varying roles and responsibilities. Key differences between the two programs can be seen in the requirements for state permit program determination of adequacy. The proposed Section 4011 amendment to RCRA includes few requirements from 40 C.F.R. Part 239 in the CCR permit program. Comparable provisions not included in the statute may not apply to a state's program or may be applied at its discretion."
