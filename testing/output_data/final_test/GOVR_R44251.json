    "content": "Some scholars and legislators propose reexamining the U.S. Constitution's Citizenship Clause to potentially change birthright citizenship rules. The clause states that all persons born in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. Debates on birthright citizenship involve concerns about unauthorized immigration, terrorism, \"birth tourism,\" and congressional redistricting. Legal debates focus on the clause's wording \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" The Citizenship Clause in the U.S. Constitution grants automatic citizenship to any child born within the country, with limited exceptions. The clause is based on the English common law doctrine of jus soli, which determines nationality by place of birth. The alternative doctrine of jus sanguinis, based on descent, is more common globally. Both systems have elements of the other, with few countries purely adopting one over the other. The Citizenship Clause in the U.S. Constitution grants automatic citizenship to any child born within the country, with limited exceptions. Judicial decisions have recognized the jus soli interpretation of the clause, but it remains unclear if it extends to children of aliens present unlawfully. Key cases like Elk v. Wilkins and United States v. Wong Kim Ark involved Native Americans and children of resident aliens, respectively. Elk found that Indian tribe members were not granted citizenship by the Fourteenth Amendment, while Wong Kim Ark established citizenship for a child of Chinese citizens in San Francisco. Some argue that the Citizenship Clause only applies to children of lawfully present or resident aliens, not unauthorized or nonimmigrant aliens. Legislation has been proposed to change the jus soli rule, targeting Section 301 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Any law excluding children of certain aliens would face judicial review. The Supreme Court could potentially review a statute excluding children of certain aliens from birthright citizenship. The Court may need to reconsider previous interpretations of the Citizenship Clause to uphold such a statute. The report provides a historical review of U.S. citizenship from the founding to the Fourteenth Amendment. It discusses Supreme Court decisions on birthright citizenship and legal arguments for and against reassessing the Citizenship Clause. The report closes by discussing the legal considerations for restricting birthright citizenship of U.S.-born children of alien parents without a constitutional amendment, building on historical and judicial precedent. The Constitution required certain citizenship criteria for Representatives, Senators, and Presidents, with Congress having the power to establish naturalization rules. Naturalization is the process through which a non-citizen obtains citizenship, not by birth. Before the Civil Rights Act of 1866, U.S. citizenship by birth was not clearly defined in federal laws. Citizenship at birth was often interpreted based on English common law. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the influence of English common law on the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. For instance, in a 1824 case, the Court considered three girls born in the U.S. as citizens, even though their father was an Irish citizen who never naturalized. In 1830, the Supreme Court ruled that a person born in New York after July 4, 1776, was a U.S. citizen unless born in British-occupied territory. In Lynch v. Clarke (1844), a New York court determined that a child born to Irish aliens in New York was a U.S. citizen based on jus soli doctrine. The birthright citizenship principles in the United States were not extended to slaves or Native Americans. The 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford case applied a racial limitation on citizenship, but was later repealed by the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 repealed Dred Scott and declared all persons born in the US, not subject to foreign power, as citizens. Senator Trumbull clarified that the exclusion for \"Indians not taxed\" was due to their status as separate nations. He confirmed that the provision would naturalize children of Chinese, Gypsies, and German parents born in the country. Senator Cowen agreed that children of German parents were citizens under the current law, focusing on race rather than alien status. Senator Trumbull discussed citizenship requirements in terms of allegiance to the US. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was passed despite President Johnson's veto, followed by the introduction of the Fourteenth Amendment. Senator Wade proposed amending the citizenship provision in the Fourteenth Amendment. The Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment was debated by Senator Wade, who proposed replacing \"citizen\" with \"person\" to clarify uncertainties in the government. Senator Howard introduced the clause to declare that all persons born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. This amendment aimed to affirm that individuals born in the US, excluding foreigners and aliens, are citizens by natural and national law. Senator Cowen objected to the Citizenship Clause, questioning if children of Chinese immigrants in California should be granted citizenship. Senator Conness argued that all children born in California, regardless of parentage, should be considered citizens. Debate then shifted to Native American status. Senator Trumbull raised concerns about the meaning of the clause. Senator Trumbull questioned the jurisdiction of the United States over Native Americans despite the Citizenship Clause's expansion of birthright citizenship. Naturalization remained racially restricted even after the Fourteenth Amendment, with only African nativity and descent individuals being eligible. The Slaughter-House Cases decision in 1873 interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment but focused on federal rights, rendering the Privileges and Immunities Clause practically useless for state citizenship privileges. The decision mentioned excluding children of foreign diplomats from birthright citizenship, but this statement is not considered binding precedent. Elk v. Wilkins, decided in 1884, addressed the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved John Elk, a member of an Indian tribe who was denied U.S. citizenship. The Supreme Court ruled that members of Indian tribes were not automatically granted citizenship at birth due to their special status as independent political communities. The Elk v. Wilkins case in 1884 addressed the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ruling that members of Indian tribes were not automatically granted U.S. citizenship at birth. The Supreme Court stated that Indians born within the U.S. owed allegiance to their tribe, not the U.S., and were not fully subject to U.S. jurisdiction. The primary Supreme Court case on birthright citizenship under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is United States v. Wong Kim Ark, decided in 1898. Wong Kim Ark, a Chinese citizen born in San Francisco in 1873, was detained upon returning to the U.S. in 1895 and was declared not a U.S. citizen, leading to a legal battle over his citizenship status. The Supreme Court case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898 involved a Chinese citizen, born in San Francisco, who was denied U.S. citizenship. The government argued that \"subject to the jurisdiction\" referred to those born within the political jurisdiction of the U.S., while Wong Kim Ark's attorneys cited common law jurisprudence and the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ultimately, Justice Horace Gray ruled in favor of Wong Kim Ark, emphasizing the development of English common law and rejecting the argument that it had been replaced by jus sanguinis. The Supreme Court case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898 involved a Chinese citizen, born in San Francisco, who was denied U.S. citizenship. The government argued that \"subject to the jurisdiction\" referred to those born within the political jurisdiction of the U.S., while Wong Kim Ark's attorneys cited common law jurisprudence and the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Horace Gray ruled in favor of Wong Kim Ark, affirming citizenship by birth within the territory under the protection of the country. The Supreme Court case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898 affirmed birthright citizenship for individuals born within the territory of the United States, regardless of their parents' nationality or allegiance. The Court emphasized that all persons, regardless of race or color, domiciled within the U.S., are included in the Amendment's protection, with only a few exceptions such as children of foreign diplomats or hostile occupying enemies. The Supreme Court case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898 affirmed birthright citizenship for individuals born within the territory of the United States, regardless of their parents' nationality or allegiance. The Court reiterated that birthright citizenship could not be abridged by legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Acts. The specific case involved a child born in the U.S. to Chinese parents who were domiciled and carrying on business in the country. The Supreme Court affirmed birthright citizenship for individuals born in the United States, regardless of their parents' nationality. Chief Justice Fuller and Justice Harlan dissented, emphasizing a treaty and statute disqualifying Chinese parents and their children from naturalization. U.S. citizenship is automatically granted to anyone born within the U.S., unless falling within specific exceptions. The Fourteenth Amendment grants U.S. citizenship to individuals born in the country, with exceptions for children of recognized Indian tribes and foreign diplomatic officers. Alien status or unlawful presence of parents does not affect a child's citizenship. In a WWII case, an attempt to challenge birthright citizenship for Japanese Americans was unsuccessful. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed whether the Citizenship Clause requires U.S. citizenship for persons born in the United States to unlawfully present aliens. In Plyler v. Doe, the Court ruled that denying education to children not legally admitted violated the Equal Protection Clause. Texas argued that illegal immigrants are not protected under the Clause. The Supreme Court ruled in Plyler v. Doe that denying education to children not legally admitted violated the Equal Protection Clause. Texas argued that illegal immigrants are not protected under the Clause, but the Court disagreed, stating that excluding certain groups from jurisdiction undermines the purpose of the Clause. The Court also noted the use of \"jurisdiction\" in the Citizenship Clause. The Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe ruled that denying education to children not legally admitted violated the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Gray in United States v. Wong Kim Ark emphasized the geographic sense of \"jurisdiction\" in the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He concluded that every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled in the US, is within its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court emphasized in Plyler v. Doe that denying education to children not legally admitted violated the Equal Protection Clause. Justice Gray in United States v. Wong Kim Ark highlighted that every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled in the US, is within its jurisdiction. The Court also considered the distinction between resident aliens with lawful entry and those with unlawful entry in terms of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction. In 2004, the Supreme Court was asked to reconsider granting U.S. citizenship to children born to aliens in the United States in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. The case involved a U.S. citizen born to Saudi parents detained in Afghanistan. Some argued for a more limited interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment based on consent. The Court did not address the issue in its decision. The issue of granting American citizenship to children of aliens has been debated in recent cases, including Tuaua v. United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that \"born in the United States\" does not include those born in American Samoa. The court analyzed the jus soli doctrine and referenced Elk v. Wilkins and United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The court questioned if Wong Kim Ark reflects the constitutional definition. The court in Tuaua v. United States ruled that American Samoa is not included in the jus soli doctrine for granting citizenship. The court found that American Samoa's situation is more akin to Indian tribe members under Elk v. Wilkins and is significantly self-governing. The decision was influenced by The Insular Cases, which addressed the application of the Constitution in territories not considered states. The court also dismissed the argument that Congress could change the interpretation of the Citizenship Clause by statute without a constitutional amendment. The United States Government argues that Congress's power to modify birthright citizenship by statute trumps the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, this argument erroneously conflates Congress's naturalization powers with the authority to abrogate birthright citizenship under the Constitution itself. Congress's authority for the latter is lacking, as the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature. The debate over American birthright citizenship for children of aliens has significant policy and political philosophy components with real-world consequences. The report focuses on the legal and constitutional aspects of the debate surrounding birthright citizenship. It introduces competing perspectives and legislative proposals to limit birthright citizenship, discussing potential Supreme Court assessments. The debate centers on the interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, with some advocating for reinterpretation while others maintain the status quo. The question remains unsettled, with legal and constitutional hurdles facing those seeking reinterpretation. The legal debate over the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment revolves around whether U.S. citizenship should be automatically granted to all persons born in the country, including those born to unlawfully present aliens. The majority view is that the Amendment does require automatic citizenship for all born in the U.S. The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states that U.S. citizenship is granted to all persons born in the country, with exceptions for foreign diplomats, hostile occupying forces, or members of recognized Indian tribes. The interpretation of \"jurisdiction\" refers to territorial jurisdiction, determining citizenship based on geographical circumstances of birth. There is debate over whether citizenship should be automatically granted to persons born in the U.S. to aliens, especially those present unlawfully or domiciled elsewhere. The argument against birthright citizenship is based on the idea that the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" in the Citizenship Clause requires undivided allegiance and a reciprocal relationship between the individual and the government at the time of birth. This view, known as the \"consensual\" approach, suggests that political membership should be based on mutual consent between the individual and the government. The debate over birthright citizenship centers on the concept of mutual consent between the individual and the government, with some arguing that citizenship is not solely determined by place of birth but by consent to the sovereign's jurisdiction. The minority viewpoint challenges the conventional interpretation and looks to historical evidence for support. The American Revolution rejected the English common law concept of citizenship based on birthplace, emphasizing consensualist ideals of a social contract. Proponents of the Citizenship Clause argue that the Founders understood jus soli with limited exceptions. The debate over birthright citizenship focuses on mutual consent and historical evidence. The history of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and its precursor language in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 diverge. The legislative history contains conflicting inferences, with some arguing for narrowing birthright citizenship based on notions of \"complete jurisdiction\" and \"allegiance.\" However, these arguments were mainly in the context of excluding members of Indian tribes from the Citizenship Clause. The debate over birthright citizenship revolves around the exclusion of Indian tribe members from the Citizenship Clause. Proponents argue that children of aliens were intended to be included, while interpretations of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 differ. Consensualists suggest a narrow interpretation of Wong Kim Ark to support reinterpreting the Citizenship Clause. The Elk v. Wilkins and Wong Kim Ark Supreme Court decisions in the 1800s settled the meaning of the Citizenship Clause, arguing that jus soli doctrine does not include the unlawful presence of alien parents at the time of birth. Supporters debate the definition of \"jurisdiction\" in the Citizenship Clause based on territoriality or a more context-specific interpretation. Supporters of the prevailing interpretation argue for a broader definition of \"jurisdiction\" in the Citizenship Clause, avoiding the need for a complex construct of consent and allegiance. Some argue that illegal immigration as it exists today did not exist when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, questioning the granting of birthright citizenship to children of illegal aliens. Proponents of a narrower interpretation argue that the United States embraced a more open borders policy prior to the Twentieth Century, and point out that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment apparently did not discuss unlawfully present aliens per se. The Wong Kim Ark decision also did not expressly declare that the children of unlawfully present aliens were included within the scope of the Citizenship Clause. On the other hand, the Chinese Exclusion Acts were a legal fact by the time the Wong Kim Ark case was decided. Some late nineteenth century writers believed violations of the Chinese Exclusion Acts occurred at a large scale. Modern commenters also point to other precursors to today's unlawfully present aliens, such as slaves imported in violation of the slave import ban and socially isolated \"Gypsies.\" Lawmakers have proposed restricting automatic U.S. citizenship at birth since the early 1990s, raising broader issues on applying the Constitution to unanticipated social conditions. Lawmakers have proposed restricting automatic U.S. citizenship at birth since the early 1990s. In 1995, a hearing was held on bills and resolutions to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. More recently, the \"Birthright Citizenship Act of 2015\" was introduced to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act. The 14th Amendment establishes that a person born in the United States is considered 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States for citizenship purposes if at least one parent is a citizen, national, lawful permanent resident, or actively serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. If both parents are unlawfully present aliens or on nonimmigrant visas, the child would not be granted U.S. citizenship. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security held a hearing in April 2015 to discuss the legal and constitutional issues of restricting birthright citizenship by statute. The current policy of automatically granting U.S. citizenship to every person born in the United States is permissible under the Citizenship Clause. The Citizenship Clause allows Congress to extend U.S. citizenship by birth to additional groups beyond the minimum guarantee. Any attempt to reinterpret the Citizenship Clause more narrowly would likely be deemed unconstitutional, requiring a new constitutional amendment. The judicial branch may need to determine if Congress or the Executive Branch can impose a narrower interpretation, considering various complex factors. The interpretation of the Citizenship Clause may involve complex considerations such as constitutional canons, separation of powers, stare decisis, and the language of the statute. Opinions on the outcome vary, with some suggesting a constitutional amendment may be necessary to change the rule of birthright citizenship. Some commentators believe amending the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny birthright citizenship to children of unlawfully present aliens would be constitutional. Others argue that legal and constitutional obstacles would make this difficult. Supporters of the current practice argue that changing the Citizenship Clause would be a significant shift in constitutional law. The potential reinterpretation of the Citizenship Clause could lead to a significant change in constitutional law. Supporters argue for maintaining the current practice, while opponents raise concerns about practical, policy, and ethical considerations. Proponents of a narrower reinterpretation point to modern circumstances diverging from historical assumptions as a reason for change. The U.S. Supreme Court's authority to reinterpret the Citizenship Clause may be constrained by previous case law, including the Wong Kim Ark decision. Overturning precedent is not taken lightly, with factors like workability, reliance interests, and reasoning considered. Special justification is required for any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis. The U.S. Supreme Court's authority to reinterpret the Citizenship Clause may face constraints from previous case law, such as Wong Kim Ark. Courts would need to consider the meaning of \"jurisdiction\" in the context of the Equal Protection Clause. Retroactively changing citizenship laws would be challenging, as seen in the Afroyim v. Rusk case. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a statute stripping citizenship for voting in a foreign election is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, protecting citizens from congressional actions that could revoke their citizenship. Congress may consider birthright citizenship restrictions only for future cases. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a statute stripping citizenship for voting in a foreign election is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. Birthright citizenship restrictions may only apply prospectively, facing hurdles due to legal history and interpretations. A constitutional challenge could potentially block a statute denying citizenship to certain individuals born in the U.S."
