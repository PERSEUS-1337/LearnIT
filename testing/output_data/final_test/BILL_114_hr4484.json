    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Long Island Aviation History Act\". It includes findings related to aviation history. The Congress finds that Long Island has been crucial in the development of the aviation industry in the US, with notable landmarks in Hempstead Plains, Suffolk County Air Force Base, Bethpage, Port Washington, and Farmingdale. The Hempstead Plains, known as the \"Cradle of Aviation,\" had major airfields like Roosevelt Field, Curtiss Field, and Mitchel Field in the early 20th century, serving as important training centers during World War I. The Curtiss Field in Garden City, New York, played a significant role in aviation history. It was a training center for US military pilots and a hub for aircraft research, development, and production. Notable events include the first transatlantic flight in 1919 by the U.S. Navy Curtiss NC-4 and Charles Lindbergh's famous transatlantic flight in 1927. Amelia Earhart and other women pilots also founded the Ninety-Nines at Curtiss Field in 1929. During World War II, Long Island was a crucial center of military aircraft production, with aircraft of excellent quality produced in large numbers for the Army, Navy, and foreign governments. The Grumman Aircraft Company, based on Long Island, played a significant role in the war effort. During World War II, Long Island was a vital hub for military aircraft production. Grumman and Republic Aviation manufactured innovative planes like the F6F-3 Hellcat and P-47 Thunderbolt. Mitchel Air Force Base on the Hempstead Plains was crucial for defense, while Suffolk County Air Force Base in Westhampton defended the NYC area. In 1962, Grumman secured the contract to build the Lunar Module. In 1962, Grumman won the contract to build the Lunar Module for the Apollo Program, leading to the first men traveling to the moon in 1969 aboard a spacecraft built with Long Island's aviation industry expertise. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the study area to evaluate the national significance of Long Island's aviation history, determine the feasibility of designating parts of the area as a unit of the National Park System, consider preservation alternatives, and identify properties for historic designation. The special resource study will evaluate Long Island's aviation history for potential National Park System designation, consult with various entities, consider management options for protection, enhance historical research and awareness, and estimate associated costs. The study area focuses on Long Island, particularly the Hempstead Plains and surrounding areas in Suffolk. The study will focus on areas such as the Hempstead Plains, Suffolk County Air Force Base, Bethpage, Port Washington, and Farmingdale. The study will be conducted in accordance with applicable law and a report will be submitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate within 3 years."
