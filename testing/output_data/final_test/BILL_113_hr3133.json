    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Marriage and Religious Freedom Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that conflicts between same-sex marriage and religious liberty are real and should be legislatively addressed. Protecting religious freedom from Government intrusion is a Government interest of the highest order. Legislatively enacted measures advance this interest by remedying, deterring, and preventing Government interference with religious exercise. The amendment to the United States Constitution aims to protect the free exercise of religious beliefs about marriage to promote tolerance and contribute to a more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society. SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. The Federal Government is prohibited from taking adverse actions against individuals who act in accordance with a religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. Adverse actions include denying tax exemptions or deductions for charitable contributions. The Federal Government is prohibited from discriminating against individuals based on their religious belief about marriage, including denying benefits or opportunities. SEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF. (a) A person can use this Act to claim damages, relief, or defense against the Federal Government. Standing is based on general rules of standing under the Constitution. \n(b) Attorneys' fees can be recovered under this Act. \n(c) The Attorney General can enforce compliance with this Act through injunctive or declaratory relief. The subsection does not affect the right of the Attorney General or any agency of the United States to take legal action under other laws. SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act shall be broadly construed in favor of protecting religious beliefs. It does not preempt or repeal state or federal laws that offer equal or greater protection for religious beliefs. If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected. In this Act, definitions include \"Federal benefit program,\" \"Federal Government,\" and \"person,\" with specific meanings provided for each term."
