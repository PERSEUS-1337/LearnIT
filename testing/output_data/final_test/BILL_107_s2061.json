    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Response to Terrorism and Consequence Management Act of 2002.\" Title I focuses on building capacity for urban search and rescue task forces, known as the \"National Urban Search and Rescue Task Force Assistance Act of 2002.\" The Congress finds that FEMA established the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System in 1989 to provide search and rescue capacity in the event of an earthquake. Task forces can be activated after a major disaster declaration, must deploy within six hours, and sustain themselves for the first 72 hours of operations. Each task force must be capable of deploying personnel and equipment. In fiscal year 2001, FEMA provided funding for task forces to ensure they have trained individuals, logistical support, and equipment. Some funds were specifically allocated for upgrading the capability of six task forces to respond to disasters involving weapons of mass destruction. Since 2001, FEMA has funded 28 task forces in the US to respond to disasters involving weapons of mass destruction. Task forces require additional training and equipment support. Each task force deployed with 80,000 pounds of equipment valued at $1,800,000. Operating costs are $150,000 per year with a need for $1,500,000 for maintenance. Inadequate transportation hinders timely disaster response. FEMA's Incident Support Teams cost $5,000,000 annually. Task forces need proper training and equipment for urban search and rescue, including response to terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. The Federal Government needs to ensure that designated task forces have adequate equipment, staff support, and capability to deploy internationally for search and rescue functions in response to acts of terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. These task forces, originally created for earthquake response, play a vital role in responding to such acts. The purpose of this act is to provide funds, equipment, and training for urban search and rescue task forces to respond to all emergency needs, including acts of terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    Definitions for this title:\n            (1) Director: Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n            (2) Urban search and rescue task force: Any of the 28 FEMA-designated task forces.\n            (3) Urban search and rescue equipment: Equipment necessary to respond to emergencies, including terrorist acts. The Director may provide grants to urban search and rescue task forces for operational costs, equipment, training for operating in contaminated environments, transportation, task force expansion, and Incident Support Teams. The Director shall prioritize funding to ensure urban search and rescue task forces are capable of deploying two task forces simultaneously. Funding for operational costs is set at $1,500,000 per task force annually. Grants for international disaster response teams will only be provided upon determination of need by the Director. The Director will prioritize funding for urban search and rescue task forces to deploy two task forces simultaneously, with operational costs set at $1,500,000 per task force annually. Grants for international disaster response teams will be provided based on need determined by the Director or to maintain existing capacity. The Director will establish grant requirements for awarding grants under the Act. Additionally, up to four percent of funds may be used for technical assistance to help urban search and rescue task forces coordinate with other agencies. There is also provision for additional task forces to be established. SEC. 107 authorizes the establishment of additional urban search and rescue teams once the initial 28 teams are fully funded and operational. SEC. 108 outlines the performance requirements for these teams. SEC. 108 allows the Director to incur necessary obligations for urban search and rescue task forces, including temporary employment and insurance. SEC. 109 authorizes $160,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, with each task force receiving at least $1,500,000 for operational costs.
