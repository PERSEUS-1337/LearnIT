    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmentally Responsible Windpower Act of 2005\" and provides local control for siting windmills. The \"Environmentally Responsible Windpower Act of 2005\" grants local control for siting wind turbines. Before receiving certain approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wind projects must obtain Local Approval Authorization from the governing body at the lowest level of government with authority under State law. This authorization involves a resolution from the local authorities approving or denying the project. Local authorities must issue a resolution approving or denying a wind project within 120 days of the Market-Based Rate application filing. Failure to do so results in the project obtaining Local Approval Authorization. The applicant must notify the authorities on the day of filing. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must be notified of a wind project's approval or denial by local authorities within 10 days of filing the Market-Based Rate application. If the project is denied by local authorities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will not issue Market-Based Rate Authority. In this subsection, the term \"viewshed\" refers to the area within 20 miles of a State's boundary. If an offshore windmill project is within the viewshed of an adjacent State, the adjacent State can deem it inconsistent with their development plan under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. If a State makes this determination, the project must cease. A Highly Scenic Area includes offshore areas and UNESCO World Heritage Sites. A Qualified Wind Project is any above-water wind-turbine project located in a Highly Scenic Area or within 20 miles of the boundaries of a designated World Heritage Site, Armed Forces base, or nominated area for UNESCO recognition. Before issuing Exempt-Wholesale Generator Status, Market-Based Rate Authority, or Qualified Facility rate schedule to a Qualified Wind Project, an environmental impact statement must be completed within 12 months of application. The statement should include a cumulative impacts analysis addressing visual impacts and avian mortality. Qualified Wind Projects are not eligible for Federal tax credits. The section on Federal tax credit will expire 7 years after the enactment of the Act. It does not prevent environmental review of wind projects on a State or local level."
