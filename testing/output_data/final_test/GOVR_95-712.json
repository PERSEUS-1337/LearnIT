Recent interest in a broad-based guest worker program has renewed efforts to amend the H-2A program. The debate over an agricultural guest worker program focuses on the supply of workers in the U.S. and the temporary admission of aliens for seasonal farm jobs. Some farmers argue that importing foreign workers for seasonal farm jobs does not harm domestic workers as they do not compete for the same jobs. They claim that domestic workers are unwilling to perform the labor-intensive farm tasks, preferring nonfarm jobs that are less strenuous and more stable. Growers advocate for access to foreign labor to meet the demand for perishable crops during peak harvest seasons. Opponents of temporary alien worker programs argue that reliance on foreign labor for seasonal farm jobs could lead to higher consumer prices, increased dependency on low-wage foreign competitors, and hinder the employment prospects of domestic workers. They believe that raising wages and improving working conditions for domestic workers would attract more individuals to seasonal farm employment, reducing the need for foreign labor and promoting innovation in the agricultural sector. Opponents of temporary alien worker programs argue that growers prefer foreign over domestic workers due to lower wages, lack of legal protections, and easier control. The debate centers on whether admitting foreign workers reduces wages and employment for U.S. workers. Economic theory clarifies the debate on wages and employment of domestic workers. The labor market equilibrium is at point A, where supply equals demand at wage W1. The addition of foreign workers shifts the supply curve to S2, expanding the total labor quantity at any wage rate. After the importation of foreign workers, the labor market equilibrium shifts to point B, where the wage rate drops to W2. Total employment expands, with domestic employment decreasing and alien worker employment increasing. The theory of supply and demand predicts a decrease in wages from W1 to W2, leading some domestic workers to seek jobs outside the farm sector. The presence of foreign farm workers (E2) leads to a decline in domestic farm worker employment (E3), known as the displacement effect. This shift in labor market equilibrium results in lower wages (W2) for domestic workers, but also benefits consumers with lower agricultural prices. The H-2A program, established in 1952, allows foreign workers to fill seasonal farm jobs in the U.S. East Coast growers of perishable crops were the original applicants. Despite criticisms of the Bracero program, the H-2A program has seen an increase in worker certifications. The H-2A program, established in 1952, allows foreign workers to fill seasonal farm jobs in the U.S. Despite increases in worker certifications, the program's overall impact on the domestic farm labor force remains minimal. However, in some states, growers rely on the program, which may have a more substantial effect on domestic farm workers in certain local labor markets. Some proposals aim to make it easier for growers to employ foreign workers temporarily. The Bracero program allowed Mexican workers to take temporary jobs in the U.S. agricultural industry, with potential impacts on domestic farm workers. Studies have examined the program's effects on wage and employment levels of hired farm labor, showing consistency with economic theory. The Bracero program increased total farm employment, reduced employment of domestic farm workers, and lowered the farm wage rate. Non-bracero farm workers experienced a wage loss of 6-7% of total wages paid, benefiting U.S. farmers who were able to hire 120,000 more workers at lower wages. Braceros were seen as a substitute for mechanization, particularly in High Plains cotton, and the end of the program accelerated the mechanization of Texas cotton. The mechanization of Texas cotton and the widespread use of the tomato harvester in California marked a period of change in agriculture. Wise and Mason studied the impact of raising wages on domestic farm workers. They found that a small increase in wages led to a larger increase in the supply of domestic labor for crops like winter melons and strawberries. These findings challenge the belief that higher agricultural wages would not attract more domestic workers, especially in the mid-to-late 1960s. The termination of the Bracero program led to a decrease in total employment, an increase in U.S. farm worker employment, and higher wages on strawberry and melon farms in California. Without bracero labor, domestic farm worker employment in California would have been significantly higher, and wages would have also increased. The absence of bracero labor contributed to a significant rise in farm wages in Michigan as well. The end of the Bracero program did not significantly impact farm wages in four southwestern states between 1954-1964 and 1965-1977. The replacement of braceros with unauthorized aliens may have kept the labor supply stable. Overall, the program expanded temporary farm labor but reduced wages and employment for domestic farm workers."
