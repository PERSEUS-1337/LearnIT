Retailers must inform consumers of the country of origin of covered commodities at the final point of sale. A covered commodity can only be designated as having a United States country of origin if it meets specific criteria, such as being exclusively born, raised, and slaughtered in the United States for beef, lamb, and pork. The country of origin labeling requirements specify that for a covered commodity to be designated as having a United States origin, it must meet specific criteria such as being exclusively produced in the United States, including being born, raised, and slaughtered in the country for animals like beef, lamb, and pork. This also applies to farm-raised fish that must be hatched, raised, harvested, and processed in the United States, and wild fish that must be harvested in the U.S. or its territories for river, stream, or lake fish, or by U.S. documented vessels for sea fish. Additionally, perishable agricultural commodities and peanuts must be exclusively produced in the United States. The country of origin labeling requirements distinguish between wild fish and farm-raised fish. Food service establishments are exempt from these requirements if the commodity is prepared or served in normal retail quantities. The required information may be provided to consumers through labels or visible signs at the final point of sale. The country of origin labeling requirements apply to commodities at the final point of sale to consumers. Retailers do not need to provide additional information if the commodity is already labeled. The Secretary can use existing records to verify compliance, and suppliers must provide information on the country of origin. The business supplying covered commodities to retailers must indicate the country of origin. The Secretary will implement a self-certification program for producers to certify the origin of commodities. Third-party audits of producer compliance with country of origin labeling are prohibited, with verification methods in place. The Secretary will verify producer compliance with country of origin requirements using Department of Agriculture records and producer records. Retailers cannot require producers to indemnify them for violations or provide documentation for the origin of beef, lamb, or pork. The Secretary will verify compliance with country of origin requirements for beef, lamb, or pork, as well as live cattle, hogs, or sheep. \"SEC. 283. ENFORCEMENT.\" Section 283 outlines the enforcement measures for violations of the subtitle. If a retailer violates section 282, they will be given a 30-day warning period to comply. If the violation is willful, the Secretary may impose a civil penalty after a hearing. The Secretary can assess a civil penalty of $100 for the first day of a violation, doubling each subsequent day up to a maximum of $5,000. Adulteration and misbranding due to noncompliance with country of origin requirements are exempt from penalties under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The Secretary must establish regulations by September 30, 2004, to implement this subtitle, with a focus on partnering with states for enforcement. The subtitle applies to the retail sale of covered commodities starting on September 30, 2004."
