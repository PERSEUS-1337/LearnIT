    "content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is proposing to require event data recorders (EDRs) on all new passenger vehicles sold in the United States. EDRs, also known as \"black boxes,\" are already installed voluntarily by manufacturers in over 90% of new cars and light trucks to capture crash data. The proposed regulation would make EDRs mandatory without changing the information they collect. EDRs have been used in aircraft and railroad locomotives for decades. The mandatory installation of Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in passenger cars has been controversial in Congress due to concerns about driver privacy. While legislators recognize the devices' safety value, Congress declined to mandate EDRs in new passenger vehicles in 2012. A proposal to limit access to EDR data was ordered to be reported by the Senate Commerce Committee in April 2014. Event Data Recorders (EDRs) provide technical information about a vehicle's operational performance during a crash. EDRs have evolved over the past 40 years, with early versions using analog signal processing. The engine control unit (ECU) is a key component in the electronics system, collecting and analyzing engine operation data to improve fuel economy. The ECU collects data on engine operation to improve fuel economy, while EDRs record variables like spark advance. EDRs have expanded to include diagnostic components for storing data on detected problems, aiding mechanics in addressing vehicle performance issues. The EDR, typically installed under a front seat or in the center console, is crucial in recording accident data from sensors or vehicle networks. Passenger vehicle EDRs, located within airbag electronic controllers, use crash-sensing algorithms to determine airbag deployment and record pre-crash data. NHTSA regulations require recording 15 data elements during a crash, but manufacturers may collect additional data like seat positions and occupant weights. The proposed regulations mandate recording crash data in EDRs, with NHTSA specifying intervals for data collection. Data stored is limited by sensor memory, cannot be altered, except for near-deployments. EDRs are connected to other sensors, replacing data every five seconds. Recent data is retained during airbag deployment, retrievable via cable or OBD-II port. The EDR in passenger vehicles collects limited information compared to other transportation vehicles. It does not have voice recording capabilities and stores data related to accidents. Law enforcement agencies use EDR data to determine accident causes, and automakers use it to understand vehicle performance. The EDR in passenger vehicles collects data related to accidents, used by automakers and law enforcement to understand crash causes and improve vehicle safety. NHTSA and NTSB have recommended greater use of EDRs for highway safety. The NTSB recommended that NHTSA pursue crash information gathering using EDRs and develop a plan with manufacturers to gather better crash data. NHTSA later established an EDR working group to improve highway safety through occupant protection systems. The EDR working group recommended that EDR systems should capture crash-related data for vehicles, improve driver awareness, and integrate with other vehicle electronics for early crash notification. NHTSA was already using EDR data in its research databases, but most EDR systems were proprietary to manufacturers for data analysis. NHTSA proposed its first EDR regulation in 2004, with the final regulation issued in 2006. The regulation did not mandate EDRs in vehicles but aimed to standardize data collection for future use and improve automatic crash notification. The crash notification regulation for light vehicles with EDRs sold after September 2012 requires standard data elements, specific technical requirements for data recording intervals, crash survivability testing, availability of tools for data retrieval, and public awareness through owner's manuals. The 2006 regulation set data element requirements, leading to the need for a new rulemaking. NHTSA proposed a new rule in December 2012 to mandate EDR installation in all light vehicles sold in the US after September 1, 2014. The rule would not change the 2006 standard's data collection requirements. NHTSA estimated that 8% of new light vehicles lack EDR technology and manufacturers would not voluntarily install them without regulation. NHTSA proposed a new rule in December 2012 to mandate EDR installation in all light vehicles sold in the US after September 1, 2014. Upgrading the regulation to a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard would improve vehicle safety for consumers and allow for enforcement options. The new regulation would affect more expensive vehicles with advanced safety systems, gathering information on their performance in accidents for potential safety improvements. The federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) does not protect information collected by Event Data Recorders (EDRs). State laws clarify that EDR data is owned by the vehicle owner and can be accessed with consent, court order, for vehicle safety, repair purposes, or by emergency personnel. NHTSA set minimum EDR data requirements in 2006. NHTSA declined manufacturers' request to explicitly state that the rule preempted state and local regulations, citing general principles of preemption law. State laws conflicting with EDR regulations would be preempted due to the significant costs and injuries caused by vehicle crashes in the United States. Crash analyses are crucial for preventing future accidents. Crash analysis is challenging due to factors like heavy traffic, night-time crashes, and inclement weather. Investigators face pressure to clear scenes quickly and may not be able to interview participants or witnesses. EDR data is useful in analyzing crashes by providing specific information on factors like vehicle speed and brake application. EDR data collected from thousands of actual vehicle crashes annually provides valuable information on crash sequences, helping improve vehicle safety performance and inform traffic safety policies. For example, EDR data was instrumental in analyzing the unintended acceleration issue with Toyota vehicles in 2009 and 2010. EDRs can help in crash investigations by providing reliable data, preventing fraud, and potentially tying premiums to driving habits. Insurers are exploring \"usage based insurance\" using EDRs and telematics devices for accurate documentation of driving habits. Insurance companies are considering using EDR data to assess driver safety and offer discounts. Some states prohibit insurers from accessing EDR data without consent. Concerns about privacy and potential for increased data collection exist. Advances in technology allow for greater data collection through EDRs, which can collect more data than required by NHTSA. Concerns about personal privacy stem from the misconception that EDRs may record audio and location information. Critics argue that mandatory EDRs could track every aspect of a driver's movements, not just driving habits. The NHTSA has concerns about crash-related data collected from privately owned vehicles being used against the owner. While NHTSA itself cannot disclose personal identifiers, other entities like insurance companies or salvage yards can access a car's data. EDR data used by NHTSA does not raise privacy concerns as it does not collect information that identifies an individual. The vehicle identification number (VIN) can only identify the owner, not the driver, if linked to a vehicle registration database. The NHTSA's proposed EDR rule would require vehicle owner's manuals to include a statement about the purpose of EDRs. State legislation on EDR data ownership varies, allowing access to data in certain circumstances without the owner's permission. Insurance policies may transfer ownership of EDR data to the insurer in case of a significant claim. Access to EDR data can be allowed without the owner's consent for safety research, vehicle servicing, and by court order in some states. Auto insurance policies may require cooperation with investigations, including access to EDR data. Vehicles with Advanced Automatic Crash Notification systems can transmit EDR information to a central location in the event of a crash. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is collaborating with vehicle manufacturers and third parties to develop connected vehicle technologies for continuous transmission of EDR data. This system allows vehicles to communicate with each other and roadside infrastructure to enhance traffic flow and minimize collision risks. However, there are concerns about potential security breaches by hackers accessing wireless data exchanges among vehicles. Manufacturers expanding EDR data collection beyond NHTSA requirements could lead to the data becoming commercially valuable for various vehicle information, unrelated to crashes. Some drivers may even desire to share this data with selected individuals. Auto makers are allowing software developers to access data from cars, such as fuel economy, to create apps that track gas mileage for each trip. Privacy concerns regarding data not shared with NHTSA fall outside their legal authority. NHTSA can prevent commercial entities from disabling required safety features. Some privacy advocates suggest EDRs should have an off switch. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers issued the first universal standard for EDR technology in 2004. IEEE issued the first universal standard for EDR technology in 2004, known as IEEE Standard 1616, to set performance standards for memory devices in vehicles. In 2010, they introduced Standard 1616a, which includes a lockout system to prevent unauthorized access and protect data integrity. This measure aims to address concerns about privacy, data tampering, odometer fraud, and VIN theft, ensuring the long-term acceptance of EDR technology by motorists. IEEE issued standards for EDR technology in 2004 and updated them in 2010 to address privacy and data integrity concerns. In a letter to NHTSA, IEEE emphasized the importance of public acceptance for EDRs. Concerns over public acceptance could impact sales and limit data collection for research purposes. Legislators have been addressing ownership and privacy issues related to EDR data since 2004. Bills introduced in Congress require auto dealers to disclose EDR presence in new vehicles. Auto dealers must disclose the presence of Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in new vehicles, along with the type of information collected and its potential use by law enforcement. EDR-equipped vehicles cannot be sold unless owners can disable the devices. The Federal Trade Commission would enforce violations of EDR provisions, deemed unfair or deceptive acts. NHTSA would study and report to Congress on the benefits and consequences of EDR technology. A 2012 vote on a related proposal was supported by Representative Landry and Representative Rahall. The Landry amendment, proposed by Representative Landry and supported by Representative Rahall, aimed to prohibit the use of funds for developing regulations mandating recording technology on vehicles. It argued against the Department of Transportation's plan to electronically monitor vehicle movements with devices similar to airplane black boxes. The amendment was not enacted due to the Senate's failure to pass a comparable transportation appropriation bill in 2012. In 2010, bills were introduced in Congress to mandate the use of Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in all new passenger vehicles by 2015 and in medium and heavy-duty vehicles by 2017. These bills also proposed the establishment of a Council for Vehicle Electronics, Vehicle Software, and Emerging Technologies within NHTSA. Despite being reported by committees, the bills were not passed. Additional bills in the 111th Congress included provisions for a phased-in approach for EDRs in passenger automobiles, a universal data retrieval method, and an EDR database for research and analysis. The 2010 proposal to mandate Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in all new passenger cars by 2015 was incorporated into the surface transportation reauthorization bill, S. 1813, which passed the Senate in 2012. The bill stipulated that EDR data is owned by the car owner, required a safety and privacy impact assessment within two years of enactment, and did not pass in the House. The transportation bill, H.R. 4348, did not include EDR provisions or the Council on Vehicle Electronics. The law enacted as MAP-21 established a Council for Vehicle Electronics to examine safety standards for electronic systems in passenger vehicles. Representative Capuano introduced H.R. 2414 in the 113th Congress, requiring manufacturers to disclose EDR presence in new cars. The legislation regarding Event Data Recorders (EDRs) addresses the control and ownership of data recorded by EDRs in vehicles. It prohibits the sale of vehicles after 2015 unless owners can control the data recording. The bill states that EDR data is the vehicle owner's property and can only be accessed with consent, court order, or by a repair technician. The Driver Privacy Act aims to limit access to EDR data to the vehicle owner or lessee, with exceptions for authorized access by judicial or administrative authorities. The bill allows for the use of Event Data Recorders (EDRs) in vehicles for various purposes, with consent required for data access. NHTSA is required to study EDR data retention time and issue regulations within two years. A House amendment prohibits federal funds from enforcing EDR regulations and GPS tracking mandates. Representative Yoho believes vehicle owners should own data collected by event data recorders, opposing the use of federal funds for GPS tracking mandates."
