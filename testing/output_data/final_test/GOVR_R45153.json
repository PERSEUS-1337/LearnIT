    "content": "For decades, lawyers have debated the scope of a hypothetical law prohibiting vehicles in the park. The rule seems straightforward, but questions arise about whether it includes bicycles, strollers, or service vehicles. The complexity of enforcing this law is highlighted by scenarios like a city bringing in a WWII truck for a memorial. Justifying restrictions on vehicles like a minivan full of soccer players would require careful legal interpretation. The challenges of statutory interpretation arise from the inherent difficulties of language, where the meaning of words can change over time and depend on context. Even seemingly unambiguous statutory provisions can pose significant difficulties when applied in real-world scenarios. Justice Felix Frankfurter described the problem as rooted in the nature of words as inexact symbols of meaning. Statutes are often written in general terms, leading to ambiguity and difficulty in applying them to specific situations. This ambiguity may be intentional to address unforeseen circumstances or delegate interpretive authority. Vague language can also result from compromise or lack of anticipation by the enacting legislature. Statutes are often ambiguous, leading judges to interpret the law. Judicial pronouncements on statutes are final unless Congress amends the law. Judges view their role as subordinate to Congress, with purposivism and other theories guiding statutory interpretation. The two main theories of statutory interpretation are purposivism and textualism, with judges using various tools to determine Congress's intended meaning. Understanding these theories is crucial for effective legislation, as judicial opinions shape how statutes are implemented. Congress can reduce ambiguity by knowing how courts interpret statutory text. By drafting statutory text according to predominant legal theories, Congress can reduce ambiguity and better communicate policy choices to courts and the public. Understanding the ongoing debate over statutory interpretation is crucial for Members of Congress to participate meaningfully in discussions on how courts interpret statutes. This report provides an overview of how courts interpret statutory language, discussing the goals, approaches, theories, and tools used in statutory interpretation. Courts resolve legal disputes by interpreting statutes, regulations, and common law principles. When interpreting statutes, courts focus on giving effect to the intent of Congress rather than applying equity or natural justice. Judges aim to act as faithful agents of Congress and not substitute their policy views for legislative intent. This approach is rooted in the belief of legislative supremacy. The evolution of statutory interpretation in U.S. courts is reviewed, noting various schools of legal thought that influenced modern legal theory. Judges must remain faithful to what the legislature enacted, rooted in the belief of legislative supremacy. In the early years of legal thinking in the United States, natural law and formalism influenced the development of modern legal theory. Natural law posited that judges should conform man-made law to objectively correct principles derived from human nature or divine justice. Formalism, on the other hand, believed that the correct outcome of a case could be deduced scientifically from fundamental principles of common law. Natural law and formalism believed in finding the one correct answer to legal questions based on fundamental common-law principles. Both theories saw judges and legislators as engaged in the same process of discovering this answer. Proponents of natural law and formalism argue that courts do not need to defer to the legislature if they can determine the correct answer to a legal question. This belief led to the idea that judges could interpret laws based on general principles of justice or logic. However, the school of legal realism, which emerged in the early 20th century, challenged these theories. The school of legal realism emerged in the early 20th century, questioning traditional assumptions and calling for judges to justify their rulings more self-consciously. Legal realists applied insights from sociology and psychology to judicial decision-making, leading to the recognition that judges sometimes make law instead of just discovering it. This realization highlighted the need for judges to openly justify the law they announce in any given case, especially in the field of statutory interpretation. In response to legal realism, legal scholars and judges emphasized the distinction between the law-making role of the legislature and the law-interpreting role of the court, with \"law\" being defined as the statute passed by Congress. Judges recognized that the Constitution limits judicial discretion by assigning lawmaking to Congress, leading them to view their role as merely translating legislative commands. Justice Frankfurter emphasized the importance of legislative supremacy in a democracy, stating that courts should interpret the law as intended by lawmakers. This principle is now widely accepted, guiding modern purposivism and textualism. Some legal scholars and judges, however, did not fully embrace this view in response to legal realism. Legal scholars and judges reacted to legal realism by emphasizing legislative supremacy in statutory interpretation. Some argued that judges should openly embrace their role in making good law, pointing out that the Constitution grants them the power of interpretation. This school of thought, led by scholars like William Eskridge, believes that judges have a duty to shape the law through interpretation, separate from statutory enactment by Congress. Eskridge's theory of \"pragmatic dynamism\" is seen as a revival of the natural law tradition. Eskridge's theory of \"pragmatic dynamism\" is a revival of the natural law tradition, emphasizing judges' active role in interpreting statutes. Judge Calabresi and Judge Posner also advocate for judges to consider practical consequences and their own intuitions in statutory interpretation. The two main theories today are purposivism and textualism, both aiming to faithfully interpret statutes enacted by Congress. This belief is rooted in the Constitution's grant of legislative supremacy. The goal of statutory interpretation is to determine the objective intent of Congress, as the actual legislative intent is often unknowable. Purposivists and textualists have different views on how to achieve this objective intent, based on their beliefs about the institutional competence of the courts. The key to good government is determining which institutions should make decisions and how they should interrelate. Purposivists and textualists have different views on statutory interpretation, advocating different modes of interpretation based on their beliefs about advancing the will of the legislature. Purposivists argue that judges should construe statutes to execute legislative purpose by focusing on the problem Congress was trying to solve. Purposivists believe judges should interpret statutes to execute legislative purpose by focusing on how Congress works and the problem it aims to solve. They argue for a benevolent presumption that legislators are reasonable, but this should not apply if the text clearly indicates otherwise. Purposivists argue that judges should consider how Congress communicates its purposes through text and legislative history to preserve the integrity of legislation. They believe in interpreting statutes based on the policy context to understand what a reasonable legislator intended to achieve. This approach promotes comity with the legislative branch and helps in reaching the correct result. Purposivists believe in interpreting statutes based on the policy context to understand Congress's purpose and promote consistency in judicial decisions. They argue that judges should consider legislative history to achieve coherence and workability in applying the law. Critics, however, question the feasibility of finding a single legislative intent and argue against judges determining legislative purpose. Critics of purposivism argue that judges may struggle to understand the complex legislative processes that influence enacted laws, as legislative history can be unreliable and contradictory. They also claim that purposivism can be easily manipulated to ignore the text of a statute. In contrast, textualists prioritize the words of a statute, believing that courts should interpret them as an ordinary Member of Congress would. They focus on the text's meaning and its relationship to the body of law, caring about statutory purpose only to a certain extent. Textualists prioritize the words of a statute, believing that judges should interpret them as an ordinary Member of Congress would. They focus on the text alone, believing that following rules that prioritize the statutory text best respects legislative supremacy. Textualists argue that judges should prioritize the words of a statute and interpret them as an ordinary Member of Congress would, focusing on the text alone to best respect legislative supremacy. They seek evidence of the statute's \"semantic context\" to determine its meaning and generally avoid using legislative history. Critics of textualism argue that it is a formalistic approach to interpreting statutory text that ignores courts' interpretive authority under the Constitution. They claim that Congress expects judges to consider legislative processes and the law's purpose when applying statutes, making evidence of a statute's purpose more constraining on judges than just considering the text alone. The Supreme Court case of Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy involved a dispute over whether the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act authorized the compensation of expert fees. Justice Alito, in a textualist opinion, concluded that the Act did not allow for such compensation. The Supreme Court case of Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy involved a dispute over whether the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act authorized the compensation of expert fees. The majority opinion rejected the parents' arguments for awarding expert fees, emphasizing that the provision only allows for \"reasonable attorneys' fees\" and not expert fees. Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion took a purposivist approach, arguing that expert fees should be included in the term \"costs\" based on Congress's intent and the Act's goals. Justice Breyer disagreed with the majority opinion in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy, arguing that expert fees should be included in the term \"costs\" under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. He emphasized the Act's purpose of ensuring quality education for children with disabilities and considered the legislative history as evidence of the statute's meaning. Breyer's approach combined elements of purposivism and textualism, showing that the theoretical gap between the two theories may be narrowing. In NLRB v. SW General, the Supreme Court considered statutory interpretation regarding federal employees serving as \"acting officers.\" The majority opinion, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, took a textualist approach, analyzing the statutory text and relevant sources to determine the statute's meaning. The case highlighted the increasing similarities between textualists and purposivists in Supreme Court decisions. Chief Justice John Roberts primarily takes a textualist approach in interpreting the disputed statute, focusing on the statutory text, grammar, and context. The Court emphasizes key words in the provision and rejects the need for extra-textual evidence like legislative history. Ultimately, the Court finds the text clear and does not consider additional evidence compelling. In SW General, the Court evaluated and rejected evidence as \"not compelling.\" The majority held that the acting officer's service violated the statute. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the statute should be interpreted differently based on textual canons and historical executive department practices. The dissent used legislative history to support its interpretation. The dissent in SW General used legislative history to inform its understanding of the statute, reaching a different conclusion from the majority opinion. The dissent represents a more purposivist view of the case, focusing on the statutory text. The judge's choice of interpretive tools can influence the case outcome, as seen in SW General and Arlington Central School District. The textualist majority opinion in SW General, like in Arlington Central School District, emphasized the disfavor of legislative history. The majority opinion in SW General emphasized the disfavor of legislative history in statutory interpretation, giving less weight to this tool compared to the dissenting opinion. Judges use various interpretive tools such as ordinary meaning, statutory context, canons of construction, legislative history, and evidence of statute implementation. These tools can overlap and influence the way a judge resolves a dispute. Some theories of statutory interpretation suggest that judges should rarely rely on legislative history, influencing the tools they use. Judges may interpret the same evidence differently, but in practice, they use various tools to determine the meaning of a statute. Courts typically start by seeking the ordinary meaning of the text, assuming Congress uses common words in their popular sense. Justice Scalia, for example, discussed the interpretation of the term \"use\" in a case involving a gun. Justice Scalia, in a dissenting opinion on a case about the use of a gun, argued that using an instrumentality typically means using it for its intended purpose. The Supreme Court seeks a word's natural meaning, but this presumption can be challenged if there is evidence of a specialized legal or field-specific meaning. Judges can use various materials to determine a text's ordinary meaning, sometimes relying on simple introspection. Judges determine a text's ordinary meaning through simple introspection, dictionaries, books like Moby Dick or the Bible, and legal materials. The principle of giving words their \"usual\" meaning is widely accepted by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court members regularly use the rule of ordinary meaning to interpret statutes, aiming to align with Congress and the public's understanding. While there is consensus on the rule's validity, disputes can arise in its application. The ordinary meaning of a term may seem clear in some cases, but debates can still occur. Some critics argue that judges may use the \"ordinary meaning\" standard to hide their own policy preferences, as it allows them to rely on their personal experiences as English speakers. This can lead to disputes in interpreting statutory terms, especially when the court is dealing with non-prototypical examples. When interpreting statutory terms, judges must justify assertions about the ordinary meaning of a term to avoid vulnerability to attack. Courts interpret words in the context of the full statutory scheme and may look to other provisions for clarification. The meaning of a term can be illuminated by looking at how it is used in similar provisions elsewhere in the law. Statutory context can provide evidence of semantic context when interpreting terms in a statute. Courts may consider how a term is used in other provisions of the same statute to determine its meaning. This can help avoid ambiguity and ensure consistent interpretation. In Smith v. United States, the Supreme Court had to decide if a sentence enhancement applied to a defendant who offered to trade a gun for cocaine during a drug trafficking offense. The Court disagreed with the defendant's argument that the enhancement should only apply when a firearm is used as a weapon, not when used to barter for drugs. The Court considered how Congress used the term \"use\" in other provisions of the statute, finding it relevant to the case. The Court in Smith v. United States considered how Congress used the term \"use\" in other provisions of the statute, finding it relevant to the case of a sentence enhancement for offering to trade a gun for cocaine during a drug trafficking offense. Congress used the phrase \"involved in\" instead of \"use\" in a different provision, showing a distinction in language for different scenarios involving firearms. According to the majority opinion, Congress viewed guns as items of commerce that could be used by trading them. Statutory context helps courts understand disputed terms and their purpose in the law. Judges consider practical consequences and statutory declarations of purpose to determine statutory meaning. This use of statutory context involves the debate between purposivism and textualism. Courts have developed canons of construction over time. Courts have developed canons of construction over time to guide the interpretation of statutes. These canons provide default assumptions about how Congress expresses meaning, but judges may choose not to apply them if not justified in a particular case. Some judges question the validity of these canons, leading to disagreements on their use. The Appendix in this report combines two prominent anthologies of canons of construction. The report's Appendix combines two prominent anthologies of canons of construction, listing widely accepted canons. Authors disagree on the validity of certain canons. The report describes canons generally, dividing them into semantic and substantive categories. Semantic canons focus on decoding legal language and are favored by textualists. They reflect grammar rules and may overlap with a provision's ordinary meaning. Some authors refer to the principle of giving words their ordinary meaning as a semantic canon. There are various semantic canons, including the \"grammatical 'rule of the last antecedent'\" which clarifies how limiting clauses should be interpreted. This is illustrated in a hypothetical scenario involving parental instructions to a teenage son. The last-antecedent canon clarifies how limiting clauses should be interpreted, as seen in a case involving parental instructions and a Supreme Court case on federal criminal statute interpretation. The Court applied the last-antecedent canon to interpret a limiting phrase in a list of predicate crimes, concluding it only applied to \"abusive sexual conduct.\" The dissent argued for the series-qualifier canon, claiming the phrase should apply to all terms in the list. The Court debated the application of different semantic canons in interpreting a statutory provision related to sexual abuse. The majority rejected the series-qualifier canon, arguing that the provision did not contain items typically listed together. They also discussed the rule against surplusage, emphasizing the need to give each word and clause of a statute operative effect. In Bailey v. United States, the Supreme Court analyzed a statute imposing a mandatory minimum sentence for using or carrying a firearm during a crime. The Court emphasized giving distinct meanings to each term in a statutory list to avoid redundancy. Judges have debated whether Congress intentionally uses redundant language or not. The substantive canons of statutory interpretation focus on legal consequences rather than just linguistic issues. They may tip the scale towards a particular result if a statute has multiple meanings, leading to judicial disagreement. The constitutional avoidance canon is an example of a substantive canon that can spark debate. The constitutional avoidance canon guides courts to interpret statutes in a way that avoids constitutional issues, even if it's not the most natural interpretation. For example, in Bond v. United States, the Supreme Court limited the broad language of a statute to prevent potential constitutional problems. The Court limited the broad language of a statute to avoid constitutional issues, deciding not to interpret it broadly to reach local crimes. Judges may disagree on alternative readings to avoid constitutional problems, but the constitutional-avoidance canon does not give courts the authority to rewrite statutes as they please. The canon of constitutional avoidance requires only a \"serious doubt\" about the constitutionality of an interpretation of a statute. Judges often disagree on how much doubt is needed to apply this canon. Disagreements also arise on the use of substantive canons to interpret statutes, both in theory and practice. The disagreement over the use of substantive canons to interpret statutes often stems from differing beliefs about their general justifications. Courts typically only apply these canons when a statute remains ambiguous after consulting other interpretive tools. Judges may choose not to apply a canon if they disagree with its justifications or believe they are not warranted in a particular case. Legal scholar Karl Llewellyn criticized the use of canons of construction in statutory interpretation, arguing that they were not useful due to their indeterminacy. He compiled a table showing opposing canons for every canon, leading some judges to question their effectiveness in choosing between competing canons. Some scholars and judges have challenged Llewellyn's list of canons of construction, questioning their validity and whether they truly represent contradictory rules. Textualists have defended the canons as sound interpretive conventions, but criticism has led judges to justify their use more diligently. Scholar Caleb Nelson categorizes canons into descriptive and justificatory groups based on their canonization justifications. The group of canons of construction can be categorized into descriptive and normative canons. Descriptive canons reflect broader language conventions, while normative canons are used primarily by lawyers for interpreting statutes. Courts may apply these canons for historical practice, good policy, or to limit judicial deference and promote predictability in decision-making. The canons of construction help judges interpret statutes, promoting predictability in decision-making. They act as guiding rules for judges to follow legislative intent, reflecting either drafting practices or background rules. The constitutional-avoidance canon is seen as respecting legislative supremacy, with some arguing that it ensures Congress upholds the Constitution. Others believe it represents a judicial policy judgment to minimize judicial interference. Some judges argue for caution in using canons of construction, warning they may not always reflect legislative drafting reality or respect legislative supremacy. Modern theory acknowledges that canons provide one indication of meaning, but their application is context-dependent. Judges view canons as rebuttable presumptions, weighing their application against statutory evidence. Judges may disagree on the application of canons of construction, which are viewed as rebuttable presumptions. The use of canons should be justified and is context-dependent. Some judges only turn to canons if other interpretive tools fail to resolve ambiguity. Justice Clarence Thomas, a textualist, sees canons as rules of thumb to determine legislation meaning. In a textualist opinion, Justice Thomas concluded that the canon against surplusage was inapplicable because the statutory text was clear. Justice Brennan argued against invoking the canon of constitutional avoidance, stating that the majority's alternative reading was not a \"fairly possible\" interpretation of the statute. He relied on the statute's legislative history to show that Congress intended to foreclose the majority opinion's construction. Judges may disagree on the appropriate application of canons and interpretive tools when resolving statutory ambiguities. Legislative history has been used when the text alone does not provide a clear answer. The Supreme Court's use of legislative history in United Steelworkers v. Weber to interpret Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a notable example. The Supreme Court in United Steelworkers v. Weber allowed a private employer to implement an affirmative action plan to increase black employees in a training program, despite potential discrimination against white employees. Justice Brennan used legislative history to justify this decision, stating that the goal of Title VII was to address racial injustice and promote diversity in the private sector. Justice Brennan used legislative history to support the private employer's affirmative action plan, which aimed to eliminate racial segregation and hierarchy. The use of legislative history in court decisions has sparked debate, with some arguing it should only be used when the statutory text is ambiguous. Judges may use legislative history to determine a statute's purpose, specialized meanings of terms, scope, and alignment with congressional intent. In FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., the Court reviewed the history of tobacco-specific legislation and the disputed provision in the agency's organic statute. In FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., the Court examined the disputed provision in the agency's organic statute, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC&A). Congress did not intend to grant the FDA broad authority to regulate tobacco products under the FDC&A. Purposivists and textualists may disagree on the use of legislative history in statutory interpretation. Defenders of legislative history argue that judges should respect Congress's processes and pay attention to materials used in the lawmaking process. Textualists, like Justice Scalia, object to using legislative history as it assumes intent over statutory text meaning. They believe judges should not elevate background purposes over the clear text. Textualists oppose using legislative history in interpreting laws, arguing that the text itself is the law enacted by Congress. They believe relying on legislative history is inappropriate and unreliable, as it may not accurately reflect the full Congress's understanding of the statute. Justice Scalia has emphasized the limited value of legislative intent found in sources consulted by courts. Textualists criticize the use of legislative history in interpreting laws, citing concerns about its reliability and potential for manipulation. Despite these criticisms, some judges still find value in examining legislative history in more nuanced ways. Courts review legislative history in conjunction with other interpretive tools. Some judges consider committee reports as a reliable source of legislative history, while floor debates are viewed as weaker indicators of a bill's meaning. Courts give weight to legislative history, including amendments to a statute, as it provides insight into congressional deliberation. Amending a statute is seen as a strong indicator of legislative intent, with the Supreme Court presuming that amendments have a significant impact on the statute's meaning. Understanding a statute's evolution through its amendment history can be crucial in interpreting its meaning, sometimes even outweighing other evidence. Additionally, courts analyze how a statute functions to determine the problem Congress aimed to solve when enacting it. Courts assess how a statute works by examining the problem Congress intended to address and how they did so. Practical consequences are considered, aligning with dynamic theories of interpretation. Administrative agencies often interpret statutes first, resolving questions to implement the statutory scheme. When courts interpret a statutory scheme, they may consider agency interpretations to understand how the statute works and the problem Congress intended to address. This use of agency interpretation is different from Chevron deference, which gives special weight to official agency interpretations. The court gives weight to an agency's interpretation of a statute when it is silent or ambiguous. This is known as Chevron deference. Even outside of Chevron deference, courts may consider agency interpretations as evidence of a statute's meaning. Legal scholars Hart and Sacks suggest that popular constructions of a statute, especially those seen in law implementation, should be given special consideration. Legal scholars argue that the implementation of a law provides evidence of how people have acted based on their understanding of the statute, even if it goes against their own interests. They suggest that interpreters should give weight to actions taken by those required to make initial decisions under the law. This aligns with the rationale for Chevron deference, where courts defer to agency interpretations due to their expertise and Congress assigning them implementation authority. Despite this, judges regularly consider agency interpretations in their decisions. Judges may reject agency interpretations if they conflict with the statute's text or other strong evidence of its meaning. They may also use their own understanding to interpret the statute. Textualists, who typically oppose consequentialist reasoning, sometimes consider policy consequences in evaluating interpretations. Courts may reject an interpretation if it undermines the statute's purpose, even if it aligns with the text. Judges also consider administrability and policy concerns to limit a statute's reach. In King v. Burwell, the Supreme Court departed from the natural reading of a statutory phrase in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to determine the availability of tax credits in States with a Federal Exchange. The Court considered the broader statutory context to interpret the provision. The Supreme Court in King v. Burwell departed from a strict textualist approach to interpret the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Court considered the Act's broader context and the potential impact of denying tax credits to individuals. Justice Scalia dissented, arguing that the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" should not include Federal Exchanges. The dissent in King v. Burwell criticized the majority for \"rewriting the law under the pretense of interpreting it.\" The majority justified their decision by stating that reliance on context was necessary to avoid calamitous results that Congress intended to prevent. The Court emphasized the importance of respecting the Legislature's role and not undoing their work. This case highlights the consideration of practical and policy consequences in statutory interpretation. Courts often consider pragmatic concerns when discussing interpretive tools, such as substantive canons that favor specific policy outcomes. The debate between purposivism and textualism revolves around the use of legislative history versus canons of construction. Recent scholarship questions the legitimacy of these tools and their implications for the theoretical differences between the two camps. Both purposivist and textualist judges aim to interpret the law effectively. Both purposivist and textualist judges aim to act as faithful agents of the legislature by seeking an objective legislative intent. While both agree that a statute's text is primary, they disagree on the types of context inherent in the text and which interpretive tools are necessary. Purposivists focus on legislative history to understand Congress's intent and how they achieved it. Many purposivists believe that \"reliable legislative history\" is a better constraint than judicially created canons to ensure a court's decision reflects \"what Congress had in mind.\" Textualists, on the other hand, focus on a statute's text to determine Congress's intent, doubting judges' capacity to discern a statute's purpose. Canons provide traditional background rules for legislative drafting. Textualists believe canons of construction impose greater constraint on judges than legislative history, despite doubts about discovering Congress's intent. Recent scholars argue the choice between legislative history and canons may not align with judges' legal philosophies. Anita Krishnakumar's study shows substantive canons have not replaced legislative history in modern Supreme Court decisions. Anita Krishnakumar's study found that while the use of legislative history has decreased since the Burger Court era, there has not been a corresponding increase in the use of substantive canons on the modern Supreme Court. Research on the Roberts Court showed that Justices regularly engage with both canons of construction and legislative history, indicating a continued reliance on both tools of interpretation. The study found that judges use interpretive tools like legislative history and canons, challenging the assumption that textualist judges use canons while purposivist judges use legislative history. Legal scholarship questions if these tools align with the goals set for them. Legal scholars have raised questions about judges' use of legislative history and statutes to interpret laws, suggesting that judges may need to adapt their methods to better reflect legislative intent. When judges consider a word's \"ordinary meaning,\" they often rely on their own interpretations, leading to debates about the constraints of this approach. Judges sometimes cite dictionaries to support their interpretations, but this may not always prove that a word's meaning is commonly used. Some scholars and judges use corpus linguistics to determine common meanings of statutory phrases, using large collections of language data. For example, in Muscarello v. United States, the Supreme Court searched newspaper databases to find sentences with disputed terms to interpret whether defendants had \"carried\" a firearm in a vehicle. In Muscarello v. United States, the Supreme Court used corpus linguistics to determine the common meaning of the term \"carry\" in relation to transporting firearms in a vehicle. The Court found that a significant number of results supported the interpretation of \"carry\" as referring to carrying a gun in a car, based on evidence from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). This linguistic evidence has been used in other court cases, such as FCC v. AT&T, to influence judicial opinions. The court used corpus linguistics to interpret the word \"information\" in a statute regarding statements from law enforcement officers in criminal proceedings. The court determined that \"information\" includes both true and false statements based on empirical data from the COCA. Some caution against judges relying on these databases, citing concerns about notice to litigants. Judges use corpus linguistics to understand how an ordinary person would interpret statutes for notice purposes. However, relying solely on corpus data may not align with the ordinary person's understanding, leading to notice concerns. Scholars challenge judicial assumptions about legislative drafting through empirical studies. Despite its limitations, corpus analysis cannot definitively determine the ordinary meaning of a word in a specific statute. Empirical studies of legislative drafting show that judges aim to interpret statutes as faithful agents of the legislature. Tools like canons and legislative history are used to mimic Congress's language and policy goals. Recent research by Gluck and Bressman surveyed congressional staffers to understand their awareness of judicial doctrines and compliance with them in drafting statutes. The study by Gluck and Bressman examined the awareness and use of statutory interpretation canons among legislative drafters. Findings showed varying levels of awareness, with drafters influenced by the concept of legislating within constitutional bounds. Additionally, drafters were familiar with the canon against surplusage but often erred on the side of redundancy. The study also explored the influence of judicial assumptions on legislative history use. The study by Gluck and Bressman found that both Members and staff valued legislative history as an important tool for legislative drafters and courts. Drafters believed it limited judicial discretion, with committee reports seen as the most reliable form of legislative history. However, some critics argue that the study may not provide a complete view of the federal lawmaking process. Textualist judges question the competence of courts to understand the complexities of federal lawmaking. The new empirical data may impact how judges use interpretive tools like ordinary meaning, canons, and legislative history in federal lawmaking. Purposivism and textualism aim to find the most reasonable meaning of a statute, rather than Congress's actual intent. Reform-minded scholars suggest that evidence of actual practice, such as linguistic corpora or legislative drafting practices, should not be dismissed by judges. Reform-minded scholars argue that judges should align their use of interpretive tools with how Congress generally uses words and achieves policy goals. They suggest using linguistic corpora and citing studies to refine statutory interpretation methods. Some judges, like Justice Elena Kagan, have used this new scholarship to reject certain canons and give special weight to committee reports. Textualist judges are also considering adjusting their approach to statutory interpretation in light of this new research. One textualist judge suggests shedding semantic canons that do not reflect the intended meaning of words. Further scholarship on legislative processes may influence how judges interpret statutes. Congress may need to understand court interpretive conventions for better drafting, but other factors also impact the drafting process. Courts shape statutory implementation, so Congress may need to consider these factors in drafting. The appendix presents a list of canons of construction from different works, with Justice Scalia and Bryan Garner taking a normative approach and law professor William Eskridge compiling canons invoked by the Supreme Court. This dialogue between courts and Congress can help ensure laws are applied consistently with drafters' intentions. The appendix compiles canons invoked by the Supreme Court from 1986 to 2014, without taking a position on their validity. It includes editorial choices to generalize and consolidate canons, omitting specific ones. The list aims to provide an overview of how courts interpret statutes, excluding canons representing substantive legal principles. Each canon is briefly described, citing applicable cases. The appendix compiles canons invoked by the Supreme Court from 1986 to 2014, without taking a position on their validity. It includes editorial choices to generalize and consolidate canons, omitting specific ones. The list aims to provide an overview of how courts interpret statutes, excluding canons representing substantive legal principles. Each canon is briefly described, citing applicable cases. The canons are listed in alphabetical order and include semantic canons like the \"Artificial-Person Canon\" and \"Casus Omissus.\" The canons of statutory construction provide guidelines for interpreting laws, such as the \"Expresio Unius\" canon which implies exclusion of other items not mentioned deliberately. The \"Gender/Number Canon\" states that masculine includes feminine and singular includes plural. The \"General/Specific Canon\" dictates that specific laws govern over general ones, and the \"General-Terms Canon\" gives general terms their general meaning. The canons of statutory construction provide guidelines for interpreting laws, including the \"Harmonious-Reading Canon\" which states that provisions should be interpreted in a way that is compatible, not contradictory. The \"Irreconcilability Canon\" dictates that if there are truly irreconcilable provisions at the same level of generality, neither should be given effect. Legislative history can provide clear evidence of congressional intent, with Committee Reports being the most authoritative source. Floor statements should be used cautiously. The canons of statutory construction provide guidelines for interpreting laws, including the \"Harmonious-Reading Canon\" and the \"Irreconcilability Canon.\" Legislative history can provide evidence of congressional intent, with Committee Reports being authoritative. The \"Mandatory/Permissive Canon,\" \"Nearest-Reasonable-Referent Canon,\" \"Noscitur a Sociis,\" and \"Ordinary Meaning Canon\" offer further guidance on interpreting statutory text. The \"Plain Meaning Rule and Absurdity Doctrine\" and \"Predicate-Act Canon\" also play a role in statutory interpretation. The canons of statutory construction provide guidelines for interpreting laws, including the \"Predicate-Act Canon\" which recognizes that authorization of an act also authorizes a necessary predicate act. Preambles, purpose clauses, titles, and headings are permissible indicators of meaning. Identical words in the same statute are presumed to have the same meaning, while a material variation suggests a variation in meaning. The term 'including' is illustrative, not all-embracing. The \"Presumption of Validity\" states that an interpretation that validates outweighs one that invalidates. Courts should interpret statutes to have effect, using canons such as the Proviso Canon, Punctuation Canon, Purposive Construction, Reddendo Singula Singulis, Rule Against Surplusage, and Rule of the Last Antecedent. The canons of statutory interpretation include the Scope-of-Subparts Canon, Series-Qualifier Canon, Subordinating/Superordinating Canon, Unintelligibility Canon, and Whole-Text Canon. These canons provide guidelines for interpreting statutes and resolving conflicts in the language used. The canons of statutory interpretation guide courts in interpreting statutes, including the Canon of Constitutional Avoidance, the \"Dog that Didn't Bark\" Presumption, Federalism Canons, and the principle of In Pari Materia. These canons help ensure statutes are interpreted in a way that avoids constitutional issues and maintains the federal-state balance. The canons of statutory interpretation guide courts in interpreting statutes, including the Canon of Constitutional Avoidance, the \"Dog that Didn't Bark\" Presumption, Federalism Canons, and the principle of In Pari Materia. These canons help ensure statutes are interpreted in a way that avoids constitutional issues and maintains the federal-state balance. In order to \"abrogate state sovereign immunity,\" courts should apply the Nondelegation Doctrine and the Penalty/Illegality Canon. The Mens Rea Canon presumes a culpable mental state in criminal statutes, and the Pending-Action Canon requires courts to apply new laws during ongoing lawsuits. The courts must apply new laws unless it violates the presumption against retroactivity. There are various other presumptions in statutory interpretation, such as against extraterritoriality, hiding elephants in mouseholes, implied repeals, and implied right of action. Courts should not imply a private remedy without clear congressional intent. Retroactive legislation is also disfavored. Presumptions in statutory interpretation include against retroactivity, waiver of sovereign immunity, retaining common law, favoring judicial process, continuity, and legislative acquiescence. Congress must provide clear statements for changes in legal rights and obligations. The presumption of legislative acquiescence applies to administrative and judicial interpretations of statutes. If Congress reenacts a statute without changes, it incorporates settled judicial constructions. Courts should interpret exceptions narrowly to preserve the primary operation of the provision and assume that statutory amendments have real effects. The repeal-of-repealer canon states that the repeal of a repealer should be given effect. Statutory amendments have real and substantial effects. The \"Repeal-of-Repealer Canon\" states that the repeal of a repealing statute does not reinstate the original statute. The \"Repealability Canon\" allows one legislature to repeal acts passed by a former legislature. The Rule of Lenity resolves ambiguity in statutes in favor of the defendant."
