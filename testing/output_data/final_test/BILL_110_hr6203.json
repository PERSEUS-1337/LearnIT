The Congress acknowledges the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease with age, making it the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 5.2 million individuals in the US have Alzheimer's, with projections estimating 11 to 16 million individuals over 65 will have the disease by 2050. By 2050, over 60% of individuals in the US with Alzheimer's will be 85 or older. Education level affects dementia risk, with those with fewer years at higher risk. Hispanics, the fastest-growing population, will see a six-fold increase in Alzheimer's by 2050. Hispanics may have a higher risk of developing dementia, with a 64% higher incidence of diabetes compared to non-Hispanic white Americans. Research on disparities in Alzheimer's risk factors between Hispanic and other ethnic groups is ongoing, revealing complex differences such as Caribbean Hispanics having a cumulative risk for Alzheimer's twice that of non-Hispanic whites, even without the APOE-e4 allele. Hispanics face challenges in Alzheimer's diagnosis due to a shortage of bilingual health professionals and inadequate translation of diagnostic tools. They are also more likely to be uninsured compared to other ethnic groups. Hispanics with dementia face barriers in accessing healthcare and are less likely to see a physician compared to non-Hispanics. They have a strong cultural commitment to caring for elders within the family, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Hispanic elders often live with their families instead of in long-term care facilities, which impacts family caregivers and Alzheimer's patients. Alzheimer's disease costs the United States $148 billion. Alzheimer's disease costs the United States $148 billion annually in direct and indirect expenses. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on NIH research and education on Alzheimer's disease. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will ensure resources for Alzheimer's disease research in Hispanic communities, including increasing efforts in epidemiological work, allocating resources to research centers for increased participation of Hispanics in clinical trials, and conducting research on reasons for delayed diagnosis in Hispanic individuals. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will expand efforts to educate communities about Alzheimer's disease research and address cultural concerns, especially regarding brain tissue and genetic information collection. Increased funding for Alzheimer's disease demonstration grants is proposed, with $25,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2009 and additional funding for the following years. The CDC will also focus on outreach and education regarding Alzheimer's disease. The section aims to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk by addressing vascular risk factors, promoting early diagnosis, and training public health personnel. The Secretary will conduct an education and outreach program through the CDC to raise awareness and reduce risks, consulting with State Health Departments and the Alzheimer's Association. The Secretary may consult with the Alzheimer's Association and other entities for education and outreach, with a focus on Hispanic populations."
