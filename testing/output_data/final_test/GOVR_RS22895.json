    "content": "Campaign-related activity by 527 groups has increased in recent election cycles. These groups fund communications discussing federal candidates' positions on public policy issues without explicitly advocating for or against a candidate. Some argue that these \"issue advocacy\" communications are not regulated by the FECA due to Supreme Court interpretations. In the late 1990s, the IRS issued rulings allowing some issue advocacy activities by 527 groups to qualify as tax-exempt under IRC \u00a7 527. These groups, also known as \"stealth PACs,\" were not regulated by the FEC and only had contact with the IRS for tax purposes. Congress amended IRC \u00a7 527 in 2000 and 2002 to require political organizations to report their activities. Section 527 political organizations, not regulated by the FEC, must report to the IRS within 24 hours of formation. They disclose contributors who gave at least $200 and expenditures to recipients of at least $500 annually. Exceptions exist for small organizations, state/local candidate committees, and political party committees. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 increased the prominence of 527 groups after eliminating unregulated money flow to political parties. FECA regulates political committees receiving or spending over $1,000, defining contributions and expenditures for influencing federal elections. Registered committees must adhere to contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure rules. IRC \u00a7 527 offers tax benefits to political organizations, including parties, committees, associations, or funds. The IRC defines \"political organizations\" as any group organized to influence elections at all levels, including state and local campaigns. This definition is broader than FECA's definition of \"political committees,\" which focus on federal election activities. The Supreme Court's campaign finance jurisprudence established constitutional limitations on Congress's regulation of election activity. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court defined \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" to include funds for express advocacy. They also defined \"political committee\" as organizations under candidate control or with the major purpose of candidate nomination or election. The Buckley Court established the \"major purpose test\" to determine if an organization is subject to regulation under FECA as a \"political committee\" based on fundraising and expenditures. The debate revolves around how to ascertain an organization's major purpose and which groups can be considered FECA-regulated \"political committees.\" Some argue that activities beyond express advocacy should be considered, while others believe that only organizations engaging in express advocacy should be regulated. The FEC regulation distinguishes political committees under FECA based on fundraising activities that include appeals to \"support or oppose\" federal candidates. This rule does not apply to \u00a7 527 political organizations under tax laws, which do not require explicit advocacy for or against candidates. The FEC regulation distinguishes political committees under FECA based on fundraising activities related to federal candidates. Organizations with $1,000 or more in contributions are subject to FECA regulation. The FEC acknowledged a failure to address when nonparty groups like 527s must register as political committees. \u00a7 527 status alone is not enough to determine political committee status under FECA. The FEC will continue to determine political committee status based on contributions and expenditures over $1,000 in a calendar year and whether the organization's \"major purpose\" was campaign activity. They will consider if solicitations resulted in contributions for supporting or opposing a federal candidate. The FEC enforces regulations on organizations that should be registered as political committees under FECA, regardless of tax status. In a significant 527 enforcement action in 2006, civil penalties were imposed on MoveOn.org Voter Fund, League of Conservation Voters 527, and Swiftboat Veterans and POWs for Truth for not registering as political committees. In the 110th Congress, the 527 Reform Act of 2007 aimed to amend FECA by defining \"political committee\" to include any group that has notified the IRS of its status as a \u00a7 527 political organization. Exceptions would be made for certain organizations, such as small groups and state/local candidate committees. The 527 Reform Act of 2007 aimed to amend FECA by defining \"political committee\" to include any group that has notified the IRS of its status as a \u00a7 527 political organization. Exceptions would be made for certain organizations, such as small groups and state/local candidate committees. Organizations spending over $1,000 on public communications supporting a federal candidate or voter drive efforts must meet strict criteria to be involved in non-federal election activities. The 527 Reform Act of 2007 aimed to amend FECA by defining \"political committee\" to include any group that has notified the IRS of its status as a \u00a7 527 political organization. It would have established allocation and funding rules for certain expenses related to federal and non-federal activities by political committees, with provisions for expedited judicial review and three-judge court hearings for constitutional challenges. The 527 Reform Act of 2007 aimed to amend FECA by defining \"political committee\" to include any group that has notified the IRS of its status as a \u00a7 527 political organization. This would require most 527s to register with the FEC as \"political committees,\" limiting their funding to federally regulated hard money contributions for advertisements related to federal candidates. Litigation over the constitutionality of this requirement was likely, as some interpret Supreme Court precedent to restrict regulation to organizations engaging in express advocacy. Legislation regulating 527 organizations has not yet been introduced in the 111th Congress."
