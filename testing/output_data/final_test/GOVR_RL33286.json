    "content": "On June 24, 2005, the Federal Railroad Administration's Rule on the Use of Locomotive Horns at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings went into effect, requiring train horns to be sounded at public crossings unless safety measures compensate for the horn's absence. The rule was implemented from a congressional mandate and exempted the Chicago region pending further analysis of accident data. The FRA train horn rule preempted existing state and local whistle bans, allowing communities to establish \"quiet zones\" where locomotive horns can be banned if safety measures are in place. Collisions at highway-rail at-grade crossings account for nearly 40% of all railroad-related deaths in the United States. Reducing injuries and deaths from grade-crossing collisions has been a federal concern for decades, with over $4.1 billion provided by Congress since 1974 for grants to states. This funding has led to the installation of 30,000 active warning devices and the closure of many crossings, resulting in a significant decline in incidents and deaths. In the decade before the FRA interim final rule, highway-rail grade-crossing incidents decreased by 41% and deaths by 48%, despite increased train and auto traffic. The reduction was attributed to closing 41,000 grade crossings and installing warning signals at 4,000 crossings. Deaths from grade-crossing collisions have decreased by 30% since the train horn rule, with a significant decline in other highway deaths since 2005. The recent decline in grade-crossing deaths may not persist if driving activity resumes its historical growth rate. The train horn rule was prompted by industry consolidation since the 1980s, leading to a reduction in railroad track mileage and heavier use of the remaining network. Communities have banned the sounding of train horns at intersections due to increased train movements and sensitivity towards noise levels. In 1984, Florida authorized local communities to ban train horns at night at intersections equipped with warning signals. In 1989, Florida communities banned nighttime train horn use at 511 intersections. A 1990 study found a threefold increase in collisions after the bans, prompting the FRA to issue an emergency order in 1991 ending the bans. Night-time collision rates dropped to pre-ban levels after the order. A nationwide study in 1995 identified 2,122 crossings with train horn bans, showing an 84% increase in collisions compared to similar crossings without bans. The study found that crossings with train horn bans had 84% more collisions than those without bans. In response, Congress increased federal funding for automatic warning gates at crossings, with $155 million available in FY2000. Additionally, FRA was mandated in 1994 to regulate train horn use at intersections, leading to the implementation of the 2005 train horn rule. The 2005 train horn rule requires locomotive horns to be sounded at public highway-rail grade crossings, preempting state and local bans. It formalized an industry standard where train horns were already used at over 98% of crossings. The rule focuses on exceptions to the horn sounding requirement, particularly for establishing quiet zones to balance safety measures. The 2005 train horn rule mandates the sounding of train horns at grade crossings, but exceptions can be made for quiet zones with adequate safety measures in place to prevent accidents. The rule aims to balance safety with reducing noise pollution by compensating for the risk of increased train-vehicle collisions in quiet zones. Establishing quiet zones at grade crossings requires additional safety measures to prevent train-vehicle collisions. Communities can choose from three alternatives to create a quiet zone, including implementing supplementary safety measures at each public crossing. These measures reduce the risk of collisions by closing crossings permanently or during whistle ban hours, blocking approach lanes, or installing four-quadrant gate systems. Establishing quiet zones at grade crossings requires additional safety measures to prevent train-vehicle collisions. Communities can establish a quiet zone by implementing safety measures such as closing crossings permanently or during whistle ban hours, blocking approach lanes, or installing four-quadrant gate systems. If the accident risk exceeds the national average, alternative measures like traffic law enforcement, public education campaigns, and photo enforcement can be used to reduce the risk to the national average level. The community can implement safety measures to reduce the risk of grade-crossing collisions in quiet zones to the level of risk prior to creation. Quiet zones qualified by comparison to the national average risk must be reviewed annually, with the need for additional safety measures if the nationwide average declines. Quiet zones can be approved automatically by the FRA if they meet specific conditions, otherwise a full review is conducted. The FRA estimated that 66% of existing whistle ban crossings could qualify for conversion to quiet zones without improvements, while 34% would need additional safety measures. The Chicago area has around 385 of these crossings. As of April 2013, FRA received 549 applications for quiet zones, aiming to reduce train horn noise impact on 3.4 million people out of the 9.4 million affected prior to the regulation. The FRA estimated that the rule would reduce train horn noise levels by limiting the maximum sound level to 110 decibels and the duration of sounding horns at grade crossings to 15-20 seconds. 445,611 people would experience increased noise levels if existing whistle bans were eliminated, with 46% in Illinois and 34% in Cook County, IL. The train horn rule implemented a maximum noise level of 110 decibels and limited the duration of sounding horns at grade crossings to 15-20 seconds. Local governments argued that the rule was an unfair preemption of their authority, stating that the decision to ban whistles should be made at the local level. The train horn rule mandated by Congress requires the sounding of train horns at intersections to promote public safety. Federal funding from FHWA grant programs is available to reduce the risk of grade-crossing collisions, with some programs specifically targeting hazards at railway-highway grade crossings. See Table 1 for potential federal funding sources. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) emphasized that establishing quiet zones would primarily be a state and local responsibility due to strict federal funding requirements for grade-crossing risk reduction projects. Federal funding programs were available, but most improvements for quiet zones would not meet safety project priority rankings for funding. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) stated that establishing quiet zones may not significantly improve safety at grade crossings, as any safety enhancements may offset the risk of banning train horns. In 2012, Congress reauthorized federal surface transportation programs, consolidating highway grant programs. This consolidation reduced the number of programs eligible for grade-crossing safety funding but maintained overall funding levels. The Railway-Highway Crossings Program still provides funding specifically for grade-crossing safety. States can use federal funds to improve grade-crossing safety, but face competition from other highway projects for these funds. Projects must be high priorities in transportation improvement plans to be eligible for funding. In the past, earmarks were used by Members of Congress to fund specific transportation projects, but currently, projects must be in a state or metropolitan transportation improvement plan to be eligible for federal funding. Commenters raised objections to federal funding for quiet zones, arguing that it diverts resources from higher-risk crossings. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) received objections to federal funding for quiet zones, with concerns that resources would be diverted from improving rural crossings to urban areas already equipped with safety measures. Most highway-rail grade-crossing collisions are attributed to motorists' risky behavior, such as ignoring warning signals or driving around gates. Residents argued against train horn noise to protect irresponsible individuals. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) defended the sounding of train horns, mandated by Congress, to protect against grade-crossing accidents caused by irresponsible drivers. FRA stated it is necessary to shield even the unwise from severe consequences that could harm innocent victims and society as a whole."
