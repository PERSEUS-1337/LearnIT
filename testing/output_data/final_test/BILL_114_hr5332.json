    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2016\". Congress acknowledges the under-representation of women in conflict resolution but recognizes their success in moderating extremism, countering terrorism, and stabilizing societies. Research shows that peace negotiations are more successful when women are involved. Women's groups playing a key role in peace negotiations increases the likelihood of reaching a peace agreement. If women participate in the negotiation process, the peace agreement is 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years. Meaningful participation of women in negotiations also leads to addressing the root causes of conflict for more sustainable outcomes. The sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of women's participation in conflict prevention and resolution for promoting inclusive societies and long-term stability. It also highlights the critical role of women in political leadership during democratic transitions.
