    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biliteracy Education Seal and Teaching Act\" or the \"BEST Act\". Congress acknowledges the importance of celebrating cultural diversity and promoting language skills for students to succeed in the 21st century. It commends students proficient in multiple languages and encourages others to follow suit. The study of world languages in schools is vital for cognitive development, national economy, and security. Recognizing student language proficiency will benefit higher education and employers. California has led in implementing a State system for this purpose. California pioneered the first State system in the Nation to award a Seal of Biliteracy to over 10,000 graduating high school seniors in 2012. Students in every State should have access to a similar program. The State Seal of Biliteracy Program was established in California in 2012 to award graduating high school seniors. The Secretary of Education awards grants to States to establish or improve a Seal of Biliteracy program, recognizing student proficiency in English and a second language through speaking, reading, and writing. States must submit an application outlining criteria for student proficiency and ensuring students receive a seal on their diploma. The Seal of Biliteracy program requires students to have a secondary school diploma or equivalent, demonstrate proficiency in their official academic transcript, and not be charged a fee for application. To participate, students must submit an application to the State, meeting criteria set by the State and ensuring they will receive a diploma in the year of application. Eligibility for application is based on meeting State-established criteria. The Seal of Biliteracy program allows students who gained proficiency in a second language outside of school to apply for participation. Grant funds are used for administrative costs, program improvement, and public outreach. Grants are awarded for 2 years and can be renewed at the Secretary's discretion. Recipients can reapply for a grant at the end of the term, with a limit of 1 grant at a time. Recipients of grants under this section must not have more than 1 grant at a time. Unspent grant funds must be returned within 6 months of the grant term ending. A report on the Seal of Biliteracy program implementation is due 9 months after receiving the grant. Definitions for terms like \"secondary school\" and \"second language\" are provided in this section. The Seal of Biliteracy program authorizes $10,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2015-2019."
