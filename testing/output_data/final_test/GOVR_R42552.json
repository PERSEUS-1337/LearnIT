A total of 45 amendments were adopted before the Senate approved the bill by a vote of 64-35. The House Agriculture Committee also completed markup of its version of the farm bill in July 2012. The House Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 6083, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2012, on July 11, 2012, with nearly 100 amendments considered. The bill was officially filed on September 13, 2012, and includes changes to farm commodity support, crop insurance, conservation programs, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The House and Senate farm bills aim to reshape agricultural policy through FY2017. The House Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 6083, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2012, which aims to reshape agricultural policy through FY2017. The Senate-passed farm bill, S. 3240, would reduce spending by $23.1 billion (2.3%), while the House bill, H.R. 6083, would reduce it by $35.1 billion (-3.5%). The reductions are consistent with previous proposals and budget resolutions. The House Agriculture Committee approved H.R. 6083, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2012, which aims to reshape agricultural policy through FY2017. Under both the Senate-passed (S. 3240) and House Agriculture Committee-reported (H.R. 6083) farm bills, farm support for traditional program crops is restructured by eliminating direct payments, the existing counter-cyclical price program, and the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) program.
