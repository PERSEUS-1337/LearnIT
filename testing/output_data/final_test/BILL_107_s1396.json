    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new tax credit for first-time homebuyers looking to purchase a principal residence. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers allows a 10% credit on the purchase price of the residence, up to a maximum of $6,500. The credit is limited to one residence per taxpayer, and both spouses must be first-time homebuyers to claim the credit on a joint return. The tax credit for first-time homebuyers applies differently based on filing status. For married individuals filing separately, the credit is only available to first-time homebuyers, with a reduced amount of $3,250. For unmarried individuals purchasing a home together, the credit can be allocated among them, not exceeding $6,500 in total. The term 'first-time homebuyer' refers to an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the US in the past 3 years. Once a person is considered a first-time homebuyer for one residence, they cannot be considered for another. The definition of 'principal residence' is the same as in section 121. The terms 'purchase' and 'purchase price' are also defined. The terms 'purchase' and 'purchase price' are defined as provided by section 1400C(e). Any excess credit in a taxable year can be carried forward to the next year. Reporting requirements may be necessary to verify taxpayer eligibility for the credit. No double benefit is allowed for the credit. The provisions of this section apply to a principal residence if the taxpayer enters into a binding contract to purchase the residence between September 1, 2001, and before September 1, 2002, and purchases and occupies the residence before April 1, 2003. No credit is allowed if the credit under section 1400C is allowed, and the basis of the residence is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code related to the allowance of a credit for a residence under section 25C. The amendments include adding a new paragraph (29) to address the credit allowed under section 25C(g). Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include adding section 25C for a residence credit.
