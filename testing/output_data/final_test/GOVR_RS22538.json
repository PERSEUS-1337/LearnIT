    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides income support for unemployed workers through UC benefit payments. UC benefits may be extended at the state level under the Extended Benefit (EB) program. The program impacts businesses in the US, with $7.4 billion in federal unemployment taxes and $36.1 billion in state unemployment taxes collected in FY2007. States spent $31.4 billion on UC benefits in FY2007, covering approximately 133.4 million jobs. In March 2008, 3.2 million unemployed workers received UC benefits, with an average weekly benefit amount of $291. The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program aims to counter economic fluctuations like recessions by adjusting funding and benefit structure. During economic growth, program revenue increases through taxes while spending decreases. This creates a surplus for use during recessions when tax revenue drops and spending rises. UC payments to unemployed workers help inject funds into the economy. Other income support programs may be more specialized. Income support programs for workers can be specialized, targeting specific groups or triggered by economic conditions. Unemployment Compensation is a federal-state program funded by federal and state taxes. The program is governed by the Social Security Act, which includes provisions for grants to states, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and federal loans to insolvent state programs. Federal funds support program administration, Extended Benefits payments, and loans to states. In FY2008, the federal government appropriates $3.7 billion for federal and state UC program administration. States will receive $2.29 billion for their UC programs. The U.S. Department of Labor administers the federal portion of the UC system, setting rules for state programs. Non-compliance may result in employers losing state unemployment tax credits. States receive federal funding for their unemployment insurance programs, which covers administrative costs, the EB program, loans to insolvent state accounts, and employment services. State tax revenues are used for UC benefits only. States determine benefit eligibility, payments, and duration based on wages. Benefits replace half of a claimant's average weekly wage, with weekly maximums varying by state. The average weekly benefit in March 2008 was $291, available for up to 26 weeks. Massachusetts offers up to 30 weeks with a maximum of $600 per week. In April 2008, around 3.0 million unemployed workers received Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. The Extended Benefit (EB) program can extend UC benefits at the state level based on certain economic conditions. The EB program provides additional weeks of benefits, up to a maximum of 13 weeks during high unemployment periods and up to 20 weeks in states with extremely high unemployment. As of July 21, 2008, the EB program is active in Alaska and Rhode Island. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program was created on June 30, 2008, providing up to 13 additional weeks of benefits to workers who have exhausted regular UC benefits. It began on July 6, 2008, and will end on March 28, 2009, with no benefits paid beyond July 4, 2009. EUC08 is temporary and applies to all states, while the EB program is permanent and applies only to certain states based on economic conditions. States can choose to pay EUC08 or EB benefits first. States balance the decision of which benefit to pay first by examining the potential cost savings and loss of unemployment benefits for individuals. It may be less costly for the state to choose EUC08 benefits first, as they are 100% federally financed. However, if EB triggers off before EUC08 benefits are exhausted, individuals may receive less in total benefits. Alaska pays EB before EUC08, while Rhode Island pays EUC08 before EB. UC benefits are financed through employer taxes under FUTA and SUTA. The State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA) authorize taxes deposited in the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). The FUTA tax rate for employers is 0.8% on the first $7,000 of each worker's earnings if a state UC program follows federal rules. Federal law mandates coverage of certain jobs to avoid the maximum FUTA tax rate of 6.2%. The FUTA tax funds federal and state administrative costs, the EB program, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, and state employment services. Government and nonprofit employers are exempt from FUTA tax, but state programs must cover government workers. The FUTA tax rate for employers is 0.8% on the first $7,000 of each worker's earnings. Government and nonprofit employers are exempt from FUTA tax, but state programs must cover government workers and all workers in nonprofits with at least four workers in each of 20 weeks in the current or prior year. An estimated $7.3 billion in FUTA taxes were collected in FY2007, with a net balance of $35.2 billion expected in the UTF accounts by March 2008. P.L. 110-140 includes a one-year extension of 0.2% FUTA surtax. The FUTA tax rate for employers will decrease to 0.6% on the first $7,000 of wages at the end of CY2008. SUTA taxes are not affected by this change. State UC tax rates are based on the amount of UC paid to former employees, with higher benefits leading to higher tax rates for employers. State ceilings on taxable wages in 2008 vary from $7,000 to $32,200. In 2008, state unemployment insurance tax rates varied from 0% to 12.27%, with a total of $33.7 billion in SUTA taxes collected in FY2007. State UC revenue is deposited in the U.S. Treasury and reimbursed to states for benefit payments. If a state trust fund becomes insolvent, federal funds can be borrowed, but as of March 2008, no state had an outstanding loan. The net balance of state accounts in the UTF was approximately $32.4 billion."
