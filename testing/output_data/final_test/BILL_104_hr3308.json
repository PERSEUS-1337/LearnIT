The \"United States Armed Forces Protection Act of 1996\" highlights Congress's concerns regarding the President's commitment of US military personnel to United Nations peace operations, particularly in Haiti, Croatia, Macedonia, and the former Yugoslavia. Congress is wary of the potential risks to US personnel under UN operational control and emphasizes the need for clear distinctions between administrative and operational control of US forces. The United States has experienced challenges with United Nations command and control arrangements during combined operations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. Despite deficiencies, there may be occasions when US participation in UN peace operations is in the national security interest. Congress emphasizes the need for clear distinctions between administrative and operational control of US forces in such operations.

US should participate in UN operations only when clearly beneficial. The United States should only participate in UN peace enforcement operations when it is clearly in the national security interest to do so. US combat forces must be under qualified commanders with clear command and control arrangements, rules of engagement, and mission statements. US Armed Forces should not be under the operational control of foreign nationals in UN peace enforcement operations, except in extraordinary circumstances.

SEC. 4 amends Chapter 37 of title 10, United States Code, to require commanders to ensure that all members of a unit are informed of the unit's mission and chain of command. SEC. 5 prohibits members of the armed forces from being required to wear United Nations uniform items. The new section added to Chapter 45 of title 10, United States Code, prohibits members of the armed forces from being required to wear any insignia indicating allegiance to the United Nations, unless specifically authorized by law for a particular UN operation. The House of Representatives passed the legislation on September 5, 1996."
