    "content": "The bill titled the \"National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Access Act\" reaffirms Congress's commitment to oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska by facilitating exploration, production, and transportation of resources. The \"National Petroleum Reserve Alaska Access Act\" amends the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act to conduct competitive leasing of oil and gas in Alaska's reserve, with at least one lease sale annually from 2013 to 2023. It also addresses planning and permitting for pipeline and road construction. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other Federal agencies, must ensure timely permits for surface development activities in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, including pipelines and roads for oil and gas production and transportation to existing infrastructure on the North Slope. Permits must be issued within a specified timeline. Permits for transportation of oil and natural gas from Federal leases must be approved within specific timelines, and a plan for infrastructure development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska must be submitted to Congress within 270 days of the enactment of the Act. All leasable tracts in the Reserve are located within 25 miles of an approved road and pipeline right-of-way for future development. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF A NEW INTEGRATED ACTIVITY PLAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT. Within 180 days of enactment, the Secretary of the Interior must issue a new proposed integrated activity plan and environmental impact statement for oil and gas leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to maximize resource development. The existing Record of Decision, IAP, and EIS will be nullified, except as specified. The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision issued by the Secretary of the Interior in 2013 will have no force or effect, except as specified. The Secretary of the Interior will establish regulations within 180 days to ensure support for oil and gas lease development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Additionally, deadlines will be set under a new proposed Integrated Activity Plan. SEC. 7 of the new proposed Integrated Activity Plan sets deadlines for the Department of the Interior to acknowledge receipt of oil and gas lease development permit applications within 5 business days. It also establishes a 60-day limit for issuing permits after application submission without the applicant's agreement. The Secretary of the Interior must assess all fossil fuel resources in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska within 24 months, with cooperation from the US Geological Survey, the State of Alaska, and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. Funding from Alaska can be used for this assessment."
