    "content": "The public safety community is set to develop a national emergency communications capacity with unencumbered spectrum and funding, thanks to Congress. The Deficit Reduction Act established a deadline for releasing spectrum for new radio channels, providing 24 MHz at 700 MHz for public safety in 2009. Congress mandated the creation of an Office of Emergency Communications within the Department of Homeland Security to plan for interoperable communications. However, legislation on how to use the upcoming spectrum release has not been passed yet. Three major initiatives are working on plans that could incorporate the 700 MHz spectrum. Three major initiatives are developing plans to incorporate 700 MHz spectrum for public safety communications. Congress mandated DHS to create a National Emergency Communications Plan, the Administration tasked NTIA with spectrum efficiency recommendations, and the FCC is seeking input on using 700 MHz spectrum for shared public safety use. The FCC is considering a plan to use 700 MHz spectrum for a shared public safety network under its supervision, potentially reducing the role of DHS in planning for interoperable communications. Unresolved policy choices include national planning direction, network control, joint agency management, regulatory vs. legislative authority, spectrum management, congressional jurisdiction, and funding sources. The FCC could move forward with creating the network by spring 2007, but Congress may alter the timeline. Congress may change the terms of the debate by setting its own timetable, objectives, and parameters for creating a national authority to manage a public safety network at 700 MHz. Options for Congress include requiring the Department of Homeland Security to expedite its plans, involving the FCC more in DHS planning, limiting FCC's regulatory role in network development, and transferring spectrum management to the NTIA. Various efforts and proposals are being considered, including the allocation of radio frequency spectrum for wireless communications. The demand for spectrum is increasing as new wireless tools are developed for emergency responders. Policy decisions need to be made to address spectrum allocation and efficiency. Market-driven methods like pricing spectrum access or auctioning it may maximize economically efficient use, but for public safety, inelastic demand and difficulty in substitution can lead to increased costs without gains. Spectrum capacity needs among first responders and emergency workers vary. In times of crisis, demand for spectrum exceeds availability for public safety. Identifying spectrum to share with commercial users is considered for efficient use. Fragmentation of spectrum assignments hinders broadband capacity for the future. Technical problems like outdated equipment and network congestion plague public safety communications. New spectrum at 700 MHz is provided for broadband. The FCC has proposed a nationwide network at 700 MHz for broadband communications to address issues with incompatible radio frequencies and technologies. This model would require standardized interfaces and allow for sharing of radio frequencies between public safety and commercial users. This approach represents a significant shift from traditional local public safety radio operations. Radio communications have historically been built for local operations with proprietary solutions, limiting interoperability. Post-9/11, emphasis on interoperability led to three technology-based solutions dominating policy making: radios, gateways, and networks. One solution is to standardize radios for first responders through Project 25, the accepted standard for radio interoperability. The solution to interoperability includes P25 radios and gateways, which were developed in response to recommendations by the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee. P25 radios can be costly, while gateways act as \"black boxes\" that can accept and resend wireless transmissions on different frequency standards, although they are inefficient users of spectrum. Gateway solutions, using Internet Protocol (IP) to connect to IT systems, have limited interoperability due to proprietary components. The AGILE Program tested early gateways, with Project 25 members developing the Inter-Sub-System Interface (ISSI) for full interoperability. DHS aims for situational interoperability through gateways, expecting them to evolve into a standards-based shared system. Prices range from $500,000 to millions for customized systems. Another technology option, a network solution, requires agreement among jurisdictions for compatibility. A national network solution for interoperability requires agreement among multiple jurisdictions to deploy compatible equipment and interfaces. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating a network for high-risk urban areas, modeled after the Army Signal Corps, using a national architecture compatible with commercial technologies. The DHS is focused on installing gateways to achieve situational interoperability. The DHS is focused on developing interoperability with gateways and a digital backbone. Secretary Michael Chertoff supports an interoperable network at 700MHz if additional spectrum is freed up by Congress. The private sector has proposed using 700 MHz spectrum for public safety networks in the absence of federal action. The 700 MHz spectrum is proposed for a public safety network, with potential cost estimates ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion for commercial broadband in top markets. Building interoperability into the network can reduce costs for new radios, making devices more affordable for public safety. Recent FCC actions have increased focus on the potential of a network solution for interoperability. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 established an Office of Emergency Communications within DHS to lead planning for a national response capability in communications. This initiative aims to address the need for public safety interoperability without comprehensive federal policymaker discussion. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007 created the Office of Emergency Communications to oversee national emergency communications planning. The 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006 established the position of Director to coordinate emergency communications at the state and regional levels, working closely with Regional Administrators appointed by FEMA. The Director also assists the Secretary for Homeland Security in fulfilling program responsibilities outlined in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. The Director's responsibilities include coordinating emergency communications, conducting outreach programs, providing technical assistance, and developing a National Emergency Communications Plan. This plan includes evaluating the feasibility of a mobile communications capability and establishing non-proprietary standards for interoperability. The Director also reviews grants and works to assure operability and interoperability of communications systems for emergency response. The Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Group includes first responders, state and local officials, emergency managers, and public safety answering points. They coordinate with various communication providers, hospitals, utilities, ambulance services, and amateur radio operators. President George W. Bush established a national Spectrum Policy Initiative in 2003. The Secretary of the Department of Commerce is leading an initiative to implement recommendations from the Federal Government Spectrum Task Force. The NTIA is guiding the planning process with seven projects focusing on spectrum policy, including public safety communication needs and spectrum sharing feasibility. The NTIA is working with the FCC to establish a test-bed for shared radio frequencies. A Spectrum Advisory Committee is evaluating wireless technologies for the policy initiative. The committee is studying public safety communications programs like WARN, which uses 700 MHz for broadband communications in Washington, D.C. FCC submitted a report to Congress on spectrum needs for emergency response providers, seeking comments on making additional spectrum available for public safety, possibly from the 700 MHz band. The FCC sought comments on additional spectrum for public safety, potentially from the 700 MHz band. Public safety community supported the need for more spectrum, with the FCC considering modifications to the current band plan to accommodate broadband for emergency response. The FCC received over 1,000 responses regarding the allocation of spectrum for broadband use by first responders. One petition from Cyren Call Communications Corporation requested the reallocation of 30 MHz to a \"Public Safety Broadband Trust,\" which was denied by the FCC. The FCC denied Cyren Call's petition to reallocate spectrum for broadband use, citing a Congressional mandate to auction the spectrum. Other proposals for joint operations were submitted, including one from Access Spectrum and Pegasus Communications Corporation suggesting rebanding 24 MHz for broadband wireless. Verizon Wireless proposed building a broadband network for public safety on half of the 24 MHz spectrum. In December 2006, the FCC issued a new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to turn over management of the 24MHz of spectrum designated for public safety to a not-for-profit group. The FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to allocate 12 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety broadband use to a single nationwide licensee. This move aims to promote the rapid deployment of an interoperable broadband public safety network with centralized access for state and local public safety members. The FCC proposed allocating 12 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band to a single nationwide licensee for public safety broadband use. The licensee would operate commercially on the remaining spectrum with public safety having priority access when needed. The licensee would provide public safety broadband access on a fee-for-service basis and allow commercial operators access. The FCC aims to establish performance requirements for interoperability, build-out, preemptibility of commercial access, and system robustness. The licensee must meet criteria such as not-for-profit status and experience with public safety frequency coordination. The FCC proposed allocating 12 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band to a single nationwide licensee for public safety broadband use. The licensee would operate commercially on the remaining spectrum with public safety having priority access when needed. Responsibilities include network design, coordination of eligibility, and leasing capacity to commercial users. The licensee can charge fees for services and must meet criteria like not-for-profit status and experience with public safety coordination. Comments are requested on topics like broadband network implementation and system architecture for the National Public Safety Network. The FCC seeks comments on system architecture requirements for a national broadband public safety network, including interoperability standards, federal access, network build-out timing, and disaster restoration. The FCC seeks comments on requirements for network resiliency and disaster restoration, including robustness requirements for all public safety systems. They also seek input on allowing local entities operational discretion within the network norms and propose using the definition of public safety services from the Communications Act for the national license. The FCC proposes a national license for public safety use, seeking comments on secondary operations by commercial users on 12 MHz of spectrum. The plan would exempt the new licensee from current limitations on leasing spectrum. This shift in responsibility to a not-for-profit entity regulated by the FCC would impact federal jurisdiction over spectrum ownership. The FCC proposal for a national license for public safety use includes considerations such as network operations control by a not-for-profit entity and joint management by agencies like the FCC and NTIA. The decision on spectrum allocation has implications for public safety and national security. Joint management by agencies like the FCC and NTIA is being considered for the development and operation of the 700 MHz network. Questions arise regarding the roles of NTIA, the Presidential Spectrum Initiative, and the Spectrum Advisory Council in advising and regulating the network. Additionally, coordination with FEMA, the Department of Homeland Security, and other federal authorities for emergency communications is crucial. Regulatory actions by the FCC in public safety communications raise the question of coordination with DHS. Spectrum management policies are also under scrutiny for the best approach. Spectrum management policies, market-driven pricing, congressional jurisdiction, and funding for interoperable communications are key issues in the development and operation of the 700 MHz network. Congressional decisions on jurisdiction for programs funded by DHS operating on spectrum managed by FCC and NTIA are pending. $1 billion funding for interoperable communications is mandated for 2007. New federal funding of $1 billion for interoperable communications is mandated for 2007 from the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. The funding is intended for the acquisition, deployment, or training for the use of interoperable communications systems utilizing spectrum at 700 MHz. There are discussions on funding a new network on public safety spectrum through access fees from users. Congress may revisit emergency communications policy and management at the federal level. Congress may revisit emergency communications policy and management at the federal level through hearings and oversight to clarify priorities and goals regarding interoperability. Three separate policy initiatives from different sectors of the federal government are moving in different directions due to jurisdictional and institutional responsibilities. Without guidance, these initiatives may develop without coordination, impacting emergency communications policy. The FCC's proposal sponsored by the Public Safety is one of the three initiatives. The FCC's proposal, sponsored by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, is the most far-reaching of the three initiatives. It could potentially allocate spectrum to a quasi-commercial entity by 2010-2011, preempting decisions from the NTIA and DHS. The FCC may also bridge the gap between the RECC Working Group and Regional Planning Committees to bring regional representation and technical expertise to the table. The FCC's proposal aims to bring regional representation and technical expertise to the table by potentially allocating spectrum to a quasi-commercial entity. This could lead to a network administered by the Office of Emergency Communications, with DHS potentially ceding responsibilities to the FCC. The spectrum efficiency at 700 MHz may be lost to public safety users in this scenario. Many routes are possible with clear authority and direction, whether they will be coordinated or collide at the crossroads remains to be seen."
