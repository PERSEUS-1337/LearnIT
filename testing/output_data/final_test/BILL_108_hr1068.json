    "content": "The \"Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act of 2003\" includes sections on short title, findings, organ procurement organization certification, interagency committee on islet cell transplantation, study of islet cell transplantation, Medicare pancreatic islet cell transplant demonstration project, and authorization of appropriations. The Congress finds that approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States have juvenile diabetes, where the immune system attacks the pancreas. Insulin-producing islet cell transplants offer a potential cure for this condition. Islet cell transplants using variations of the Edmonton Protocol have shown promising results in maintaining normal glucose levels without insulin injections in 80 percent of patients after 1 year. A key challenge is the limited availability of pancreases for transplantation. Data on the efficacy of simultaneous islet-kidney transplants and islet transplants after kidney transplants for individuals with type 1 diabetes are insufficient. The Federal Government should promote policies and regulations to increase the supply of pancreases for research and coordinate efforts in the area of islet cell transplantation. Data collection is needed to move islet cell transplantation from experimental to standard therapy covered by insurance. A medicare demonstration project should be created to determine the efficacy of islet transplants for individuals with type 1 diabetes. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include pancreases procured for islet cell transplantation or research in organ procurement organization certification. An interagency committee on islet cell transplantation is established. The Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation is established within the Department of Health and Human Services. The Committee's membership includes representatives appointed by various health agencies. The Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation, established within the Department of Health and Human Services, includes members appointed by various health agencies to conduct a study on federal research funding and policies related to islet cell transplantation. The Interagency Committee on Islet Cell Transplantation, established within the Department of Health and Human Services, is studying current policies and regulations affecting the supply of pancreases for islet cell transplantation, the effect of xenotransplantation on advancing islet cell transplantation, the impact of United Network for Organ Sharing variances on pancreas retrieval and islet cell transplantation, and existing mechanisms to collect outcome data from islet cell transplantation trials. The Committee will develop recommendations and submit annual reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Committee will submit a report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress with findings, conclusions, and recommendations to increase the supply of pancreases for islet cell transplantation. The Committee will conduct a study on islet cell transplantation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services requests a study on the impact of islet cell transplantation on juvenile diabetes patients' health-related quality of life and economic outcomes. The study will examine clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life before and after pancreatic cell transplantation. The study will assess the impact of pancreatic islet cell transplantation on health-related quality of life outcomes, including patient worry about hypoglycemia, ability to perform daily functions, and impact on family members. It will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of islet cell transplantation compared to standard medical management for juvenile diabetes patients. Cost-effectiveness analysis will include post-treatment costs and benefits, such as health care resource utilization. The study will evaluate post-transplant health care resource utilization and long-term health care resource utilization due to diabetes complications. It will also consider indirect measures like time lost at work and productivity analysis. Establishment of a Medicare pancreatic islet cell transplant demonstration project for Medicare beneficiaries with type 1 diabetes and end stage renal disease. The project will last 5 years and evaluate outcomes, with a report to Congress including recommendations for future action. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Medicare pancreatic islet cell transplant demonstration project for Medicare beneficiaries with type 1 diabetes and end stage renal disease."
