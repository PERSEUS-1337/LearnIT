    "content": "SECTION 1. SMALL EMPLOYER BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS. Amendments to IRC Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 include a new subsection for Small Employer Benefit Arrangements. This subsection treats a small employer benefit arrangement as an employer for providing qualified retirement, accident and health plans, and group-term life insurance. Shareholder-members of the arrangement are treated differently for income allocation. The Small Employer Benefit Arrangement is treated as an employer for administering employee benefits. Certain organizations are prohibited from being considered a small employer benefit arrangement if they are owned or controlled by specific entities like insurers or retirement plan service providers. The Small Employer Benefit Arrangement can contract for services from retirement plan service providers, claim administrators, and investment advisors. This does not prohibit them from receiving ordinary products and services from entities that would otherwise be restricted from having ownership or management interests in the arrangement. The Small Employer Benefit Arrangement allows for the creation of service organizations exclusively owned and controlled by small employer benefit arrangements to provide products and services. It is defined as a member-owned cooperative organization meeting specific requirements. The amendments made by this subsection apply to plan years beginning on or after the enactment of this Act, including provisions for accident and health plans, qualified retirement plans, employee benefits, and eligibility criteria for shareholder-members and their employees. The enactment of this Act includes amendments to ERISA, specifically defining a \"small employer benefit arrangement\" as a cooperative organization meeting certain criteria and sponsoring an accident and health plan for shareholders. The Act includes amendments to ERISA, defining a \"small employer benefit arrangement\" as a cooperative organization sponsoring health and retirement plans for shareholder-members and employees. Self-insurance is prohibited under the Act. The Act prohibits self-insurance for group health plans established by small employer benefit arrangements, requiring them to be fully insured with guaranteed benefits under a qualified insurance contract. The amendments made by this subsection apply to plan years starting on or after the enactment of the Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is amended to define \"small employer benefit arrangement\" and include it in qualified health plans. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is amended to include small employer benefit arrangements in qualified health plans, treating them as small employers. The amendments made by this subsection will take effect as if included in the enactment of the provision."
