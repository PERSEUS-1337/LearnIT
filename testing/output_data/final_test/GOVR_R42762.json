    "content": "The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) reauthorizes federal surface transportation programs through September 30, 2014, with roughly $105 billion authorized for FY2013 and FY2014 combined. The highway trust fund (HTF) has been the main source of funding for surface transportation bills since 1956. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has been the primary source of funding for surface transportation bills since 1956. However, due to a sluggish economy and improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency, fuel tax revenues have fallen below projections. In response, Congress transferred money from the general fund to the HTF to fund a two-year authorization, while also making significant changes to the structure and formula of highway and transit programs. Highway programs were reduced by two-thirds, and mass transit programs were consolidated. The Highway Trust Fund has been the main source of funding for surface transportation bills since 1956. Due to a sluggish economy and improved vehicle fuel efficiency, fuel tax revenues have fallen below projections. Congress transferred money from the general fund to the HTF to fund a two-year authorization and made significant changes to highway and transit programs. The six core programs under SAFETEA were consolidated into five under MAP-21, increasing efficiency. Roughly 92% of highway program funding under MAP-21 is allocated. Transportation Alternatives (TA) receives roughly 92% of highway program funding under MAP-21, which is distributed by formula and controlled by state departments of transportation. Discretionary programs previously under FHWA control have been reduced, and project earmarking is eliminated. MAP-21 shifts towards limited federal oversight at state and metropolitan levels, using a broad initial calculation to distribute funds across formula programs. Each state's apportionment share is set under most formula programs without separate formulas. MAP-21 shifts towards a performance-based approach for distributing funds across formula programs, eliminating the need for an equity bonus program. Each state's share is determined based on its previous apportionment, ensuring they receive 95% or more of their highway tax contributions. This adjustment may not be necessary as states have consistently received more in funding than their tax payments since FY2007. MAP-21 also removes budgetary \"firewalls\" and spending guarantees present in previous transportation legislation. Under MAP-21, budgetary \"firewalls\" and spending guarantees from previous legislation have been removed, allowing for more flexibility in surface transportation spending levels. The act includes an expansion of the Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and changes in federal tolling provisions to support value and congestion pricing. Public transportation receives slight spending increases under MAP-21. Under MAP-21, transportation funding has increased slightly. Transit programs have seen structural changes, with the State of Good Repair Program replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program is now funded at a lower level and distributed by formula. The federal freight transport program proposed in the Senate bill was not included in MAP-21. The act also aims to speed up project delivery by altering the NEPA compliance process. The highway trust fund is primarily financed by excise taxes on motor fuels, with 90% of revenue coming from gasoline and diesel taxes. The fund consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with fuel tax rates last raised in 1993. The new law aims to speed up project completion but may also cause delays for some projects. The highway trust fund's revenues do not increase with inflation and have been below optimistic projections due to economic sluggishness and improved fuel efficiency. Transfers from the general fund have been necessary to meet funding levels, with MAP-21 providing additional transfers to cover shortfalls. Additionally, a transfer from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund was made in FY2012. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund balance was transferred to the Highway Trust Fund for FY2012. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $4.1 billion balance for the highway account and a $0.5 billion balance for the mass transit account by the end of MAP-21 in FY2014. Revenues for the HTF are projected to be insufficient to support surface transportation programs post-FY2014, necessitating fuel tax increases, general fund expenditures, or program reductions. Sequestration of funding authorizations may occur if the Budget Control \"Super Committee\" fails to agree on spending reductions. Sequestration exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 mean that surface transportation spending beyond FY2012 would not be significantly reduced. Exempted programs include federal-aid highways, highway traffic safety grants, NHTSA operations, motor carrier safety programs, and transit grants. Annual contract authority of $739 million is typically exempt from obligation limitations. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program and the Federal-Aid Highway Program are subject to sequestration. The Highway Program is state-run, with state DOTs determining project funding and complying with federal guidelines. MAP-21 authorizes $81.99 billion over two years for highway and research projects. States and local governments must provide a matching share for project funding. MAP-21 authorizes $81.99 billion over two years for highway and research projects. The bill eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and instead provides states with the same total apportionment as in the previous year. It also ensures a 95 cent return on each dollar paid by highway users to the Highway Trust Fund. MAP-21 does not include highway program earmarks and consolidates most discretionary programs. Unlike previous acts, it uses a single funding formula for each major program. For FY2014, the total amount available for distribution among states is determined based on their FY2012 shares of total nationwide apportionments and allocations. If any state receives less than 95 cents for every dollar contributed to the highway account of the HTF, their share is raised to that level. Adjustments are unlikely due to federal highway spending exceeding HTF revenues in recent years. Additionally, amounts for each state's apportionments from specific programs are set aside, with the remainder divided among core programs. The distribution of funds among core programs under MAP-21 is as follows: 63.7% to the National Highway Performance Program, 29.3% to the Surface Transportation Program, and 7% to the Highway Safety Improvement Program. The Transportation Alternatives Program is funded through setasides at 2% of all federal-aid highway funds. MAP-21 reduces the number of funding programs by two-thirds to around 30 programs by consolidating activities and eligibilities into core programs with overlapping eligibility areas. The NHPP is the largest federal-aid highway program under MAP-21, with authorizations of $21.8 billion for FY2013 and $21.9 billion for FY2014. It supports improving the National Highway System's condition and performance by combining various programs and includes projects to achieve national performance goals for infrastructure improvement. The NHPP is a federal-aid highway program that supports various infrastructure projects such as bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian pathways, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration. It also includes funds for Appalachian Development Highway System projects and allows for transfers of funds if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. STP remains a broad federal-aid highway program with flexible eligibility criteria. MAP-21 authorized $10 billion for FY2013 and $10.1 billion for FY2014 for various transportation projects, including road infrastructure, non-motorized paths, and bridge and tunnel inspection. STP funds can also be used for Appalachian Development Highway System Projects with no state match. Half of each state's STP funds are based on population, with the remainder available for use anywhere in the state. Additionally, STP funds are set aside for off-system bridges and can be used on minor collector roads in rural areas. Under MAP-21, funding was allocated for various transportation projects, including road infrastructure improvements and non-motorized paths. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) received $2.39 billion for FY2013 and $2.41 billion for FY2014 to address hazardous road locations and make safety improvements. The Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program was continued with a $220 million annual setaside. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) was authorized at roughly $2.209 billion for FY2013 and $2.411 billion for FY2014, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects. Congress compromised on non-motorized transportation programs, making changes to the Transportation Enhancements program. Under MAP-21, the Transportation Enhancements program was renamed Transportation Alternatives (TA) and combined with Recreational Trails and Safe Routes to Schools programs. TA funds can be used for various transportation projects, including boulevards and roadways. Each state receives roughly 2% of total highway funding for TA, with funding levels reduced from $1.2 billion in FY2011 to $820 million in FY2014. Under MAP-21, the Transportation Enhancements program was renamed Transportation Alternatives (TA) and combined with Recreational Trails and Safe Routes to Schools programs. States must allocate 50% of TA funds to local entities for obligation. If states do not obligate the remaining 50% of funding, they may use it for any TA- or CMAQ-eligible projects once the unobligated amount reaches 100% of the state's annual TA set-aside. MAP-21 also allows bicycle facilities and pedestrian walkways as eligible expenses under various programs. States can transfer up to 50% of any apportionment to other programs, except for funds suballocated by population or Metropolitan Planning funds. Section 1107 clarifies eligibility criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures. Under MAP-21, the Transportation Enhancements program was renamed Transportation Alternatives (TA) and combined with Recreational Trails and Safe Routes to Schools programs. States must allocate 50% of TA funds to local entities for obligation. If states do not obligate the remaining 50% of funding, they may use it for any TA- or CMAQ-eligible projects once the unobligated amount reaches 100% of the state's annual TA set-aside. MAP-21 also allows bicycle facilities and pedestrian walkways as eligible expenses under various programs. States can transfer up to 50% of any apportionment to other programs, except for funds suballocated by population or Metropolitan Planning funds. Section 1508 outlines criteria for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters or catastrophic failures, including the eligibility for Emergency Relief (ER) funds only on federal-aid highways. The state must apply within two years of the disaster, providing a comprehensive list of eligible project sites and repair costs. The total cost of an ER project cannot exceed the cost of repair or reconstruction of a comparable facility, with U.S. territories limited to $20 million per fiscal year. Adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for federal cost coverage can be made for time lost due to lack of access to damaged facilities, and a 90% federal share may be allowed at the discretion of the authorities. Under MAP-21, the ADHS program was eliminated and its eligibilities were incorporated into NHPP and STP. Section 1114 allocated $150 million and $40 million annually for the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs for FY2013 and FY2014. FEMA funds debris removal for major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. ER funds were previously used for first-pass debris removal on disaster-impacted federal-aid highways. States represented on the Appalachian Regional Commission must establish a plan for completion of designated corridors within one year of enactment. Under MAP-21, the ADHS program was eliminated and its eligibilities were incorporated into NHPP and STP. Section 1120 establishes a program with a budget authority of $500 million for FY2013 to fund critical high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects. States with significant uncompleted ADHS route miles must maintain efforts towards completion, with a requirement that their completion plan may not reduce obligated funds if costs exceed 15% of the total completion cost. The MAP-21 program provides funding for critical high-cost surface transportation infrastructure projects, with a budget authority of $500 million for FY2013. The program aims to support projects that would generate national and regional economic benefits, increase global competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve roadways vital to national energy security, and enhance transportation safety. The existing Title 23 discretionary Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program has been changed into a formula program under Section 1121, with $67 million annually allocated for FY2013 and FY2014. Funding is apportioned based on factors such as total passengers, vehicles carried per day, and total route miles serviced by ferry systems.

The program aims to support projects that would generate national and regional economic benefits, increase global competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve roadways vital to national energy security, and enhance transportation safety. The existing Title 23 discretionary Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities Program has been changed into a formula program under Section 1121, with $67 million annually allocated for FY2013 and FY2014. Funding is apportioned based on factors such as total passengers, vehicles carried per day, and total route miles serviced by ferry systems. Additionally, Section 1119 restructures several programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, which includes the Tribal Transportation Program, Federal Lands Transportation Program, and Federal Lands Access Program. MAP-21 authorizes funding for the Tribal High Priority Projects Program and the Federal Lands Access Program, allocating funds based on factors like road mileage, tribal population, federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. The Tribal High Priority Projects Program receives $30 million from the general fund for FY2013 and FY2014. MAP-21 authorizes funding for various federal land management agencies, allowing tolling of non-Interstate federal-aid highways. States are implementing express toll lanes and congestion pricing. The law also permits the construction of new Interstate Highways. The Value Pricing Pilot Program under MAP-21 allows for toll roads on new Interstate Highways and toll lanes on existing ones without reducing free lanes. It eliminates the requirement for a toll agreement with FHWA before tolling and mandates interoperable tolling technology by October 1, 2016. Tolls are crucial for revenue in public-private partnerships and alternative financing. Congress supports congestion pricing and tolling of HOV and express lanes, but did not expand Interstate Reconstruction. The TIFIA program, part of MAP-21, provides loans for transportation projects with dedicated revenue streams. Funding for TIFIA has increased significantly, allowing for more lending capacity. Congress did not expand the Interstate Reconstruction program to shift toll burdens to interstate travelers. MAP-21 increased TIFIA funding to $9.2 billion in FY2014 and raised the maximum project cost share to 49%. It allows for a master credit agreement for a program of projects, enabling future credit assistance commitments. Los Angeles Metro seeks to accelerate 12 transit projects with this change. The eligibility threshold for TIFIA assistance remains at $50 million per project. MAP-21 increased TIFIA funding to $9.2 billion in FY2014 and raised the maximum project cost share to 49%. It allows for a master credit agreement for a program of projects, enabling future credit assistance commitments. The eligibility threshold for TIFIA assistance remains at $50 million, with $15 million allocated for intelligent transportation system projects and a $25 million threshold for rural infrastructure projects. Rural projects receive 10% of program funds and are offered loans at half the Treasury rate. MAP-21 eliminates previous selection criteria for TIFIA assistance, now permitting it for any eligible project based on creditworthiness. The TIFIA program under MAP-21 requires projects to have an investment-grade rating, foster public-private partnerships, proceed quickly, and reduce federal grant funding. Eligibility criteria include meeting planning and environmental requirements and being ready for construction within 90 days of assistance. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Concerns exist about the increase in TIFIA's share of project costs to 49% potentially crowding out private financing. The TIFIA program under MAP-21 requires projects to have an investment-grade rating, foster public-private partnerships, proceed quickly, and reduce federal grant funding. Concerns exist about the increase in TIFIA's share of project costs to 49% potentially crowding out private financing. The public transit provisions of MAP-21 simplify the structure of the public transit program, eliminate discretionary programs in favor of formula programs, and introduce funding for FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. The Federal Public Transportation Act (FPTA) restructures the federal transit program by replacing the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program with a new State of Good Repair (SGR) Grant Program. Funding for the SGR Program is increased to $2.136 billion in FY2013 and $2.166 billion in FY2014. The program is funded from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and has two components: The High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Program distributes 97.15% of the funds. The High Intensity Fixed Guideway SGR Program distributes 97.15% of the funding by formula for maintaining fixed guideway transit systems in a state of good repair. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program distributes the remaining 2.85% of the funds by formula for public transportation provided on a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility. Transit agencies are required to develop an asset management system with performance targets based on metrics developed by the Secretary. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program is retained in MAP-21 but with reduced funding. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program in MAP-21 has reduced funding levels of $422 million in FY2013 and $428 million in FY2014, down from $984 million in FY2012. Funding will now be distributed by formula based on population and service levels. The Elderly Individuals and Individuals with Disabilities Program and the New Freedom Program have been combined into the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program. The Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities Program, authorized at $255 million in FY2013 and $258 million in FY2014, combines funding from the Elderly and Disabled and New Freedom programs. Funds are distributed by formula based on population, with 60% to large urbanized areas, 20% to small urbanized areas, and 20% to rural areas. Requirements for a locally developed transportation plan are maintained, and activities previously under the JARC program are now eligible expenses under the Urbanized and Rural Area Formula programs. Discretionary programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program have been eliminated in MAP-21. MAP-21 eliminates discretionary programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program, Transit in Parks Program, Over-the-Road Bus Program, and Alternatives Analysis Program. The Growing States and High Density State Formula Program sees increased funding levels. The Urbanized Area Formula Program also receives increased funding, with a higher set-aside for the Small Transit Intensive City (STIC) and state safety oversight program grants. Additionally, a new discretionary ferry boat grants program is created with $30 million set aside from the Urbanized Area Formula. The Rural Area Formula Program funding is increased to $600 million in FY2013 and $608 million in FY2014. The formula for apportioning funds now includes vehicle revenue miles and low-income individuals. Setasides for RTAP, Public Transportation on Indian Reservations, and a new $20 million setaside for Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance are added. Public Transportation on Indian Reservations funding is doubled to $30 million. MAP-21 doubles funding for Public Transportation on Indian Reservations to $30 million annually, with $25 million distributed by formula and $5 million competitively. It also establishes the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program for natural or man-made disasters. The bill does not increase federal share for bus projects but promotes private sector participation in public transit. MAP-21 reauthorizes the New Starts Program with funding at $1.907 billion for FY2013 and FY2014, slightly reduced from previous levels. The bill allows funds to be used for core capacity improvement projects and interrelated projects in existing fixed guideway systems. MAP-21 reauthorizes the New Starts Program with funding at $1.907 billion for FY2013 and FY2014, slightly reduced from previous levels. It simplifies the process by reducing major stages from four to three: project development, engineering, and construction. The bill eliminates the separate alternatives analysis and requires the applicant to initiate the NEPA process to enter the project development phase. FTA must use an expedited process to review technical capacity for sponsors with recent successful projects. The MAP-21 reauthorizes the New Starts Program with funding at $1.907 billion for FY2013 and FY2014, simplifying the process by reducing major stages to project development, engineering, and construction. Projects must go through the NEPA process, be selected as the locally preferred alternative, adopted into the metropolitan plan, and justified on their merits to enter the engineering phase. Projects eligible for full funding grant agreement with FTA can move into the construction phase. Special warrants expedite projects with federal share of $100 million or less. Small Starts projects requesting $75 million or less in federal assistance and costing $250 million or less have two phases: project development and construction. MAP-21 reauthorizes the New Starts Program with funding at $1.907 billion for FY2013 and FY2014, simplifying the process by reducing major stages to project development, engineering, and construction. Small Starts projects, including corridor-based bus rapid transit, do not operate in a separate right of way. Unlike SAFETEA, MAP-21 does not reserve funds for Small Starts projects in FY2013 and FY2014. The pilot program for expediting New Starts project delivery is limited to three projects. An issue going forward will be whether the changes made in MAP-21 actually speed up the process. MAP-21 introduces changes in transportation planning, including allowing larger urbanized areas with 76 to 100 buses to use 50% of their funds for operating expenses. It also mandates the use of performance management, requiring the establishment of performance measures and targets at national, state, and metropolitan levels. MAP-21 establishes seven national goals for transportation planning, including safety, infrastructure condition, congestion reduction, system reliability, freight movement, environmental sustainability, and reduced project delivery delays. Performance measures and targets must be developed by states, MPOs, and transit agencies to support these goals. DOT is required to develop measures and standards for various aspects of transportation system performance. MAP-21 requires the development of a national freight strategic plan, assessing conditions and performance of the national freight network, forecasting freight volumes, identifying highway bottlenecks, and improving freight performance. States are still required to develop statewide transportation plans and improvement programs. States must incorporate a performance-based approach into transportation planning to support national goals. Performance targets are set by each state in coordination with MPOs, and progress towards these targets must be evaluated. Investment priorities in the transportation improvement program should align with achieving performance targets. Additionally, states are required to develop a risk-based asset management plan for the National Highway System, including performance targets and an investment strategy. Failure to make significant progress towards targets requires submission of an action plan. The Department of Transportation (DOT) must set minimum standards for Interstates and bridges on the National Highway System. States failing to meet these standards must redirect federal funds to improve facilities. Failure to develop a risk-based asset management plan may result in a reduced federal share of projects. States must also create a strategic highway safety plan to address safety hazards and set performance targets for reducing injuries and fatalities. Non-compliance may lead to loss of highway program funds. MAP-21 sets performance targets for reducing serious injuries and fatalities per vehicle mile traveled using DOT measures. Failure to meet these targets may result in loss of flexibility in highway funds and additional reporting requirements. States can establish regional transportation planning organizations in nonmetropolitan areas, similar to MPOs in urbanized areas. MPO requirements remain unchanged, with long-range planning and transportation improvement programs still mandatory in urbanized areas with 50,000 or more residents. The biggest change in metropolitan planning under MAP-21 is the requirement for a performance-based approach to support national goals. MPOs must establish performance targets that align with national goals and set targets for performance measures set by DOT. Each MPO must evaluate the region's progress towards these targets in their transportation improvement programs. MPOs in transportation management areas with over 1 million residents must also develop performance plans linking CMAQ funded projects with targets for emissions and congestion reduction. The implementation of MAP-21 includes provisions for outcome-based planning and the development of multiple scenarios by MPOs. Enforcement against MPOs not following Congress's direction is minimal. Transportation project development occurs at the local, tribal, or state level, with federal approval from FHWA or FTA. Project stages include planning, design, environmental review, construction, and operation. Legislative efforts during reauthorization debate aim to address project delivery delays. Legislative efforts during reauthorization debate focused on expediting project delivery by streamlining the environmental review process for surface transportation projects. This involves FHWA or FTA working with federal, state, and tribal agencies to ensure compliance with environmental requirements, primarily through documenting consideration of a project's impacts under NEPA. MAP-21 includes provisions to expedite environmental compliance, with a focus on NEPA procedures. MAP-21 includes provisions to ensure that surface transportation projects comply with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including those related to protecting resources under federal laws like the National Historic Preservation Act and the Clean Water Act. Additionally, projects may be subject to local and state regulations. Provisions in MAP-21 aim to expedite project delivery by focusing on NEPA compliance and other related elements. These provisions include statements of national policy, amendments to environmental review processes, directives for categorical exclusions, and establishment of programs. The impact of these changes on accelerating environmental reviews and project delivery will depend on various factors. Provisions in MAP-21 aim to expedite project delivery by focusing on NEPA compliance and related elements. Regulations by DOT and CEQ demonstrate compliance with NEPA. Several provisions in MAP-21 codify regulations currently included in CEQ or DOT regulations. National policies or priorities in MAP-21 align with procedures currently implemented by DOT. These provisions include Declaration of policy and project delivery initiative, Integration of planning and environmental review, and Development of programmatic procedures. Section 1306 of MAP-21 amends Section 139(h) to create an issue resolution process initiated by DOT to ensure project deadlines are met, particularly for projects requiring an environmental impact statement under NEPA. Section 1306 of MAP-21 amends Section 139(h) to establish an issue resolution process by DOT to enforce project deadlines, especially for projects needing an environmental impact statement under NEPA. It allows DOT to penalize agencies for delays in issuing permits or approvals required by federal law, potentially causing delays in approvals. Section 1309 of MAP-21 introduces \"Enhanced Technical Assistance and Accelerated Project Completion\" under Section 139. This allows projects involved in EIS preparation to receive technical assistance from DOT to resolve issues and delays. Amendments in Sections 1305, 1307, and 1308 focus on efficient environmental reviews and assistance to agencies, with minor changes that may not significantly impact the review process. Under MAP-21, DOT is directed to create regulations for programmatic approaches to environmental reviews, which are already allowed under CEQ regulations. DOT has developed nationally applicable programmatic evaluations for states to use in the review process and has made agreements with state DOTs to expedite compliance with federal requirements. MAP-21 also amends programs related to State assumption of responsibility for categorical exclusions. Under MAP-21, states are not required to forego project delivery methods as a condition of assuming responsibility for CE determinations. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program has been made permanent, allowing all states to participate and expanding the program to include NEPA responsibilities for railroad, public transportation, or multimodal projects. Under MAP-21, states can assume responsibility for CE determinations without giving up project delivery methods. The Surface Transportation Project Delivery Pilot Program is now permanent, allowing all states to participate and expanding to include NEPA responsibilities for railroad, public transportation, or multimodal projects. Projects eligible for CEs are those that typically do not significantly impact the environment based on past DOT experience. The new provisions in MAP-21 aim to broaden the scope of projects processed as CEs, potentially accelerating the environmental review process. DOT is directed to survey projects processed as CEs since 2005 and suggest new CEs based on its findings. Under MAP-21, DOT must propose a rulemaking to move certain highway, bridge, and highway safety projects from the group of CEs listed as those that require appropriate documentation to be approved as a CE to the list of projects that normally require limited documentation. The actions listed in MAP-21 involve a potentially broad range of projects and are those that DOT has identified as potentially involving unusual circumstances. Regardless of whether such an action is listed among those that normally require limited NEPA documentation, DOT's obligation under NEPA to ensure that a CE determination for an individual project is appropriate will not change. MAP-21 also includes directives to DOT to designate broad categories of action as CEs and to promulgate regulations applicable to each designation, including emergencies. Under MAP-21, DOT is required to designate certain highway, bridge, and highway safety projects as categorical exclusions (CEs) with limited documentation. This includes projects within a right-of-way or with limited federal assistance. Projects meeting emergency criteria may be exempt from NEPA requirements. The regulations aim to streamline the approval process for these designated projects. Designating certain projects as categorical exclusions under MAP-21 may not significantly change the environmental review process, as these projects would still need to demonstrate no significant environmental impacts and comply with other laws and regulations. MAP-21 directives require DOT to establish programs and gather specific information for Congress. State DOTs may face challenges in collecting data for project acceleration. One directive is the Environmental Procedures Initiative, where DOT must develop consistent procedures for environmental permitting and procurement requirements. DOT's authority is limited in developing procedures for permitting requirements under Title 23. The DOT is required to compare completion times for environmental assessments and permits before and after 2005. Data for these comparisons are not readily available. State DOTs do not typically track the time it takes to complete project development stages. The time it takes to complete NEPA documents for surface transportation projects approved with a CE or EA may not be readily available. Tracking and measuring completion times for NEPA documents could add bureaucracy to projects. Completion times may not accurately reflect efforts to expedite environmental reviews due to various factors. The directive instructs the GAO to review state laws and procedures for environmental reviews of surface transportation projects, identify states with equivalent environmental protections, and report to Congress within two years. State environmental review programs may differ from federal NEPA process, but can be incorporated into NEPA documents. The NEPA compliance process identifies potentially duplicative state, tribal, or federal requirements for projects. State DOTs may struggle to track costs related to duplicative environmental reviews, leading to difficulties in identifying specific elements causing duplication and extracting project costs. MAP-21 introduces changes to speed up project delivery, including the use of CM/GC contracts by state DOTs. These contracts involve a general contractor providing advice during the design phase and potentially being employed for construction. This aims to streamline the process and reduce duplication of effort in project delivery. The contractor can start construction before design completion, speeding up project delivery. MAP-21 increases federal funding by 5% for highway projects using acceleration methods. Examples include prefabricated elements and design-build contracts. Another provision streamlines relocating displaced entities for transportation projects. The MAP-21 legislation allows for lump-sum payments for acquisition and relocation of displaced households and businesses affected by transportation projects. The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program funds projects to reduce transportation-related pollutants, in accordance with the Clean Air Act's ambient air quality standards. The MAP-21 legislation amends the CMAQ program requirements to include turning lanes in eligible projects, allow funding for projects in nonattainment areas regardless of the pollutant targeted, and permit the use of funds for electric and natural gas vehicle infrastructure. States with nonattainment areas have flexibility in using a portion of their apportioned STP funds. The MAP-21 legislation allows states with nonattainment areas to use a portion of their apportioned STP funds for CMAQ projects. It also directs DOT to evaluate project cost-effectiveness and allows for optional technical assessments to demonstrate emissions reductions. Priority is given to funds in PM 2.5 areas. In nonattainment or maintenance areas for PM 2.5, states and MPOs prioritize CMAQ fund distribution for projects reducing pollutants, including diesel retrofits. MPOs must prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. States can use CMAQ funds for transit project operating costs. NHTSA focuses on highway safety through addressing driver behaviors and vehicle safety features. Driver behavior is a state matter, not under federal control. In MAP-21, Congress authorized essentially level funding for highway traffic safety grant programs, with $670 million in FY2013, up 1% from $660 million in FY2012. Changes were made to NHTSA's safety grant program structure, including the elimination of the state safety belt incentive grant program and the creation of new grant programs like the distracted driving incentive grant program. The DOT can use funds to make grants to states with distracted driving laws. Congress prohibited states from using federal funds for speed or red light cameras. FMCSA oversees safety in commercial motor vehicles. In MAP-21, Congress authorized funding for FMCSA's grant programs and added provisions for commercial vehicle safety, including the requirement for electronic onboard recorders to improve compliance with hours of service regulations. MAP-21 made changes to safety standards for motorcoaches, including electronic stability control systems, increased roof strength, and seat belts for passengers. Congress also directed DOT to establish minimum entry-level training requirements for commercial drivers and a national clearinghouse for controlled substance and alcohol test results. Congress directed DOT to consider requiring tire pressure monitoring systems, improved tire performance standards, and stronger window standards for motorcoaches to enhance safety. Accelerated licensing procedures were also established to assist veterans in obtaining commercial driver's licenses. The federal government regulates safety in air travel, intercity passenger rail, and interstate freight transportation, but does not regulate public transit operations. In response to identified safety weaknesses in public transit agencies, Congress directed the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to create a national public transportation safety plan with performance criteria and standards. This plan includes setting and enforcing minimum safety standards for transit rail systems and overseeing state safety oversight programs, with $22 million annually authorized for grants to eligible states. The Senate version of MAP-21 authorized $22 million annually for formula grants to states' safety oversight programs. The funding can be used for operational expenses, including employee training. The debate on funding freight improvements was a major policy question, but a separate funding program for freight transport was not enacted in the final bill. Instead, the local cost share for freight projects was reduced to 5% for Interstate Highway System projects and 10% for other projects. MAP-21 also included planning provisions for identifying critical infrastructure components for freight transport, such as the designation of a \"primary freight network\" consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways. The Secretary of Transportation can designate up to 3,000 additional centerline miles of existing or planned roads as part of the Primary Freight Network (PFN) based on future importance to freight movement. States can designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density connecting the PFN or Interstate System with busy freight terminals. The National Freight Network (NFN) will include critical rural freight corridors, portions of the Interstate System not in the PFN, and roads in the PFN. DOT will develop a national freight strategic plan identifying highway bottlenecks and report every two years. The DOT is required to report every two years on the condition and performance of the National Freight Network (NFN). States are encouraged to create a state freight advisory committee and a state freight plan to improve freight movement. MAP-21 does not include major changes to truck size and weight provisions but requires a study of current state laws. Weight allowance for truck idle reduction technologies is increased, and states can issue overweight permits for trucks carrying relief supplies during major disasters. The surety bond filing requirement for truck brokers and ocean freight forwarders was raised from $10,000 to $75,000 to combat fraud in the industry. Small brokers argue that this change is unnecessary and is being used by larger firms to push them out of business. The bond is used to ensure brokers have a financial stake in the business and to pay creditors if firms go out of business. Section 1536 of MAP-21 suggests that all revenues collected in the harbor maintenance trust fund should be fully expended each year. The provision in Section 100124 of MAP-21 reduces the U.S. food aid shipping requirement from 75% to 50% on U.S.-flag ships and eliminates the 25% requirement for Great Lakes ports. It also emphasizes the importance of protecting Army Corps programs and directs the Administration to estimate national harbor maintenance needs annually. The cargo preference law requires 25% of food aid to be shipped through Great Lakes ports to promote U.S.-flag shipping for military deployment. Congress supports U.S.-flag vessels with additional shipping costs paid by DOT's Maritime Administration. Section 100124 repeals a provision increasing the cargo preference requirement from 50% to 75% under the Food Security Act of 1985."
