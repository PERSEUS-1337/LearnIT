    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Cooperation to Meet the Millennium Development Goals Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States committed to improving the lives of the world's poorest people by 2015 at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000. Goals include reducing poverty, child mortality, and ensuring education for all children. The US supports the Millennium Development Goals and advocates for measurable outcomes through global partnerships. The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States emphasizes the importance of fighting poverty globally as a moral imperative and a top priority of U.S. international policy. President Bush highlighted the connection between poverty and terrorism, stating that addressing poverty is essential for human dignity and faith. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States emphasized the need for the U.S. to demonstrate moral leadership and provide opportunities for educational and economic advancement to defeat global terrorism. The Group of Eight summit, United Nations summit, and World Trade Organization conference in 2005 were seen as opportunities to measure progress on Millennium Development Goals. The Group of Eight summit in 2005 focused on alleviating extreme poverty in Africa by canceling debt obligations for eligible countries under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. The report by the Commission for Africa, issued by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2005, called for coordinated actions to address challenges in Africa. The United States recognized the need for reducing debt burdens in poor countries. The United States has taken significant initiatives in recent years to strengthen economic and trade opportunities, provide financial and technical assistance to Africa and other countries burdened by extreme poverty. This includes the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, established under the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003, is providing new assistance to promising African countries. The United States is canceling 100% of bilateral debt for countries eligible for debt relief. The Commission for Africa's report emphasizes the need for African leadership in addressing governance issues. Many African leaders prioritize personal interests over national goals, often influenced by foreign governments pursuing their own agendas in the region. Africa has experienced more violent conflicts between 1965 and 2005 than any other continent, highlighting the need for effective governance to create a stable economic environment attractive to investment. The capacity for trade in Africa is hindered by poor infrastructure and trade barriers, while resources for investment and good governance have been misused and depleted. Despite challenges in Africa such as poor infrastructure and misused resources, there is optimism and energy shown by individuals like Wangari Maathai and organizations like the African Union. Debt forgiveness and support for institutional reform are crucial for serving the needs of the people and preventing conflicts, which incur significant costs to African development and the international community. Political reform in Africa has led to positive outcomes, with dictatorships becoming a minority by 2005 and democracy flourishing. The report \"Our Common Interest\" by the Commission for Africa includes recommendations for progress. The report \"Our Common Interest\" by the Commission for Africa recommends immediate international action led by industrialized countries and African nations to address poverty and underdevelopment on the continent. Africa must take responsibility and show leadership in finding sustainable solutions for development. The report \"Our Common Interest\" by the Commission for Africa recommends international action to address poverty and underdevelopment on the continent. Developed countries should collaborate to provide efficient and responsive assistance to Africa. The international community should invest in strengthening African peacekeeping capacity and nonmilitary conflict resolution through regional organizations like the African Union. The report \"Our Common Interest\" by the Commission for Africa recommends international action to address poverty and underdevelopment on the continent. It suggests massive investments in physical infrastructure to support commerce, governance, education, healthcare, and growth in West African States. Donors and African governments should invest in education and health sectors to reach remote regions. The public sector should engage the private sector to drive growth through partnerships and reform laws, bureaucracy, and infrastructure to foster investment. The report \"Our Common Interest\" by the Commission for Africa recommends international action to address poverty and underdevelopment on the continent. It suggests maximizing women's participation in business and government, dismantling trade barriers, and strengthening multilateral institutions in Africa. The international community should provide incentives for commercial firms to develop products that improve water, sanitation, health, and the environment in Africa to promote economic development and give the people of Africa a stronger voice in global forums. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"appropriate congressional committees,\" \"Group of Eight,\" and \"Millennium Development Goals.\" SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is for the President to lead in encouraging partnerships for pursuing the Millennium Development Goals, consider recommendations for Africa's development, and honor commitments made in previous Africa Action Plans. The international community should continue to build upon the progress made at previous summits towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. SEC. 5. REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit a report within 60 days after the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in 2005 on the progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The report should include a review of commitments made by the US and other countries at various summits. The World Trade Organization is set to discuss the ability of developing countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. The United States will review its progress towards these goals and assess the likelihood of their achievement. Other national and international actors' contributions will also be evaluated. The Senate passed S. 1315 on December 22, 2005, requiring a report on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals."
