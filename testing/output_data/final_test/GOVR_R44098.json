    "content": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and oceans. It was created in 1970 to unify environmental agencies and provide a systematic approach for monitoring and protecting the environment. NOAA faces challenges due to its diverse mission of science and service. NOAA's main challenge is connecting research pieces and aligning them with agency needs. Its administrative structure includes five line offices and Program Support. The agency was allocated $5.441 billion in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 allocated $5.441 billion for NOAA. President Obama requested $5.975 billion for NOAA's FY2016 budget, which is $533.7 million more than the FY2015 enacted appropriation level. The House passed a bill providing $5.169 billion for NOAA in FY2016, $271.7 million less than FY2015. The Senate committee-reported bill would provide $5.382 billion for NOAA in FY2016, $59.4 million less than FY2015. The FY2016 NOAA budget is $212.3 million more than the House-passed bill recommendation. The Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) account is NOAA's largest, supporting line offices and Program Support. Funding from ORF and Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC) is allocated across NOAA's programs. The ORF account provides funding for operating expenses, salaries, benefits, utilities, grants, and other services. The Administration's FY2016 request is $3.413 billion, $211.0 million more than FY2015. The House-passed bill allocates $3.150 billion, $52.5 million less than FY2015. The Senate committee-reported bill proposes $3.243 billion, $40.3 million more than FY2015 and $170.6 million less than the Administration's request. The PAC account funds capital assets. The PAC account funds capital assets like research vessels and facilities, with a majority of funding going towards NESDIS satellite acquisition. The Administration's FY2016 request is $2.499 billion, a 14.7% increase from FY2015. The House-passed bill allocates $1.960 billion, $219.2 million less than FY2015. The Senate committee-reported bill proposes $2.079 billion, $99.7 million less than FY2015. The Saltonstall-Kennedy Act of 1954 established a fund for U.S. fisheries research and development programs, supported by a permanent appropriation of import duties. Most funding has been used for fisheries management and research efforts by NMFS. NOAA estimates Department of Agriculture funding for FY2016. In FY2016, NOAA estimates a $143.7 million transfer from the Department of Agriculture, with $13.6 million allocated for the Saltonstall-Kennedy grant program. The remaining $130.2 million will offset ORF account appropriations. The Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund supports West Coast salmon recovery efforts through grants to states and tribes. The Administration's request for the PCSRF account for FY2016 is $58.0 million, a 10.8% decrease from FY2015. The House-passed bill proposes $65.0 million, $7.0 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill also suggests $65.0 million for FY2016, matching the FY2015 enacted appropriation and the House recommendation. The Fisheries Finance Program offers long-term financing for fishing and aquacultural facilities. The Fisheries Finance Program offers long-term financing for fishing and aquacultural facilities, with an annual loan authority from Congress. It generates a positive return of approximately $6.0 million each fiscal year and NOAA has requested $10.3 million for refinancing a loan related to Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishing Capacity Reduction. The Fishermen's Contingency Fund is funded by receipts from the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, with a limit of $350,000 per fiscal year. The Fisheries Disaster Assistance Fund provides aid for fishery disasters declared by the Secretary of Commerce in 2012 and 2013 under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act. Annual appropriations for this fund are not expected. In FY2015, funding for NOAA's line offices is allocated among programs and activities according to agency priorities. NOS and NMFS focus on coastal and ocean resource management, while NWS and NESDIS are related to weather and climate. OAR is the primary research center within NOAA, with over 92% of its budget dedicated to research and development. Program Support provides assistance to activities across NOAA's line offices. Funding details for each line office can be found in Table 2. The National Ocean Service (NOS) manages coastal ocean and Great Lakes areas, provides navigation products and services, and responds to natural disasters. The Administration has requested $550.8 million for NOS in FY2016, which is $66.0 million more than the previous year. The House-passed bill would provide $466.5 million for NOS, $18.3 million less than the previous year and $84.3 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill would allocate $501.1 million for NOS in FY2016. The Administration has requested $54.1 million for coastal zone management and services, an increase of $12.4 million (29.8%) over the FY2015 enacted appropriation level. The House-passed bill would fund coastal zone management at $40.0 million, a decrease of $1.7 million (4.1%) from the previous year. The Senate committee-reported bill would fund coastal zone management at $39.6 million, a decrease of $2.1 million (5.1%) from the FY2015 appropriation level. The Administration also requested $116.1 million for coastal management grants, an increase of $45.0 million (63.2%) over the FY2015 enacted. The House-passed bill recommends $65.0 million for coastal management grants, a decrease of $6.1 million (8.6%) from the FY2015 enacted funding level. The Senate committee-reported bill would fund coastal zone management grants at $75.0 million, an increase of $3.9 million (5.4%) over the FY2015 appropriation level. The Senate Committee on Appropriations would maintain funding for regional coastal resilience grants at $5.0 million. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is the lead federal agency for management and conservation of living marine resources and their habitat. The Administration has requested $888.2 million for NMFS, an increase of $66.1 million (8.0%) from the FY2015-enacted funding level of $822.1 million.

The House-passed bill recommends $120.5 million for weather and air chemistry research, which is $29.7 million more than the FY2015 enacted funding level and $23.2 million more than the Administration's request. This increase includes funding for activities authorized in House-passed H.R. 1581, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015. The Senate committee-reported bill would fund weather and air chemistry at $91.2 million, $0.4 million more than FY2015 appropriation level, $6.1 million less than the Administration's request, and $29.3 million less than the House-passed bill. The NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP) was established by the Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act. OAP coordinates NOAA activities related to monitoring, research, and other efforts consistent with the Strategic Plan for the Research and Monitoring of Ocean Acidification. The Administration has requested $30.0 million for OAP, $21.5 million more than the FY2015 appropriation level. The House-passed bill recommends $8.4 million for OAP, a small decrease of $54.0 thousand from the FY2015 enacted funding level and $21.6 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill would fund the National Weather Service (NWS) at $1,112.4 million for FY2016, which is $24.9 million more than the FY2015 enacted appropriation.

The Administration's FY2016 request for NESDIS satellite system acquisition and construction is $2,189.3 million, an increase of $154.8 million (7.6%) over the FY2015 appropriation. The House-passed bill recommends $1,802.6 million for NESDIS satellite system acquisition and construction, $231.9 million less than FY2015 enacted funding level and $386.7 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate committee-reported bill proposes $1,918.4 million for NESDIS satellite system acquisition and construction in FY2016, which is $116.1 million less than FY2015 enacted appropriation and $270.9 million less than the Administration's FY2016 request. The Administration has requested $380.0 million for the Polar Follow-On program in FY2016. The Polar Follow-On program, funded at $135.0 million, aims to ensure continuity of NOAA's polar satellite system for weather prediction models. It includes the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) launching JPSS-1 in 2017 and JPSS-2 in 2021, providing global environmental data such as cloud imagery, sea surface temperature, and Arctic sea ice monitoring. The program extends operations potentially to 2038 and supports launch readiness for JPSS-3 in 2024 and JPSS-4. The Polar Follow-On program, funded at $135.0 million, aims to ensure continuity of NOAA's polar satellite system for weather prediction models. It includes the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) launching JPSS-1 in 2017 and JPSS-2 in 2021, extending operations potentially to 2038. The Administration request, House-passed bill, and Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill would provide identical funding levels for satellite acquisition programs like GOES-R at $871.8 million, JPSS at $808.9 million, JASON-3 at $7.5 million, and DSCOVR. The Administration's request and the House-passed bill would fund the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-2) at $20 million, an increase from the FY2015 funding level. The Senate committee-reported bill would fund COSMIC-2 at $10.1 million. Additionally, NOAA's FY2016 request and the House-passed bill would provide $2.5 million for the Space Weather Follow-On program to analyze options for the next space weather satellite. The design life of the DSCOVR spacecraft ends in 2019. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not fund the space weather follow-on but instructed NOAA to submit a report detailing space weather data needs, options for collecting data, costs, project timelines, and the impact of a space weather gap after 2019. Program Support (PS) provides management and services to most of NOAA's staff and line offices, divided into two main areas: the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) and PS, including Corporate Services, the Office of Education, and Facilities. The Administration has requested $277.0 million for Corporate Services, the Office of Education, and Facilities for FY2016, an increase of $29.1 million (11.7%) over the FY2015 appropriation. The House-passed bill recommends $210.7 million for PS, a decrease of $37.2 million (15.0%) from the FY2015 enacted budget. The Senate committee-reported bill recommends $250.1 million for Program Support (PS) in FY2016, which is $2.2 million more than FY2015 enacted funding. NOAA requested $16.4 million for the Office of Education, while the House-passed bill recommends $23.6 million. The Senate bill proposes $26.6 million for the Office of Education in FY2016. In FY2016, the Office of Education received $16.4 million from NOAA, $23.6 million from the House-passed bill, and $26.6 million from the Senate bill. OMAO's funding for FY2016 includes $369.8 million requested by the Administration, $219.3 million recommended by the House, and $225.1 million proposed by the Senate committee. The Senate committee-reported bill for FY2016 includes $369.8 million requested by the Administration for OMAO, which is $5.8 million more than the House-passed bill. The House-passed bill and Senate committee-reported bill do not include NOAA's request for $147.0 million to begin construction of a new oceanographic research vessel. Amendments in the House-passed bill aim to restrict funding for specific NOAA activities, including enforcement of Amendment 40 of the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper Fishery Management Plan. The National Ocean Policy, established under Executive Order 13547, divides the recreational quota between charter and private angling components. Some private fishermen are concerned about the disproportionate share going to charters. H.Amdt. 346 aims to restrict funding for coastal and marine spatial planning. The National Ocean Council coordinates the policy's implementation through specific federal actions outlined in the National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan. The Administration's National Ocean Policy is questioned for being a new regulatory program without clear statutory authority. Concerns include potential exclusion of activities like recreational fishing and oil/gas development. H.Amdt. 354 aims to prevent NOAA from implementing recovery plans for salmon/steelhead populations if they don't address predation by non-native species like striped bass and largemouth bass. This amendment emphasizes managing introduced species' impact on native salmon populations. President Obama's FY2016 budget request includes a proposal to consolidate federal business and trade programs into one department for increased efficiency. This reorganization would involve incorporating NOAA into the Department of the Interior to enhance conservation efforts and scientific resources. The integration details between NOAA and DOI programs have not been provided yet. In FY2016, NOAA is proposing to restructure budget line items by combining program, project, and activity lines, with the largest changes in the NMFS budget. This restructuring aims to align the NMFS budget to its programmatic and organizational needs, providing increased transparency and accountability. For example, PPAs under the Protected Species Research and Management program areas would be combined, and the Fisheries Research and Management subprogram would be changed to Fisheries Science and Management with fewer PPAs. The NOAA is proposing to consolidate program, project, and activity lines to streamline fund allocation. This includes combining PPAs in the Fisheries Science and Management program, such as merging Pacific and Atlantic salmon into one PPA. The Senate Committee on Appropriations supports most of the budget restructuring but opposes the consolidation of Atlantic and Pacific salmon into a single PPA."
