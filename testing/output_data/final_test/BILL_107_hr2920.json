    "content": "The \"Bulk Cash Smuggling Act of 2001\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to address findings and purposes related to cash smuggling. The Congress finds that effective enforcement of currency reporting requirements has forced criminals to avoid traditional financial institutions, leading them to move large quantities of cash through ports of entry for smuggling. The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form is a common method of money laundering and a warning sign of various crimes. Large amounts of currency moved to circumvent reporting laws are equivalent to smuggling goods and contribute to criminal proceeds laundering efforts. The smuggling of bulk cash is a key part of criminal activity and can be effectively disrupted by confiscating the cash. Current penalties for currency reporting violations are not enough to deter money laundering, and making bulk cash smuggling a separate offense could allow for easier confiscation of the cash. The Act aims to criminalize bulk cash smuggling, authorize forfeiture of smuggled cash and other property involved, emphasize the seriousness of the offense, and provide guidelines for forfeiture amounts. The Act criminalizes bulk cash smuggling into or out of the United States. The Act criminalizes bulk cash smuggling involving amounts over $10,000 to evade currency reporting requirements within or outside the United States. The Act criminalizes currency smuggling within the United States, including concealing currency on a person or in belongings. Offenders face up to 5 years in prison and forfeiture of any property.
