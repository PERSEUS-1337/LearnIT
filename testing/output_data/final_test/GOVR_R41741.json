    "content": "The state secrets privilege is an evidentiary privilege that allows the government to withhold information during civil litigation if it could harm national security. The privilege can only be invoked by the government after review by the department head and evaluation by the court. If the court agrees, the protected information is deemed unavailable, and the litigation may proceed without it. The state secrets privilege can be used by the government to withhold information during civil litigation to protect national security. In response to concerns about its overuse, the Obama Administration implemented new policies to ensure the privilege is only invoked when necessary to safeguard national defense or foreign relations. Attorney General Eric Holder established procedures requiring review by a State Secrets Review Committee and personal approval for invoking the privilege in litigation. The Department of Justice will not defend the state secrets privilege to conceal violations of the law or prevent the release of information that would not harm national security. The privilege has been used in high-profile cases like defending against claims from extraordinary rendition practices and challenges to the terrorist surveillance program. This report provides an overview of the protections of the state secrets privilege. The state secrets privilege provides protections against disclosure of information that could harm national security. The modern framework of the privilege was established in the 1953 case of United States v. Reynolds, involving a military aircraft crash during a secret mission. The privilege has been applied in high-profile cases, such as defending against claims related to extraordinary rendition practices and the terrorist surveillance program. The Supreme Court established a two-step procedure for evaluating claims of privilege to protect state secrets in the case of United States v. Reynolds, involving a military aircraft crash during a secret mission. The Court ruled that a formal claim of privilege must be made by the head of the department in control of the information, and the court must determine if the circumstances warrant the privilege without compromising the protected information. The Reynolds Court upheld the Air Force's privilege claim without requiring in camera review of the incident report. The Court directed the district court to allow the plaintiffs to proceed without the privileged evidence. The privilege must be formally asserted by the government and cannot be invoked by a private party. The state secrets privilege must be formally asserted by the government and cannot be invoked by a private party. Litigation that could lead to the disclosure of secret evidence threatening national security requires government intervention. Most courts allow the privilege to be raised at any time, either prospectively or during discovery. Evaluating the validity of the government's claim presents difficulties for the court. The government bears the burden of proving the validity of the state secrets privilege claim, as courts must independently evaluate it to prevent abuse and protect sensitive information. The judiciary must strike a balance between deference to the executive branch and maintaining control over evidence. The Court employs a \"formula of compromise\" to balance oversight by the judiciary, plaintiffs' need for evidence, and national security interests. The privilege is valid when disclosure may expose military matters detrimental to national security. Courts vary in the depth of review, considering the opposing party's need for information and the government's need for non-disclosure. In some cases, evidence may be required for in camera review. The court balances oversight, plaintiffs' need for evidence, and national security interests with the privilege of non-disclosure in camera review. The depth of review varies, considering the necessity of the underlying information to the litigation. The court may be satisfied without examining the evidence based on the government's representations. In cases like Reynolds, courts may rely on government representations to uphold privilege, especially when alternative avenues for information exist. Courts may redact sensitive portions of documents to protect privileged information while allowing non-privileged evidence to be considered. Some courts question the use of redaction to protect privileged portions out of concern for potentially relevant information being withheld. The \"mosaic theory\" cautions against disclosing seemingly innocuous information that could collectively reveal protected information. Federal judges may struggle to determine which pieces of information could lead to disclosure, resulting in broad deference to intelligence agencies. The privilege, if properly invoked, is absolute and cannot be compelled by the court, even with a compelling necessity from a private litigant. Courts have varied in their approach to cases involving successful claims of privilege, with some dismissing claims entirely and others allowing cases to proceed with consequences from the loss of evidence. The privilege, if validly invoked, protects specific pieces of evidence and can have constitutional implications. The state secrets privilege, with its constitutional underpinnings, often requires deference to executive branch assertions and can result in the outright dismissal of a case in certain circumstances. For example, in Halkin v. Helms, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was confronted with a claim of privilege regarding the National Security Agency's alleged interception of international communications. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the protection of privileged information regarding the NSA's interception of international communications targeted by the CIA. Without this privileged information, the plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case of unlawful surveillance. In another case, a job seeker alleged the FBI disqualified him based on his father's political ties, violating their First Amendment rights. The FBI claimed a lawful reason to disqualify a job seeker based on his father's political ties, citing the state secrets privilege. The D.C. Circuit agreed that evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason was protected, leading to the dismissal of the case. Courts recognize cases where the subject matter is a state secret, requiring outright dismissal to avoid disclosing sensitive information. This has sparked confusion and debate in legal circles. Dismissals under the state secrets privilege have caused confusion and debate, stemming from the 1876 Supreme Court case Totten v. United States. The Totten rule prohibits federal courts from reviewing controversies involving secret espionage contracts, as seen in cases like Tenet v. Doe involving CIA spies. The Totten rule prohibits federal courts from reviewing disputes over contracts for espionage, as affirmed in the Supreme Court case Tenet v. Doe. The Court distinguished between the Totten bar and the Reynolds privilege, maintaining that the Totten rule has not been replaced by the state secrets privilege. This means that cases involving clandestine spy relationships remain outside the jurisdiction of the courts. The Totten rule prohibits federal courts from reviewing disputes over contracts for espionage, as affirmed in the Supreme Court case Tenet v. Doe. Some courts differentiate between Totten and Reynolds, while others interpret Totten to have broader application beyond spy contracts, leading to dismissal under the privilege if state secrets are at risk of being revealed. Recent cases from the Fourth and Ninth Circuits show differing conclusions on civil claims related to the government's extraordinary rendition program. El-Masri v. United States involved allegations of unlawful detention and interrogation by the CIA and private transportation companies. The Totten rule prohibits federal courts from reviewing espionage contracts, with some courts applying it broadly to dismiss cases involving state secrets. El-Masri, a German citizen, alleged unlawful detention and interrogation in violation of the U.S. Constitution and international law. He claimed he was detained in Macedonia, transferred to the CIA, flown to Afghanistan, held in a CIA facility, and then released in Albania. El-Masri also reported being mistreated during transport and confinement. Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan involved plaintiffs suing Boeing's subsidiary for its role in the extraordinary rendition program. They alleged the company provided transportation services for the program. In El-Masri and Jeppesen cases, the government invoked state secrets privilege to dismiss lawsuits regarding flights transporting plaintiffs to detention and torture locations. The Fourth Circuit cited Totten and Reynolds, stating that some matters are too pervaded by state secrets for judicial resolution once the privilege is invoked. The court concluded that Totten's principle extends beyond enforcing secret espionage contracts. The Fourth Circuit invoked the state secrets privilege in the El-Masri case, leading to the dismissal of the lawsuit due to the potential disclosure of privileged information about the CIA's internal organization and procedures. The Supreme Court declined to review the decision, emphasizing the constitutional significance of the state secrets privilege. The Fourth Circuit opinion in the El-Masri case asserted that the state secrets privilege has a constitutional foundation. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit in Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan initially held that the privilege only excluded privileged evidence from discovery or trial, not requiring dismissal of the complaint at the pleadings stage. The Ninth Circuit distinguished between the Reynolds privilege and the Totten bar, stating that dismissal under the Reynolds privilege is only appropriate when privileged evidence hinders the plaintiff's case or the defendant's defense. The court emphasized that the 'very subject matter' of any other lawsuit is not considered a state secret, except in the specific context of Totten itself. The Ninth Circuit panel refused to expand Totten's dismissal rule beyond its original scope. The Ninth Circuit panel refused to expand Totten's dismissal rule beyond secret agreements with the government. The panel decision was overturned in en banc review by a 6-5 vote. The court determined that dismissal was required under Reynolds, not Totten, due to the risk of divulging state secrets in litigating Jeppesen's alleged liability. The court recognized a convergence of the Reynolds privilege and the Totten bar, forming a continuum of analysis. The court recognized a convergence of the Reynolds privilege and the Totten bar, forming a continuum of analysis. Plaintiff's petition for certiorari is pending before the Supreme Court, with confusion remaining on the amount of deference owed to the executive branch when the state secrets privilege is invoked. In General Dynamics Corporation v. United States, the federal government asserted the state secrets privilege to prevent disclosure of sensitive technology in a defense contract dispute. The case focused on the consequences of the privilege inhibiting a party's defense against the government's breach of contract claim. The opinion contained important language regarding contract remedies. The General Dynamics case involved the state secrets privilege in a defense contract dispute. The Court reaffirmed that the Reynolds privilege is based on evidentiary rules, not the Constitution. It extended the nonjusticiability theory of Totten to cases beyond espionage contracts. The Court extended the Totten nonjusticiability theory to cases beyond espionage contracts, citing that state secrets can prevent adjudication of claims. The state secrets privilege has led to the dismissal of plaintiffs' claims in various cases, including those related to the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) was a Bush Administration program that allowed the NSA to intercept communications of U.S. persons without warrants under FISA. Numerous legal challenges were filed against private telecom companies and government officials involved in the program. The federal government intervened in many of these cases due to the sensitive nature of NSA's surveillance activities. The federal government intervened in legal cases challenging NSA's surveillance activities, invoking state secrets privilege to dismiss them. However, early assertions of the privilege were largely unsuccessful. In Hepting v. AT&T Corp., the court denied the government's motion, stating that the case's subject matter was not a secret due to public disclosures. In 2008, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies for assisting NSA. The FISA Amendments Act granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies for assisting NSA under the TSP. Most TSP-related claims against telecom companies were dismissed in federal courts. Challenges to the TSP program against the NSA or government officials were not affected by the immunity. Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Bush is a prominent challenge to the TSP, involving allegations of unlawful interception of communications by the NSA. Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation challenged the NSA's surveillance program, with the government invoking the state secrets privilege to dismiss the case. The Ninth Circuit rejected the dismissal but upheld the privilege for a top secret document inadvertently disclosed to Al-Haramain. The lawsuit revealed details about the TSP confirmed by government officials. The court in Al-Haramain did not dismiss the case under the state secrets privilege, but determined that without the top secret document, the plaintiffs could not establish standing to prove they were subject to TSP surveillance. The court in Al-Haramain dismissed the claim for lack of standing as Al-Haramain could not prove it was subject to TSP surveillance. The question of whether certain FISA provisions superseded the state secrets privilege was left open. FISA provides a framework for authorized electronic surveillance and a civil remedy for those affected by unlawful surveillance. The Ninth Circuit noted that FISA provides a detailed regime to determine the legality of surveillance, potentially allowing Al-Haramain to proceed with its claim if FISA preempts the state secrets privilege. This would make necessary portions of secret documents available for review. The court remanded the case to determine if FISA preempts the state secrets privilege, requiring plaintiffs to prove they are \"aggrieved persons\" under FISA before accessing the secret document. In January 2009, the district court allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with discovery under FISA after finding that the government had unlawfully surveilled them. The federal government often intervenes in civil claims against government contractors to protect state secrets, as seen in a 2008 case against Raytheon. The estate of a deceased U.S. Navy lieutenant filed a tort case against Raytheon, alleging that a malfunction in Raytheon's Patriot Air & Missile Defense System caused the death of the lieutenant. The United States intervened to protect national security by asserting privilege over technical information and military operational orders related to the Patriot missile system. The district court judge dismissed the case after a supplemental declaration revealed that Raytheon could not defend itself without revealing state secrets. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a separate case involving the state secrets privilege and its impact on defending against the federal government. The cases of General Dynamics v. U.S and Boeing v. U.S involved a contract for the A-12 Avenger project, terminated by the Navy in 1991 due to missed deadlines. The contractors sued under the Contract Disputes Act, claiming project delays were caused by lack of Pentagon support, seeking to avoid returning $1.35 billion in progress payments. The contractors in the A-12 Avenger project case argued that the Navy's failure to provide access to promised stealth technology led to the contract termination. They sought evidence related to the technology, but the government invoked the state secrets privilege. The contractors in the A-12 Avenger project case argued that the government's refusal to disclose classified information on stealth technology led to contract termination. The courts upheld the government's privilege claim, rejecting the contractors' defense based on superior knowledge. Ultimately, the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of the government's contract termination, leading to a request for the return of $1.35 billion in progress payments. The Supreme Court later vacated and remanded the decision for further consideration. The Court's opinion focused on the consequences of invoking the state secrets privilege in the A-12 Avenger project case, rather than the propriety of the privilege itself. The remedy crafted by the Court left both parties in their original positions, with the government unable to claim $1.35 billion in progress payments and the contractor unable to pursue its claim. The Court's opinion in the A-12 Avenger project case clarified the consequences of invoking the state secrets privilege. The contractor could not claim $1.35 billion in progress payments, and the government could not pursue damages under the theory of \"superior knowledge\" being withheld. The privilege also arises in employment-related claims against national security agencies, with the federal government arguing that such cases could threaten intelligence-gathering methods or disrupt diplomatic relations. In Sterling v. Tenet, a racial discrimination claim was brought against the Director of the CIA, invoking the state secrets privilege to dismiss the case due to potential harm to CIA sources and foreign relations. The Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal, citing the privilege's protection of sensitive information. The Fourth Circuit upheld the dismissal of Sterling's employment discrimination claim, citing the state secrets privilege as necessary to protect classified details. This broad view of state secrets consequences was also seen in other cases like Al-Aulaqi v. Obama, where a claim challenging the inclusion of a cleric on a CIA target kill list was dismissed. The plaintiff argued that his son being on the CIA kill list violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The government claimed the plaintiff lacked standing, the claim was a political question, and should be dismissed under state secrets privilege. Declarations from top officials supported the privilege claim to protect classified evidence. The government asserted that disclosing certain evidence in the case could harm national security, specifically related to targeting foreign terrorist organizations and criteria for lethal force. The court dismissed the case for lack of standing and nonjusticiability, hinting at dismissal under the state secrets privilege. The court noted the state secrets privilege in a case involving the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), where the government claimed privilege to protect national security. The plaintiffs sought evidence to prove they were \"misidentified\" or \"overclassified,\" but the government asserted the privilege to withhold information. The government claimed privilege to withhold information related to the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to protect national security. The federal district court rejected the claim and ordered disclosure of the TSDB information to plaintiffs under a protective order, citing the plaintiffs' strong showing of necessity. The court rejected the government's claim of privilege to withhold TSDB information, stating that disclosure would not jeopardize national security. The court also noted that plaintiffs who have been repeatedly stopped at border entries are likely aware of government scrutiny, questioning the need for secrecy. The federal courts are still defining the boundaries of the state secrets privilege. The state secrets privilege is a complex legal issue with unresolved questions regarding its definition, deference to the executive branch, dismissal of claims, and the relationship between different privileges."
