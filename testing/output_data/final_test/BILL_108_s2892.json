    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2004\". Congress finds that thousands of children worldwide are infected with HIV daily, with most cases due to mother-to-child transmission. In the United States, over 3,700 children under 13 are living with HIV/AIDS, and young people aged 15-24 account for half of all new HIV infections globally. Additionally, more than 6,000 youth are infected with HIV daily, and half of the 40,000 new HIV cases in the U.S. annually are among individuals under 25 years old. Women make up over a quarter of new HIV infections in the U.S., with young women representing 58% of new cases among those aged 13-19. Title IV of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 provides family-centered health care and supportive services for women, children, youth, and families affected by HIV. It is the main source of medical care for HIV-positive children, youth, and pregnant women in their area, offering specialized services and linking HIV-positive youth to comprehensive medical care and support services through its Adolescent Initiative. Title IV of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 provides essential services for women, children, and youth affected by HIV, reducing mother-to-child transmission rates significantly. The Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control recommend routine, voluntary HIV testing for pregnant women to reduce mother-to-child transmission. Experts emphasize the need for HIV vaccines to control the global pandemic, but pediatric populations are often excluded from vaccine trials. Only a few completed and ongoing trials on HIV vaccines include pediatric populations, highlighting the importance of testing vaccines in all relevant pediatric groups early on for safety and efficacy. SEC. 3 amends the Public Health Service Act to ensure family-centered, coordinated care for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. SEC. 4 expands care for youth with HIV by providing health care and supportive services to recruit and retain individuals aged 13 through 24. SEC. 5 Ensuring adequate resources for children and families. Women, Infants, Children, and Youth Provisions are being amended to use HIV case data for determining funding for services instead of AIDS case data. This change is aimed at aligning with the use of such data for other funding allocations authorized under this title. The State will use HIV case data instead of AIDS case data for allocating funds for services. The Secretary must report on the implementation of HIV case data and its impact on resources for women, infants, children, and youth by October 1, 2007. The Secretary will award demonstration grants to assess strategies for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission, including increasing HIV testing for pregnant women and improving access to prenatal care for HIV-positive pregnant women. The Secretary will award grants to entities prioritizing pregnant women in areas with mother-to-child HIV transmission. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2005, with additional funding for 2006-2010. SEC. 2673A. PEDIATRIC HIV VACCINE TESTING. The Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2004 mandates a report on HIV vaccine testing in pediatric populations to be submitted to Senate and House committees within 120 days. The report must include plans for expanding capacity for HIV vaccine research. The report on HIV vaccine testing in pediatric populations must include plans for expanding capacity, increasing coordination across relevant institutes, and identifying collaboration opportunities with other HIV vaccine research programs and organizations. The Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2004 mandates guidance on initiating HIV vaccine testing in pediatric populations, including enrollment sequencing and community education efforts. The FDA Commissioner must issue guidance on minimum requirements for testing an HIV vaccine in pediatric populations within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Children and Family HIV/AIDS Research and Care Act of 2004 mandates FDA guidance on testing HIV vaccines in pediatric populations, including long-term health effects, psycho-social needs, and treatment options for HIV-infected pediatric populations. The term 'pediatric populations' includes neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.
