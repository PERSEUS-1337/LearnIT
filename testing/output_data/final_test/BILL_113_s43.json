    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar-for-Dollar Deficit Reduction Act\" and includes an amendment to Title 31. The \"Dollar-for-Dollar Deficit Reduction Act\" amends Title 31 by adding a new section 3101B for debt limit control. The Secretary of the Treasury must issue a debt limit warning to Congress in case of a near breach of the public debt limit, outlining when extraordinary measures may be needed. The Secretary of the Treasury can take action in case of a breach of the debt limit to keep the government functioning. A \"near breach\" is when the debt limit will be reached within 60 days despite extraordinary measures. The President must submit a request to increase the debt limit along with proposed legislation. The proposed legislation accompanying a debt limit increase must include spending reductions over the next 10 years, excluding net interest savings. The savings should be calculated against a budget baseline consistent with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. SEC. 316. DEBT LIMIT INCREASE POINT OF ORDER. The text chunk outlines the conditions under which it is not permissible to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that increases the statutory debt limit in the Senate or the House of Representatives unless there are corresponding net spending reductions over the current and next 10 fiscal years. Net interest savings cannot be included as part of the required spending reductions. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 excludes emergency spending from the baseline. The Senate and House cannot vote on increasing the public debt limit without a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office available for 24 hours. Provisions shifting outlays or revenues outside the 10-year window are prohibited. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 requires a three-fifths Senate vote to waive or appeal subsection (a)(1). A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents. Sec. 316. Debt limit increase point of order."
