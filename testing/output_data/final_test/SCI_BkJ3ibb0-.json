    "content": "Defense-GAN is a framework that uses generative models to protect deep neural networks from adversarial attacks by modeling the distribution of unperturbed images. It provides a defense mechanism that can be applied to any classification model without altering its structure or training process. This method is effective against various attacks and does not require knowledge of how adversarial examples are generated. Defense-GAN is effective in defending deep neural networks against adversarial attacks by generating adversarial examples. It improves on existing defense strategies and is consistently effective against different attack methods. Adversarial attacks involve adding carefully crafted perturbations to legitimate input samples, causing misclassification at inference time. These perturbations are small and do not affect human recognition but can change the classifier's output. In the context of defending against adversarial attacks, various defenses have been proposed to mitigate their effects. These defenses fall under three approaches: modifying training data, adjusting the training procedure, and removing adversarial noise from input samples. However, these approaches have limitations as they are effective against either white-box attacks or black-box attacks, but not both. In this paper, a novel defense mechanism is proposed to combat both white-box and black-box attacks by leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The GAN framework involves training two models simultaneously: a generative model that emulates data distribution and a discriminative model that distinguishes real data from artificially created samples. The generative model learns a mapping from a low-dimensional vector to the high-dimensional input space, aiming to generate samples that diminish the effect of adversarial perturbations. During GAN training, the generator G aims to produce samples resembling the training data. Adversarial samples are projected onto G's range to reduce perturbations, improving defense against attacks. Empirical evidence supports this Defense-GAN approach against black-box and white-box attacks on image datasets. The paper also covers attack models, defense mechanisms, and GANs. Defense-GAN, a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks in classification problems, is introduced in Section 3. The paper discusses attack models, defense mechanisms, and the use of GANs for defense. Various attack models aim to find a small perturbation \u03b4 to be added to a legitimate input x, resulting in an adversarial example x = x + \u03b4. In the context of defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks, various threat levels are considered, including black-and white-box attacks. White-box attacks assume complete knowledge of classifier parameters and defense mechanisms. Attacks can be targeted or untargeted, with a focus on untargeted white-box attacks using different methods like FGSM, RAND+FGSM, and CW. The FGSM attack is a fast and simple algorithm that uses the sign of the gradient to determine perturbation direction. RAND+FGSM enhances FGSM for white-box attacks, while the CW attack is a powerful white-box attack. These three models cover a broad range of attack algorithms. The RAND+FGSM BID21 attack enhances the FGSM attack by adding random noise before perturbing the image. The CW attack is an optimization-based attack that can reduce classifier accuracy to almost 0%. The perturbation \u03b4 is found by solving an optimization problem. For black-box attacks, untargeted FGSM attacks are considered on a substitute model. Adversaries train a substitute model with a small dataset augmented by synthetic images labeled by querying the classifier. Adversarial examples designed to fool the substitute often end up being misclassified by the targeted classifier. Various defense mechanisms have been employed to combat the threat from adversarial attacks. One popular approach is to augment the training dataset with adversarial examples generated using chosen attack models. This strategy increases robustness, especially against white-box attacks, but may not perform as well against different attack strategies. Defensive distillation trains the classifier in two rounds to reduce gradient amplitude around input points, making it hard for attackers to create adversarial examples. While effective against white-box attacks, it fails to protect against black-box attacks. MagNet introduces a reformer network to move adversarial examples closer to legitimate examples, strengthening defense mechanisms. Defense-GAN is a defense mechanism that uses GANs and GD minimization to find latent codes, making it more robust against white-box attacks compared to MagNet, which uses auto-encoders. GANs consist of two neural networks, G and D, where G maps a low-dimensional latent space to the high dimensional sample space of x, and D is a binary neural network classifier. In training, G and D are learned adversarially using actual input data samples. Defense-GAN utilizes GANs with adversarial training of neural networks G and D to enhance robustness against white-box attacks. G learns to generate outputs similar to input data samples x, while D discriminates between real and fake samples. WGANs are used as the generative model due to their stable training methods. Defense-GAN utilizes GANs with adversarial training of neural networks G and D to enhance robustness against white-box attacks. The algorithm ensures global optimum by matching generator distribution to data distribution. If G and D have sufficient capacity and training algorithm converges, the generator converges to data distribution. Defense-GAN is a defense strategy using GANs to combat adversarial attacks on classification networks. The algorithm involves finding z * to minimize G(z * ) and inputting it to the classifier. This step aims to reduce adversarial noise and maintain classifier performance on natural samples. Defense-GAN utilizes GANs to defend against adversarial attacks on classification networks by employing random restarts for training. The GAN is trained unsupervised on the classifier training dataset, allowing for training on original images, G-generated reconstructions, or a combination of both. This approach differs from existing defense mechanisms as it can be used with any classifier without modifying its structure, serving as a pre-processing step. Defense-GAN can be used as a defense against adversarial attacks on classification networks without the need for re-training the classifier. It leverages the generative power of GANs to reconstruct adversarial examples, making it effective against black-box and white-box attacks. Defense-GAN is utilized to defend against adversarial attacks on classification networks without re-training the classifier. It reconstructs adversarial examples using GANs, making it effective against black-box and white-box attacks. Gradients are computed on the classifier and defense networks to find adversarial examples, with details of architectures, parameters, and random seed accessible to the attacker. The method is compared to adversarial training and MagNet under various white-box attacks, as well as a black-box attack. In our experiments, we use two different image datasets: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, each with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The training images are split into a set of 50,000 images for training and a validation set of 10,000 images. For white-box attacks, the testing set remains the same, while for black-box attacks, a small hold-out set of 150 samples is reserved for adversary substitute training. In the experiments, a hold-out set of 150 samples is reserved for adversary substitute training in black-box attacks. The attacker trains a substitute model using a limited dataset of legitimate and synthetic images labeled with the target classifier. FGSM black-box attacks successfully reduce classifier accuracy by up to 70%. Defense mechanisms are effective at mitigating the attacks, with Defense-GAN-Rec performing as expected. The Defense-GAN-Rec and Defense-GAN-Orig perform similarly well against attacks, with Defense-GAN outperforming MagNet. Adversarial training defenses show decreased performance with incorrect knowledge of attack parameters, and are only effective against FGSM attacks. Defense-GAN and MagNet are more general in their defense capabilities. The Defense-GAN and MagNet are general defense mechanisms that do not assume a specific attack model. The performances of defenses on the F-MNIST dataset are lower than on MNIST due to the large noise in the FGSM attack. The Defense-GAN parameters were kept the same to study the effect of dataset complexity, and varying the number of GD iterations and random restarts had a comparable performance on Defense-GAN-Rec and Defense-GAN-Orig. Increasing L improves performance without attacks, but with an FGSM attack, performance decreases after a certain L value. Too many GD iterations on MSE retain adversarial noise components. Varying R has a significant effect due to the non-convex nature of MSE, enabling sampling of different local minima. Higher  leads to more successful FGSM attacks, especially on F-MNIST dataset with a notable drop in performance. Adversarial samples and their reconstructions with Defense-GAN at different  values are shown in Figure 7. Defense-GAN can be used to diminish the effect of attacks and detect them by comparing clean images to adversarial examples. The MSE of an image with its reconstruction from Defense-GAN can be used as a measure of attack strength. The MSE of an image with its reconstruction from Defense-GAN can be used as a metric to detect adversarially manipulated images. ROC curves and AUC metrics show the effectiveness of this attack detection strategy, especially with large numbers of GD iterations and random restarts. The number of random restarts is crucial for detecting false positives and true positives in attacks. Results on white-box attacks using FGSM, RAND+FGSM, and CW strategies are presented. Defense-GAN outperforms other defenses in classification performance. Adversarial training with FGSM was used, and attacker access to random initializations did not significantly impact performance. Defense-GAN is resilient to GD-based white-box attacks, with a larger L increasing robustness but also increasing inference time complexity. The difficulty of GD-based white-box attacks is discussed further in the appendices. Defense-GAN is a novel defense strategy utilizing GANs to enhance classification model robustness against black-box and white-box adversarial attacks. Experimental results on higher-dimensional images are reported in Appendix F, showing Defense-GAN's effectiveness against various attack strategies on MNIST and F-MNIST datasets. Defense-GAN is a feasible defense mechanism against adversarial attacks, but implementing and deploying it may pose practical difficulties. The success of Defense-GAN depends on the training and tuning of GANs, which is a challenging task. The choice of hyper-parameters L and R is critical for the defense's effectiveness, and tuning them without knowledge of the attack can be challenging. The optimal discriminator for WGANs is such that p_data(x) = p_g to minimize the loss. To perform a white-box attack on models using Defense-GAN, an attacker needs to compute the gradient of the classifier's output with respect to the input. The generator and classifier act as a combined network, making gradient propagation easy. The challenge lies in the GD optimization process, where z* is recursively computed. The gradient computation involves a large number of steps. The text describes the challenges of computing the gradient of z* with respect to x in neural network architectures, involving recursive chain rules and high-dimensional Jacobian tensors. It also details the various network architectures used, including convolutional layers, fully-connected layers, dropout layers, and activation functions like ReLU and LeakyReLU. The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 face images for gender classification using a GAN architecture with additional layers. The time complexity of reconstructing images with Defense-GAN depends on the number of iterations and gradient computation time. The average running time for reconstructions of MNIST and F-MNIST images on a GPU is shown in TAB0. Random restarts in R have minimal impact on running time. There is a tradeoff between running time, defense robustness, and accuracy."
