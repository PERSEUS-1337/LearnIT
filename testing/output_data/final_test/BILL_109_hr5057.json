Brigadier General Francis Marion, born in 1732 in South Carolina, led the Williamsburg Militia Revolutionary force in disrupting British supply lines with unconventional tactics during the Revolutionary War. He and his forces would retreat into swamps after lightning raids on British convoys, earning him the nickname \"swamp fox.\" Brigadier General Francis Marion, known as the \"Swamp Fox,\" led a racially integrated force during the Revolutionary War. His victory at the Battle of Eutaw Springs was recognized by Congress, and he also served as a statesman representing South Carolina at the Constitutional Convention. Congress has authorized commemorative works for celebrated Americans in the District of Columbia. Brigadier General Francis Marion, also known as the \"Swamp Fox,\" led a racially integrated force during the Revolutionary War. Despite his significant contributions to the nation's heritage, there is currently no formal memorial to him in Washington, DC. It is time to correct this oversight and ensure that future generations understand his lasting significance. The Marion Park Project, under the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, has the authority to establish a commemorative work honoring Brigadier General Francis Marion in Washington, DC. The work must comply with the Commemorative Works Act and cannot use federal funds for its establishment. The Marion Park Project, a committee of the Palmetto Conservation Foundation, is responsible for accepting contributions and paying expenses for the establishment of a commemorative work honoring Brigadier General Francis Marion in Washington, DC. Any excess funds after expenses are paid will be deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Marion Park Project committee is responsible for establishing a commemorative work honoring Brigadier General Francis Marion in Washington, DC.

The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 24, 2006. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
