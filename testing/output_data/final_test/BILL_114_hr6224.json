    "content": "The Act titled \"Enhancing Minority and Women Representation in NIH Medical Research Act of 2016\" aims to collaborate to enhance diversity in clinical research. Section 402(b) of the Public Health Service Act is amended to require accurate data collection for assessing research priorities, including evaluating scientific opportunities, public health burdens, and reducing health disparities. This includes data on study populations in clinical research, specifying the inclusion of women, minority groups, and relevant age categories. The amendment to Section 402(b) of the Public Health Service Act requires accurate data collection for assessing research priorities, including demographic variables determined by the Director of NIH. The data must be disaggregated by research area, condition, and disease categories, and made publicly available on the NIH website. Additionally, the amendment aims to foster collaboration between clinical research projects funded by national research institutes and centers. The amendment encourages collaboration between research institutes conducting human subjects research and collecting similar data to increase the number of subjects studied and utilize diverse study populations to address health disparities. SEC. 3. PROMOTING INCLUSION IN CLINICAL RESEARCH. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act requires consultation between national institutes and centers with the Directors of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities and the Office of Research on Women's Health to focus on reducing health disparities for women and minorities in strategic planning. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act mandates reporting requirements for new clinical research projects receiving grant awards after a specified date. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act requires entities conducting applicable clinical trials to submit results to the clinical trial registry data bank. The Director of NIH will consider compliance with reporting requirements when awarding future grants. The Public Health Service Act is amended to change biennial reporting to triennial reporting for advisory councils of national research institutes. Reports must now include the number and proportion of women subjects in clinical research projects. The curr_chunk focuses on reporting requirements for clinical research projects, including the inclusion of women and minority groups as subjects. It specifies the need to disaggregate data by research area, condition, or disease, and account for single-sex studies. The curr_chunk amends reporting requirements for clinical research projects, specifying the completion of studies during the reporting period. Coordination is also addressed by updating the designation of senior-level staff. The curr_chunk focuses on improving coordination related to minority health and health disparities. Section 464z-3 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to improve coordination within the National Institutes of Health for minority health and health disparities. The Director of the Institute may facilitate partnerships and funding for collaborative research projects related to minority health and health disparities within the National Institutes of Health. SEC. 5. WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN RESEARCH. The Director of NIH is required to develop policies for basic research projects funded by the National Institutes of Health to assess relevant biological variables, including sex, and how differences between male and female cells, tissues, or animals may be examined and analyzed. The policies can be updated or revised as needed, and consultation with relevant parties is required during the development process. The Director of NIH must consult with the Office of Research on Women's Health, the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, and members of the scientific and academic communities. They are also required to conduct outreach to gather feedback on the impact of sex as a variable in basic research projects. Additionally, the Director must ensure that basic research projects funded by NIH consider relevant biological variables, including sex differences in cells, tissues, or animals. The Director of NIH, in consultation with relevant offices, must ensure that basic research projects funded by NIH consider sex differences in analysis and results disaggregation. Additionally, guidelines under the Public Health Service Act must be updated within a year. The guidelines under the Public Health Service Act must be updated to reflect science on sex differences, improve adherence to reporting requirements, and clarify when studies should be designed to detect demographic differences in intervention effects. The guidelines under the Public Health Service Act need to be updated to reflect science on sex differences and improve reporting requirements, including the need to detect demographic differences in study outcomes."
