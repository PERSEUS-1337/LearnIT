    "content": "The Act titled \"Commercial Fisheries Waste Reduction Act of 1993\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". It includes findings related to commercial fisheries waste reduction. The Congress finds that current commercial fisheries practices in the United States and worldwide result in significant waste of edible food resources, including juvenile fish with greater economic value if allowed to mature before harvesting, and adult fish or fish parts that could be processed for human consumption but are discarded for various fisheries management purposes. Fish currently harvested but discarded without processing include significant numbers of fish of species for which there is presently no viable market, but which, if they remained unharvested, could form the basis for future fisheries as new markets and processing techniques are developed. There is concern that current levels of mortalities among non-target fish species may have adverse environmental consequences, and high discard levels may cause damage to the productivity of ocean bottom resources. The current scientific knowledge is insufficient to determine if removing nutrients returned to the ocean through fish discards may have adverse impacts. It is important to minimize mortalities among non-target species and utilize all parts of harvested fish for environmental and economic reasons. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO MAGNUSON ACT. The Fisheries Conservation and Management Act is amended to include provisions for maintaining resources in a non-wasteful manner, limiting mortality in non-target species, and defining non-target species as those caught incidentally during fishing. The Fisheries Conservation and Management Act is amended to include provisions for minimizing mortalities among non-target species, reducing discards of fish, and assessing fishery resources. The Fisheries Conservation and Management Act is amended to include provisions for estimating mortalities among non-target species and discard levels of fish, as well as implementing measures to reduce mortalities and encourage the use of target species to minimize discards. The Fisheries Conservation and Management Act now requires each council to submit management plan amendments within one year to comply with specific subsections. Additionally, councils must submit annual reports on changes to estimates and descriptions, providing explanations for any modifications."
