    "content": "The U.S. electric grid and energy pipeline network are critical infrastructure, with over 700,000 miles of transmission lines and 55,000 substations connecting power plants to 150 million customers. The pipeline network spans over 2.9 million miles, transporting natural gas, oil, and hazardous liquids. Cyber threats to these systems have become a growing concern in recent years. Cyber threats against energy infrastructure, particularly in the electric subsector and pipeline systems, have increased in frequency and severity. The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security are tasked with assessing the impacts of cyberattacks on the energy sector. Grid and pipeline cybersecurity are interconnected due to the physical interdependency between electricity generators and natural gas pipelines. The Department of Energy leads efforts to protect electric power, oil, and natural gas infrastructure, working closely with the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Energy, specifically the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, is leading cybersecurity efforts to protect the power grid. The FAST Act in 2015 granted the Secretary of Energy additional authority to address grid security emergencies, including cyber threats. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to fund and expand DOE's cybersecurity programs, with proposed appropriations in various acts. Additional funding for cybersecurity is also being considered in bills such as the Energy and Natural Resources Act of 2017 and the Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2017. The Preparedness Act of 2017 (H.R. 3050) would authorize additional DOE funding for cybersecurity research and assistance to states. This report examines the energy sector cybersecurity program administered by DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability for the electric power and pipelines subsectors, summarizing risks, threats, recent cyberattacks, legislative authorities, and policy guidance. Key policy issues for Congress are also discussed. Federal security officials and industry analysts have long identified the grid and pipelines in the United States as potential targets for intentional disruption. The United States faces evolving cyber risks, with concerns about terrorist groups targeting supervisory control systems. The pipeline industry is increasingly worried about cybersecurity threats, and the DOE has highlighted growing sophistication in malicious cyber activity against the electricity system. The threat of terrorist groups using cyber tools against critical infrastructure is a concern, but they have not yet attacked U.S. infrastructure in this way. The electricity grid and energy pipelines face similar cybersecurity risks as other industries. Different adversaries may target various systems based on their motivations. Industrial control systems (ICS) are vulnerable to cyber threats, used in monitoring and controlling operations for various networks. SCADA systems are widely used in power grids and pipeline networks to collect real-time data from sensors and allow operators to control equipment remotely. The system provides continuous feedback and generates safety alarms when needed. Communication links can include various methods such as telephone landlines, wireless communications, and the Internet. As technology advances, system control becomes more intelligent and automated. SCADA technology has evolved to be more automated and intelligent, reducing the need for human intervention. However, this advancement has made SCADA systems more vulnerable to outside intrusion due to standardized control system technologies with known vulnerabilities, increased connection to external networks, insecure communication connections, and the public availability of sensitive information. SCADA systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to standardized technologies, insecure communication connections, and public availability of sensitive information. Attackers can exploit SCADA systems by issuing unauthorized commands, sending false information, disrupting operations, making unauthorized changes to software, and propagating malicious software. These cyberattacks could disrupt services, cause environmental releases, or damage equipment. In 2007, a proof-of-concept attack known as the Aurora Project demonstrated how a diesel-fueled electric generator could be destroyed without operators knowing. This experiment involved sending commands to the generator to cause failure while displaying normal operation on the control panel. More recently, the emergence of malware like CrashOverride poses a threat to the energy sector by allowing attackers to disrupt ICS operations by manipulating electric circuit breakers. In 2016, an updated version of the malware CrashOverride was used in an attack against the Ukrainian electric grid. Most public cyberattacks in recent years have targeted electricity generation and delivery infrastructure. In 2012, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) identified cyber intrusions among U.S. natural gas pipeline operators. These intrusions included targeted spear-phishing attempts and intrusions into multiple natural gas pipeline sector organizations. The Stuxnet computer worm, identified in 2010, targeted specific Siemens industrial SCADA systems. The Aurora Project and CrashOverride malware also pose threats to energy delivery systems. The Clinton Administration's PDD-63 in 1998 established national policy for critical infrastructure protection. DOE has cybersecurity authority for energy systems. PDD-63 established national policy for critical infrastructure protection from physical and cyber threats, using a public-private partnership. DOE was assigned responsibility for electric power and oil/natural gas sectors. The George W. Bush Administration superseded PDD-63 with HSPD-7 in 2003, expanding sectors and removing \"special functions.\" In HSPD-7, lead agencies were replaced by Sector Specific Agencies (SSA) for transportation and energy subsectors. DHS was named as the SSA for transportation, including pipelines, while DOE was assigned responsibility for the energy sector. DHS focused on a risk-based approach to allocate federal resources based on vulnerability assessments and stakeholder input. Congress also passed legislation on cybersecurity for energy delivery systems during the George W. Bush Administration. During the George W. Bush Administration, legislation was passed on cybersecurity for energy delivery systems through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT). This act established the Electricity Modernization Act of 2005, directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to create an \"Electric Reliability Organization\" (ERO) to develop reliability standards for the bulk power system, including cybersecurity protection. FERC's authority is limited to reviewing the ERO's standards, not creating them independently. FERC reviews ERO's standards but cannot create them independently. FERC's regulatory authority over natural gas pipelines is limited to siting and rate regulation, not safety or security. The Obama Administration replaced HSPD-7 with PPD-21 in 2013, focusing on critical infrastructure security and resilience. PPD-21 aimed to integrate cybersecurity into critical infrastructure protection by clarifying federal roles for security and resilience. PPD-21, established in 2013, focused on critical infrastructure protection by clarifying federal roles for security and resilience. It designated DOE as the SSA for the energy sector, with DHS as co-chair for the transportation sector. Congress further legislated on energy sector cybersecurity in 2015 with the FAST Act, directing DOE to collaborate with DHS and prioritize activity, incident management, and vulnerability. The Trump Administration issued Executive Order 13800 (E.O. 13800) on \"Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure,\" requiring DOE and DHS to assess U.S. readiness for managing consequences of a prolonged power outage due to a significant cyber incident. DOE also developed a plan for strategic transformer reserve options in response to a FAST Act directive, focusing on addressing disruptions in power delivery. The federal government has issued various policy documents over the last two decades addressing cybersecurity for energy infrastructure, resulting in the current DOE energy delivery cybersecurity program. The National Plan for Information Systems Protection in 2000 identified the electric power system and pipelines as critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyber attacks. The infrastructures heavily rely on telecommunications, energy production, and distribution networks. The DOE is the lead agency for protecting electric power and oil and gas infrastructure, while DOT leads for pipelines. The energy sector is identified as critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyber threats. The strategy emphasized securing digital control systems (DCS) and SCADA in the electric power and pipeline sectors, calling for coordination among DHS, DOE, other agencies, and private industry. In 2006, DOE and DHS released a Roadmap to Secure Control Systems in the Energy Sector, focusing on critical infrastructure protection for the U.S. electric grid and oil and gas pipeline networks. The vision was for control systems to be designed, installed, and operated securely within 10 years. The 2011 Roadmap to Achieve Energy Delivery Systems Cybersecurity, sponsored by DOE, aims for control systems to withstand cyber attacks while maintaining critical functions by 2020 in the electricity, oil, and natural gas sectors. The 2011 Roadmap sponsored by DOE aims for energy delivery systems to withstand cyber attacks by 2020 in the electricity, oil, and natural gas sectors. Energy delivery systems include processes for producing, transferring, and distributing energy, along with control systems and communication networks. DOE, in coordination with DHS, released an Energy Sector-Specific Plan in 2015 to enhance security and resilience in critical infrastructure. The 2015 Energy Sector-Specific Plan (SSP) emphasizes cross-sector interdependency issues and cyber-physical security integration. It defines the Energy Sector as electricity, oil, and natural gas segments, excluding pipelines. This exclusion aligns with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) where pipelines fall under the transportation sector. DOE and DHS collaborate on security efforts. The Energy Sector-Specific Plan (SSP) highlights DOE and DHS collaboration on security efforts for critical infrastructure sectors, including pipelines, maritime, chemical, and dams. The SSP also focuses on deploying government technologies for improved situational awareness and implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in the electricity subsector. FERC, TSA, and DOE are key federal agencies involved in cybersecurity for energy infrastructure. FERC has authority over grid reliability and approves mandatory cybersecurity standards proposed by NERC. Grid security is a high priority for FERC, with enforceable standards in place. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considers grid security a high priority and has established the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) to address cyber and physical security concerns. The U.S. pipeline security program began after the September 11, 2001 attacks, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) initially under the Department of Transportation (DOT) before being transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS remains the lead agency for pipeline security. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) directs TSA to regulate pipeline security and enforce necessary inspections. TSA has primary responsibility for the security of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines in the United States, while DHS relies on voluntary industry compliance with security guidance. Cybersecurity is also included in voluntary security standards developed by the pipeline industry. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates the safety of oil and natural gas pipelines under specific acts. The Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 introduced new requirements for control room management that could impact cybersecurity. The DOE's energy delivery cybersecurity activities are overseen by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE). The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) leads cybersecurity activities to make the nation's electric power grid and oil and natural gas infrastructure resilient to cyber threats by 2020. The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) focuses on cybersecurity for energy delivery systems, structured around cybersecurity preparedness, incident response, and research. OE works with energy sector companies to detect and mitigate risks rapidly, co-funding the Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program (CRISP) for timely information sharing. The Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC) and OE's Cybersecurity for the Operational Technology Environment (CYOTE) pilot program focus on two-way data sharing and analysis for energy sector operational technology. OE supports training programs for cybersecurity in the energy sector and works on developing better cyber risk analysis tools and guidelines for energy infrastructure. The Office of Electricity (OE) has developed the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2) for the energy sector infrastructure, including electricity, oil, and natural gas. The model helps operators assess their cybersecurity capabilities and prioritize improvements. OE has also provided guidance to align cyber risk management with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a voluntary guidance to reduce cybersecurity risks in critical infrastructure. The Office of Electricity (OE) has developed a Cybersecurity Risk Management Process (RMP) guideline in collaboration with NIST and NERC for the electricity sector. Presidential Policy Directive 41 (PPD-41) outlines the federal government's response framework for cyber incidents, with DHS leading asset response, FBI leading threat response, and the Intelligence Community providing support. The National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP) outlined in PPD-41 establishes a Cyber Unified Coordination Group (Cyber UCG) to manage cybersecurity incidents and coordinate federal resources. The Cyber UCG includes federal, state, local, private sector, and other relevant parties and operates at DHS's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). OE plays a significant role in the Cyber UCG for cyber incidents in the energy sector, but there is no record of it being activated. DOE collaborates with TSA and PHMSA for pipeline security, following a plan from 2010 that has not been updated for cyber incidents. OE also manages a cybersecurity RD&D program. OE administers a cybersecurity research, development, and demonstration program focused on energy sector asset owners. The agency has invested over $210 million since 2010 in projects related to cybersecurity tools and technology, primarily in electric power applications. The Office of Electricity (OE) funds the National SCADA Test Bed (NSTB) in partnership with national laboratories to address control system security challenges in the energy sector. The NSTB offers testing facilities and advanced tools for cyber security assessment of SCADA systems in the electricity sector. OE is also investing in expanding the power grid test bed at Idaho National Laboratory. The Office of Electricity (OE) is expanding the power grid test bed at Idaho National Laboratory to support research, testing, and demonstration for electric transmission and substation cyber threats. Collaborative teams of academic institutions funded by OE develop cybersecurity tools for the energy sector, such as the Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power Grid (TCIPG). This initiative focuses on ensuring the trustworthy operation of devices, communications, and data systems in the power grid. The cybersecurity programs and technologies developed in one sector can be applied to others, but customization is often needed to meet specific sector requirements. Industry representatives state that natural gas pipeline companies collaborate closely with the Department of Energy on cybersecurity, developing practices and guidelines to address relevant risks and threats. OE's cybersecurity focus is primarily on the electric power sector, but some projects involve the pipeline sector. Projects like SASEDS and Chess Master aim to develop next-generation cybersecurity tools for multiple energy delivery sectors. Collaboration with industry partners like San Diego Gas & Electric helps in transferring new technology. OE's cybersecurity focus is primarily on the electric power sector, with some projects involving the pipeline sector. Collaboration with industry partners like San Diego Gas & Electric facilitates the transfer of new technology between sectors. Regulatory authorities like FERC and TSA oversee cybersecurity in the bulk power and pipeline systems. Collaboration between OE and these agencies on specific cybersecurity programs is limited. OE's cybersecurity focus is primarily on the electric power sector, with some projects involving the pipeline sector. Collaboration with industry partners like San Diego Gas & Electric facilitates the transfer of new technology between sectors. Regulatory authorities like FERC and TSA oversee cybersecurity in the bulk power and pipeline systems. OE's statement before FERC's 2016 Reliability Technical Conference does not mention RD&D collaboration, although it discusses OE's leadership of electric grid emergency preparedness exercises. Collaboration between OE and DHS S&T on grid cybersecurity is mentioned, but the level of cooperation with TSA in pipeline security is unclear. TSA's cybersecurity activities testimony in 2016 did not specifically mention working with DOE. In 2014, TSA's pipeline security director mentioned coordination with DHS and DOE for cybersecurity risk management programs. A 2010 GAO report highlighted TSA and DOE's collaboration on pipeline security issues. In 2007, national laboratories coordinated activities funded by DHS and DOE for SCADA assessments. DOT issued an Advisory Bulletin in 2016 recommending pipeline companies monitor their SCADA systems for abnormalities. The DOT issued an Advisory Bulletin recommending pipeline companies monitor SCADA systems for abnormal operations and unauthorized access. The House passed the Defense Appropriations Act, 2018 providing $218.5 million for DOE's OE program. Collaboration between OE and DOT on cybersecurity is not well-documented. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (S. 1609) would appropriate $213,141,000 for OE, with $27,000,000 allocated for program direction until September 30, 2019. Cybersecurity of energy infrastructure is addressed in Title II of S. 1460, focusing on establishing a program for energy sector cybersecurity RD&D to identify and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities. The bill, S. 1460, focuses on interdependencies of critical infrastructure sectors and authorizes appropriations of $65 million annually from FY2018 through FY2026 for cybersecurity RD&D efforts. It also requires DOE to support a cyber-resilience program with $10 million annually for emergency response capabilities testing and monitoring of the energy sector. Additionally, DOE will develop modeling and risk assessment tools for cyber-resilience in securing energy. The bill, S. 1460, authorizes $10 million annually from FY2018 through FY2026 for developing tools to enhance energy sector security and resilience from human threats and natural hazards. It aligns with the 2011 Roadmap for Energy Delivery Systems Cybersecurity goals. Additionally, the House passed H.R. 3050, providing $90 million annually through FY2022 for state energy security planning and emergency preparedness. The bill authorizes $90 million annually for states to assess cybersecurity threats to energy infrastructure and provide technical assistance for state energy security plans. Issues related to OE's energy delivery cybersecurity program and budget requests are also highlighted. The House and Senate appropriations bills propose funding OE at $218.5 million and $213.1 million, respectively, for Energy Delivery Systems, a reduction of approximately 32% from FY2017. Some analysts are concerned about the proposed budget cut in cybersecurity, while additional authorizations under S. 1460 and H.R. 3050 could significantly expand resources for DOE's energy delivery cybersecurity initiatives. The FAST Act includes provisions for cybersecurity in the energy sector, such as addressing cyber and physical attacks, coordinating energy sector security, and preparing for energy supply disruptions. Congress may need to assess DOE's implementation of the law and consider if additional authorities or changes are necessary. The FAST Act does not mandate reviews by the DOE Inspector General or other agencies on DOE's implementation progress. Congress can oversee DOE through hearings, new reports, or requests for information. The interdependency of the electric power and natural gas sectors, especially in reliability and cybersecurity, is a concern. The QER highlights this in its second installment. The QER, published in January 2017, emphasizes the need to secure natural gas pipelines against cybersecurity threats to ensure the reliability of the electric system. Recommendations include assessing interdependencies between natural gas and electricity infrastructure for cybersecurity protection. Concerns have been raised by Members of Congress and NERC about the security implications of the increasing interdependency of electric power and natural gas. Executive Order 13636 directs DHS to work with SSAs like DOE on cybersecurity measures. Executive Order 13636 directs DHS, in consultation with SSAs like DOE, to identify critical infrastructure at risk of catastrophic impact from cybersecurity incidents. The analysis may need to consider both direct and indirect impacts on interconnected infrastructure. Congress may be interested in how DOE's cybersecurity programs can inform this analysis. Other federal agencies, state regulators, and NERC have raised concerns about the increasing interdependency of electric power and natural gas. Federal agencies like FERC, DHS, and DOE, along with state regulators and energy companies, share roles in energy sector cybersecurity. However, coordination among these entities is fragmented, with DHS leading critical infrastructure protection and incident coordination, while DOE serves as the SSA for the energy sector. The dispersed cybersecurity responsibility at the federal level has drawn congressional interest but has not been fully studied for its impact on energy cybersecurity stakeholders. Congress may examine how OE's cybersecurity activities fit in and coordinate with other roles in energy cybersecurity for electricity, oil, and natural gas pipelines. This includes looking at how OE's RD&D programs and work with National Labs support federal and private sector efforts in pipeline cybersecurity."
