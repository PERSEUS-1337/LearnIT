    "content": "If conflict arises in budgeting, a government shutdown may occur due to delays in enacting appropriations acts. Congress and the President have options like reaching agreements by October 1, using interim CRs for temporary funding, or facing a shutdown if no agreements are made. If Congress and the President do not reach agreements on full-year appropriations by October 1, a government shutdown may occur. Funding can be provided through regular appropriations acts, omnibus legislation, or a full-year CR. Shutdowns happen when a funding gap begins and activities are affected, leading to a temporary halt in government operations. The federal government faces shutdowns if full-year appropriations are not agreed upon by October 1. A funding gap can lead to a shutdown if interim or full-year appropriations are not enacted, causing a temporary halt in agency operations. A government shutdown occurs when there is a funding gap and leads to the furlough of personnel and curtailment of agency activities. This can happen if regular appropriations bills are not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year. Funding gaps occurred from FY1977 to FY1996, with durations ranging from 3 to 21 days. Legal opinions in 1980 and 1981 restricted agency activities during funding gaps. Funding gaps shortened after FY1980, but a significant exception occurred in FY1996 with two shutdowns totaling 26 days. In November 1995, a five-day funding gap occurred, followed by a 21-day gap in December 1995-January 1996. Funding gaps did not happen again for over 17 years until October 1, 2013, when a 16-day shutdown occurred. In FY2018, two brief shutdowns occurred, highlighting challenges in counting the days of a funding gap or shutdown. The first FY2018 shutdown began after a CR expired on January 19, 2018. The second FY2018 shutdown began after a CR expired on January 19, 2018, leading to a funding gap and shutdown over the weekend. Agencies were directed to plan for an orderly shutdown, and OPM warned of potential impacts on agency operations. Funding resumed on January 22, 2018, but many agencies continued to shut down operations and furlough employees due to the timing of the CR enactment. Employees were expected to return to work on January 23, 2018. The second FY2018 shutdown began after a CR expired on January 19, 2018. OMB directed agencies to execute shutdown plans when funding expired on February 8, 2018. However, a new CR was enacted on February 9, 2018, prompting employees to return to work that morning. While technically no funding gap occurred, some agency operations may have been affected during the brief period between CR expiration and enactment. The legal framework for funding gaps and shutdowns is provided by provisions, court opinions, and Department of Justice (DOJ) opinions. The Antideficiency Act in Title 31 of the U.S. Code prohibits federal officials from obligating funds before an appropriations measure has been enacted, except as authorized by law. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal officials from obligating funds before an appropriations measure has been enacted, except as authorized by law. It also prohibits accepting voluntary services or employing personal services exceeding what has been authorized by law. Failure to comply may result in criminal sanctions, fines, and administrative discipline. Exceptions are made for emergencies involving human life or property protection. Many agencies continued to operate during funding gaps before 1980, minimizing nonessential operations while waiting for appropriations acts or CRs. In 1980 and 1981, U.S. Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti issued opinions interpreting the Antideficiency Act strictly during funding gaps. The opinions stated that agencies could only continue operations if there was a reasonable connection to human life or property protection. Exceptions were limited, and agencies were advised to suspend operations until appropriations were enacted. During funding gaps, U.S. Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti strictly interpreted the Antideficiency Act in 1980 and 1981. Agencies could only continue operations if there was a reasonable connection to human life or property protection. Exceptions were limited, and agencies were advised to suspend operations until appropriations were enacted. The 1981 Civiletti opinion identified four sub-types of \"authorized by law\" exceptions, including activities funded with appropriations that do not expire at the end of one fiscal year. Activities authorized by statutes that expressly permit obligations in advance of appropriations, such as contract authority, fall under exceptions to the Antideficiency Act. The Civiletti opinion illustrated this concept with an example involving benefit payments under an entitlement program funded from permanent entitlement authority, while salaries of program administrators are funded by one-year appropriations. The Attorney General and GAO provided views on the Antideficiency Act, stating that obligations necessary for benefit payments and presidential initiatives are authorized by law. The 1980 Civiletti opinion allowed federal officers to incur minimal obligations in the absence of appropriations for orderly agency closure. OMB later interpreted this exception. In 1990, Congress clarified that emergencies involving safety or property do not include regular government functions. The 1995 OLC opinion modified aspects of the 1981 Civiletti opinion in light of this amendment. The 1981 opinion on government operations during a funding gap remains a sound analysis of legal authorities. OMB has issued detailed memoranda on exceptions to the Antideficiency Act in recent years. OLC and OMB do not allow outlays to liquidate federal obligations without appropriated funding during a shutdown. Exceptions only permit obligations that will be paid upon enactment of appropriations. The Circular No. A-11 provides instructions to agencies on operating during a funding gap, citing legal opinions and establishing policies on incurring obligations. The Circular No. A-11 authorizes agencies to incur obligations for orderly termination of functions but prohibits disbursements. Agency heads must develop shutdown plans, now requiring more detailed information and periodic updates since the 2011 revision. OMB's Circular No. A-11 requires agencies to update shutdown plans every two years starting August 1, 2015. Agency heads must use DOJ opinions and the circular to determine authorized activities during a funding lapse. Plans must address actions during a shutdown's initial one to five-day period. During a shutdown, agencies must have a plan that includes a summary of activities that will continue or cease, an estimate of shutdown completion time, employee numbers, and exceptions to the Antideficiency Act. During a government shutdown, agencies must have a plan outlining essential activities, estimated completion time, employee numbers, and exceptions to the Antideficiency Act. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to release employees according to applicable law and regulations, with guidance available on OPM's website. OMB directs agencies to notify employees two days before a potential lapse in coordination with OMB. Employees to be furloughed are referred to as \"released,\" while those not furloughed are \"excepted\" or \"retained.\" During a government shutdown, agencies must have a plan outlining essential activities, estimated completion time, employee numbers, and exceptions to the Antideficiency Act. Officials and observers may use various personnel-related terms, many starting with the letter \"e.\" OMB provides guidance to agencies on employee release procedures, with OPM offering access to relevant documents. Different terms may be used officially or colloquially, and OMB may issue detailed guidance in specific situations. During a government shutdown, agencies receive guidance from OMB through bulletins or memoranda, which can be internal or publicly visible. Congress may be interested in non-public guidance documents in certain situations. During shutdown planning, OMB provided detailed guidance to agencies before funding near-impasses in FY2011 and FY2012. Agencies were instructed to create or revise shutdown plans and post them online. OMB coordinated contingency planning efforts in accordance with the Antideficiency Act through non-public documents. This guidance was also provided for the impasses of FY2014 and FY2018. During the near-impasses of FY2011 and FY2012, as well as the actual impasses of FY2014 and FY2018, agencies and OMB followed a similar process of posting shutdown plans online. OMB posted agencies' plans on a web page, and agencies also created their own pages with additional information. Topics covered included shutdown procedures, furlough policies, government service availability, and past shutdown information. Agencies implemented their plans after OMB instructed them to do so for the FY2014 and FY2018 shutdowns. In 2013, OMB directed agencies to prepare for a potential government shutdown due to uncertainty about Congress acting in time. The effects of a shutdown can impact federal officials and employees, lead to furloughs, affect government operations, and services to the public. Shutdown plans were posted online during past impasses, with agencies following OMB instructions for implementation. During a government shutdown, employees may be placed on furlough without pay, but historically they have received retroactive pay through legislation. Shutdown furloughs do not break service and can impact benefits and seniority. Various factors are considered when deciding on retroactive pay for furloughed staff. During a government shutdown, employees may be furloughed without pay but historically have received retroactive pay through legislation. Employees furloughed during the FY2014 shutdown were required to be paid retroactively, including excepted employees who are entitled to receive payment for work performed during the appropriations lapse. Payroll centers will pay all excepted employees for time worked after appropriations are enacted. The 1981 memorandum from OMB to executive departments and agencies stated that funds may not be available during a appropriations hiatus, but the US will not contest legal obligation to pay for excepted services. Congress has historically authorized retroactive pay for excepted employees who work during a government shutdown. For example, the CR enacted after the FY2014 shutdown included provisions for retroactive pay. The authority granted by the joint resolution for maintaining essential activities during a government shutdown is ratified and approved. Congress has taken similar actions in past shutdowns, such as in FY1996 and FY2014, which showed the impact of furloughs. Shutdown duration affects the extent of furloughs, driven by unenacted appropriations bills. Shutdowns of shorter duration may not produce significant information on their effects. During FY1996, two funding gaps led to shutdowns, with the first lasting five days in November 1995 and the second lasting 21 days in December 1995. The shutdowns were caused by the expiration of continuing resolutions and vetoed CRs. Approximately 800,000 federal employees were furloughed during the first shutdown, with six regular appropriations bills remaining unenacted at the start of the second shutdown. The second shutdown in FY1996 lasted 21 days from December 15, 1995, to January 6, 1996. It affected fewer employees and agencies compared to the first shutdown, with 284,000 federal employees furloughed. Eight continuing resolutions were passed from January 6, 1996, to April 26, 1996, when the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 was enacted to provide budget authority for agencies and programs not covered in the FY1996 annual appropriations acts. After the second FY1996 shutdown, no shutdowns occurred until over 17 years later, in FY2014. A funding gap began on October 1, 2013, after funding from the previous fiscal year expired. None of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2014 had been enacted. OMB instructed affected agencies to cease operations and furlough personnel on October 1. An automatic continuing resolution provided funds for certain activities at DOD and DHS for FY2014. The FY2014 shutdown lasted 16 days, ending on October 17, 2013, when the President signed an interim CR. Initial reports suggested over 800,000 executive branch employees were furloughed. OMB released a retrospective report three weeks after the shutdown. According to OMB, the FY2014 shutdown resulted in the furlough of approximately 850,000 employees per day at its peak, decreasing over time due to legislative measures. OMB did not provide an overall estimate of furloughs across all branches of the federal government for the FY1996 and FY2014 shutdowns. During a federal government shutdown, certain executive branch officials and employees, including the President and \"excepted\" employees, are not subject to furlough. \"Excepted\" employees must work without pay until funding resumes. The President's salary cannot be reduced while in office according to the Constitution. During a government shutdown, the President's salary cannot be reduced according to the Constitution. The judiciary can continue to operate for a limited time using funds from court fees and other sources. In past shutdowns, the judiciary estimated it could sustain activities for about 10 working days. In FY2018, they indicated they could operate for approximately three weeks without a new appropriation by using available funds. If funds are exhausted, the judiciary would operate under the terms of the Antideficiency Act. During a government shutdown, the judiciary can continue to operate under the Antideficiency Act, allowing essential work to continue, including the resolution of cases. Judges, core court staff, and essential officers would not be furloughed, while non-essential staff would be. Supreme Court Justices are protected from pay reductions by the Constitution. Supreme Court Justices and other Article III judges, along with U.S. magistrate judges and U.S. bankruptcy judges, would continue to be paid during a government shutdown due to a constitutional prohibition. Essential judicial staff working without pay would receive compensation once Congress enacts an appropriation. The House and Senate would still engage in legislative activities during a shutdown, such as introducing new legislation, holding hearings, and considering nominations. During a government shutdown, Supreme Court Justices and other Article III judges, along with U.S. magistrate judges and U.S. bankruptcy judges, would continue to be paid due to a constitutional prohibition. Essential judicial staff working without pay would receive compensation once Congress enacts an appropriation. Members of Congress are not subject to furlough and continue to receive pay as mandated by the Constitution. Pay for congressional employees would not be disbursed during a funding gap if there is no appropriation to fund. During a government shutdown, pay for congressional employees would not be disbursed if there is no appropriation to fund legislative branch activities. The decision on whether congressional employees should continue to work during a shutdown falls to their employing authority. Legislative branch agencies would be restricted to activities necessary to support Congress with its constitutional responsibilities or to protect life and property. When funding resumes after a shutdown, agencies and employees work to resume normal activities based on the provided legislation. The timing of funding resumption affects how quickly agencies and employees can fully operate, as seen in past shutdowns like FY2014 and FY1996. In FY2014, President Obama signed an interim CR to end the shutdown, allowing federal government reopening on October 17. OMB issued a memo for employees to return to work, and OPM posted guidance for executive branch employees. The experience of FY1996 also illustrates this process. During the FY1996 shutdown, funding resumed late in the evening on November 19, 1995, but affected agency operations did not restart until the following day. This resulted in a potential six-day shutdown for agencies despite funding being technically available earlier on that day. OPM has provided guidance to agencies on when furloughed employees may be expected to return to work in the event of a shutdown. In the event of a shutdown, agencies should use a rule of reason in requiring furloughed employees to return to work promptly, considering the disruption caused in their lives. Past experiences can inform future decisions, and insights can be gained from documents related to previous shutdowns. The FY1996 shutdowns are less documented compared to more recent events. During past near-impasses in 2011 and 2013, agencies posted shutdown plans online, including details on personnel and activities. OMB directed agencies to update and release these plans for potential shutdowns. Updated plans are periodically posted on agency and OMB websites, offering insight into government activities during shutdowns. In 2011 and 2013, OMB provided guidance on exceptions to the Antideficiency Act during funding gaps. OMB memoranda outlined key principles for agencies to follow. In 1981, Director David A. Stockman identified concrete examples of excepted activities in a memorandum to executive agencies. These documents offer insights into government operations during shutdowns. During a government shutdown, agencies can continue activities authorized by law to protect life and property, ensure national security, make benefit payments, and perform essential contract obligations. This guidance was provided by OPM for the FY2014 shutdown based on previous memoranda from OMB outlining exceptions to the Antideficiency Act. During a government shutdown, essential activities include emergency outpatient care, public health and safety measures, air traffic control, border protection, law enforcement, disaster assistance, and maintenance of the banking system and power distribution. During a government shutdown, essential activities must be maintained to protect research property and government operations. The report highlights program-related effects, potential costs, and general impacts on mandatory spending programs. It also discusses effects on government procurement, agencies, grant recipients, the economy, and other areas of interest to Congress. Past events can provide insight into possible effects of future shutdowns. During government shutdowns, essential activities must be maintained to protect research property and government operations. The effects of past shutdowns on executive branch agencies and programs include new patients not being accepted into clinical research at NIH, CDC ceasing disease surveillance, and hotline calls to NIH being unanswered. Shutdowns have limited effects primarily on agencies and programs included in specific appropriations bills. During the government shutdown, essential activities were maintained to protect research property and government operations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ceased disease surveillance, hotline calls to NIH concerning diseases were not answered, and delays occurred in processing alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives applications. Additionally, work on bankruptcy cases was suspended, recruitment and testing of federal law enforcement officials were canceled, and child support cases were delayed. National Park Service sites and museums were closed, resulting in a loss of visitors and tourism revenue. Approximately 20,000-30,000 visa applications by foreigners went unprocessed each day. During the government shutdown, 20,000-30,000 visa applications by foreigners went unprocessed each day, 200,000 U.S. passport applications were also left unprocessed, and U.S. tourist industries and airlines suffered significant financial losses. Multiple services for American veterans and federal contractors were curtailed, with adverse effects on contracts and product deliveries. The National Institute of Standards and Technology was unable to issue a new standard for lights and lamps, leading to potential delays in product delivery and lost sales. Employees of federal contractors were furloughed without pay. During the FY1996 government shutdowns, federal courts operated with limited disruption using fee revenues and carryover funds to hear and decide cases. Internal judiciary guidelines recognized the unique function of the Judiciary. During the government shutdown, some U.S. courts were affected, leading to disruptions in court functions such as rescheduling arguments and furloughs of staff. The judiciary used fee revenues and carryover funds to continue essential operations. During the FY2014 government shutdown, some courts furloughed personnel on a limited basis due to a funding gap in all 12 regular appropriations bills. The shutdown had extensive effects on federal government operations, with news media reporting on how it impacted programs and agencies in the executive branch. Agencies did not provide ongoing impact information during the 16-day shutdown period due to staff furloughs and non-updated websites. After the FY2014 government shutdown, OMB released a detailed 27-page report on the impacts and costs of the shutdown, which was a significant contrast to the shorter reports produced after the FY1996 shutdowns. The report discussed the economic disruptions caused by the cessation of government activities that the private sector relied on. The OMB released a detailed report on the impacts and costs of the FY2014 government shutdown, highlighting economic disruptions caused by the halt in government activities relied upon by the private sector. This included a suspension of permitting, reviews, and licensing, federal employee furloughs, and disrupted tourism and travel. Payroll costs for furloughed federal employees were cited as the largest direct cost of the shutdown. The OMB report detailed the impact of the FY2014 government shutdown, highlighting furlough days for employees across various agencies, totaling over 25,000 work years. The furloughs affected services like food safety inspections, tax refunds, and public health monitoring. Shutdown impacts on government programs and services were also quantified in the report. The OMB report outlined the impacts of the government shutdown in various policy and programmatic areas, including direct services for vulnerable groups, public health, product safety, worker rights, international trade, and other government services. It also highlighted other direct budgetary costs incurred by executive branch agencies. The OMB report detailed the impacts of the government shutdown, including lower revenues, halted program integrity activities, interest on late payments, increased costs on federal contracts, and shutdown-related costs. These costs diverted employee and contractor time from mission-related work. During the government shutdown, federal employees faced pay cuts, impacting recruitment and retention. Grant programs for state and local governments were disrupted, affecting project funding and services. Courts operated with minimal disruption during the shutdown. During the government shutdown, federal employees faced pay cuts, impacting recruitment and retention. Grant programs for state and local governments were disrupted, affecting project funding and services. Despite limited disruption, the judiciary operated using non-annually appropriated funds during the shutdown, affecting some court functions such as postponing civil cases and operating on condensed criminal calendars. During the government shutdown, federal employees faced pay cuts, impacting recruitment and retention. Grant programs for state and local governments were disrupted, affecting project funding and services. The judiciary operated using non-annually appropriated funds, postponing civil cases and operating on condensed criminal calendars. Some legislative branch agencies released official guidance or operational plans, but the impact varied. Assessing costs of shutdowns is complex due to varying perspectives and lack of data availability. After a government shutdown, efforts were made to determine the costs incurred. Senator Alan Cranston requested the GAO to assess costs related to paying furloughed employees and other shutdown-related expenses. The GAO found that data on furloughed employees and shutdown costs were not easily obtainable. Agencies had different approaches to defining costs, leading to limited information available for comparison. The GAO cautioned against comparing costs across agencies after a government shutdown. OMB estimated over $1.4 billion in costs for the FY1996 shutdowns, including retroactive pay for furloughed employees and additional expenses like interest payments and personnel costs. After the FY1996 shutdowns, OMB estimated over $1.4 billion in costs, including payroll costs for furloughed employees and other expenses. OMB did not quantify costs for impacts on government services, but released a 27-page report after the FY2014 shutdown detailing costs in five categories. OMB estimated costs in five categories after the FY2014 shutdown: effects on the economy, federal employee furloughs, impacts on programs and services, other budgetary costs, and impacts on the federal workforce. The estimated costs included $2-6 billion in lost domestic economic output, $2.0 billion for retroactive pay to furloughed employees, and additional costs if benefits were included. The total costs exceeded those of the FY1996 shutdowns. OMB estimated budgetary effects of program- and policy-specific impacts during the FY1996 shutdowns, totaling $1.65 billion in inflation-adjusted terms. The funding gap affected programs funded by laws other than annual appropriations acts, with questions arising on the ability of mandatory programs to function without appropriations for employee salaries. According to the 1981 Civiletti opinion, some employees may not be subject to furlough during a funding gap if their salaries are obligated for program administration. However, this determination depends on specific circumstances and absence of contrary legislative history. The experience of the Social Security Administration during the FY1996 shutdowns shows that lack of funds for salaries could eventually impact processing and payment of entitlement claims. During the initial stages of the first shutdown, 4,780 employees were retained in direct service positions to ensure benefits to Social Security, SSI, and Black Lung beneficiaries. SSA furloughed 61,415 employees but later reconsidered due to the need for staff to respond to customer calls and process new claims. SSA advised OMB that an additional 49,715 employees were needed for direct service work. During the second shutdown, adjustments were made to retain employees for administering entitlement programs. Representative John L. Mica criticized the disorganized execution of the shutdown, citing the recall of over 50,000 Social Security personnel. Security personnel were furloughed three days into the shutdown, leading to questions about their necessity. Then-Ranking Member James P. Moran sought clarification on excepted and non-excepted activities and employees. Congress could consider legislative and oversight actions to improve agency shutdown planning and rationale for exempting employees from furlough. Accessing agency shutdown plans from previous years and OMB guidance documents could provide insight into decision-making processes. OMB's Circular No. A-11 requires executive agencies to submit shutdown plans to OMB, which must be updated whenever there is a change in funding or significant program modifications. Plans must be updated and submitted to OMB at least once every two years starting August 1, 2015. Shutdown plans were released on OMB's website in April and December 2011. The release of agency shutdown plans on OMB's website and agency websites in April and December 2011 brought transparency to agency shutdown planning. Plans were posted before interim CR expiration dates, indicating a possible impasse. OMB started posting shutdown plans in September 2013 for FY2014 funding and continued to do so for FY2018 funding. It is uncertain if these plans will be a permanent feature. It is uncertain if the shutdown plans will remain a permanent fixture on federal agency and OMB websites. Congress could consider establishing a statutory structure for updating and posting the plans, which may provide incentives for agencies to improve plan quality and inform budget policy debates. However, inquiries into shutdown plans may distract agency personnel from other duties and raise sensitive issues. During a federal government shutdown, grant administration activities to state and local governments may be disrupted or cease, depending on factors such as timing, length of shutdown, and choices made by officials. The scale of these activities is significant, with federal outlays for grants totaling $510 billion in FY2013. Congressional and stakeholder decisions play a crucial role in grant program administration during a shutdown. During a shutdown, Congress and stakeholders decide on administering programs, including filling gaps in federal grant funding with state funds, furloughing grants administration personnel, and involving them in contingency planning. States must choose to use state funds to continue programs or cease activities during federal funding gaps, considering uncertainty in reimbursement. Congress may need to enact legislation before a shutdown to address state funding issues. During a government shutdown, grant administration personnel may be furloughed, impacting activities such as grant agreement execution and payment processing. In FY2014 shutdown, officials were unavailable to assist grantees. Lack of involvement in contingency planning can disrupt grant program administration. During a government shutdown, grant administration personnel may be furloughed, impacting grant program administration. Congress has enacted narrow continuing resolutions to fund specific programs during shutdowns, such as benefits for veterans and certain children and families programs. The Pay Our Military Act provided funds for certain DOD and DHS activities during the FY2014 shutdown. Narrow CRs have various implications. During a government shutdown, narrow continuing resolutions have been enacted to fund specific programs, such as benefits for veterans and certain children and families programs. Proponents argue that CRs mitigate the effects of a shutdown, while others believe they unfairly prioritize programs and reduce pressure for broader negotiations. A shutdown could have negative security implications, as some may see the nation as vulnerable. The Antideficiency Act is unclear on which organizations would be exempted during a shutdown, but entities performing national security functions may be allowed. During a government shutdown, entities performing national security functions may be allowed to continue operations to avoid imminent threats. The actions taken in anticipation of a shutdown can lessen negative effects on national security incidents. Preparation for a shutdown by agencies and OMB may have short- and long-term consequences if an incident occurs during reduced government services. During a government shutdown, non-traditional federal government organizations may be shut down, potentially delaying the nation's response to a crisis. This could increase the risk to the nation and prolong recovery time as essential services may not be available. Security experts warn that prolonged shutdowns could make the nation more vulnerable to exploitation by enemies."
