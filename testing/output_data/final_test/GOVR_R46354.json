    "content": "Multiple bills and resolutions have been introduced in Congress regarding China's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. This report provides a timeline of key developments in the early weeks of the outbreak, including responses in China, the World Health Organization, and the United States up to January 31, 2020. It also discusses disease terminology and the Chinese context of the outbreak. On February 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus was named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization. This naming references the genetic link to the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in China's Guangdong Province. The 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease, initially called \"pneumonia of unknown cause\" in Wuhan, China, was later referred to as \"viral pneumonia\" and then \"novel coronavirus infection pneumonia.\" Chinese doctors identified cases of the disease, now known as COVID-19, in Wuhan, the largest city in central China. Wuhan, located at the intersection of the Yangtze River and the Hanshui River, is a major transportation hub with links to the rest of China. It is also an industrial base with elite universities and research centers. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission oversees hospitals and the Wuhan CDC. The Wuhan CDC, with a staff of about 220, is divided into 13 districts, each with its own health bureau reporting to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. Jianghan District, where the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market is located, has a population of 730,000 with a high population density. Communist Party secretaries hold significant power in China's political system, with General Secretary Xi Jinping serving as the top leader. Party General Secretary Xi Jinping is China's top leader, also serving as Chairman of the Party's Central Military Commission and State President. Li Keqiang is the second-most senior official, serving as Premier of the State Council. Both are members of the Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee. In Hubei Province, Party Secretary Jiang Chaoliang was replaced by Ying Yong, an associate of Xi Jinping. Governor Wang Xiaodong remains in office. In Wuhan, Party Secretary Ma Guoqiang was in charge at the start of the epidemic. At the outset of the epidemic, Party Secretary Ma Guoqiang and Mayor Zhou Xianwang were key officials in Wuhan. Ma was removed from his posts and replaced by Wang Zhonglin, while Zhou remains in office. The top officials of the Hubei Provincial Health Commission, Zhang Jin and Liu Yingzi, were also replaced. Zhang Hongxing continues to serve as the top official of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. In early 2019, China faced criticism for delays in reporting SARS outbreak. However, with COVID-19, China shared information more promptly. Questions arise about China's interactions with WHO during the early weeks of the pandemic. China, along with other countries, is obligated under the International Health Regulations to assess and notify WHO of events within its territory. China, along with other countries, is obligated under the International Health Regulations to notify WHO of potential public health emergencies of international concern within its territory. The timeline suggests that in the early weeks of the pandemic, Chinese authorities may not have always communicated with WHO in a timely and accurate manner. Chinese authorities may not have communicated with WHO in a timely and detailed manner as required by IHR (2005). WHO first learned about the outbreak in Wuhan from a U.S.-based open-source platform, not directly from Chinese authorities. The curr_chunk discusses leaked documents from Wuhan detailing atypical pneumonia cases and a positive SARS lab report. Dr. Ai Fen and Dr. Li Wenliang shared the information online before official notices were issued. The leaked documents from Wuhan revealed atypical pneumonia cases and a positive SARS lab report. Dr. Li Wenliang shared the information online, triggering WHO's response under the IHR (2005) to verify the outbreak in China. Dr. Li later died from COVID-19, becoming a whistleblower celebrated by the Chinese public. China Country Office requested verification of the outbreak from the government of China under IHR (2005). Member states must respond within 24 hours to WHO's requests for clarification. China began informing WHO of the outbreak on January 3, with WHO tweeting about it on January 4. WHO formally requested verification on January 1, and on January 4, they tweeted about the event. WHO's first formal statement on January 5 was unclear on how they learned about the outbreak. The WHO Country Office learned about the outbreak in Wuhan on December 31, 2019. China potentially hesitated before informing WHO about the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak. WHO announced the identification of the novel coronavirus on January 9, 2020, and received the genetic sequences on January 11, 2020. China had determined the novel coronavirus responsible for the outbreak and sequenced the virus' genome before these dates. Several Chinese organizations sequenced the genome of the novel coronavirus in late December 2019 and early January 2020. BGI Genomics completed genomic sequencing on December 26, 2019, followed by the Wuhan Institute of Virology on January 2, China CDC on January 3, and China CDC officially on January 7. Media reports about the CDC's sequencing were released on January 9, 2020. On January 5, 2020, Prof. Yong-zhen Zhang's team at Fudan University in Shanghai sequenced the genome of the novel coronavirus and shared it with the world. They deposited the sequence with the U.S. National Institutes of Health's GenBank, submitted a paper to Nature on January 7, and posted the genome on Virological.org on January 11. China CDC and two other teams also shared genomic sequences on GISAID on January 11. Chinese authorities did not share biological samples with WHO or international partners as of January 28, 2020, and possibly as of April 25. The WHO press release on January 28, 2020, indicated that China had yet to share biological samples with the organization. State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus tweeted on April 25, 2020, that China had not shared any COVID-19 virus or clinical samples. China's early information sharing on the COVID-19 outbreak was incomplete and understated the virus' spread. Wuhan doctors suspected person-to-person transmission in late December, with a family cluster reported on December 27, 2019. China began sharing more information on January 20, 2020, including daily updates on case numbers from January 21. On January 13-14, 2020, Chinese officials acknowledged \"limited\" human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus to visitors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Wuhan medical personnel started showing symptoms similar to patients in December, but infections were not confirmed until January 20. Dr. Li Wenliang, who raised early warnings about the virus, was reprimanded by Wuhan police on January 3, hospitalized on January 12, and passed away on February 7, 2020. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued no updates during a political meeting from January 6-10, 2020, while a \"super-spreader\" patient infected 14 medical staff. The commission's report on January 11 gave the impression the epidemic was shrinking, with a revised cumulative number of cases down to 41. No new infections were reported during a second political meeting from January 12-17. The absence of updates from January 6 to 10 and the official statements of no new cases between January 3 and 16 may have misled Wuhan residents into thinking the outbreak was under control. The United States offered to send a U.S. CDC team to China multiple times in January 2020 to assist with the outbreak response, but no team traveled to China during that period. President Trump supported the offer on January 27, but the assistance was not provided. Weigong Zhou and Clifford Lane participated in a WHO-China Joint Mission to China in February 2020. Chinese experts have published papers in English-language journals since the epidemic began, but some in the international community are frustrated with China's lack of transparency. China CDC found 33 positive samples for SARS-Cov-2 at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market but did not provide details of its scientific analysis or sample collection from animals in the market. Chinese media reports indicate that local authorities disinfected the market before it closed, potentially compromising samples. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo criticized China for withholding information needed to keep people safe, including viral isolates and details about COVID-19 patients in December 2019. Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang cited China's Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases for restricting information sharing. It remains unclear who was responsible for decisions to withhold information in the early weeks. The period up to January 31, 2020, saw official actions taken to discipline individuals who shared information about the epidemic publicly, including instances of censorship. Wuhan Municipal Public Security officers reprimanded at least eight people for allegedly spreading rumors about the outbreak. Dr. Ai Fen and Dr. Li Wenliang from Wuhan Central Hospital were among those reprimanded for sharing early information. Additionally, after scientists shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, Shanghai authorities closed down a laboratory for investigation. The closure of a laboratory in Shanghai is being investigated for unspecified wrongdoing related to publishing sequencing data before authorities. Official Chinese timelines omit mention of the team's work, and censorship has blocked access to reporting by Chinese and foreign news organizations. Dr. Ai Fen's account in a national magazine was deleted from the website, but Chinese activists have archived censored reports. Prior to January 20, there was little evidence that China's top leaders prioritized containment of the epidemic. China's top decisionmaking body, the Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee, held three meetings in January 2020. General Secretary Xi mentioned raising concerns about the novel coronavirus at the January 7 meeting. The People's Daily newspaper did not mention the epidemic until January 21. Xi made an official visit to Burma from January 17-18, 2020. During Xi's visit to Burma in January 2020, there was no mention of discussions about the epidemic. However, on January 20, China's approach to the epidemic changed dramatically with the confirmation of human-to-human transmission and the declaration of novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia as a statutory notifiable infectious disease. Xi issued an \"important instruction\" to prioritize coronavirus prevention. China's holiday calendar likely set back efforts to contain the outbreak and contributed to its spread overseas. The Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival, is China's most important holiday. In 2020, it fell on January 25. Millions of Wuhan residents left the city ahead of the holiday to spend it with their extended families, contributing to the virus' spread. A community in Wuhan held a mass potluck banquet on January 18, 2020, further spreading the virus. The earliest known COVID-19 patient's symptom development date remains unclear. Reports suggest a 55-year-old from Hubei Province fell ill on November 17, but China CDC Director Gao Fu denies evidence of clusters in November. Doctors in Wuhan reported the first patient showing symptoms on December 1. Chinese authorities identified December 8 as the day when the first known COVID-19 patient became symptomatic.
