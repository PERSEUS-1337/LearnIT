The board prioritizes funding for the BSM and upgrading IRS security systems. Increased investment in modernizing the core taxpayer account system for individuals is vital for future advances in IRS operational efficiency, taxpayer service, and tax law enforcement. Nearly 60% of the recommended BSM budget would go into the CADE 2 program, expected to improve processing of individual taxpayer accounts. The program will provide benefits such as timely account balance information and faster refunds. Achieving an 80% level of service for IRS's toll-free telephone lines during FY2012 is a top priority.

The General Services Administration manages federal procurement policies and facilities for former Presidents. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages funding and facilities for former Presidents and presidential transitions through the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF). The FBF is funded by rental payments from federal agencies leasing GSA space, with Congress allocating funds for specific activities like construction, repairs, and rental payments. GSA is limited by Congress on how much it can spend from the FBF, even if revenue exceeds expectations. A negative total occurs when funds available for expenditure are less than expected revenue. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages funding and facilities for former Presidents and presidential transitions through the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF). The FBF is funded by rental payments from federal agencies leasing GSA space. A negative total occurs when funds available for expenditure are less than expected revenue. GSA's operating accounts are funded separately from the FBF. The total funding for GSA is calculated by adding FBF funds to direct appropriations. In FY2012, the President proposed $9.509 billion from the FBF for GSA's real property activities, an increase from FY2011. Additionally, $332 million was requested for GSA's operating accounts, a $90 million increase from FY2011. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $7.224 billion from the FBF for GSA in FY2012, $2.285 billion less than the President's request.

The Electronic Government Fund (E-Government Fund) has been a contentious matter between the President and Congress. Initially proposed at $20 million for FY2002, it was reduced to $5 million for FY2003 and subsequent years. In FY2009, President Bush requested $5 million, but Congress did not appropriate any funds. President Obama's FY2012 budget also did not allocate any funds to the E-Government Fund. In FY2012, President Obama requested $34 million for the Electronic Government Fund, $24 million more than the previous year. House appropriators recommended combining the fund with the Federal Citizen Services Fund and renaming it the \"Information and Engagement for Citizens\" account with a $50 million appropriation. This was $8 million more than the combined appropriation for both funds in FY2011. In FY2011, Senate appropriators recommended combining the Electronic Government Fund and the Federal Citizen Services Fund to create the Information and Engagement for Citizens account with an appropriation of nearly $39.1 million. This was $10.9 million less than the House appropriators' recommendation and $3.0 million less than the previous year's appropriation for the two funds. The purpose of the new office is to provide access and understanding of Federal information, benefits, and services to citizens, businesses, other governments, and the media. In FY2011, the Electronic Government Fund and the Federal Citizen Services Fund were combined with an appropriation of $42.1 million. David McClure testified that a reduction in funding could limit new projects. P.L. 112-74 funds the Electronic Government Fund and the Federal Citizen Service Fund separately, with $12.4 million provided for FY2012. Congress required a proposed spending plan with explanations for each project before funding. The proposed spending plan for FY2012 includes an explanation for each project before funding is allocated to agencies. The $12.4 million appropriated is $4.4 million more than FY2011 and $21.6 million less than President Obama's request. The Federal Citizen Services Fund received $34.1 million. The combined appropriation for the Electronic Government Fund and the Federal Citizen Services Fund is $46.5 million, $3.5 million less than House recommendations but $7.4 million more than Senate recommendations.

The House committee aimed to boost recruitment efforts in U.S. territories. S. 1573 proposed funding levels for OPM and OIG, slightly lower than the President's request. The Senate report requested updates on retirement claims processing and modernization efforts every six months. The committee directed OPM to address shortages in nurses and nurse faculty members through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act Mobility Program. They also requested reports on temporary hiring authority misuse, a wellness pilot program, and updates on the Consolidated Business Information System.

Legislation to reauthorize the agency was not introduced in the 111th Congress or the 112th Congress. H.R. 2434 and S. 1573 proposed appropriations of $18.0 million and $19.0 million respectively, with differences from the FY2011 enacted amount and the President's request. The Senate report highlighted the agency's caseload growth and the need for additional staff for the USERRA program. P.L. 112-74 provided the Senate committee's recommended appropriation of $19.0 million. President Obama requested $422.5 million for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in FY2012, slightly more than the previous year. The Administration recommended $430.7 million for operations and the Electronic Records Archive (ERA), with the ERA absorbing most of the budget cuts. This was a decrease from the President's FY2011 recommendation of $434.2 million. The President recommended reductions in funding for NARA's inspector general, repairs and restorations, and NHPRC in FY2012. House appropriators suggested a $57.0 million decrease in NARA's budget compared to FY2011. Operating expenses, including the ERA, were recommended to be $57.0 million less than the previous year and $47.7 million less than the President's FY2012 request. House appropriators recommended funding levels for NARA's Office of the Inspector General and repairs/restorations, which were lower than both the FY2011 appropriation and the President's FY2012 request. They also suggested directing cost savings from construction projects towards critical repairs and improvements to Archives facilities. Additionally, the NHPRC received $1 million in appropriations, significantly less than previous years and the President's recommendation. The House committee report did not provide a reason for these funding reductions. The Senate appropriators recommended over $378.8 million for NARA operating expenses in FY2012, which is $24.9 million less than the President's request but $17.9 million more than the House appropriators' recommendation. This amount is also nearly $39.8 million more than was appropriated in FY2011. The Senate matched the President's request for the Office of the Inspector General and repairs/restorations funding. The Senate recommended over $378.8 million for NARA operating expenses in FY2012, $24.9 million less than the President's request but $17.9 million more than the House recommendation. The Senate also matched the President's request for the NHPRC with $5.0 million, $4.0 million more than the House recommendation.

The Office of the Inspector General is set to receive $4.1 million, and $9.1 million was allocated for repairs and restorations. Any unobligated funds after completing required projects will go towards the National Archives and Records Administration Capital Improvement Plan. The NARA's capital improvement plan includes creating a new exhibit gallery focusing on the defense of important Charters like the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights. The budget allocation is $9.1 million, slightly lower than the President's and Senate's requests but higher than the House's recommendation. The NHPRC will receive $5 million in FY2012, and the NCUA is an independent agency funded by credit unions. The Community Development Revolving Loan Fund Program (CDRLF) was established in 1979 to assist low-income credit unions in providing financial services to low-income communities.

The U.S. Postal Service receives funding primarily from user fees, with Congress providing additional appropriations for specific purposes such as free mailing privileges for the blind and overseas voters. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 authorized these appropriations, including a $29 million annual reimbursement until 2035 for below-cost postal services to not-for-profit organizations in the early 1990s. Funds are deposited in the Postal Service Fund at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 impacted the postal appropriations process.

Agencies must ensure employees have necessary skills. OMB Director to report on federal workforce management annually. The financial services appropriations bill includes a provision in P.L. 112-74 for FY2012 that prohibits funds from being used to start public-private competitions involving federal employees. This provision does not apply to competitions involving contractor employees. The FY2012 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bills had provisions regarding Cuba sanctions, but these were not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The conference report indicated that language from the House Appropriations Committee-approved version would be considered approved. This includes a Treasury Department report on Cuba licenses. The FY2012 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bills included provisions related to Cuba sanctions, with a focus on licenses for people-to-people exchanges. The bills aimed to clarify the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural and medical sales to Cuba. Additionally, the Senate bill had a provision regarding payment for U.S. exports to Cuba. The provision added during the Senate Appropriations Committee's markup of S. 1573 on September 15, 2011, would have prohibited restrictions on direct transfers from a Cuban financial institution to a U.S. financial institution for licensed agricultural and medical exports to Cuba. This provision became part of H.R. 2434 during the House Appropriations Committee's markup on June 24, 2011. In December 2011, a legislative battle occurred over Cuba provisions in H.R. 2055, the FY2012 appropriations measure. The White House pressured not to include provisions that would roll back restrictions on family travel and remittances. Ultimately, the Cuba provisions were not included in the final bill. The definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural and medical products was a political tradeoff to compensate for the travel rollback provision being dropped. Despite U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba, some U.S. commercial agricultural exports have been allowed since 2001 under TSRA, with restrictions on financing and licensing requirements. The Bush Administration tightened sanctions on Cuba in February 2005 by restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product. OFAC clarified that \"payment of cash in advance\" means payment received before shipment, not before delivery, causing objections from exporters and Congress. Since 2002, the United States has been a major supplier of food and agricultural products to Cuba, with exports reaching a high of $712 million in 2008. However, exports declined to $368 million in 2010, causing concerns about potential impacts on U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. OFAC's clarification on payment terms in 2005 led to objections from exporters and Congress. In 2010, U.S. exports to Cuba declined to $368 million, a 31% drop from 2009. The decrease was attributed to Cuba's shortage of hard currency. Congress defined \"payment of cash in advance\" in FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations measures, overturning OFAC's previous clarification. Both H.R. 2434 and S. 1573 aimed to continue this interpretation for agricultural and medical exports to Cuba in FY2012. In FY2012, S. 1573 aimed to prohibit restrictions on direct transfers from Cuban to U.S. financial institutions for agricultural and medical exports. This provision was also included in H.R. 4645 in the 111th Congress, which sought to clarify the definition of \"payment of cash in advance\" and lift restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba. U.S. agricultural exporters argued that the prohibition on direct transfers made sales transactions more complicated and costly. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue for U.S. businesses. During a debate in September 2011, supporters of direct transfers argued that U.S. exports to Cuba have declined, while opponents believed that financial linkages should not be opened while Cuba is on the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism. The George W. Bush Administration tightened restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, including eliminating certain categories of travel. The Obama Administration eased restrictions on family and educational travel to Cuba in 2009, following the Bush Administration's tightening of travel and remittance restrictions in 2004. Opposition to the policy grew, especially within the Cuban American community regarding the restrictions on family travel and remittances. Congress took action to ease some restrictions on travel to Cuba by including provisions in the FY2009 omnibus appropriations measure. In 2009, the Obama Administration eased travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing unlimited family travel and remittances. Additional changes in 2011 increased purposeful travel for religious, educational, and people-to-people exchanges. The Obama Administration implemented new measures to increase people-to-people exchanges with Cuba, allowing non-family remittances up to $500 per quarter and easing restrictions on religious institutions sending remittances for religious activities. These changes aim to strengthen Cuban civil society and reduce dependence on the Cuban state, coinciding with the Cuban government's shift towards private enterprise. Policy groups supporting increased U.S. engagement with Cuba praised the Administration's actions to expand self-employment categories, increase information flow, and boost Cuban private sector income. The Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) strongly backed the policy changes, emphasizing the importance of sending remittances to break the Castro regime's hold on Cuba. Conversely, critics of easing U.S. sanctions fear the changes could bolster Cuba's repressive government. Opponents of policy changes argue that increased travel and remittances to Cuba will help maintain the repressive government. They believe easing restrictions will not lead to respect for human rights. H.R. 2434 aimed to roll back Obama's easing of restrictions on family travel and remittances, while S. 1573 did not include a similar provision. The provision would restore regulations on family travel and remittances to Cuba, limiting family travel to once every three years for up to 14 days with a specific license required, reducing remittance amounts to $300 for travelers and $300 per quarter for family remittances. Non-family remittances up to $500 per quarter would not be allowed. The Obama Administration restored regulations on family travel and remittances to Cuba in 2011. The White House opposed Section 901 of H.R. 2434, stating it would reverse the President's policy on family travel and remittances. The provision aimed to limit family travel to once every three years for up to 14 days with a specific license required, reduce remittance amounts, and eliminate the general license for remittances to religious organizations. The House Appropriations Committee report to H.R. 2434 requires OFAC to provide information on pending applications for people-to-people exchanges in Cuba. This reporting requirement was added via an amendment by Representative Jeff Flake. In June 2011, the House committee marked up a bill. By early July, OFAC approved licenses for U.S. people-to-people organizations to bring visitors to Cuba, with trips starting in August."
