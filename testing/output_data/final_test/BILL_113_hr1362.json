    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act\" and includes amendments. The \"Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act\" amends the Federal Employees Retirement System to include employees involved in investigating or apprehending individuals suspected of criminal offenses and authorized to carry firearms, as well as employees of the Internal Revenue Service primarily responsible for collecting delinquent taxes. The amendment includes provisions for the collection of delinquent taxes and securing delinquent returns. It also expands the coverage of employees under the Civil Service Retirement System to include those who meet specific criteria and employees of the Internal Revenue Service with duties related to tax collection. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the enactment date of the Act and apply to individuals appointed as law enforcement officers after that date. SEC. 3. Treatment of service performed by incumbents. The text describes the definition of a law enforcement officer and service, as well as the definition of an incumbent in relation to this section. It specifies the requirements for individuals to be considered law enforcement officers and defines an incumbent as someone appointed before a certain date and serving as a law enforcement officer on that date. The text outlines that service performed by an incumbent on or after the enactment of the Act will be treated as service as a law enforcement officer. This includes retirement benefits under specific chapters of the United States Code. Individuals can elect to have their service treated as law enforcement officer service and make contributions for prior service performed. Contributions can be made to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to account for the difference in individual contributions made for prior service. The amendments made by section 2 affect the annuity of law enforcement officers if full contributions are not made. Prior service is defined as service performed before retirement deductions begin. If an incumbent elects under subsection (c)(2), the agency of prior service must remit the required amount to the Office of Personnel Management for deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The remittance is the additional Government contributions that would have been required for the prior service. Government contributions for an incumbent must be made ratably over a 10-year period. Law enforcement officers are exempt from mandatory separation for three years after the enactment of this Act. The Office of Personnel Management will create regulations for interest computation on certain amounts. The computation of amounts under subsection (d) or (e) is based on section 8334(e) of title 5, United States Code. Provisions apply to individuals who meet specific criteria, including law enforcement officers and survivors entitled to annuities. The section does not apply to reemployed annuitants."
