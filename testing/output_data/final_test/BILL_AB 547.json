    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4000.5 of the Elections Code in San Diego County allows for all-mailed ballot special elections for vacancies in congressional or legislative offices, legislative bodies, or governing bodies. Special elections in San Diego County can be conducted entirely by mail if authorized by the Board of Supervisors or the legislative/governing body, and if not held on the same date as other elections. If the eligible entity's jurisdiction overlaps with a city, at least one ballot dropoff location per city must be open during business hours starting seven days before the election. The number of dropoff locations in unincorporated areas is based on the number of registered voters, with a minimum of one location. Dropoff locations consist of locked ballot boxes in secure public buildings meeting accessibility requirements. On weekends after ballot delivery, voters can vote at satellite locations within the jurisdiction. Polling places must be provided based on registered voters, with one for every 10,000 voters or one per eligible entity. Voting hours are between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on election day. The polling places provided under this section must adhere to accessibility requirements outlined in various laws and ensure even distribution throughout the jurisdiction. They should be located at accessible locations and equipped with voting units accessible to individuals with disabilities, allowing for private and independent voting. The elections official must ensure that polling places are staffed with precinct board members fluent in required languages. Additionally, all necessary supplies for mail ballots must be provided to voters, including a prepaid return envelope. The elections official must provide voters with a notice informing them of an all-mailed ballot election, options for casting their ballot, and language assistance options as required by the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. The elections official must provide a list of ballot dropoff locations, satellite locations, and polling places on their website. They also need to include a postage-paid postcard for voters to request a vote by mail ballot in a different language. Additionally, a voter education and outreach plan must be submitted to the Secretary of State for implementation during elections. The eligible entity must conduct education and outreach meetings with representatives from various communities and organizations, including those advocating for individuals with disabilities. They must also hold bilingual voter education workshops and workshops to increase accessibility for voters with disabilities. The elections official must provide a toll-free voter assistance hotline in multiple languages and public service announcements to inform voters about the upcoming election. The voter education and outreach plan includes public service announcements in multiple languages, a voter education social media strategy developed with community organizations, and must be posted on the Secretary of State and elections official websites. The election day procedures, additional ballot dropoff locations, and processing of mail ballots are governed by specific sections. Special elections allow for early processing of mail ballots 29 days before the election. If an eligible entity conducts a special election, they can start processing vote by mail ballots 10 days before the election, including opening envelopes, duplicating damaged ballots, and preparing them for machine reading. Results of the ballot count cannot be released before 8 p.m. on election day, and no vote by mail ballot tabulation can be released before the polls close. Upon completion of the ballot count, the elections official shall divide the jurisdiction into precincts and prepare a statement of the election results. An index of all voters must be compiled and retained electronically for 10 years. The eligible entity conducting the election must report to the Legislature and Secretary of State on the election's success. The report on the election must include statistics on the cost, turnout of different populations, number of rejected ballots, voter fraud, and any other problems encountered. It should also compare the election conducted under this section to similar elections in the same or comparable jurisdictions. The eligible entity must submit the election report to the Legislature, Secretary of State, and post it online. The eligible entity includes San Diego County and other districts within the county. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended or repealed by a later statute. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for San Diego County due to unique voting behavior and demographic characteristics. The act aims to continue a pilot program for future special elections."
