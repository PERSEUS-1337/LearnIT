    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) is the largest energy consumer in the United States, accounting for 63% of energy consumed by federal facilities. Despite only using 1% of national energy, DOD spends over $3.4 billion annually on facility energy. Congress mandated energy reductions for federal agencies in the 1970s, with DOD achieving a 28.3% reduction in energy consumption by FY 2005. Recent legislation and Executive Orders aim for further energy reduction goals, including President-elect Obama's plans for improving public building energy efficiency. The report reviews energy conservation provisions in legislation applicable to DOD, Executive Orders for federal facilities, and OSD directives. It summarizes DOD spending on facility energy, annual appropriations, and investments in energy conservation measures. Transportation fuels are not covered in this report. Federal government initiatives to reduce energy consumption have a long history. Initiatives to reduce energy consumption have a long history, starting with the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) in 1973. The 1978 National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA) initiated retrofitting federal buildings for energy efficiency. The 1985 Deficit Reduction Act authorized energy savings contracts up to 25 years. The 1992 Energy Policy Act introduced Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) for improving energy efficiency in federal buildings. Federal agencies, including DOD, are required to report annually on energy consumption. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) was established in 1973 to reduce energy consumption in federal buildings. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1988 mandated a 10% reduction in energy consumption by FY1995. Subsequent energy bills such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 have further addressed energy efficiency in federal agency facilities. Annual DOD appropriation bills also include energy provisions for defense facilities. Section 103 of the NECPA mandates the use of advanced meters to reduce electricity use in federal buildings by October 1, 2012. Section 109 adopts the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code for new federal buildings, requiring a 30% reduction in energy consumption. Section 203 requires the federal government to offset its electric energy consumption with renewable energy, increasing from 3% in 2005 to at least 7.5% by 2013. Section 431 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act mandates a 30% energy reduction in federal buildings by 2015 compared to 2005 levels. Section 432 requires guidelines for energy and water efficiency in federal buildings, while Section 433 mandates a 55% reduction in fossil energy use in new federal buildings. Efficiency Performance Standards mandate reduced fossil energy use in federal buildings by 55% in 2010 and 100% by 2030. Federal agencies must ensure energy cost effectiveness for equipment replacements and renovations. Leasing of buildings without an EPA Energy Star label is prohibited. High Performance Green Federal Buildings standards are established for all federal facilities. Financing Flexibility allows the use of appropriated funds and private financing for Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). Section 514 enacts permanent authorization of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) and restricts federal agencies from limiting the duration of ESPCs to less than 25 years or limiting the total amount of obligations. Section 518 directs the Department of Defense to study the potential use of ESPCs in nonbuilding applications. Section 526 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless contract provisions ensure that greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed those produced from conventional petroleum sources. Subtitle E establishes new energy performance goals for the Department of Defense. The new legislation (10 U.S.C 2865) establishes energy performance goals for the Department of Defense, promotes the use of renewable energy, and encourages energy efficiency in new construction. It includes the creation of Chapter 173\u2014 Energy Security, which sets goals for transportation systems, support systems, utilities, and infrastructure. Additionally, it allows appropriated funds equal to energy cost savings to be used for future projects and authorizes energy conservation construction projects with congressional notification. The Department of Defense aims to use renewable energy for 25% of its electricity needs by 2025. Congressional notification is required for energy savings contracts exceeding $7,000,000. New construction must use energy-efficient products, and contracts for renewable energy can last up to 10 years. Section 2861 repeals the requirement for Congressional notification for energy savings contracts exceeding $7 million. Section 902 appoints a director for overseeing energy needs for military operations. Section 2831 requires certification for leases over 20 years for energy projects. Section 2832 mandates an annual report on energy management at DOD installations. Section 2832 amends reporting requirements for Department of Defense installations energy management, including progress on meeting green-building standards and certification requirements. Executive Order 13423 revoked previous orders on federal agencies' energy and environmental management, consolidating and strengthening goals, practices, and reporting requirements for environmental, energy, and transportation performance and accountability. The new Executive Order implements replacement energy and environmental efficiency goals for federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Progress is measured by reductions in energy consumption versus building area. The Executive Order mandates energy reduction targets for federal agencies, aiming for new buildings to be 30% more cost efficient and renovations to be 20% more cost efficient than industry standards. Agencies are encouraged to incorporate sustainable practices and dispose of unneeded assets. The revoked Order 13123 focused on building energy efficiency, renewable energy use, and greenhouse gas reduction goals for buildings. The new Executive Order 13423 lacks specific greenhouse gas reduction targets but aims to reduce agency energy intensity. It now requires half of renewable energy to come from new sources. The Executive Order 13423 requires federal agencies to use renewable energy sources, including non-electric options like solar and biomass, to meet energy intensity reduction goals. However, non-electric sources cannot be used to meet the renewable electricity requirement. Agencies must report annually to the President, with guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides general reporting guidance in Circular No. A-11 on energy use, costs, and efficiency. The Department of Defense (DOD) has issued directives and instructions to implement EO13423 and comply with energy legislation, emphasizing energy conservation goals. DOD's primary guidance on installation energy management is outlined in DOD Instruction 4170.11. The DOD Instruction 4170.11 applies to all military departments and agencies, covering various activities related to facilities energy. A memorandum from November 18, 2005, sets goals for reducing greenhouse gases, energy and water consumption, expanding renewable energy procurement, and reducing petroleum use. The guidance also includes completing eligible utility privatization under the Deputy Secretary of Defense and encourages sustainable building design. Additional guidance is provided in the DOD Energy Managers Handbook. DOD encourages obtaining LEED certification, responds to EPACT Section 103 with revised energy management instructions, and reports significant energy consumption in its facilities. \"Energy consumption at DOD facilities has been decreasing, with electricity costs staying within the range charged to commercial and industrial customers. Natural gas costs have generally followed local distribution company prices. Changes in reporting requirements for renewable energy have occurred due to new mandates and Executive Orders.\" \"DOD began reporting renewable energy in FY2000, with 5.5% of electricity consumption from renewables in FY2007. The goal is 25% by 2025. Despite energy consumption reductions, spending increased until FY2006 due to energy efficiency investments.\" The Defense Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) funds energy efficiency improvements in DOD programs through MILCON and O&M appropriations. Between 1999 and 2009, $442.9 million was allocated for Defense Energy Conservation Projects, prioritizing projects with high savings to investment ratios and quick payback periods. OSD centrally controls ECIP funding allocation based on project criteria. Between 2001 and 2007, the Department of Defense allocated $260.3 million for 193 ECIP projects, prioritizing projects based on energy efficiency and renewable energy goals. ESPCs, funded by Qualified Energy Service Companies, complement DOD's Energy Conservation Investment Program by providing additional energy efficiency improvements. Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) finance infrastructure improvements and new equipment to reduce energy consumption, funded through O&M appropriations. DOD awarded 248 ESPCs between 1999 and 2007 for over $2.8 billion. ESPCs impose a future financial obligation on the federal government, scored as mandatory spending by the CBO. The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act established pay-as-you-go rules for ESPCs, which create future commitments to appropriations. The GAO finds that ESPCs could be achieved with upfront funds but agencies often use ESPCs as a supplement to achieve energy savings benefits. DOD Utility Energy Savings Contracts are similar to ESPCs and can achieve the same energy efficiency improvements. Between 1999 and 2006, DOD reported placing 241 UESCs worth $967.6 million, funded through O&M appropriated funds. DOD's energy consumption can account for up to 23% of its annual budget, with over $3.4 billion spent annually in FY2006 and FY2007. Congress has allocated $443 million for DOD energy conservation projects, with an additional $250 million invested by DOD. Despite DOD's significant investments in energy conservation projects, annual energy spending has been increasing since 1999 due to rising electricity and natural gas prices. Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) have exceeded $2.8 billion in value and are a preferred method for making energy efficiency improvements. However, ESPCs come with risks for Energy Savings Contractors (ESCOs) who guarantee savings, leading to higher costs. ESPC commitments can extend up to 25 years to recoup investments, while UESCs offer lower costs but without savings guarantees. Federal agencies may not be fully utilizing the savings opportunities offered by Utility Energy Savings Contracts (UESCs) due to various factors such as limited promotion, unfamiliarity with UESCs, and the influence of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) by ESCOs. Aging buildings may struggle to meet energy efficiency goals, and investing in energy conservation may reach a point of diminishing returns. To achieve overall goals, replacing older buildings with new ones built to high-performance standards like LEED and ASHRAE may be more beneficial than continued investments in energy conservation projects and ESPC commitments. Congress may need to consider authorizing ESPCs for building renovation to install more efficient equipment, insulation, windows, and renewable energy sources. Expanding EISA Section 518 ESPC provision to renovate energy-inefficient buildings to LEED and high-performance standards could be beneficial. The lack of rules from DOE on applying O&M funds to ESPCs may hinder achieving DOD-related provisions in the ARRA of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for energy efficiency projects and repair of DOD facilities. Acquisition planning for improvements may exceed funding availability, requiring a trained acquisition workforce. Given the lack of rules, high funding level, and short obligation period, Congress may need to assess DOD's ability to act on provisions. DOD's energy costs could be reduced further by leveraging its buying power to negotiate lower utility rates."
