    "title": "SB 1214",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Best Value Construction Contracting Pilot Program for the Regents of the University of California is amended to require projects over $1,000,000 to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder or reject all bids. The Regents of the University of California may select the lowest responsible bidder based on best value, with procedures ensuring fair evaluation. If bids are equal, preference may be given to disadvantaged, women, or disabled veteran business enterprises. The Regents of the University of California have the authority to award a project to the second or third lowest responsible bidder if the successful bidder fails to execute the contract. The Public Contract Code defines \"best value\" as a procurement process that considers both price and qualifications in selecting the lowest responsible bidder. A \"best value contract\" is defined as a contract entered into under specific provisions. A \"best value contractor\" is a licensed entity that bids for or is awarded such a contract. \"Demonstrated management competency\" refers to the experience and capability of the proposed management team. \"Financial condition\" relates to the resources required to fulfill the contract, including the ability to obtain necessary bonds and insurance. Labor compliance refers to the ability to meet contract and statutory requirements for wages and workforce qualifications. Evaluation criteria include compliance with apprenticeship and prevailing wage laws. Qualifications for bidders also consider financial condition, relevant experience, management competency, safety record, and subcontractor qualifications. The definition of \"relevant experience\" includes the capacity to complete projects of similar size, scope, or complexity. The definition of \"safety record\" includes evaluating a bidder's safety performance based on criteria such as experience modification rate and injury rates. The term \"University\" refers to all locations of the University of California. Section 10506.8 of the Public Contract Code is repealed, and Section 10506.9 is amended to specify its expiration date. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
