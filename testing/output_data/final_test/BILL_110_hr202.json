The United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to authorize appropriations for tenant-based vouchers for fiscal years 2008 through 2012, including renewing expiring contracts and providing assistance for housing relocation and replacement. The Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134) includes provisions for various programs such as conversion of section 23 projects, family unification program, relocation of witnesses for crime combat, enhanced vouchers, HOPE VI program vouchers, and demolition or disposition of public housing. The Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134) includes provisions for various programs such as conversion of section 23 projects, family unification program, relocation of witnesses for crime combat, enhanced vouchers, HOPE VI program vouchers, and demolition or disposition of public housing units, mandatory and voluntary conversions to vouchers, vouchers for consent decrees or court orders, vouchers transferred from other agencies, and tenant protection assistance. The Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 includes provisions for various programs such as conversion of section 23 projects, family unification program, relocation of witnesses for crime combat, enhanced vouchers, HOPE VI program vouchers, and demolition or disposition of public housing units, mandatory and voluntary conversions to vouchers, vouchers for consent decrees or court orders, vouchers transferred from other agencies, and tenant protection assistance, including replacement and relocation assistance. The Secretary shall allocate renewal funding among public housing agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted by an annual factor, and make adjustments for first-time renewal of vouchers funded under paragraph (1)(B) and other appropriate adjustments. The Secretary determines leasing and cost data biennially, using the average for the most recent completed calendar year. This data includes vouchers set aside for project-based assistance. Public housing agencies participating in the moving to work program are exempt from these requirements. Public housing agencies participating in the Moving to Work program will be funded according to their agreement and subject to pro rata adjustments. If funds are insufficient, allocations may be adjusted accordingly. The Secretary will reduce agency allocations on a pro rata basis if funds exceed the necessary amount, with excess funds used for specified purposes. During the last 3 months of each calendar year, the Secretary can provide up to two percent of the allocation to public housing agencies for additional voucher costs. The amounts advanced must be repaid in the subsequent calendar year by reducing the agency's allocation. The Secretary can recapture unused amounts allocated to public housing agencies at the end of each calendar year and reallocate them by May 1 of the following year. The Secretary can recapture and reallocate unused amounts allocated to public housing agencies annually. This includes reimbursing agencies for increased costs related to portability and family self-sufficiency activities, and reallocating remaining amounts to agencies meeting specific criteria. The Secretary can reallocate unused amounts to public housing agencies to increase voucher leasing rates."
