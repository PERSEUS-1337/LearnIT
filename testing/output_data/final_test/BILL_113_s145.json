    "content": "The \"Save Our Students Act\" allows for National Guard support to keep schools safe from violence. The \"Save Our Students Act\" authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide funding to Governors who submit plans for using National Guard personnel to support school safety efforts, including administrative functions, security assessments, safety plans, and capital improvements. The \"Save Our Students Act\" authorizes funding for National Guard personnel to enhance school safety through capital improvements, equipment maintenance, and procurement of services and equipment. The \"Save Our Students Act\" allows funding for National Guard personnel to support school safety by procuring services and equipment, with a limit of $5,000 per item unless approved by the Secretary of Defense. National Guard personnel can be ordered to perform full-time duty under specific regulations. National Guard members can be ordered to full-time duty to support school safety efforts. They must participate in required training and receive the same pay and benefits as when performing duty for school safety. No additional pay is given for training participation. National Guard members can be ordered to full-time duty to support school safety efforts without degrading their military training and readiness. Activities must not interfere with military functions, degrade skills, or significantly increase training costs. Activities supplementing State and local efforts to keep schools safe from violence may be performed by a unit organized to serve as a unit, supporting valid unit training requirements. National Guard members can provide services or assistance to eligible organizations under an approved plan without interfering with military functions or significantly increasing training costs. The plan to supplement State and local efforts to keep schools safe from violence under this subsection must specify the use of National Guard personnel, certify that operations are conducted when personnel are not in Federal service, certify that participation is in addition to required training, and certify any engineer-type activities. The plan to supplement State and local efforts to keep schools safe from violence under this subsection must specify the use of National Guard personnel for engineer-type activities, certify authorization by the State Attorney General, and ensure activities with Federal law enforcement agencies serve a State law enforcement purpose. Before funds are provided to the Governor of a State under this section and before members of the National Guard are ordered to full-time duty, the Secretary of Defense must examine the adequacy of the plan submitted by the Governor. This examination is done in consultation with the Secretary of Education, except in cases where the Governor submits a plan similar to a previous year's plan and funds were provided accordingly. At the end of a fiscal year, there may not be more than 4,000 National Guard members on full-time duty to keep schools safe from violence, with funds provided under subsection (a)(2)(A). The Secretary of Defense can increase end strength by up to 20% if necessary for national security interests. An annual report to Congress is required on assistance provided and activities conducted under this section, including the number of National Guard members excluded from end strength calculations and activities to keep schools safe from violence. The annual report to Congress must include an accounting of funds provided to each state, the impact on military training and readiness when using National Guard units for school safety, and clarification that states' National Guard units can perform law enforcement functions as authorized by state laws. The term 'State' includes several States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and territories or possessions of the United States. It defines 'supplementing State and local efforts to keep schools safe from violence' as supporting State and local plans to ensure school safety. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the relevant chapter. Support for State and local efforts to keep schools safe from violence is defined as backing State and local plans to ensure school safety."
