    "content": "ENERGY INNOVATION HUBS. The Secretary of Energy will establish Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct collaborative research on advanced energy technologies with unique technology focuses to enhance economic, environmental, and energy security. Coordination with other Department of Energy research entities will be ensured to avoid duplication of activities. The Energy Innovation Hubs will collaborate with research entities like National Laboratories, ARPA-E, Energy Frontier Research Centers, and industry consortia. Consortia must have at least 2 qualifying entities and operate under an agreement detailing partnership, governance, cost-effective measures, and budget. The consortium applying to establish an Energy Innovation Hub must submit a detailed application to the Secretary, including a proposed budget, intellectual property rights plan, and accounting structure for compliance. The Secretary selects consortia for Hubs through competitive processes, considering disclosed information and existing facilities. Awards are for up to 5 years, renewable after merit review. Existing Hubs can receive support for 5 years. Each Hub conducts collaborative research on advanced energy technologies for 5 years, encourages communication among members, publishes plans online, and submits annual reports to the Secretary. Each Hub conducts collaborative research on advanced energy technologies for 5 years, encourages communication among members, publishes plans online, and submits annual reports to the Secretary. Hubs are required to submit annual reports summarizing activities, detailing expenditures, describing projects, and monitoring project implementation. Conflict of interest procedures must be maintained to ensure disclosure and avoidance of conflicts, with the Secretary having the authority to disqualify applications or revoke funds if conflicts are discovered. No funds from this section can be used for new building construction for Hubs, except for test beds or renovations. The Secretary may approve test bed or renovations for research purposes limited to necessary scope and scale. The Secretary can terminate underperforming Hubs for cause. Advanced energy technology includes innovative technologies for renewable and nuclear energy production. The Secretary may approve test bed or renovations for research purposes limited to necessary scope and scale. The Secretary can terminate underperforming Hubs for cause. Advanced energy technology includes innovative technologies for renewable and nuclear energy production, carbon capture and sequestration, advanced vehicles and components, energy efficiency, Smart Grid technologies, and enhancing energy independence and security through improved domestic energy resources. The Energy Innovation Hub focuses on research, development, and commercial application activities for ensuring a secure and sustainable energy supply of critical elements. Energy critical elements are chemical elements essential for new energy technologies, and a shortage would hinder their large-scale deployment. The term \"qualifying entity\" refers to institutions of higher education, State or Federal entities, nongovernmental organizations with expertise in advanced energy technology, or any other relevant entity deemed appropriate by the Secretary."
