    "content": "This report outlines the process for filling PAS positions requiring Senate confirmation in various government organizations during the 110th Congress. It includes nominations in executive and legislative branches, excluding appointments to executive departments and regulatory boards. Profiles of each agency track nominations, Senate activity, and presidential actions related to the nominations. The appointment process for PAS positions requiring Senate confirmation during the 110th Congress involves three stages: selection and nomination, confirmation, and appointment. The President nominates officers with Senate approval, who serve in high-ranking positions with significant authority. The White House selects and clears appointees before formal nomination to the Senate. The Senate confirmation process for PAS positions involves several steps. The President selects a candidate with assistance from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. Members of Congress and interest groups may recommend candidates, but the White House is not obligated to follow these suggestions. Senators argue they have a constitutional right to provide advice on nominations. If Senators feel consultation is lacking, they may use procedural measures. During the Senate confirmation process for PAS positions, pre-nomination consultation can lead to delays or blocks in considering a nomination. The candidate undergoes a clearance process overseen by the Office of the Counsel to the President, which includes submitting forms like the SF 278 and SF 86. Background investigations are conducted by various agencies, and conflicts of interest are addressed with the candidate. The nomination process for high-level positions involves clearance by the Office of the Counsel to the President, which can lead to delays. Efforts have been made to streamline this process, such as amendments to the Presidential Transition Act in 2004. Candidates for national security positions are prioritized for clearance, and nominees are encouraged to be submitted promptly after the election. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary appointments to be extended by 90 days during presidential transitions, potentially delaying permanent appointments. The President typically nominates individuals recommended by Senators or party leaders for positions within a state. Occasionally, recommendations are sought from Senators of the opposition party. The President solicits recommendations from Senators, including those from the opposition party, for federal positions. Recess appointments may be considered if circumstances allow, but they can have political consequences. Senate-confirmed positions can be temporarily filled under the Vacancies Act until confirmation is received. In the nomination process, advisors play a role until Senate confirmation and presidential appointment. The Senate then decides on confirmation based on various factors like the nominee's views and potential impact on public policy. The President's party control of the Senate and their involvement can also influence the scrutiny of a nominee's qualities. The Senate confirmation process involves committees receiving nominations and conducting investigations and hearings. Information from the White House and the committees themselves is used during the process. Hearings provide a platform for discussing nominees and related issues. Confirmation hearings offer opportunities for Senators and nominees to address concerns. The Senate confirmation process involves committees conducting hearings to explore nominees' qualifications, policy perspectives, and oversight issues. If a committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate, it can do so favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. The Senate may discharge the committee from further consideration of a nomination if it is not reported. Most executive nominations are historically confirmed by the Senate. The Senate confirmation process involves committees conducting hearings to explore nominees' qualifications, policy perspectives, and oversight issues. Most executive nominations are historically confirmed by the Senate, but unsuccessful nominations may fail to be reported or discharged from committee for various reasons. Senate rules dictate that pending nominations not confirmed or rejected in the session they were made must be resubmitted by the President in a succeeding session. The Senate confirmation process involves committees conducting hearings to explore nominees' qualifications, policy perspectives, and oversight issues. Once confirmed, the nominee is given a commission signed by the President and sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out responsibilities. The President can make limited-term recess appointments without Senate confirmation, which expire at the end of the following session of Congress. The Senate recesses for the 110th Congress, and Presidents have used recess appointments to bypass confirmation. Congress restricts pay for recess appointees, incentivizing Presidents to use this power strategically. If a position is filled by a recess appointment while the Senate is in session, the appointee may not be paid until confirmed, unless the vacancy arose within 30 days before the session's end. When a recess appointment is made, the President must submit a new nomination for the position within 40 days of the next Senate session. The Department of Justice interprets this to prevent payment for appointees receiving successive recess appointments to the same position. The FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act prevents recess appointees from being paid if their nominations are rejected by the Senate. Congress also restructured the Senate's longer recesses in response to the President's use of recess appointments. During the 110th Congress, the Senate restructured its recesses to prevent recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions every three days. This practice was implemented in November 2007, with pro forma sessions held during scheduled recesses to avoid appointments. The Senate reconvened for business on December 3, 2007, following this procedure for the remainder of the Congress. During the 110th Congress, the Senate restructured its recesses to prevent recess appointments by holding pro forma sessions every three days. President Bush made no additional recess appointments during the remainder of his presidency. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary filling of vacant positions requiring Senate confirmation in three ways. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows temporary appointments for vacant positions requiring Senate confirmation. The appointment is for 210 days but can be extended if nominations are pending. During a presidential transition, the 210-day restriction period is delayed. President Bush made 52 nominations during the 110th Congress, with 27 confirmed, 16 returned, and 9 withdrawn. Two recess appointments were made during this time. During the 110th Congress, President Bush made two recess appointments to positions covered in the report, which expired at the end of the session. The Senate's confirmation process varied widely, with nominations taking an average of 110 days and a median of 113 days to confirm. The methodology for counting the time between nomination and confirmation in this report differs from previous reports due to changes in Senate recesses and sessions. The new method reduces direct comparability with earlier statistics. Reasons for the change include shorter recesses with pro forma sessions, ongoing committee consideration during recesses, and alignment with political science methodology. The methodology for counting the time between nomination and confirmation in this report has changed to include all days, even during long recesses. Agency profiles provide data on presidential nominations and Senate action during the 110th Congress. Some agencies had no nomination activity during this period. At the end of the 110th Congress, full-time PAS positions in the department, incumbents, and pay levels were listed. Pay levels for Senate-confirmed positions ranged from level I ($196,700) to level V ($143,500). The nomination action table provided information on nominees, positions, nomination and confirmation dates, and days between nomination and confirmation. The methodology for counting time between nomination and confirmation now includes all days, even during recesses. The report includes information on nominees for positions, including those nominated multiple times. It also covers recess appointments and the average time between nomination and confirmation. The report provides average \"days to confirm\" nominations using mean and median to show central tendency. It includes a table of nominations and appointments, indicating confirmation status and time taken. Additionally, a summary table by agency is provided in another appendix. Appendix B summarizes appointments and nominations by agency categories, providing details on positions, nominees, confirmations, and time to confirm. Appendix C lists department abbreviations, while Appendix D covers Senate recesses and recess appointments. Methodological changes in tracking appointments are explained in detail in Appendix E. Appendix A provides a summary of all nominations and appointments to independent and other agencies, including agency abbreviations such as EPA, NASA, and NSF. The curr_chunk lists abbreviations for various government agencies and organizations, including OPM, SSA, SBA, and USAID. The curr_chunk provides information on the methodology used in calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals for the 110th Congress, including the inclusion of all days within the interval, even during recesses. This differs from previous reports where days during August and intersession recesses were not included in the calculations. The Senate is unlikely to consider nominations during certain recess periods, as committee activities typically do not occur then. Senate rules state that nominations not confirmed or rejected during the session they are made must be resubmitted by the President if the Senate adjourns or takes a recess longer than 30 days. This approach aligns with some political scientists' views on executive branch appointments. The methodology for this report differs from previous reports due to the Senate breaking longer recesses into shorter ones with pro forma sessions. This created two options for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals. The Senate and President actions during short recesses were consistent with treating them as short recesses, not subtracting days from the nomination-to-confirmation interval. This approach differs from previous reports, as pro forma sessions created shorter recesses, affecting the calculation of intervals. The methodological problem of subtracting days from the nomination-to-confirmation interval arose during the 110th Congress and may occur again in the future. Reasons for this change include intentional extensions of Senate consideration during recesses and the ongoing consideration of nominations by staff even during breaks. In response to the methodological problem of subtracting days from the nomination-to-confirmation interval, a new methodology for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals is employed in the report. This new approach aligns with the work of other political scientists and CRS judicial nominations research, allowing for easier comparison and combination with related work."
