The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 is amended to enhance the defense nanotechnology research and development program by updating the National Nanotechnology Initiative and the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office. The program's administration will be under the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 is amended to update the defense nanotechnology research program. The administration will now fall under the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics. Amendments include changes in administrative matters related to investments in nanotechnology research and development. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 is amended to update the defense nanotechnology research program. The program will now be overseen by the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics, with activities including the development of a strategic plan for defense nanotechnology research and interagency coordination with other departments participating in the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The National Nanotechnology Initiative will integrate nanotechnology research and development with the strategic plan. Policy guidance will be issued annually to establish research priorities, document benefits, and outline a strategy for transitioning research into needed products for the Department of Defense. Advocacy will be made for the transition of nanotechnologies in defense acquisition programs, including developing nanomanufacturing capabilities and a nanotechnology defense industrial base. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics will submit reports to congressional defense committees on the National Nanotechnology Initiative program, including a review of long-term challenges, technical goals, progress, funding levels, and adequacy of funding to support program activities. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics will submit reports to congressional defense committees on the National Nanotechnology Initiative program, including a review of coordination with other departments and agencies, analysis of recommendations from external reviews, and assessment of technology transition for enhanced warfighting capabilities.
