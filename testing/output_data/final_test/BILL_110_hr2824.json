Congress finds that in the 1830s, members of the Cherokee Nation were forcibly removed from their lands in the southeastern United States and made to migrate to Oklahoma along the Trail of Tears. This included Black slaves of Cherokees, free Blacks married to Cherokees, and the children of mixed-race families, known as the \"Black Cherokees\". In 1861, the Cherokee Nation signed a treaty with the Confederate States of America, cutting ties with the United States. After the Civil War, the United States reestablished relations with the Cherokee Nation. The Treaty of 1866 reestablished relations with the Cherokee Nation and declared the Black Cherokees, or Cherokee Freedmen, as citizens with full rights. The treaty also ensured uniform laws, presidential oversight for unjust laws, and the right for Freedmen to elect officials based on population. Following the Treaty of 1866, the Cherokee National Council guaranteed full rights to the Cherokee Freedmen as citizens of the Cherokee Nation. The Courts upheld the Cherokee Freedmen's treaty rights, including their entitlement to share in land sale proceeds and the Cherokee Nation's sovereignty being bound by treaty obligations to the United States. In 1906, the Supreme Court affirmed that Cherokee Freedmen are citizens of the Cherokee Nation with property rights under the Treaty of 1866. The Dawes Commission categorized Cherokee Nation members in 1906 as either Black Cherokees on the Freedmen Roll or other Cherokees on the Blood Roll based on African blood presence. In 1970, Congress passed the Principal Chiefs Act, requiring approval for voting laws for selecting the principal chief in certain Native American Nations. The Department of the Interior specified three fundamental conditions for democratic selection, including voter qualifications broad enough to include Cherokee Freedmen citizens. In May 2003, the Cherokee Nation held an election for officers and ratification of a new constitution. The vote aimed to amend the 1999 constitution by removing the requirement for US approval. Cherokee Freedmen were excluded from voting or running for office, violating various laws and guidelines. The new constitution of the Cherokee Nation removed the need for approval from the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for amendments. The election in May 2003 excluded Cherokee Freedmen from voting, violating several laws. The Department of the Interior did not recognize the vote, and the Cherokee Nation now operates with a Chief elected in violation of laws and treaties. In May 2003, the Cherokee Nation renamed its highest court to the Supreme Court after a ruling that Cherokee Freedmen were entitled to citizenship. The new constitution, not approved by the Department of the Interior, led to the appointment of additional judges by the illegally elected Principal Chief. In a 3-2 decision, judges ruled that the Cherokee Nation could vote on the tribal status of the Cherokee Freedmen. Despite allowing Freedmen to vote in the June 2007 election, their rights within the Cherokee Nation remain restricted. The Cherokee Nation is violating treaties by restricting Freedmen from running for office and halting their citizenship registration, reducing their voting rights for the upcoming election. The United States' relationship with the Cherokee Nation is not in its best interest and violates existing treaties and laws. The Cherokee Nation's current efforts to expel Cherokee Freedmen and abolish Department of the Interior oversight go against treaty rights and Freedmen citizenship. The Department of the Interior has failed in its fiduciary responsibility. The Department of the Interior failed in its fiduciary responsibility by not taking action against the Cherokee Nation for disenfranchising Freedmen in the 2003 election and expelling them in a 2007 referendum. The Department of the Interior failed to take action against the Cherokee Nation for disenfranchising Freedmen in the 2003 election and expelling them in a 2007 referendum. This led to the severance of relations with the Cherokee Nation. The United States severs all relations with the Cherokee Nation until they meet treaty obligations, restore rights of disenfranchised Freedmen, and receive final certification. The Secretary will ensure compliance with the Act across all government departments. Federal agencies must submit reports within 30 days. Federal agencies must submit reports on programs and compliance efforts related to the Cherokee Nation. The Secretary will provide monthly public reports to Congress until final certification of compliance with treaty obligations. The Secretary will issue a public report to Congress on the status of freedmen in certain Indian tribes in Oklahoma, addressing compliance with treaty obligations, tribal laws, leadership positions, benefits, and disenfranchisement efforts. After the Secretary certifies to Congress that the Cherokee Nation is in full compliance with its treaty obligations, and Congress approves this certification, the final certification of the Cherokee Nation's treaty compliance will take effect. The Cherokee Nation's authority to conduct gaming operations is suspended until compliance with all treaty obligations is achieved. The National Indian Gaming Commission must report to Congress on enforcement actions within 30 days. Definitions are provided in Section 4. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Defines terms like \"Cherokee\", \"Cherokee Freedmen\", and \"Other Freedmen Indians\" in relation to ancestry and tribal affiliation. SEC. 5. NONCOMPLIANCE. The provisions of this Act will take effect again if the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma is found to be not in compliance with its treaty obligations or Federal statutes. Cherokee Freedmen have the right to take legal action against the Cherokee Nation or Federal officials for noncompliance. SEC. 6. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The Attorney General will determine if the civil rights of Cherokee Freedmen were violated by the Cherokee Nation or the Department of the Interior. Freedmen can request an investigation within 180 days of reporting a violation. The Government Accountability Office will issue a public report to Congress detailing the Cherokee Nation's expenditure of Federal funds over the past 5 years, analyzing funds allocated for member benefits, services, and administrative purposes. The report will assess compliance with Federal regulations and laws regarding fund management and disbursement."
