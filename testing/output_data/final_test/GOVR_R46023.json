    "content": "The Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act of 2014 (STELA Reauthorization Act) governed the retransmission of television signals to cable, telco, and satellite subscribers. With the enactment of the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019, Congress permanently extended certain provisions affecting direct broadcast satellite service to viewers in rural areas. Congress amended laws related to television signal retransmission, including allowing owned broadcast stations to negotiate with cable and satellite operators. The FCC's role in resolving disputes was affirmed to prevent service interruptions. Changes were made to the Copyright Act to limit households eligible for non-local broadcast signals via satellite. Additionally, small video distributors can now negotiate collectively with large broadcast station groups. The aim is to increase transparency in billing for new customers of video distribution services. This report provides background information on how households receive television programming, the operation of the television industry, and the impact of the Copyright and Communications Acts on program availability. It discusses the provisions of the Copyright and Communications Act enacted in 2019 and its relationship with FCC media ownership rules amended in December 2019. Viewers can access broadcast television programming through individual antennas or by subscribing to multichannel video programming distributors like cable or satellite providers. The total number of U.S. households subscribing to multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) has declined over the past 10 years, with more households now relying on video provided over broadband connections or via over-the-air broadcast transmission. Currently, DIRECTV and DISH are the two main direct broadcast satellite providers in the United States. As of June 2019, DIRECTV had around 17.4 million U.S. subscribers, while DISH had about 9.5 million. Both have lost subscribers since 2014. The FCC licenses broadcast TV station owners for eight-year terms to use spectrum. The allocation plan aims to provide local communities with enough spectrum for local TV stations. Nielsen Company restricted TV viewership measurement to major metropolitan areas until the mid-1960s. Station viewership influences ad prices and revenue generation. Nielsen introduced Designated Market Areas (DMAs) to measure viewing habits in U.S. counties. Designated Market Areas (DMAs) are used to define local television markets since the late 1960s. Nielsen assigns each county to one of 210 DMAs based on viewing habits. Broadcast stations aim to reach viewers within their DMAs for advertising revenue. Advertisers use DMAs to target specific audiences. Broadcast stations and satellite operators have exclusive rights to air programming within their DMAs for advertising revenue. Advertisers use DMAs to target specific audiences. Cable, telco, and satellite services may offer stations within DMAs in their video packages, depending on station decisions. The Communications Act allows broadcast stations and satellite operators to make choices regarding retransmission and compensation. The Communications Act gives broadcast stations and satellite operators the rights to choose whether cable, telco, and satellite operators can retransmit their signals every three years. Cable operators and telcos must carry the signals of all TV stations seeking \"must carry\" status in their designated market area (DMA). Satellite operators must carry the signals of all stations seeking \"must carry\" status in a DMA if they carry at least one local TV station in that market. DIRECTV has chosen not to retransmit any local broadcast TV stations in 12 DMAs due to the \"carry one, carry all\" provision. In 12 DMAs, commercial broadcasting stations can seek compensation from cable, telco, and satellite operators for retransmission consent. Unlike must-carry laws, retransmission consent laws apply to all MVPDs. Broadcast stations can negotiate with MVPDs for the right to retransmit their signal within the station's DMA, and cable operators may also negotiate for consent to retransmit signals outside of the DMA. Negotiations for retransmission consent between broadcast stations and cable systems are typically done at the corporate level. Broadcast stations owned by station groups have increased negotiating power since 1993. Initially, large MVPDs did not pay broadcast stations directly for retransmission rights, leading to negotiations for alternative forms of compensation. The total amount of retransmission fees paid by MVPDs has significantly increased from $0.21 billion in 2006 to $12.38 billion in 2019. Broadcast stations began demanding cash for carriage as competition from satellite operators and telcos grew. Copyright owners have the exclusive right to license their works for distribution, leading to marketplace negotiations for retransmitted broadcast programming. The Copyright Act guarantees MVPDs the right to publicly perform broadcast television programming, following FCC regulations and paying royalties. The Act includes three statutory licenses for retransmitting local and distant television signals. The cable statutory license in Section 111 allows cable operators to retransmit both local and distant station signals. The Copyright Act provides statutory licenses for retransmitting television signals. The cable statutory license allows operators to retransmit local and distant station signals, while satellite operators can retransmit local signals under Section 122 and distant signals under Section 119. Congress has renewed the distant satellite license in five-year intervals, with a provision prohibiting the import of distant signals where local signals are available. The Copyright Act provides statutory licenses for retransmitting television signals to cable, telco, and satellite operators who make royalty payments every six months. The Copyright Royalty Board distributes royalties to copyright claimants and adjusts rates every five years. For more information, refer to CRS Report R44473, What's on Television? The Intersection of Communications and Copyright Policies by Dana A. Scherer. Congress has enacted a series of laws over the last 30 years to regulate satellite retransmission of broadcast television and promote competition between satellite and cable operators. This includes the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988, the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, and the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014. Recent laws such as the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 have extended legal provisions governing retransmission. The STELA Reauthorization Act of 2020 permanently extended certain legal provisions for retransmission of distant network broadcast signals, while repealing others. One provision that was set to expire was Section 119 of the Copyright Act, allowing satellite operators to obtain rights to copyrighted programming from distant broadcast network affiliates. Satellite operators submit a statement of account and pay a royalty fee to the U.S. Copyright Office semiannually to retransmit signals from up to two distant network stations to unserved households. The STELA Reauthorization Act of 2020 extended legal provisions for retransmission of distant network broadcast signals. Section 119 of the Copyright Act allowed satellite operators to retransmit signals to unserved households, including those located too far from a broadcast station or with written consent from a local network affiliate. In 2010, Congress incentivized DISH to offer local-into-local service in all 210 markets with the enactment of STELA. Between 2014 and 2019, Section 119 royalties collected by the Copyright Office declined by 89% due to fewer distant network stations and the conversion of superstations to cable networks. Satellite television subscriptions also decreased during this time. The total number of households subscribing to satellite television declined from 34.4 million in 2014 to 27.3 million in 2019. Provisions of the Communications Act related to retransmitting broadcast signals were set to expire at the end of 2019, including those referencing Section 119 of the Copyright Act. Section 339(a)(1)(A) of the Communications Act allows satellite operators to retransmit signals of two affiliates of the same network in a single day to households outside of those stations' DMAs, subject to Section 119 of the Copyright Act. Satellite operators can also retransmit local broadcast signals under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7122 in addition to any distant signals under Section 119. Rules for retransmitting broadcast station signals to satellite subscribers meeting the \"unserved household\" definition under Section 119 are discussed in Section 339(a)(2)(A). Eligibility for receiving distant signals is described in Section 339(a)(2)(D) and (c)(4)(A), referencing the \"unserved household\" definition under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7119(d)(10)(A). Section 339(a)(2)(G) clarifies that this paragraph does not affect the ability to receive signals. Section 339(a)(2)(G) clarifies that the paragraph does not affect the ability to receive secondary transmissions as an unserved household under Section 119(a)(12) of title 17, United States Code. Section 339(c)(2) outlines the process for households to seek a local affiliate's permission to receive a distant signal and qualify as an \"unserved household\" under Section 119 of the Copyright Act. Section 340(3)(2) states that a satellite operator retransmitting a distant broadcast signal under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7119 is not required to comply with FCC regulations for blacking out certain programs. Section 342 cross-references Section 119 of the Copyright Act and describes the process for DISH to obtain certification from the FCC. The process for DISH to obtain certification from the FCC to provide local-into-local service in all 210 DMAs involves presenting certification to the Florida district court. Section 325(b)(3)(C) of the Communications Act prohibits exclusive contracts for carriage and requires good faith negotiations between broadcast stations and MVPDs. Coordination of negotiations among separately owned TV stations in the same DMA is a violation of good faith standards. The FCC enforces these provisions through a two-part framework. The FCC enforces good faith negotiation standards through a two-part framework, including nine specific standards and an evaluation of the \"totality of circumstances.\" Complaints of failure to negotiate in good faith have been filed by both broadcast television station owners and MVPDs. In some cases, the FCC found the complaints invalid, while in 2016, a consent decree was reached with Sinclair Broadcast. In 2016, the FCC reached a consent decree with Sinclair Broadcast Group after investigating a complaint lacking validity. The FCC has monitored retransmission consent negotiations without complaints. In November 2019, seven station group owners violated negotiation standards with AT&T. The FCC prohibits coordination among TV stations in the same DMA permanently. Coordination is a per se violation of good faith negotiation rules. The FCC has rules regarding ownership of stations within a DMA and common ownership or control. In 2016, the FCC adopted rules on advertising time sales between stations, but in 2017, this rule was eliminated. In September 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated and remanded the FCC's 2017 decision. In September 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the FCC's 2017 reconsideration. The court vacated rule changes adopted by the FCC in 2017. The FCC issued an order in December 2019 to amend its rules in response to the court's decision. President Trump signed laws amending Copyright and Communications Acts in December 2019. The FCC has not indicated whether it will seek Supreme Court review of the Third Circuit's decision. The Copyright and Communications Acts were amended by P.L. 116-94 in December 2019. Section 119 of the Copyright Act was permanently extended, with limitations on eligible \"unserved households.\" These include operators of recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and households in \"short markets.\" Short markets are defined as local markets where certain TV networks are not available due to various reasons. The Copyright Act was amended to condition satellite operators' eligibility to retransmit distant signals on retransmitting local television signals in all 210 DMAs. After May 31, 2020, certain unserved households are no longer eligible for distant signals unless their satellite operator provides local-into-local service. Other households described in the Expiring Provision of Copyright Act are also affected. Satellite operators must provide local service in all 210 markets to maintain access to the distant compulsory license. Title X of the act permanently extends portions of the Communications Act set to expire at the end of 2019, while amending others. Satellite operators may retransmit broadcast station signals outside of the station's local markets without retransmission consent if done under Section 119 of the Copyright Act. Broadcast stations cannot have exclusive contracts with MVPDs, and negotiations for retransmission consent must be done in good faith. Accusations of not negotiating in good faith can be made by any party. Title X of the act permanently extends portions of the Communications Act set to expire at the end of 2019, while amending others. Satellite operators may retransmit broadcast station signals outside of the station's local markets without retransmission consent if done under Section 119 of the Copyright Act. Negotiations for retransmission consent must be done in good faith, and accusations of not negotiating in good faith can be made by any party. The accusing party may petition the FCC to mediate, and joint retransmission consent negotiations by separately owned broadcast stations within the same market constitutes failure to negotiate in good faith. Additionally, a qualified \"MVPD buying group\" representing smaller cable, telco, and/or satellite operators may negotiate retransmission consent with large broadcast station group owners without violating the good faith requirement. The buying group may represent only cable, telco, or satellite operators with 500,000 or fewer subscribers nationally, and the broadcast station owner with whom the group negotiates must reach more than 20% of the national audience. This amendment takes effect no later than March 19, 2020, 90 days after the enactment of P.L. 116-94. The FCC reinstated media ownership rules on December 20, 2019, limiting ownership to one station per DMA unless eight independently owned stations remain. Stations jointly selling 15% or more of advertising time are considered \"owned.\" Non-top-four stations cannot negotiate with separately owned top-four affiliates if it violates the eight voices test. Similarly, two non-top-four stations cannot jointly negotiate retransmission consent if common ownership violates the eight voices test. The FCC discounts the national reach of a broadcast station owner. The FCC discounts the national reach of a broadcast station owner by half for stations operating in the UHF band. NBC Universal and Gray Television fall into this category, limiting negotiations with qualified MVPDs unless the UHF discount is repealed. Some television companies can operate stations under agreements without them counting towards ownership limits. The FCC considers the impact of the UHF discount on broadcast station owners like NBC Universal and Gray Television, affecting negotiations with qualified MVPDs. Third-party station ownership in retransmission consent negotiations is a key issue for Congress and the FCC to address."
