    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Assistance to Firefighters Grant Reauthorization Act of 2004\". In the United States, there are 1,100,000 firefighters in over 30,000 fire departments. In 2002, fire departments responded to nearly 1,700,000 fires. Every 19 seconds, a fire department responds to a fire. In the same year, 110 firefighters died in the line of duty, and fires caused the deaths of 3,380 civilians. Additionally, 18,425 people were injured from fires, and there was an estimated $10,337,000,000 in property damage caused by fires. Approximately 1/4 of emergency responders lack radios, one-third of firefighters lack SCBA, half of SCBA units are over 10 years old, nearly half of firefighters lack PASS devices, 57,000 firefighters lack protective clothing, one-third of clothing is over 10 years old, half of fire engines are over 15 years old, and only one-fourth of fire departments can communicate with partners. Only a small percentage of fire departments have essential equipment such as thermal imaging cameras, mobile data terminals, advanced personnel location equipment, and equipment for collecting chemical or biological samples. Additionally, a significant portion of the population is not adequately protected by fire departments lacking programs for free distribution of home smoke alarms, juvenile firesetter programs, and fire safety education based on a national curriculum. Only a small percentage of fire departments have the necessary capabilities to respond to various emergency situations, such as technical rescues, hazmat incidents, wildland/urban interface fires, and major floods. Many departments consider these incidents outside their scope, highlighting a significant gap in emergency response capabilities. Many fire departments lack the capabilities to respond to major floods, considering such incidents outside their scope. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS. Section 33 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is amended to replace \"Director\" with \"Administrator\" and make various additions related to fire departments, volunteer emergency medical service squads, and firefighter safety research and development. In subsection (b)(6), amendments are made to enhance firefighter safety research and development programs, focusing on high-risk groups and improving firefighter health and life safety. Amendments are made to subsection (b)(6) to enhance firefighter safety research and development programs, with a focus on high-risk groups and improving firefighter health and life safety. This includes adjustments to matching requirements for grants and recipient limitations. The Administrator may award grants to jurisdictions based on population size, with limits of $1,000,000 for 500,000 people or less, $2,000,000 for 500,000 to 1,000,000 people, and $3,000,000 for over 1,000,000 people. Grants exceeding these limits may be awarded to recipients serving populations close to the specified thresholds. The bill sets limits on grant awards based on population size, with a maximum of $3,000,000 for jurisdictions with over 1,000,000 people. Recipients serving populations near these thresholds may receive grants exceeding the limits. Additionally, no single recipient can receive more than one half of one percent of the funds appropriated for a fiscal year, and a maximum of 4 percent of funds can be awarded to volunteer emergency medical services. The Administrator will convene an annual meeting of non-Federal fire service experts to recommend grant criteria for the next fiscal year and suggest any necessary administrative changes. Guidelines for applying and awarding grants will be published in the Federal Register each year before grants are distributed. The Administrator will convene an annual meeting of non-Federal fire service experts to recommend grant criteria for the next fiscal year and suggest any necessary administrative changes. Guidelines for applying and awarding grants, including peer review by fire service personnel, will be published in the Federal Register each year before grants are distributed. The criteria for awarding grants will focus on enhancing fire department operations and the impact on protecting lives and property, while also ensuring protection of volunteers from discrimination. The fire department receiving funds must not discriminate against volunteers or restrict their off-duty activities in another jurisdiction. Additionally, the time frame for subsection (e)(1) has been updated from \"2002 through 2004\" to \"2005 through 2007\". SEC. 4. REPORTS. The Administrator of the United States Fire Administration will reconduct a study in collaboration with the National Fire Protection Association to define the role of fire services, analyze grant awards, provide a needs assessment, and measure the impact of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant on a national and State-by-State basis. The Administrator will conduct a study to assess the impact of the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program in addressing identified shortfalls. A report on the study results will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. $300,000 is authorized for the study in fiscal year 2005."
