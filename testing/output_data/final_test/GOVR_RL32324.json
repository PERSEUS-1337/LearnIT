Some argue that government funding of health-related R&D should result in affordable drug prices, while others believe in letting the market drive innovation and pricing. Federal involvement in research is seen as crucial for economic growth through technological advancement. Government funding of basic research is essential for technological progress and economic growth. To address underinvestment in these activities, the government funds fundamental research as a public good. Legislation has been passed to facilitate the commercialization of new technology, including incentives for private sector investment in technology development. The government funds basic research to promote technological progress and economic growth. Legislation aims to encourage academia and industry to commercialize federally supported R&D through technology transfer and intellectual property rights. There are concerns about the balance between public needs and private benefits, with some Members of Congress questioning the adequacy of the current approach. Government retains certain rights for intervention in health and safety concerns as safeguards for the public. The substantial federal investment in health-related research and development has led to debates about the balance between public and private needs. Critics argue that incentives like patent protection and regulatory advantages may not be necessary, while others believe these inducements have been crucial for innovation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The government's funding of research and development in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is explored, focusing on the National Institutes of Health's support for new drug development through collaboration with academia and industry. The paper does not address drug pricing issues but aims to provide insights on the use of federal R&D results. The U.S. government spends billions on research and development to meet mission requirements of federal departments. Federal funding supports basic research not done in the private sector, aiming to facilitate technological progress and innovation in health-related areas. Government support of basic scientific research provides a significant social rate of return on R&D spending, which is often higher than the benefits captured by individual firms. This support aims to improve social well-being through scientific knowledge that cannot be sold but benefits society as a whole. However, the long-term and uncertain nature of the rewards from basic research can lead to underinvestment by the business community and dampen private sector financial commitments due to the high risk of failure. Congressional initiatives have expanded the government's role in R&D to promote innovation. Technological advancement plays a crucial role in the nation's economic growth, with experts attributing up to half of the U.S. economy's growth to technical progress. Industrial expansion now relies more on scientific discoveries and engineering knowledge, such as biomedical applications and electronics, driving the economy by creating new goods and services. Technological progress through innovation and research and development contributes significantly to economic growth by enhancing productivity and creating new industries, jobs, and capital. Investments in research and development drive productivity increases and lead to innovations in various industries. Government policies incentivize private sector utilization of R&D results, promoting collaboration for commercialization. Joint federal efforts with the private sector facilitate the transfer of government research and technical expertise to businesses for commercialization and economic growth. Collaborative ventures across government, industry, and academia promote innovation by combining ideas, expertise, and resources. Industry's increasing investment in R&D is driven by the need to keep up with new technologies and shortened product cycles. The rising costs of technology development have led to increased company support for research and development. Partnerships and collaborative R&D efforts have become essential due to intense competition and shareholder demands for quick returns. These alliances allow firms to access new technologies without bearing the full cost and risk of development independently. Collaboration in research and development allows firms to acquire necessary technical knowledge from external sources, leading to increased productivity growth. Outsourcing R&D has shown to result in faster growth and higher profitability for businesses. In 2007, U.S. companies outsourced 7.8% of their R&D expenditures, reflecting a growing trend in external R&D support. Joint ventures, however, may not always be successful due to various factors such as failed concepts or cultural differences. Studies by PriceWaterhouseCoopers highlight the benefits of partnering, including increased sales, improved competitive position, higher productivity, and development of new products. Fast-growing U.S. firms have seen significant growth rates through partnerships, leading to more innovative products and profit opportunities. Collaborative growth firms prioritize new product development and innovation by working with external partners. The trend of collaborative R&D activities is growing in the pharmaceutical industry, with an increasing number of alliances between large businesses and small biotech companies. Ernst & Young reported a significant increase in strategic alliances in the sector from 2005 to 2008, with continued growth in 2010. This trend is also reflected in the manufacturing sector, where over 60% of organizations view technology collaborations as important for growth, with plans to expand collaborative efforts. The National Science Foundation reported a 119.2% increase in R&D expenditures contracted out by pharmaceutical industries in the United States between 2000 and 2005. Research shows benefits to alliances, with nearly a third of new pharmaceutical products developed through alliances. Drugs developed in alliances have higher success rates in clinical trials. Collaborative R&D efforts improve the innovation process by merging technological knowledge and skills from different companies. Industry-university cooperation in R&D, along with joint projects among companies, enhances the innovation process by merging technological knowledge and skills. Companies increasingly rely on academia for basic research, reducing in-house research costs. Over 90% of life science companies in the US had partnerships with universities by the late 1990s. In 2007, over half of academic life science faculty had industry relationships, leading to increased productivity. A 2006 survey found that 67% of academic departments had relationships with pharmaceutical companies, leading to increased productivity. Research from public-sector institutions has resulted in the discovery of 153 FDA-approved drugs in the past 40 years. Between 9.3 and 21.2% of new drug applications approved from 1990 to 2007 were a result of work done by these institutions. Research from public-sector institutions has led to the discovery of 153 FDA-approved drugs in the past 40 years. Between 9.3 and 21.2% of new drug applications approved from 1990 to 2007 were the result of work done by these institutions, with 31% of scientifically novel drugs originating from university research. Patents play a crucial role in facilitating cooperative work between government, industry, and academia to promote innovation and the progress of science and the useful arts. The patent system, rooted in the Constitution, aims to stimulate innovation by granting exclusive rights to inventors for 20 years. This encourages further development of ideas and marketable technologies while also placing the concept in the public domain. The patent system grants exclusive rights to inventors for 20 years to stimulate innovation. It encourages the publication of ideas covered in patents, which can lead to parallel technical developments. Innovation produces new knowledge, which is considered a \"public good\" and not depleted when used. This concept underlies the U.S. patent system, where the marginal social cost of widespread application of knowledge is near zero. The federal government funds basic research to support innovation, which is costly and resource-intensive. Patents allow for control over novel concepts and create incentives for inventors to realize a return on investments. Research is essential for innovation, constituting approximately 25% of the cost of commercializing new technology. The grant of a patent provides inventors with exclusive rights to their invention for 20 years, encouraging further development and marketable technology. Patents are crucial in industries like drugs and chemicals due to the ease of reproducing results and detailed claims for defense. In contrast, patents offer less protection in other industries. In industries like aircraft and semiconductor, patents are not as effective in capturing investment benefits compared to lead time and learning curve strength. Studies show that secrecy and lead time are more important than patents in these industries. The perception of patents' effectiveness is positively correlated with increased duplication costs and time. The patent system aims to incentivize inventors while also encouraging innovation. The patent system has dual policy goals of incentivizing inventors and encouraging disclosure of technical information. It aims to balance current and future innovation through factors like disclosure requirements, scope limitations, novelty mandates, and nonobviousness considerations. Patents can foster competitiveness and multiple sources of innovation, leading to technological progress. However, some critics argue that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces already driving innovation. The patent system aims to incentivize inventors and promote technological progress. Critics argue that market forces alone drive innovation, questioning the necessity of patents. Competing views on the patent system's impact include concerns about industry concentration, barriers to entry, and the attraction of speculators. The relationship between innovation and patent rights lacks rigorous analytical methods for studying its effect on the economy. The patent system is not calibrated precisely for optimal innovation investment. Arguments for and against patents are open to challenge. Legislative provisions use intellectual property rights to promote collaborative R&D for new products. P.L. 96-480 and P.L. 96-517 serve as the basis for using patents and licensing for cooperative R&D efforts. The Stevenson-Wydler Act and the Bayh-Dole Act promote collaborative R&D and technology transfer by addressing intellectual property issues related to federal government-funded technologies. These laws impact interactions between government agencies, academia, and industry in the R&D sector, potentially conflicting with goals of drug cost containment and innovation encouragement. The Stevenson-Wydler Act encourages technology transfer from federal laboratories to outside organizations, while the Bayh-Dole Act focuses on patent distribution from federally funded research. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and the FY1990 Department of Defense Authorizations created cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) for technology transfer. CRADAs are legal documents that define collaborative ventures at the laboratory level, allowing for the exchange of funds, personnel, services, and property between parties. The government can cover overhead costs but is prohibited from providing direct funding. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and the FY1990 Department of Defense Authorizations established CRADAs for technology transfer, allowing collaborative ventures at the laboratory level. The government can cover overhead costs but cannot provide direct funding. The act does not specify the dispensation of patents, allowing agencies to develop their own policies. Non-federal collaborating parties have the option to choose an exclusive license for inventions under the agreement. The government retains certain rights, including a nonexclusive license for research or other government purposes. Under the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, CRADAs allow collaborative ventures at the laboratory level for technology transfer. The government may require a party to license technology to address health and safety needs, meet public use requirements, or if obligations are not met. Preference is given to small businesses, US manufacturers, or foreign firms from countries allowing similar arrangements. CRADAs promote cooperative activities for the widest use of this arrangement. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 allows for collaborative ventures through CRADAs at the laboratory level for technology transfer. CRADAs are a visible form of cooperative activity, with other mechanisms including personnel exchanges, licensing of patents, and educational initiatives. Federal laboratories are prohibited from competing with the private sector and can only offer expertise and equipment not readily available elsewhere. Technology transfer and cooperative efforts must not interfere with the laboratories' R&D mission-related activities. The Bayh-Dole Act aims to promote the utilization of federally funded inventions by providing ownership of certain patents to universities, nonprofit institutions, and small businesses. This is in response to the low utilization of federally owned patents, with agencies taking title to inventions but only allowing nonexclusive licensing, which may hinder companies from investing in further research and development for market applications. The Bayh-Dole Act allows universities, nonprofit institutions, and small businesses to retain ownership of patents from federally funded R&D. This incentivizes cooperative work and commercial application, with royalties supporting further research and providing a return on financial contributions. The Act clarifies the order of rights between the Federal Government and contractors in federally funded inventions. The Bayh-Dole Act allows institutions to retain ownership of federally funded inventions, with certain conditions and exceptions. The government may withhold title in exceptional circumstances or for national security reasons. The government retains rights to practice federally funded inventions worldwide and can enforce \"march-in rights\" if the contractor fails to commercialize or address health/safety needs. The Bayh-Dole Act allows federal departments to license inventions to address health or safety needs, with the government retaining certain rights. Title 35 U.S.C. Section 209 outlines the conditions for licensing, including the right to terminate if commercialization is not pursued or for public use. Agencies must inform the public about available patents through notices in the Federal Register. The National Institutes of Health funds over $30.9 billion for R&D, with a focus on extending healthy life and reducing illness. Small businesses are given preferences for licenses, with a requirement for products to be manufactured in the United States. The agency is mandated to ensure licensing of inventions to address health or safety needs, with the government retaining certain rights. The NIH is mandated to transfer new technologies from its laboratories to the private sector for commercialization. There are concerns about the adequacy of current arrangements for health research funding and commercial potential, leading to questions in Congress about closer cooperation to augment funding sources. Most experts agree that closer cooperation can augment funding sources, increase technology transfer, stimulate innovation, lead to new products, and expand markets. However, collaboration may also lead to unfair advantages, conflicts of interest, and less openness in sharing scientific discovery. NIH's intramural research accounts for 10% of its budget, with inventions made in its laboratories leading to patents, licenses, and royalties. In FY2002, 331 inventions were disclosed by NIH, leading to 99 patents issued and $51.0 million in royalty payments. Over the FY2002-FY2012 period, $917.7 million in royalties were generated from NIH-owned patents, with 26 FDA approved products developed using NIH intramural research technology. NIH was responsible for 95% of royalties collected by six agencies studied. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had the largest number of licensing agreements between 1996 and 1998, generating 55.1% of total license fees collected by federal laboratories in FY2009. The Public Health Service (PHS) aims to transfer new technologies to the private sector efficiently while protecting the public interest. The NIH's patenting and licensing agreements aim to balance product development with market competition. CRADAs must align with NIH's mission and not divert resources. Collaboration is expected to enhance government scientists' capabilities. Knowledge generated from NIH-supported research must be published, with time for patent protection. PHS research results are freely published to support technology transfer and scientific freedom. The NIH seeks patent protection for biomedical technologies to make them available to the public for various uses. Under a CRADA, the producing party retains ownership of inventions, data, and materials produced solely by its employees, while jointly owning inventions, data, and materials developed together. The collaborating party in a CRADA has the option to elect an exclusive or nonexclusive license to any subject invention not made solely by an employee of the collaborating entity. The terms of the license will reflect the nature of the CRADA Subject Invention, contributions of the Parties, development and marketing plan, risks incurred by the Collaborator, and costs of subsequent research and development. Licensing decisions aim to develop technology for broad applications, with non-exclusive or co-exclusive licenses preferred, and exclusive licenses for specific indications or fields of use. The NIH requires sublicenses for mandatory exclusive licenses under a CRADA to broaden development possibilities for public health. Licensed technologies must be available for research and commercialized promptly, offered for sale, and accessible to the public. Efforts are made to encourage competing products and fair financial returns on the public's research investment through royalty-bearing licenses. The \"fair pricing clause\" was included in agreements before 1995, and a pricing policy was instituted by the Public Health Service in 1989. The Public Health Service implemented a pricing policy for products resulting from government-owned patents licensed by NIH exclusively to industry or jointly developed under a CRADA. The policy aimed to ensure a reasonable relationship between pricing, public investment in research, and public health needs, in response to public and political pressures. The pricing clause mandating reasonable pricing for products resulting from government-owned patents was instituted in response to concerns over the cost of AZT, a drug used in HIV treatment. It was removed in 1995 after Dr. Harold Varmus concluded it drove industry away from collaborations without benefiting the public. The pricing clause in NIH CRADAs was seen as a barrier by companies, leading to potential inaccessibility of drugs due to costs. Industry sources cited uncertainty over fair pricing as a major deterrent to entering into cooperative arrangements, resulting in many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies declining to undertake CRADAs. Some firms declined joint clinical trials with NIH due to future price control concerns. Patient advocacy groups called for repeal of the fair pricing clause. NIH was hesitant to make pricing decisions, defining reasonable pricing as within existing therapy ranges. Dr. Healy suggested NIH approach fair pricing as a co-inventor leveraging its contributions. After rescinding the fair pricing clause in April 1995, the number of CRADAs executed by NIH increased substantially. Extramural research, mainly at universities or medical centers, receives the majority of NIH research funding. The Bayh-Dole Act mandates that federal departments and agencies do not retain title to inventions made with government funding when research is done by an outside contractor. This means the federal organization does not own the patent and does not receive royalty payments for licensing agreements. The agency also has limited control over how these technologies are commercialized. The Bayh-Dole Act has been successful in facilitating the commercialization of technology, as shown by the increase in new commercial products, companies, and licenses granted. Funding for university research in the life sciences, particularly in the medical and biological sciences, is primarily supported by the federal government. The federal government is the main source of funding for academic research, which is crucial for the business community. Studies show that companies with university ties have higher productivity rates, and a significant portion of new drugs rely on academic research for commercialization. Public-sector research institutions play a key role in drug discovery and innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. Public science, supported by governmental, academic, and charitable research institutions, is crucial for private sector technology development. Recent analysis confirms the impact of public-sector research on drug development, with public-sector patents leading to the most innovative drugs. Studies show that public science is essential for supporting U.S. industry and advancing technology. Academic, governmental, and public facilities contribute significantly more to patents granted to U.S. companies compared to industrial sources. Public research, including governmental, academic, and charitable institutions, plays a crucial role in private sector technology development. Studies show that public science significantly impacts industrial R&D across various industries, with the biomedical community heavily relying on basic research. Government-funded research contributes to drug development by discovering phenomena, developing techniques, and advancing technology. Federal funding plays a crucial role in pharmaceutical product innovation by contributing to basic research, which leads to the development of new drugs and clinical applications. Private sector firms often rely on public research to explore new uses for existing drugs due to patent restrictions. Research has shown that federally funded basic research significantly contributes to pharmaceutical innovation, although it can be challenging to pinpoint the exact government's contribution to a new drug. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted a detailed analysis of top-selling drugs in 1994 and 1995, finding that research can target specific diseases or focus on basic mechanisms. Disease-specific research can drive progress, but breakthroughs in drug discovery can also come from unrelated fields. NIH examined 47 FDA-approved drugs with high sales to determine their role in innovation. The NIH analyzed 47 top-selling FDA-approved drugs to see if NIH-sponsored technologies played a role in their development. Four of these drugs, including Epogen\u00ae, Procrit\u00ae, Neupogen\u00ae, and Taxol\u00ae, were found to have utilized technologies supported by NIH grants. Epogen\u00ae and Procrit\u00ae were based on patented process technology from Columbia University, licensed to Amgen and Johnson & Johnson. Neupogen\u00ae was manufactured by Amgen using patented technologies from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Taxol\u00ae was manufactured by Bristol Myers Squibb. The NIH has received millions in royalties from Bristol Myers Squibb for Taxol\u00ae manufacturing using technology developed by Florida State University with NIH grant funds. Government support of research led to the development of only a few brand name drugs. Research has significantly contributed to advances in medicine and biology, but the direct impact on therapeutic products from the Bayh-Dole process is limited and hard to determine. The government's lack of ownership of contractor inventions complicates tracking federal contributions. The benefits of biomedical research extend beyond economic gains, with potential life-saving products and opportunities for economic growth through improved productivity. Federal support for health-related R&D, amounting to approximately 21.5% of the total federal R&D budget, has raised concerns about the return on investment for taxpayers. Some suggest government involvement in setting pharmaceutical prices or recouping its investment from firms benefiting from federally supported R&D. The government provides funding for health-related R&D, leading to concerns about the return on investment. Suggestions include government ownership of intellectual property from public investment, granting firms monopoly rights through patent protection, and offering financial and regulatory advantages. Critics argue that the pharmaceutical industry has benefited from a relatively unrestrictive regulatory environment. In the late 1990s, an investigation by the Boston Globe found that pharmaceutical companies were benefiting from government-funded research and charging high prices for drugs. The Globe's research showed that 45 of the top-selling drugs were developed with government funding of $175 million, leading to significant profits for the companies. The government typically funds basic research as a public good, but there are arguments that health care has private benefits. Providing patent protection to federally funded research results benefits companies but may not be necessary for innovation in drug development due to governmental subsidization of research costs. The public investment in R&D replaces some patent incentives for private research. High drug prices are not solely due to R&D costs, as federal funding and fast-track approval play a role. Proponents suggest modifying patent monopoly with public subsidization for a return on investment. Critics argue that the patent system favors holders over the public interest in drug pricing. The prices of pharmaceuticals and therapeutics should reflect public contributions to products and processes, according to advocates of government involvement in price decisions. Critics argue that federal support for basic research is essential for innovation and long-term returns, and that policies to recoup research support may misunderstand the role of the NIH in research and development. Investments in research generate long-term returns, with the rate of return to society from government-funded biomedical research potentially reaching 30% annually. Basic research funded by the National Institutes of Health provides vital knowledge for future innovations and requires public support to sustain. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research at universities focused on understanding disease mechanisms, which is then used by the private sector to develop treatments. This public sector research plays a crucial role in drug discovery, providing fundamental insights that impact pharmaceutical R&D. The research supported by NIH explores fundamental biological mechanisms that may lead to medical advancements for diseases lacking effective therapies. While pharmaceutical companies invest more in R&D for new drugs, NIH funding enables early-stage findings that can benefit a wider population. The government and private sector both play crucial roles in drug development, with benefits flowing in both directions. A study by NIH showed that public and private sector research are complementary in the U.S. biomedical science field. Government involvement is highest in preclinical and clinical development stages. The government's involvement in drug development, particularly in preclinical and clinical stages, focused on treatments for serious diseases. NIH also contributed to the discovery of compounds in the public domain. Some argue against changes in intellectual property ownership of federally funded R&D results, citing the need for incentives to promote scientific progress in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries heavily rely on patents to promote innovation. These industries invest significantly in research and development, with pharmaceutical companies reinvesting 8% to 20% of revenues in R&D. Biotechnology companies, often small and lacking profits, depend on intellectual property rights to finance R&D, with most funding coming from equity capital rather than profits. Only 5% of biotech companies have sales and rely on venture capital and IPOs for funding. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries heavily rely on patents for innovation and funding. Experts argue that patent protection is essential for raising equity capital and promoting research and development. Weakening patent protection could hinder private R&D investment and innovation, impacting future generations' health and wealth. Calfee argues that faster research and development quickens the competitive process, emphasizing the importance of financial rewards for new drug development. Experts warn that drug price controls and limited reimbursement can deter industry investment in research and development, potentially impacting innovation and future healthcare advancements. The threat of price controls can deter industry investment in research and development, leading to a negative effect on firm R&D investment and foregone medical innovation. The Bayh-Dole Act incentivizes cooperative work and commercial application by providing title to patents arising from federally funded R&D. Royalties from intellectual property rights offer support for further research in the academic community and the business sector. The Bayh-Dole Act provides a way for the academic community and the business sector to benefit from federally funded research through royalties from intellectual property rights. Congress rejected the idea of recoupment as it was seen as an unnecessary burden, opting instead for increased revenues from taxes, job creation, and economic growth as a means of payback. The Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to benefit from federally funded research through royalties from intellectual property rights, generating significant revenue from taxes. Critics argue that patenting fundamental research hinders biomedical innovation by focusing on proprietary claims rather than end products. The Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to patent discoveries made under federal funding, including basic innovations known as \"research tools.\" Ownership of research tools may lead to delayed innovation, litigation, and hinder research by others. Concerns about hindering scientific progress by restricting access to early discoveries have been raised. Harold Varmus and others express concerns about the negative impact of seeking early intellectual property protection on scientific progress and health benefits. While the Bayh-Dole Act has helped the biotechnology industry, changes may not always align with the best interests of science. Yale President Richard Levin emphasizes the importance of keeping some research in the public domain. Levin notes that the privatization of research tools is not due to the Bayh-Dole Act but to patent law. Changes to the act may not address the issue as current law allows for patenting of research tools. Efforts have been made to make these tools more widely available, balancing commercial and public interests. The NIH issued a policy paper in 1999 calling for the sharing of research tools among non-profit organizations with minimal terms. This approach is now a requirement in NIH grants and reflects changes to the Bayh-Dole Act. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office also made changes to guidelines for patenting biotechnology discoveries. There are more patents in biomedical research, but research has not been hindered by intellectual property issues. Scientists can work around patents through licensing, inventing, using public databases, and court challenges. Private sector owners allow infringement in academia to increase the value of their technology. The government has rights under the Bayh-Dole Act to protect the public interest. The government has a \"royalty free license\" to practice or have practiced any subject invention on its behalf worldwide. A GAO report clarified that this license does not allow the government to purchase discounted products that incorporate federally funded inventions not produced under the government's license. Rights in one patent do not automatically extend to related patents. Under the Bayh-Dole Act, government licenses for biomedical products are primarily used for research. Grantees must report annually on the utilization of inventions from federally funded R&D, including development status and royalties received. Tracking the government's interest in patents is a key issue. In response to the Bayh-Dole Act, federal contractors and grantees were found to be lacking in reporting requirements, hindering the identification of government-retained licenses. Agencies have since implemented monitoring systems to improve compliance, with NIH creating the iEdison reporting system to track inventions. The U.S. system of research, development, and commercialization has had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, with American pharmaceutical firms leading in new drug discoveries and maintaining a competitive edge in international markets. U.S. investment in health-related R&D exceeds all other countries, demonstrating a pattern of increased R&D investment. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors in the United States have shown significant growth in research and development spending, with the industry investing heavily in innovation. In 2010, the biopharmaceutical industry spent between $67.4 billion and $68.0 billion on R&D, with a substantial portion reinvested from domestic sales. The industry employs around 291,000 individuals in skilled jobs, and U.S. biotechnology companies generated $52.6 billion in product sales in 2010. U.S. biotechnology has rapidly advanced in the past 25 years, providing over 200 biotech drugs and vaccines for the global market. Some concerns exist regarding unintended consequences of current innovation policies. Legislative approach aims to promote private sector utilization of federally funded research, fostering collaboration between government, industry, and academia. Incentives for commercializing government-supported R&D have been established to balance public interest with accountability and compensation. The economic benefits of government-supported R&D are seen in new goods and services, job creation, productivity improvement, and higher standard of living. There is debate over the balance of benefits and costs, especially in health-related R&D. Critics argue that industry already benefits from government-supported R&D, patent protection, and other advantages, suggesting the public should receive a more direct financial return. The government should have a say in drug pricing decisions to ensure a direct financial return on federal investment, despite the innovation generated by public-private collaboration in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Changes may be on the horizon for government-industry-university cooperation."
