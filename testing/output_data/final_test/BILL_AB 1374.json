    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2903 of the Business and Professions Code states that individuals must have a license to practice psychology or represent themselves as psychologists. This includes offering psychological services involving principles like learning, perception, motivation, emotions, and interpersonal relationships, as well as methods like counseling, psychotherapy, and administering tests of mental abilities and personality characteristics. The amended Section 2913 of the Business and Professions Code expands the application of psychological principles and methods to include assessment, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and intervention for individuals, groups, and organizations. Psychotherapy is defined as using psychological methods in a professional relationship to enhance human effectiveness or modify maladaptive behaviors. Section 2913 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow non-licensed individuals to work under licensed psychologists, physicians, clinics, or corporations to perform limited psychological functions as \"psychological assistants.\" A \"psychological assistant\" must have a master's degree in psychology or education with a specialization in psychology, be a doctoral candidate in psychology or education with specialization in psychology, or have completed a qualifying doctoral degree from an accredited institution in the US or Canada. The psychological assistant must be supervised by a licensed psychologist or board certified psychiatrist, who is responsible for ensuring the quality of services provided. The supervisor must register the assistant with the board annually. No licensed psychologist or board certified psychiatrist may register, employ, or supervise more than a specified number of psychological assistants at any given time. Contract clinics and corporations also have limitations on the number of assistants they can employ. Psychological assistants can only provide services under the supervision of a licensed professional or organization. The psychological assistant must adhere to board regulations on continuing education and cannot practice if found in violation of specific sections. Applicants for licensure must meet certain requirements outlined in Section 2914 of the Business and Professions Code. To obtain licensure as a psychological assistant, individuals must possess a doctorate degree in psychology, educational psychology, or education with a specialization in counseling or educational psychology from an accredited institution. Educational institutions are not required to be accredited by professional organizations of psychologists for recognition. The final determination of degree requirements is made by the board. An applicant for licensure trained outside the US or Canada must show the board a doctorate degree in psychology equivalent to a US or Canadian degree. They need a comprehensive evaluation from a NACES member and any other required documentation. To qualify for licensure, individuals must have at least two years of supervised professional experience under a licensed psychologist, with specific requirements defined by the board. The supervisor must verify the experience, and failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. The board sets qualifications for supervising psychologists, including passing an exam and completing training in alcohol and substance abuse detection. Additionally, applicants must have completed coursework in spousal or partner abuse assessment, detection, and intervention during specific timeframes. An applicant starting graduate training after January 1, 2004, must complete 15 hours of coursework in spousal or partner abuse assessment, detection, and intervention strategies to meet board requirements. Exemptions can be requested for those not providing direct mental health services. An applicant with a doctoral degree in psychology from an approved institution is considered to have met the coursework requirements if the institution offered a psychology doctoral program approved before July 1, 1999. The required coursework can be fulfilled through other educational requirements or a separate course, with certification from the educational institution's chief academic officer. The Evidence Code is amended to define a \"psychotherapist\" as a person authorized to practice medicine, licensed psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker engaged in nonmedical psychotherapy. The Evidence Code defines a \"psychotherapist\" as a person authorized to practice medicine, licensed psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker engaged in nonmedical psychotherapy. Additionally, individuals serving as school psychologists, licensed marriage and family therapists, registered psychological assistants, marriage and family therapist interns, and associate clinical social workers under supervision are also included. In addition to licensed psychologists and clinical social workers, individuals such as registered psychologists, psychological interns, and trainees fulfilling supervised practicum requirements are also included in the definition of a \"psychotherapist.\" The definition of a \"psychotherapist\" includes licensed registered nurses with a master's degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing, advanced practice registered nurses certified as clinical nurse specialists in psychiatric-mental health nursing, individuals providing mental health treatment or counseling services, and licensed professional clinical counselors. A clinical counselor intern or trainee must be supervised by a licensed professional in the field, such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, marriage and family therapist, or physician certified in psychiatry. No reimbursement required by this act as it creates, eliminates, or changes penalties for crimes or infractions, per California Constitution."
