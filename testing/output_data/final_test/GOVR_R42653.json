    "content": "Congress addresses various water issues annually, including responding to natural disasters like droughts and floods, improving water infrastructure, and protecting aquatic resources. Multiple congressional committees are involved in legislating, funding, and overseeing federal water-related activities, leading to challenges in coordination and consistency among programs. This results in a complex web of federal water activities with overlap and gaps, as well as discrepancies between authorized actions and actual implementation by federal agencies. No single committee in Congress oversees this disparity. The report focuses on congressional involvement in establishing, overseeing, and funding federal water-related activities, providing insight into the complexity of federal water activities and serving as a guide for administering agencies and committee jurisdictions. The authors have analyzed major federal activities authorized by Congress that impact water resource development, management, protection, and use in the United States. The report does not cover all aspects of House and Senate committee jurisdiction related to water issues. For a definitive evaluation of committee jurisdictions, the views of the House and Senate Parliamentarian Offices are official. Additionally, the report may note programs that have expired and are pending reauthorization legislation. Due to the extensive scope of the report and ongoing executive and legislative branch activities, comprehensive status reports for all programs are not feasible. The federal government has a long history of involvement in water resources development, including projects like dams and navigation locks. Congress has enacted legislation to regulate water quality, protect wildlife, manage floodplains, and support water supply augmentation. Congress plays an active role in overseeing these activities. The federal government has a history of involvement in water resources development, including dams and navigation locks. Congress enacts legislation to regulate water quality, protect wildlife, manage floodplains, and support water supply augmentation. Congress oversees implementation of laws and appropriates funding for water resources activities, involving multiple committees and agencies at both the congressional and executive branch levels. The federal government is involved in various water-related activities and programs, overseen by multiple congressional committees and federal agencies. The activities are categorized into four areas: Water Resources Development, Management, and Use; Water Quality, Protection, and Restoration; Water Rights and Allocation; and Research and Planning. Each area is described with relevant agencies, programs, and congressional committees. The curr_chunk provides detailed tables of relevant agencies, activities, and programs related to federal water issues, organized under themes such as \"Water Resources Development, Management, and Use\" and \"Water Quality, Protection, and Restoration.\" These tables cover subtopics like supply development, drought management, water quality protection, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The topic terms were determined by CRS analysts and legislative attorneys involved in the report's development. The curr_chunk discusses themes related to water rights, allocation, research, and planning, with a focus on protection and management of aquatic ecosystems. It excludes marine issues and international water concerns, except for U.S.-Mexican border dams and EPA programs. Congress has also established economic development programs that include water projects eligible for federal assistance. This report focuses on federal assistance for water-related projects, excluding broad environmental remediation statutes. It also addresses water activities affecting Indian tribes in relation to federal agency programs. Federal environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act are not covered in this report. Appendix A discusses House and Senate committee jurisdictions, highlighting the complexity of water topics. Appendices B and C outline congressional jurisdiction over water resources based on House Rule X and Senate Rule XXV. The tables in the report define water terms determined by CRS, emphasizing the intricacy of federal programs impacting water resource development, management, protection, and use in the United States. Additionally, Appendix D provides a glossary of abbreviations for federal agencies and committees. The federal government has historically played a significant role in developing the nation's water resources through infrastructure projects for navigation, flood control, and irrigation. Various House and Senate committees have jurisdiction over federal water policy, with the largest federal dams serving multiple purposes such as hydropower and water supply. The appropriations committees in both chambers also play a crucial role in water resource management. The federal government has historically been involved in water resource development for navigation, flood control, and irrigation. Congress has authorized programs for water conservation, groundwater recharge, and water reclamation. Tables list activities related to water supply, reservoir development, drought, and flood management. The federal government is involved in various water resource development activities, including hydropower, navigation, flood control, and irrigation. Efforts to protect and improve water quality range from technical and financial assistance programs to regulatory programs for preventing water pollution. Congress has also enacted bills to manage, protect, and restore aquatic ecosystems. The United States has enacted numerous bills over the last 30 years to manage, protect, and restore aquatic ecosystems like the Chesapeake Bay, California Bay-Delta, Everglades, and Great Lakes. Ecosystem restoration now includes objectives such as improving water supply, navigation, natural resource management, and watershed plans. Legislation can be complex, involving multiple agencies and committees, especially in areas like fisheries management and aquaculture oversight. Congress addresses interstate issues like river pollution and gaps in ecosystem protection. Federal activities related to water quality and regional aquatic resource protection have been enacted in response to interstate issues, gaps in protection, funding needs related to federal mandates, and other national interests. This includes efforts in surface water quality, drinking water quality, groundwater quality, source water protection, nonpoint source pollution, and wastewater infrastructure. Additionally, activities related to aquaculture, aquatic ecosystem protection, coastal zones, fisheries, invasive species, wetlands, and wild and scenic rivers are also being addressed. The federal government has significant authority over water resources management and rights, including regulating interstate waterways and promoting navigation. Congress can allocate interstate waters directly or defer to states to reach agreements through interstate compacts. River basin commissions, with representatives from basin states and federal agencies, have been established for water resource management. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized federal reserved water rights in 1908, stating that when Congress creates an Indian reservation, it also reserves the necessary water. These tribal water rights are often senior to other users' rights but are not quantified, leading to litigation or settlement agreements. The Court extended reserved rights to reservations for federal purposes like national forests, wildlife refuges, and national parks, implicating federal authority over water. Proposals to add to water systems involve federal authority related to water resources. Federal laws indirectly impact water allocation and use, favoring certain purposes over others. This can lead to unintended consequences like over allocation of water supplies. Laws addressing water quality and endangered species can also affect water allocation. Activities related to water allocation and water rights are listed in tables. The evolution of federal water research and planning authorities is reflected in the development of water-related agencies and authorities. Initially focused on navigation, flood control, and irrigation, research expanded in the 1960s to include pollution reduction. Coordination efforts in water research and planning also emerged during this time. In the 1980s and 1990s, federal water planning and research shifted to a more limited role, focusing on supporting federal projects and regulatory activities. This change led to a decrease in federal research promoting economic growth through water development. Recent decades have seen federal research primarily supporting regulatory activities like water quality research and monitoring, with a decrease in research for economic growth. New technologies and data have also influenced federal water research, including water-related satellite and radar data and concerns about climate trends. Recent decades have seen a shift in federal water planning and research towards supporting regulatory activities like water quality research and monitoring, with a decrease in research for economic growth. New technologies and data, such as water-related satellite and radar data, have influenced federal water research. This has prompted the involvement of new agencies and programs in federal water research, expanding authorities and topics covered. Tables 8 and 9 list federal authorities related to water research, planning, and development projects. Committee jurisdiction is determined by House Rule X and Senate Rule XXV, which designate subject matter for standing committees. Rules are supplemented by precedents and agreements for legislation referral. Once a measure is referred to a committee, it remains their responsibility. Amendments to enacted laws are presumed to be within the originating committee's responsibility. The jurisdiction of committees in Congress is determined by rules and precedents. Amendments to laws are assumed to fall under the responsibility of the committee that originated the law. Factors such as sponsor expertise and timing of bills also play a role in determining committee jurisdiction. Subcommittees are not officially authorized by rules but are created by full committees. Determining official subcommittee jurisdictions is imprecise, with some information included in Appendices B and C but not uniformly provided. House Referral rules have evolved over time, allowing the Speaker to refer measures to multiple committees in different ways. In 2003, rules changes further impacted committee referrals. In 2003, rules changes in the 108th Congress allowed the Speaker to refer measures to multiple committees without designating a primary committee under \"exceptional circumstances.\" Senate measures are referred to committees based on official jurisdictions in Senate Rule XXV and past precedents. Formal agreements among committees and ad hoc agreements may also influence referrals. The Senate parliamentarian advises on bill referrals, although the presiding officer is formally responsible. Under Senate Rule XVII, measures are referred to committees based on the subject matter that predominates in the legislation. Exceptions exist, such as revenue provisions being referred to the Committee on Finance. Jurisdictional issues arise when multiple committees claim authority over a topic, like water issues. House Rule X identifies committees for bills authorizing federal dam construction. House Rule X assigns committees for bills authorizing federal dam construction. The Natural Resources Committee oversees irrigation, reclamation, and Bureau of Reclamation activities. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee handles flood control, rivers, harbors, and Army Corps of Engineers activities. The Agriculture Committee manages water conservation related to activities. The Committee on Agriculture, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Environment and Public Works Committee, and Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee have jurisdiction over various aspects related to federal dam construction, hydroelectric power, irrigation, reclamation projects, flood control, and soil conservation. Multiple committees in each chamber are involved in the oversight of dams. Private dams must be licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, under the jurisdiction of the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committees. Various executive branch departments and agencies implement laws under these committees, complicating management of river systems with federal dams. This includes large watershed areas like the Columbia and Colorado River Basins, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers' delta, and smaller systems with anadromous fisheries.
