    "content": "The \"Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act\" allows for a credit for income differential for the employment of activated military reservists and replacement personnel under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act provides a tax credit for small business employers and self-employed individuals who employ qualified employees and replacement employees. The credit is equal to 40 percent of the qualified employee's average daily qualified compensation. The tax credit is based on the average daily qualified compensation of the qualified employee during reserve duty, excluding normal employment duties, or $15,000. The employment credit is calculated based on the sum of credits for each qualified employee. For a qualified employee, average daily qualified compensation is determined by dividing their compensation by the difference between 365 and the number of days they participate in qualified reserve duty. The term 'average daily military pay and allowances' refers to the amount paid to a qualified employee for participating in qualified reserve component duty, divided by the total number of days they participate in such duty. Qualified compensation for qualified reserve component duty includes compensation normally contingent on presence for work and deductible from gross income under section 162(a)(1). Qualified compensation for qualified reserve component duty includes compensation that is not characterized as vacation, holiday pay, sick leave, or any other form of nonspecific leave, and does not result in a reduction of previously credited leave. It also includes group health plan costs for the qualified employee. A qualified employee is defined as a person who meets certain criteria. The definition of an employee for the purpose of the employment credit includes being an employee of the taxpayer for the 91-day period before participating in qualified reserve component duty and being a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. The employment credit for a qualified replacement employee is 40 percent of their qualified compensation. The employment credit for a qualified replacement employee is based on their qualified compensation, which is the lesser of their qualified compensation or $15,000. Qualified compensation refers to contingent compensation for work presence. The total employment credit for all qualified replacement employees is the sum of individual credits. The employment credit for a qualified replacement employee is based on their qualified compensation, which includes contingent compensation for work presence, deductible from the taxpayer's gross income under section 162(a)(1). A qualified replacement employee is an individual hired to replace a qualified employee or self-employed taxpayer. The self-employment credit is available to qualified self-employed taxpayers during qualified reserve component duty, with a credit equal to 40 percent of the difference between their self-employment income and military pay. During qualified reserve component duty, self-employed taxpayers can receive a credit equal to 40% of the difference between their self-employment income and military pay, up to $15,000 or the exclusion of normal self-employment duties for the days spent on duty. Average daily self-employment income includes self-employment income and insurance payments. The taxpayer can receive a credit for insurance payments for medical care during the year, divided by the difference between 365 days and the days spent on qualified reserve component duty. Average daily military pay and allowances are calculated based on the military pay received during the year for participating in qualified reserve component duty. The term 'qualified self-employed taxpayer' refers to a taxpayer with net earnings from self-employment who is a member of the Ready Reserve of a reserve component of the US Armed Forces. This credit is in addition to any deductions for compensation paid to qualified employees or replacement employees. The credit allowed under this section applies to compensation paid to qualified employees, replacement employees, or self-employed taxpayers during qualified reserve component duty. The credit is subject to limitations and coordination with other credits. The disallowance of the tax credit for failure to comply with employment or reemployment rights of reserve component members of the armed forces includes no credit for a taxpayer under final orders from a district court for violations of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code for the current and two succeeding taxable years. No tax credit allowed for individuals on active duty for training under specific provisions of the United States Code, including National Guard duty. Definitions and special rules apply, such as for small business employers. The term 'small business employer' refers to an employer with an average of 50 or fewer employees during a taxable year. Controlled groups are treated as a single employer. Military pay and allowances are defined, and qualified reserve component duty is explained. The term 'qualified reserve component duty' includes active duty in support of a contingency operation. Special rules apply to qualified manufacturers, with increased thresholds for certain provisions. The term 'qualified manufacturer' refers to a person whose primary business is in sectors 31, 32, or 33 of the NAICS, with all production facilities located in the US. The credit can be carried back or forward if it exceeds the limitation for the taxable year. The tax code allows excess credits to be carried back three years and forward 20 years. Rules similar to section 39 apply. Conforming and clerical amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. The tax code allows excess credits to be carried back three years and forward 20 years, with amendments made to part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by adding a new item 30A. The tax code allows excess credits to be carried back three years and forward 20 years. Section 30B provides an employer wage credit for activated military reservists, effective after September 11, 2001. Refunds or credits resulting from this section can be claimed within one year of the enactment of the Act, even if prevented by any law or rule of law."
