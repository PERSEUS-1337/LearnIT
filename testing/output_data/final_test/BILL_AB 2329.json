    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Computer science education is essential for developing pupils' computational and critical thinking skills, enabling them to innovate and create technological tools for the 21st century. Computer science education is crucial for California's economy and cybersecurity. There are over 600,000 technology jobs open in the US, with 51% of STEM jobs projected to be in computer science by 2018. California has 86,436 open computing jobs, but only had 3,525 computer science graduates in 2014, with only 15% being female. In California, there is a lack of diversity in AP computer science exams, with low participation from females, Latinos, and African Americans. Only 16% of schools in California offered the AP computer science course in the 2013-14 school year. President Obama's Computer Science for All initiative aims to increase access to computer science education in elementary and secondary classrooms. The upcoming budget proposes funding for the Department of Education over three years, with states required to submit comprehensive five-year plans to be eligible for federal funding. Competitive grants will also be available for leading districts to expand computer science education efforts for all students, including underrepresented groups. Access to computer science education remains a challenge, especially for underrepresented communities. Only 25% of K-12 schools offer computer science courses, leaving 75% of students without the opportunity to develop crucial skills. Early exposure to computer science can help address diversity gaps in the field, with significant increases in interest among girls, African American, and Latino students who take AP computer science in high school. A Google-Gallup survey shows strong support from parents and teachers for making computer science a required subject for 21st-century students. California aims to establish distinct standards for computer science education in K-12 schools, focusing on both software creation and usage. The Legislature intends to provide all students with access to computer science education, particularly targeting underrepresented groups. The goal is to increase access to computer science in California schools and consider diverse perspectives in recommendations. This initiative is outlined in the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan added to the Education Code. The Superintendent will convene a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel to develop recommendations for a plan. The panel will consist of members with expertise in computer science, including representatives from various entities. Six K-12 teacher representatives will be designated by the Superintendent. The Superintendent will convene a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel with members including K-12 teacher representatives, a representative from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, a credentialed teacher from the Computer Science Teachers Association, a private sector technology industry representative, faculty members from various educational institutions. The Superintendent will convene an advisory panel for computer science implementation, including representatives from various organizations and educational institutions. Additionally, administrators from higher education institutions may serve as advisers for input on the strategic plan. The computer science strategic implementation advisory panel will submit recommendations for a strategic plan to broaden the pool of computer science teachers and define education principles for K-12 students by July 1, 2018. Recommendations include training, certification pathways, and scholarship programs for teachers in underserved districts. The computer science strategic implementation advisory panel will submit recommendations to ensure all high schools teach at least one computer science course, provide access to computer science in college and career pathways, ensure broadband connectivity, remove local barriers, and increase participation of underrepresented pupils. Recommendations will be submitted to the Legislature. The computer science strategic implementation advisory panel will cease to exist upon completion of recommendations. The Superintendent will appoint a statewide computer science liaison to coordinate panel efforts, solicit input, prepare legislative reports, and ensure implementation of recommendations adopted by the state board. The statewide computer science liaison will ensure the implementation of advisory panel recommendations adopted by the state board for a limited time after the adoption of academic content standards and curriculum framework. The department and state board will consider recommendations from the computer science strategic implementation advisory panel. They must develop and adopt a computer science strategic implementation plan by January 1, 2019, submitting it to the Legislature. If funds are insufficient, the panel can explore grants and donations for support in implementing the plan. The chapter will be inoperative on July 31, 2020, and repealed on January 1, 2021, unless a later statute extends these dates."
