These entities have various administrative, planning, and reporting responsibilities, but their ultimate influence on the legislation's implementation remains uncertain. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) creates new entities, including offices, boards, commissions, and advisory bodies, to implement the legislation. CRS searched the legislation to identify these entities using specific terms. The searches revealed numerous new entities created by PPACA, but it is unclear if all organizations were identified. The Appendix provides a table listing the identified PPACA offices and advisory bodies. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) created various activities and work products, such as demonstration projects, grants, trust funds, programs, systems, guidelines, and protocols. The legislation established governmental units and advisory bodies to implement PPACA, including those required to be established by the President, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or other organizations. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) created various activities and work products, including governmental units and advisory bodies to implement the legislation. The report lists these entities, their composition, leadership, purpose, and duties. It aims to compare and make general observations about these organizations. The exact number of new organizations and advisory bodies created under PPACA is uncertain. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) created new entities and advisory bodies to implement the legislation. The exact number of organizations that will be established is uncertain, with some sections expected to create multiple entities. For example, Section 10334(b) of PPACA requires six separate agencies within HHS to establish their own offices of minority health. Section 1002 of PPACA establishes an independent office of health insurance consumer assistance, or an ombudsman, that state governments must designate to receive a grant. Section 1323(d) requires state governments to establish or designate state advisory councils, with the number depending on states opting out. Section 5208(b) mandates nurse-managed health clinics to have a community advisory committee. The Patient-Centered Research Institute may appoint expert advisory panels as needed, but the exact number is unclear. One entity could fulfill multiple requirements under the PPACA, such as establishing advisory bodies for early childhood home visitation programs. The PPACA requires the establishment of two advisory bodies: one for improvement plans and another for statewide needs assessments and grants. Existing entities may fulfill some requirements, while new entities were created by eliminating existing ones. The PPACA establishes new entities by eliminating existing ones and transferring functions. For example, it creates an Office on Women's Health and a National Center for Health Workforce Analysis within HHS. Other entities may be established in the future to implement the legislation. The PPACA established new entities within HHS, including an Office on Women's Health and a National Center for Health Workforce Analysis. In the future, HHS established an Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight to implement provisions addressing private health insurance, overseeing new rules, assisting states with insurance rates, and administering programs. The PPACA created new entities and advisory bodies within HHS, such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. It also requires the President to establish the National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council and an advisory group within HHS. The PPACA established new entities and advisory bodies within HHS, including the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation and the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. Section 3509(a) requires the establishment of the Office of Women's Health within HHS. However, many of these entities cannot function until members are appointed and funds are allocated. The experience of the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) serves as an example, as Congress created ACUS in 1964 but did not provide funding for the agency. Congress created ACUS in 1964 but did not provide funding until 1968. It was eliminated in 1995 but reauthorized in 2008 with appropriations for FY2009-FY2011. However, funding was not provided until March 2009, delaying operations until 2010 when Professor Paul Verkuil was confirmed as chairman. The PPACA provisions vary in specificity for creating new entities, with some sections detailing establishment, location, structure, and funding, while others are silent on these aspects. This may impact congressional control and agency discretion in implementation. For example, Section 5605 of PPACA mandates eight appointments. The PPACA mandates the creation of various new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. For example, appointments to the Commission on Key National Indicators must be made within 30 days of enactment, and the Personal Care Attendants Workforce Advisory Panel must be created within 90 days. The Comptroller General must appoint members to the CO-OP program advisory board within three months, and the National Health Care Workforce Commission members by September 30, 2010. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must carry out its duties by January 1. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation must carry out its duties by January 1, 2011. Other sections of the legislation require the establishment of various committees and councils by specific dates to meet deadlines for reports or work products. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. For example, the council must issue its first report by July 10, 2010, and the working group must issue its first report by December 31, 2010. An advisory panel is required to review and make recommendations on statewide needs assessments and grants by March 23, 2011. Eligible entities must develop reports and improvement plans within specified timeframes. PPACA mandates the creation of new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. However, in some cases, the law does not specify deadlines for creating organizations or making appointments, giving individuals discretion. For example, appointments to the Consumer Advisory Council and the Cures Acceleration Network Review Board are not specified in terms of timing. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. However, in some cases, deadlines for creating organizations or making appointments are not specified, giving individuals discretion. For example, the board is to meet four times per year, but it is unclear when it must be established or begin advising the Director of the NIH on the CAN program. The Secretary of HHS is required to establish a National Women's Health Information Center, but the timeline for establishment and operations is not specified. The director of AHRQ is to convene a Preventive Services Task Force, which is to provide yearly reports to congress and agencies identifying research gaps, but the timeline for convening the task force and delivering the first report is not indicated. The consequences of not meeting creation dates specified in the PPACA are unclear. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. However, as of June 25, 2010, some organizations and advisory bodies required by the legislation had not been created, despite specified deadlines. For example, the Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska Task Force and the advisory committee on young women's breast health were not appointed within the designated time frames. The PPACA outlines where these new governmental organizations and advisory bodies are to be located. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities with specific timelines for appointments and establishment. Some organizations and advisory bodies required by the legislation had not been created as of June 25, 2010. The legislation outlines where these new governmental organizations and advisory bodies are to be located within the Department of Health and Human Services and other relevant offices. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities within the Department of Health and Human Services. Section 4003(a) requires the director of AHRQ to convene a Preventative Services Task Force, which is to be independent and not subject to political pressure. AHRQ is to provide ongoing support to the task force. The legislation does not specify where newly created entities are to be located, allowing appointing authorities to make those determinations. For example, Section 5605(b) creates a Commission on Key National Indicators with eight members appointed by Senate and House leaders. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities within the Department of Health and Human Services, including a National Health Care Workforce Commission. The commission is to oversee a new national indicators system enabled by the National Academy of Sciences, make recommendations on system improvements, and develop annual reports to Congress and NAS. However, the location and organizational structure of the commission are not specified in the legislation. Members are to be appointed by the Comptroller General and may be paid at a per diem rate. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities within the Department of Health and Human Services, including a National Health Care Workforce Commission. The commission oversees a national indicators system, makes recommendations on system improvements, and submits requests for appropriations. Section 6703(a) establishes an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation, with members appointed by the Secretary of HHS. Some new PPACA entities are offices within federal departments or agencies, staffed solely by federal employees. The PPACA mandates the creation of new entities within the Department of Health and Human Services, including offices staffed solely by federal employees. For example, Section 3509(a) establishes an Office on Women's Health within the Office of the Secretary of HHS, and Section 10334(b) requires the heads of six agencies within HHS to establish offices of minority health. Other entities like the Elder Justice Coordinating Council are also composed of federal employees drawn from multiple agencies.

Section 4001(a) requires the establishment of a National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council composed of various department heads. Section 3012(a) mandates the convening of an Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality with representatives from multiple agencies. Section 3509(a) establishes an Office on Women's Health within the Office of the Secretary of HHS. Section 3509(a) states that the HHS Coordinating Committee on Women's Health is composed of senior-level representatives from each agency and office within HHS. Other PPACA organizations consist of non-federal staff or a mix of federal and non-federal staff, such as the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health and the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee. Additionally, the Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation is composed of 27 members appointed by the Secretary of HHS from the general public. The Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation consists of 27 members appointed by the Secretary of HHS from the general public with expertise in prevention, detection, treatment, intervention, or prosecution. State governments are required to establish state advisory councils with representatives from the public, including health care consumers and providers. Members of the Cures Acceleration Network Review Board may receive a salary, but federal officers or employees serve without additional compensation. Section 3403(a) of the PPACA establishes an Independent Medicare Advisory Board with 15 voting members appointed by the President. The board members are required to include national experts in health finance, economics, actuarial science, and health services. The board could consist of federal employees, non-federal employees, or a mixture of both. Once confirmed by the Senate, non-federal nominees become federal employees. Additionally, a consumer advisory council appointed by the Comptroller General represents consumer interests and particular communities. The Commission on Key National Indicators members represent consumer interests and communities, excluding elected officials. New entities created by PPACA, like the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, serve specific purposes such as testing innovative payment methods. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council, Consumer Advisory Council, and Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee were established by different sections of PPACA to address specific issues related to elder abuse, consumer representation, and pain care research. PPACA does not always specify responsibilities for entities created by the legislation, such as the Coordinating Committee on Women's Health and nurse-managed health clinics' community advisory committees. Offices of minority health within HHS also lack specified duties under PPACA. Some provisions in PPACA specify how members and leaders of newly created entities are appointed, such as the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. The President appoints the 15 voting members with Senate consent, serving staggered six-year terms. The chairperson is chosen from the members by the President with Senate consent, and a vice chairperson is elected annually. Members can only be removed by the President for neglect of duty or malfeasance. The Comptroller General appoints the 10 members of another entity. Section 3403(a) states that the Comptroller General appoints 10 members to the \"consumer advisory council\" of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. The council represents consumer interests and communities, with elected officers. Section 6703(a) outlines the composition of the Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation, with 27 members appointed by the Secretary of HHS. PPACA specifies the leadership or composition of new entities, but not both in some cases. Section 10413(b) of the PPACA outlines the composition of an advisory committee for a public education campaign on young women's breast health, including experts in breast cancer. However, the legislation does not specify the size or leadership of the committee. Similarly, other sections of the PPACA do not specify how members or leaders of new organizations and advisory bodies are to be selected, such as in the case of establishing an advisory panel for technical assistance in early childhood home visitation programs. Section 3021 establishes a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models. Section 3509(a) requires the establishment of a National Women's Health Information Center. Section 4003(b) requires the CDCP director to convene a Community Preventive Services Task Force. The legislation does not specify the composition or leadership of these centers and task force. The PPACA establishes a Community Preventive Services Task Force to review scientific evidence on community preventive interventions. It also includes budgetary provisions for new entities created by the legislation, providing direct funding and imposing requirements. The PPACA establishes a 15-member advisory board and appropriates $6 billion for qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to offer plans in individual and small group markets. Section 2951 allocates funds for maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting programs, with $100 million for FY2010 increasing to $400 million for FY2014. Section 3021 establishes a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS with specified appropriations for various fiscal years. It also allows for funds not expended by eligible entities to be used for grants to nonprofit organizations. Section 3403 of the legislation appropriates $15 million for the Independent Medicare Advisory Board, with funding increasing in subsequent years based on the Consumer Price Index. 60% of the appropriations come from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and 40% from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The chairman cannot request appropriations without board approval. Other provisions in the PPACA authorize appropriations for new entities, but funding must be determined through the annual appropriations process. The PPACA authorizes appropriations for new entities, but funding must be determined through the annual appropriations process. Most provisions are general, authorizing \"such sums as may be necessary\" within specific years. Congress may choose not to appropriate funds for certain entities, leading to uncertainty about their operation. The PPACA authorizes appropriations for new entities, but funding must be determined through the annual appropriations process. Congress may place additional conditions on appropriations, including requirements to meet certain conditions to use funds. Various general management laws regulate activities of executive branch agencies, such as the Federal Advisory Committee Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. PPACA specifies whether these laws apply to new entities and advisory bodies. Several advisory bodies created under the PPACA are exempt from certain sections of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). For example, the board advising the Secretary of HHS on loans and grants under the CO-OP program is exempt from Section 14 of FACA. The National Health Care Workforce Commission is composed without regard to Section 5 of FACA. The CLASS Independence Advisory Council and Preventative Services Task Force are also not subject to FACA. The PPACA exempts certain advisory bodies from the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation is exempt from the PRA for testing and evaluating models. Additionally, the Independent Medicare Advisory Board and National Health Care Workforce Commission have exemptions from federal civil service laws for appointing personnel. The National Health Care Workforce Commission can hire an executive director and other personnel without following certain civil service laws. The CLASS Independence Advisory Council members are appointed by the President without regard to civil service laws. The coverage of general management laws for organizations and advisory bodies created by PPACA may vary depending on their location. Entities in the Executive Office of the President are less likely to be covered compared to those in cabinet departments or independent agencies. Legislative branch entities are unlikely to be covered by laws directed at the executive branch. Some organizations created by PPACA have limited lifespans and terminate after fulfilling their missions. For example, the Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska Task Force assesses healthcare access in Alaska and terminates upon submitting a report. Advisory boards making recommendations under CO-OP also terminate after completing their duties. Some entities created by PPACA have specific termination dates based on completion of their duties or specified deadlines. For instance, the Independent Medicare Advisory Board and consumer advisory council will terminate if a joint resolution is enacted by August 17, 2017. The Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee's need is reviewed every two years. Most new organizations in PPACA have indefinite durations. Most organizations created by PPACA have indefinite durations, with detailed provisions on vacancies, member qualifications, compensation, and other administrative aspects. For example, the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan program advisory board must fill vacancies in the same manner as the original appointment, while the Independent Medicare Advisory Board requires national experts in health finance and economics. The National Health Care Workforce Commission, Elder Justice Coordinating Council, and Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) Board have specific provisions for member qualifications, compensation, and federal employee details without reimbursement. Members are paid at different daily rates based on their roles. PPACA allows for travel expenses at authorized rates for federal employees serving at the pleasure of the Secretary. However, details regarding payment and federal employee details for advisory bodies are unclear. GAO is required to study various issues, and the Comptroller General must make appointments to new entities and advisory bodies as mandated by the legislation. Section 1322(b) specifically requires the appointment of 15 members to an advisory board for the CO-OP program. The PPACA mandates the Comptroller General to appoint members to various advisory bodies, including a consumer advisory council, the National Health Care Workforce Commission, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and a panel to review demonstration grant applications. PPACA increased the Comptroller General's appointment responsibilities significantly, from 45 positions to at least 128 positions. Some entities, like the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, are directed to improve evidence on health conditions through research and dissemination of findings. The National Health Care Workforce Commission is directed to coordinate with multiple government departments on related activities. The National Health Care Workforce Commission, established by PPACA, is tasked with evaluating education and training activities to ensure healthcare workforce demands are met, identifying barriers to coordination, and promoting innovations to address population needs and technological advancements. Concerns have been raised about the independence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in auditing these entities due to the Comptroller General appointing their members. The PPACA will lead to the creation of numerous governmental organizations and advisory bodies with varying roles in its implementation. Some organizations represent constituencies, gather information, or coordinate agencies, while others have decision-making authority, like the Independent Medicare Advisory Board. Concerns have been raised about the power given to this board in reducing Medicare spending. Some observers have concerns about the power given to the board overseeing the entities established by PPACA. Congressional oversight will vary depending on statutory provisions, focusing on whether requirements are met or if new offices are duplicative and contributing to the legislation's goals. Oversight of the implementation of PPACA can provide Congress with information to decide on future changes to the legislation."
