    "content": "The curr_chunk discusses the rollover of amounts received in airline carrier bankruptcy to eligible retirement plans. The curr_chunk explains that if a qualified airline employee receives an eligible rollover amount and transfers it to an individual retirement plan within 180 days, the transferred amount will not be included in gross income for that taxable year. If the transfer is made to a Roth IRA, 50 percent of the rollover amount will be included in income. If a qualified airline employee transfers an eligible rollover amount to an individual retirement plan within 180 days, the rollover amount will be included in gross income in the following taxable years. The employee can elect to include the transferred amount in the year of payment. Income limitations do not apply to this transfer. For eligible rollover amounts transferred by qualified airline employees, the amount will not be treated as wages for tax purposes in the year of payment. The transfer is considered a rollover contribution under the Internal Revenue Code. The transfer of eligible rollover amounts by qualified airline employees is treated as a qualified rollover contribution under the Internal Revenue Code, specifically section 408A(e). Qualified airline employees can transfer eligible rollover amounts related to bankruptcy claims against the carrier, excluding future earnings or profits. These employees are defined as participants in a defined benefit plan maintained by a commercial passenger airline carrier. Qualified airline employees can transfer eligible rollover amounts from a defined benefit plan maintained by a commercial passenger airline carrier. If the plan is terminated or subject to certain restrictions, the carrier must report the payments to the Treasury Secretary and the employees within 90 days. The section requires commercial passenger airline carriers to report payments made to qualified airline employees transferring eligible rollover amounts from a defined benefit plan. The reports must be submitted to the Treasury Secretary and employees, detailing the years and amounts of the payments. This requirement applies to transfers made after the enactment of the Act for rollover amounts paid before, on, or after that date."
