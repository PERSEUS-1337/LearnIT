    "content": "The Peace Corps, founded in 1961, sends American volunteers to serve in villages and towns worldwide to promote world peace, improve lives, and share American culture. Over 230,000 volunteers have served in 141 countries. Jody Olsen is the current Director. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $396.2 million for the Peace Corps, a 3% cut from FY2018. Congress may consider funding and authorization legislation for the Peace Corps in 2018. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $396.2 million for the Peace Corps, a 3% cut from FY2018 levels. Congress has yet to enact a full FY2019 budget for the Peace Corps, currently funded at FY2018 levels through a continuing resolution. Both House and Senate committee-approved bills for FY2019 would maintain or increase Peace Corps funding. The FY2018 State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs appropriations provided $410 million for the Peace Corps, matching the Administration request. Despite efforts, Congress has not enacted a new Peace Corps funding authorization since 1999. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 maintained funding at the same level as FY2017. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 aimed to address volunteer health and safety issues. The Senate approved S. 2286, which mandated the implementation of inspector general recommendations and called for a review of health care performance and delivery for Peace Corps volunteers. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018, signed into law on October 9, 2018, aimed to increase compensation benefits for disabled volunteers, inform applicants of risks, and mandate a report on volunteer access to health care benefits. The Act also included provisions for exceptions to the five-year rule, consultation with Congress on country programs, independent inspector general review of volunteer deaths, and disclosure of crimes and risks to applicants. During the Obama Administration, Peace Corps directors implemented reforms based on a comprehensive assessment of agency operations. These reforms included establishing clear criteria for selecting host countries, introducing new monitoring and evaluation policies, improving volunteer medical care, and reorganizing staff positions for increased effectiveness. The Peace Corps implemented reforms to increase effectiveness, including reorganizing country desk positions, changing performance appraisals, and extending tour lengths. Despite calls for a more specialized volunteer force, the agency decided to maintain its composition of generalists due to demographic realities and limited availability of older specialists. The assessment team recommended that Peace Corps focus on what volunteers do best, what communities want, and what volunteers can be trained to do. They suggested a Focus in/Train up strategy to improve the quality of volunteers and their impact. Peace Corps reduced the number of technical programs and increased preservice training. Volunteer composition includes specialists to meet the needs of countries requiring expertise. The Peace Corps Response Program was recommended by the assessment team to attract highly skilled volunteers for countries requiring expertise. The program doubled in size, allowing qualified individuals without previous Peace Corps experience to participate with flexible time commitments. A Global Health Services Partnership was established to recruit medical professionals as adjunct faculty in developing countries. In July 2013, volunteers were sent to Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda as part of recruitment efforts to attract the best candidates. The Peace Corps improved its recruitment process with a new online application platform and medical review system. A simpler application form introduced in 2014 increased the number of applications. The agency also focused on promoting a better understanding of other cultures among Americans, known as the \"third goal.\" The Peace Corps' \"third goal\" focuses on promoting understanding of other cultures among Americans. Activities include volunteers sharing their experiences through blogs, public talks, community service, and fundraising. The agency's Paul D. Coverdell World Wise Schools program connects volunteers with classrooms in the US. Funding for this goal is limited, but the agency has established an Office of Third Goal and Returned Volunteer Services to encourage greater participation. Hundreds of returned volunteers speak at schools annually. The Peace Corps promotes understanding of other cultures among Americans through the \"third goal\" activities, which include volunteers speaking at schools in their communities. The number of schools participating in these activities increased by nearly 200% between FY2009 and FY2013. The agency has also built partnerships with international organizations, U.S. government agencies, and corporations like Mondelez to support agriculture and community development. Additionally, the Peace Corps plays a significant role in implementing Obama presidential foreign assistance initiatives at the village level, including the Feed the Future food security initiative and the Let Girls Learn initiative. The Peace Corps established the Let Girls Learn Fund to support volunteer activities in expanding access to education for girls internationally. The agency's Strategic Plan for FY2018 to FY2022 includes six objectives to further legislative goals, with performance goals and measures of progress. Sustainable change in communities is measured by project gains and annual impact studies. The Peace Corps' Strategic Plan for FY2018 to FY2022 includes objectives to enhance volunteer effectiveness, optimize volunteer resilience, build leaders for tomorrow, improve agency services, and proactively address risks through evidence-based decision-making. Congress made it the policy of the United States in 1985 to maintain a consistent approach to programmatic and fiscal considerations. The United States aims to maintain a Peace Corps volunteer level of at least 10,000 individuals, a goal reiterated by multiple Presidents since 1985. Despite support for the agency, Congress has not provided necessary funding for this objective. President Bush's 2002 initiative to double the size of the Peace Corps saw only a 16% increase in volunteer numbers by 2009. The Obama Administration proposed a more modest goal of a 9,400-volunteer force by 2012 and 11,000 by 2016. The Peace Corps saw a peak in volunteer numbers at 8,655 in FY2010, but experienced a decline to 6,818 by FY2014. The FY2016 budget increase led to 7,213 volunteers. The FY2018 to FY2022 plan does not specify a volunteer level goal. Congress has been concerned about Peace Corps management and volunteer force makeup. The Peace Corps faced concerns from Congress regarding management practices and volunteer force makeup, especially in the context of expansion efforts. Congress requested reviews of management practices to accommodate larger numbers of volunteers and ensure preparedness for potential issues. The Peace Corps underwent a comprehensive assessment between 2010 and 2014 to address concerns raised by Congress about management practices and volunteer force makeup. In FY2017, 63% of volunteers were women, 29% were minorities, and volunteers over 50 years old made up 6% of the force. Top providers of volunteers per capita were the District of Columbia, Vermont, Montana, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, Maine, Colorado, and Minnesota. The Peace Corps has a large volunteer force serving in various regions, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Political instability limits presence in the Middle East. Programs have been launched in Burma and Vietnam. Most volunteers participate in the 27-month program after training. The Peace Corps Response Program, introduced in 1996, utilizes former volunteers and specialists for short-term assignments in emergency, humanitarian, and development work. Over 2,500 volunteers have served in 70 countries, including post-disaster areas like Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Haiti. Currently, there are 259 volunteers in 30 countries, with a subset focusing on Global Health Services Partnership providing medical professionals to developing countries. Peace Corps volunteers serve one-year terms in developing countries, working in various sectors such as education, health, youth programs, environmental programs, community economic development, agriculture, and Peace Corps Response. They play a significant role in implementing presidential aid initiatives at the village level, including efforts for AIDS relief, malaria prevention, food security, and expanding access to education for girls internationally. The Peace Corps focuses on expanding access to education for girls internationally. Most volunteers are recent college graduates with little professional experience. There is a debate on whether the Peace Corps should prioritize recruiting highly skilled professionals to better meet the current needs of developing countries. The agency's role in public diplomacy and showcasing U.S. values is also emphasized. The assessment team recommended that the Peace Corps embrace generalists while strengthening their capabilities through better training and sector activities. They also suggested utilizing experienced volunteers through innovative approaches like the Peace Corps Response Program. The recruitment of volunteers with appropriate skills and willingness to live in unfamiliar conditions is essential to the Peace Corps mission. The Global Health Services Partnership is an example of a new program accommodating different types of volunteers. Since September 11, 2001, there has been a significant increase in Peace Corps applicants, with a peak of 17,336 applications in FY2014. The introduction of a shorter application form and the ability for applicants to choose their country and sector of service contributed to this rise. However, application volume declined to 10,131 in FY2013. The Peace Corps has faced criticism in the past for inadequate programming and support for volunteers, as noted in a 1990 GAO investigation. The Peace Corps has addressed programming problems with systematic approaches to project development, annual project reviews, and increased opportunities for site visits and volunteer feedback. However, volunteer anecdotal accounts suggest some degree of poor programming and staff support still occur. The 2017 volunteer survey found that only 68% of volunteers felt they had enough to do at their work site, and 22% were dissatisfied with support received from Peace Corps staff in site selection and preparation. The Peace Corps has identified issues with site development practices, safety procedures, and coordination with partners. Volunteer dissatisfaction is evident in the 19% resignation rate for FY2014, although it has decreased from previous years. Recommendations have been made to address volunteer concerns, such as improving training and utilizing skilled volunteers better. The Peace Corps has implemented reforms to improve volunteer satisfaction, focusing on site selection, meaningful work, matching skills, work availability, and community needs. Safety and security remain top priorities, especially in light of anti-American terrorism threats post-9/11. The agency is now more data-driven in measuring progress towards these goals. The Peace Corps faced increased concerns about safety and security following anti-American terrorism post-9/11. Issues were highlighted in 2003 by the Dayton Daily News, leading to congressional action in 2004. Renewed attention came in 2010 after reports on ABC's 20/20 about volunteer safety failures, including the murder of Kate Puzey and incidents of rape. Following reports on volunteer safety failures, including the murder of Kate Puzey and incidents of rape, concerns were raised about a lack of compassion for victims of crime and insensitivity to their needs. Legislation was introduced in 2011 to address these issues, leading to the signing of the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011. The Peace Corps IG report in April 2010 highlighted areas for improvement in safety and security programs, including lack of effective processes, standardized training, and skilled personnel. Issues such as incomplete inspections, unsafe volunteer behaviors, and inadequate emergency plans were recurring between FY2004 and FY2009, indicating long-term compliance problems. The Peace Corps IG report in April 2010 identified issues in safety and security program compliance. It made 28 recommendations, including establishing clear lines of authority, tracking recommendations, reviewing roles and salaries of Safety and Security Coordinators, developing a training program, and creating a comprehensive safety and security plan. The Peace Corps implemented all 28 recommendations from the IG report on safety and security, including providing volunteers with a handbook on safety principles and signing a code of conduct. The Peace Corps Director clarified that TV programs did not accurately reflect their safety policies. They issued a formal Commitment to Sexual Assault Victims, promising to treat victims with dignity and support their safety. The Peace Corps has taken steps to improve safety and support for volunteers, including apologizing to the family of a murder victim. Volunteers have reported feeling safe in their living and working environments, with a significant decline in sexual assault incidents due to improved procedures and training. The Peace Corps has seen a significant decline in rape and major sexual assault incidents among volunteers over the past 14 years, with a 27% decrease in rape and attempted rape and a 34% decrease in major sexual assault between 1997 and 2009. The organization has implemented procedures to respond quickly and compassionately to volunteers, and has improved safety and security measures following a 2002 Government Accountability Office report. The Peace Corps has implemented various initiatives to improve safety and security, including establishing a dedicated office, deploying field-based officers, and appointing compliance officers. Despite efforts, there were still some compliance issues reported by the GAO in 2004. In 2008, a Sexual Assault Working Group was formed to reduce risk and support victims, and in 2010, a victim's advocate position was approved. In late 2010, the Peace Corps approved a victim's advocate position to support volunteers who are victims of crime, providing assistance from the crime through post-service, including navigating post-service health benefits. Guidelines for responding to rape and sexual assault were issued in February 2011, outlining procedures to assist and advocate for volunteers. Peace Corps staff are expected to prioritize the volunteer's best interest, ensuring a safe environment, medical care, counseling, and support for prosecution. Staff abroad were trained on these protocols between April and November 2012. In November 2012, over 350 staff abroad were trained on protocols related to sexual assault. Efforts were strengthened following the 2011 Kate Puzey Volunteer Protection Act. The Peace Corps IG found in reports that while many elements of the sexual assault policy were in place, full compliance with the Kate Puzey Act was still a work in progress. Sexual assault training was provided to all 27-month volunteers. By November 2016, the Peace Corps had significantly improved its support for Volunteers who reported a sexual assault. The Peace Corps has made efforts to improve safety and security for volunteers, including training on sexual assault risk reduction and response. Legislation such as the Kate Puzey Act mandates this training and outlines procedures for volunteers in the event of an assault. Peace Corps applicants are required to undergo this training as part of their preparation. The bill mandates the development of sexual assault protocols and guidelines by the Peace Corps director. It also requires staff training on protocol implementation and establishes sexual response teams to address assault reports. Volunteers can request site removal for safety evaluation, and alternative reporting systems with volunteer anonymity are set up. A victims advocate position is created to assist assaulted volunteers and a Sexual Assault Advisory Council is established. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 establishes a Sexual Assault Advisory Council to review training and policy, conducts annual surveys on program effectiveness and safety, allows for confidential incident reporting, requires a memorandum of understanding between the Peace Corps and State Department on volunteer protection, and mandates detailed reporting on volunteer deaths, crime and security risks, and sexual assault documentation. The Peace Corps has upgraded security measures in response to threats of terrorism and civil strife, including country-specific Emergency Action Plans (EAP). Evacuations and mission closures have limited the organization's growth, with volunteers evacuated from 17 countries since 2000. Volunteers from 17 countries have been evacuated due to political instability and civil unrest. Programs in Mali, Niger, Tunisia, Kenya, Ukraine, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have been suspended at various times for security concerns, including the Ebola outbreak. Peace Corps Response volunteers are currently serving in Liberia, Ukraine, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. In February 2015, Peace Corps suspended its Jordan program due to regional environment. Crime is a factor in agency evacuation decisions. Kazakhstan program was suspended in 2011 due to operational considerations, possibly related to rapes and terrorist attacks. Central America programs were under review in 2011 due to drug and organized crime-related violence. Honduras volunteers were withdrawn while the review was ongoing. The Peace Corps program in Honduras was suspended in September 2012 and closed in FY2014. Volunteer operations in Guatemala and El Salvador were resumed in 2013 with enhanced safety measures. However, the program in El Salvador was suspended in January 2016 due to increased violence. The program in Burkina Faso was suspended in September 2017, and volunteers in Nicaragua were evacuated in April 2018 for safety concerns. Despite challenges, the Peace Corps aims to convey U.S. culture and values in Islamic countries. The Peace Corps has programs in Islamic countries, with a focus on safety for volunteers. In FY2016, 16% of volunteers served in countries with Muslim populations over 40%. The organization emphasizes the close relationships between volunteers and host communities for safety. The Obama Administration proposed health insurance coverage for volunteers in cases of rape, incest, and endangerment of the mother's life. The Obama Administration proposed health insurance coverage for Peace Corps volunteers in cases of rape, incest, and endangerment of the mother's life, which opponents argued would expand abortion services by the federal government. Authorization legislation reflecting the Obama Administration's 2013 proposal to amend the Peace Corps Act for abortion restrictions on volunteer health care insurance was introduced in Congress. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 allowed exceptions for funding abortions in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life, but only applied to FY2015 funding. This provision has been repeated in subsequent years, including the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Peace Corps provides comprehensive health care to serving volunteers, including routine and emergency care, medical evacuation, and initiatives to improve care quality. Recent improvements include direct communication with medical professionals, electronic medical records, and malaria prevention efforts. The 2017 Volunteer Survey showed 71% satisfaction with medical support. The Peace Corps provides medical support to volunteers, with 71% satisfaction reported in a 2017 survey. Concerns have been raised about the use of mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, with a former volunteer suing the Peace Corps over inadequate warnings. Volunteers with health issues can file claims under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. The Peace Corps has hired staff to assist volunteers with their claims under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. A Healthcare Task Force proposed actions to improve communication with the Department of Labor and shorten the claims process. The Task Force recommended seeking legislation to raise the ceiling on disability compensation and improve postservice health benefits for volunteers and RPCVs. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 requires the Peace Corps to consult with CDC experts on malaria prophylaxis and provide medical benefits to returned volunteers injured during service for 120 days. The five-year rule, a cause of excessive turnover, has been a long-discussed issue in the Peace Corps community and periodically addressed by Congress. The five-year rule, established in 1965 and amended in 1985, limits most Peace Corps staff to five years of employment, with a possible one-year extension. A further extension of two and a half years is allowed for 15% of U.S. direct hires. Staff can only be rehired after a period equal to their previous term of service has passed. This rule does not apply to personal service contractors or foreign nationals. The five-year rule limits most Peace Corps staff to five years of employment, with possible extensions. Positive aspects include a vibrant workforce and hiring more returned Peace Corps volunteers. Negative effects have led to limited extensions and exemptions. The hiring of more returned Peace Corps volunteers provides high-quality policy input, increases the agency's influence on foreign policy, and creates possible cost savings. However, the five-year rule has led to higher turnover rates, with staff turnover ranging from 25% to 33% each year since 2004, quadruple that of the rest of the federal government. The five-year rule at the Peace Corps has led to high turnover rates, quadruple that of the federal government, with staff leaving on average after three years. This turnover results in negative impacts such as poor institutional memory, frequent vacancies, and high recruitment costs estimated at $12.6 million to $15.5 million from 2005 to 2009. The 2012 OIG evaluation of the Peace Corps recommended reforms to reduce turnover and increase employment length. The Peace Corps has since implemented changes, offering five-year employment terms to new employees and utilizing legislative authority to extend staff tenure. The Peace Corps has implemented changes to reduce turnover and increase employment length, including offering five-year employment terms to new employees and utilizing legislative authority to extend staff tenure. The agency is also working to address causes of early resignation and identify positions where staff turnover is most harmful. OIG recommendations on this issue remain open as of July 2017, with the Peace Corps considering legislative remedies if necessary. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 allows the Director to designate certain positions for extended or renewable appointments."
