    "content": "Charitable contributions of scientific equipment to elementary and secondary schools. The amendment to section 170(e)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 defines a qualified research or education contribution as a charitable donation of tangible personal property by a corporation to an educational organization, governmental unit, or organization described in section 41(e)(6)(B). In section 41(e)(6)(B), a taxpayer can make a contribution of scientific equipment or apparatus for research or experimentation purposes within 3 years of acquiring the property. A taxpayer can contribute scientific equipment or apparatus for educational purposes within the United States, with the original use of the property starting with the taxpayer. The property must not be exchanged for money, other property, or services, and the taxpayer must receive acknowledgment from the donee. Donations to Charity for Refurbishing: A corporation's charitable contribution can be considered a qualified research or education contribution if the property donated meets specific criteria and is given to an eligible organization. Donations of property to a 501(c)(3) organization for refurbishing and subsequent donation to another eligible organization must meet specific requirements under section 501(a). The taxpayer must receive a written statement confirming the property's use aligns with the regulations. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include \"qualified research or education contribution\" instead of just \"qualified research contribution\". This change applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
