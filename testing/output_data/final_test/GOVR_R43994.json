    "content": "According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), sick leave is a paid leave of absence for federal employees, who can use it for personal medical needs, family care, bereavement, and child adoption. Employees must request and receive approval from their agencies to use sick leave. Sick leave hours are earned at varied rates depending on employment status, with no limit on accumulation. Federal employees can accumulate sick leave up to statutory ceilings at the end of a leave year, with a \"use or lose\" policy enforced. Unused sick leave can be credited towards service at retirement. However, new employees may start with zero sick leave hours, potentially causing issues during medical emergencies. Federal employees may receive advanced sick leave for medical reasons, at the agency's discretion. The maximum hours advanced depend on the situation, as outlined in Table 3. Agencies have discretion in granting sick leave. Employees may receive advanced sick leave from their agencies, with agencies having discretion on the total hours advanced and approval procedures. Requests for advanced sick leave or annual leave for medical reasons must be approved by supervisors and may be denied. Advanced annual leave can also be requested for purposes like pregnancy or bonding with a baby. Advanced annual leave, like advanced sick leave, allows employees to receive annual leave hours that have not yet been accrued, up to the amount they would accrue in a given year. Federal employees can also receive leave hours from other employees through the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program and Voluntary Leave Bank Program for medical emergencies when they have exhausted all paid leave options. Employees can request unpaid leave (LWOP) for medical reasons after exhausting paid leave options. Agencies have discretion in approving LWOP, except under FMLA, which provides unpaid leave for certain medical circumstances. Extended LWOP can impact federal benefits eligibility. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employees can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption, or a serious health condition. To qualify, employees must have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months, 1,250 hours in the previous 12 months, and be at a location with at least 50 employees within 75 miles. Federal agencies are covered employers. Employees can use FMLA leave intermittently and provide 30 days' notice. Efforts have been made to expand leave options for federal employees. President Barack Obama signed a memorandum in 2015 to promote paid parental leave for federal employees, encouraging agencies to offer maximum advanced sick leave benefits irrespective of current leave balances. There have been no recent proposals to reduce sick leave benefits for federal employees. The 2015 memorandum signed by President Obama promotes paid parental leave for federal employees by offering advanced sick leave benefits for birth, adoption, or foster care placement. This allows both parents to bond with a new child and attend adoption proceedings without exhausting accrued leave. The changes aim to support mothers in their recovery after childbirth and enable partners to care for them during this time. The memorandum sets deadlines for implementation and directs agencies to follow OPM guidance. The 2015 memorandum signed by President Obama promotes paid parental leave for federal employees by offering advanced sick leave benefits for birth, adoption, or foster care placement. OPM issued guidance for agencies to implement advanced sick and annual leave policies by April 15, 2015. Agencies were directed to update their leave policies by June 15, 2015, and January 1, 2016, to ensure employees are aware of their entitlements for childbirth, adoption, or foster care placement. President Obama's 2014 memorandum encouraged federal agencies to utilize workplace flexibilities and work-life programs to enhance recruitment and retention. Agencies were directed to provide leave options for family care to the maximum extent possible, including annual and sick leave for caring for ill family members and FMLA unpaid leave for parental responsibilities. OPM issued guidance to summarize available leave options for federal employees in personal and family medical situations. Agencies were required to submit reports to OPM by October 2014 identifying best practices for supporting productivity and efficiency. In October 2014, OPM requested agency reports on workplace flexibilities and work-life programs to identify best practices and barriers. OPM issued a memorandum in December 2014 for agencies to complete a survey on leave programs, including those for personal or family medical situations. Proposed legislation from the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses aimed to enhance federal leave options, such as the Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2015. The Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2015 (FEPPLA) would provide federal employees with up to six weeks of paid parental leave for the birth or placement of a child in adoption or foster care. This paid leave would be in addition to any accrued annual or sick leave and could be used without exhausting existing leave. The bill also allows OPM to increase the amount of paid parental leave through regulations. OPM is set to increase paid parental leave from six weeks to 12 weeks, considering costs and benefits, private sector trends, and impact on lower-income employees. FEPPLA proposes a new paid leave category for parental responsibilities not covered under current sick leave laws. The FMLA has seen past legislation proposing changes for federal employees, including additional unpaid leave for family activities like parental involvement and family wellness. Some bills aimed to expand FMLA unpaid leave for caring for sick relatives, such as allowing leave to care for a grandchild with a serious health condition. The FMLA has seen proposed legislation for federal employees to use unpaid leave to care for sick relatives not currently covered, such as a grandchild with a serious health condition. The federal government does not provide short-term disability coverage, but employees can purchase private insurance for income replacement during medical absences. In 2008, OPM proposed a short-term disability insurance program for federal employees to cover non-work related injuries or disabilities, especially beneficial for new employees without sufficient leave accrual. The program aimed to provide additional income protection for recovery from accidents, illnesses, or maternity purposes through approved insurance providers as part of the federal benefits package. In 2008, OPM proposed a short-term disability insurance program for federal employees, offering coverage for non-work related injuries, care for family members, and activities related to becoming an adoptive or foster parent. Legislation in subsequent Congresses also proposed similar programs, but they were not enacted. Past legislation aimed to expand leave donation programs for federal employees. Federal law allows donation of annual leave through the Voluntary Leave Transfer or Voluntary Leave Bank program for a peer with a medical emergency, but not sick leave."
