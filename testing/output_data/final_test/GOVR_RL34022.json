    "content": "Congress enacted the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act on December 19, 2007, to fund most of the federal government, including HUD. The funding level provided is lower than initially approved but higher than the President's request. It reduces funding for programs like HOPE VI, HOME, and Community Development Block Grant. The bill also includes a rescission of over $720 million for the Section 8 voucher program. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 19, 2007, funded most federal programs, including HUD, at reduced levels. It included a rescission of over $720 million for the Section 8 voucher program. Various continuing resolutions (CRs) were passed to fund programs at FY2007 levels until the final appropriations bill was signed. Additional emergency CDBG funds were allocated for Louisiana's Hurricane Katrina recovery program. The FY2008 Transportation-HUD funding bill proposed $38.66 billion for HUD, but it was never considered by the Senate due to the President's veto threat over the funding level exceeding his request. HUD's funding primarily comes from discretionary appropriations in annual acts by Congress to address housing issues for low-income households. HUD provides rental assistance programs for the poor, elderly, and disabled, with Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance being the main funding sources. Block grant programs like HOME and Community Development Block Grants help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. HUD also focuses on increasing homeownership rates for lower-income and minority households through downpayment assistance and housing counseling programs. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers with below-average credit records. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus funds from FHA are used to offset HUD budget costs. In FY2007, Congress approved continuing resolutions to maintain government funding at FY2006 levels. In FY2007, Congress approved a continuing resolution (P.L. 110-5) that funded most programs at their FY2006 levels. The CR specified higher or lower funding levels for some HUD programs, including Tenant Based Rental Assistance, Project-Based Rental Assistance, Public Housing Operating Fund, Indian Housing Loan Guarantee, Homeless Assistance Grants, and Salaries and Expenses. Some HUD accounts were funded above their FY2006 levels, while others were funded below. In FY2007, the 110th Congress approved a supplemental funding bill that made changes to the FY2007 CR, providing additional funding for HUD's Inspector General to oversee Hurricane Katrina funding and clarifying distribution of Section 8 voucher funding. The President's FY2008 HUD budget request is compared to prior year appropriations in Table 2. The curr_chunk discusses the funding for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, which provides rent subsidies for low-income families. HUD funds over 2 million vouchers administered by Public Housing Authorities. This account is the largest in HUD's budget and covers voucher costs and program administration. The tenant-based rental assistance account receives an advance appropriation each year, typically $4.2 billion, to be used in the subsequent fiscal year. This funding covers voucher costs and program administration for low-income families under the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. In FY2007, $15,920 million in new budget authority was authorized by the appropriations act, slightly less than the $15,927 million available for allocation. HUD was directed to allocate only $15,920 million of the total amount. HUD allocated $15,920 million out of the $15,927 million available for allocation in FY2007. It is unclear how the remaining $7 million was allocated. In FY2008, Congress provided less advance appropriations compared to the prior year. The new budget authority authorized in FY2008 is less than the budget authority available. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated the full amount of budget authority available in FY2008 but also included a rescission of $723 million from the advance provided in FY2007. In FY2007, HUD allocated $15,920 million out of $15,927 million available. Congress provided less advance appropriations in FY2008, with a rescission of $723 million from FY2007. Funding for tenant-based renewals, mainly for voucher renewals, has seen changes in distribution since FY2004. Various voucher reform proposals have been considered, but none enacted. Congressional language in appropriations bills could potentially override statutory changes. In FY2007, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on actual leasing and costs from the previous 12 months, adjusted for inflation and first-time voucher renewals. Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration agencies were funded based on their MTW agreements, subject to proration. Other agencies were also funded accordingly. In FY2007, Congress directed HUD to fund PHAs based on actual leasing and costs from the previous 12 months, adjusted for inflation and first-time voucher renewals. Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration agencies were funded based on their agreements, subject to proration. Other categories of agencies also received modified funding allocations, including certain Katrina-affected PHAs, those under receiverships, and those that overspent. $100 million was set aside for agencies facing increased voucher costs or formula changes. The formula in the year-long CR was similar to FY2004, while the President requested a formula similar to FY2006 in his FY2008 budget. The President's budget requested $100 million for additional rental subsidy needs and portability adjustments in FY2008. The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 allocated $14.7 billion for voucher renewals, following a formula based on PHAs' FY2007 funding adjusted for inflation and specific costs. Agencies would be funded based on their agreements, subject to proration, with allocations adjusted for costs related to escrow accounts, HOPE VI vouchers, and project-based contracts. The bill would have allocated funding for MTW agencies based on their agreements, with prorated allocations. The Secretary would notify agencies of their budgets within 45 days of enactment. Up to $75 million could be set aside for additional rental subsidy funding. PHAs would continue to be prohibited from overleasing vouchers. The House committee chose not to use updated data for allocating FY2008 renewal funding. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3074 would have provided $14.9 billion for voucher renewals in FY2008, allocated based on PHAs' leasing and cost data. MTW agencies would have been funded according to their agreements, with certain Katrina-affected agencies receiving higher funding. PHAs would need to submit plans for effective use of funds. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3074 would have required PHAs to submit plans for effective use of additional funds within 12 months. Agencies at risk of losing funding would be funded based on higher amounts received in previous years if they submitted spending plans. Allocations would be prorated to fit within the appropriated amount, with PHAs notified of their budgets within 90 days of enactment. The Secretary could set aside up to $100 million to adjust allocations for PHAs with significant increases in renewal costs. The Senate bill aimed to adjust PHA allocations based on increased renewal costs or portability costs, and to prevent overleasing. The committee believed the FY2007 formula was efficient in capturing actual costs. The conference agreement proposed lower funding for voucher renewals, distributing funds based on leasing and cost data. The bill proposed using data from the most recent federal fiscal year to adjust PHA budgets for inflation and prorating within the appropriated amount. It included adjustments for FSS costs, tenant protection renewals, and project-based commitments. MTW agencies would be funded based on agreements, with a prohibition on overleasing. The Secretary could set aside up to $50 million for cost increases due to portability or increased voucher use. Under P.L. 110-161, PHA's initial allocations will be determined using the same formula as in the conference agreement. Each agency's allocation will then be reduced by the amount of their unusable, restricted reserve accounts exceeding 7% of the total received in FY2007. HUD will prorate the amount provided to each PHA to fit within the amount provided for renewals, which is $13,971 million in new budget authority available for tenant-based renewals in FY2008. The proration level in FY2008 will be higher if the aggregate amount of PHAs' unusable, restricted reserve accounts is less than $723 million. Prior to FY2004, PHAs were paid a fixed fee per voucher administered. Beginning in FY2004, HUD changed the way it distributed administrative fees to contain costs. The FY2007 year-long CR initially funded administrative fees at the FY2006 level. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations law increased funding for administrative fees to the amount requested by the President. The President requested increased funding for administrative fees for FY2007 and FY2008, with a request for $5 million for incentive bonuses for PHAs that consolidate. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 supported this funding and incentive bonus allocation. The allocation of administrative fees would be based on the number of families assisted by PHAs, as opposed to the previous pro-rata allocation method. The conference agreement for administrative fees in FY2007 and FY2008 did not include the $5 million consolidation bonus requested by the President. The funding level and allocation requirements were adopted in P.L. 110-161, with no provision for the Secretary to supplement administrative fee funding. The FY2007 year-long CR did not specify an amount for tenant protection vouchers initially, so they were funded at their FY2006 level of $178 million. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations law reduced the amount for tenant protection vouchers to $149 million. Tenant protection vouchers are provided to families in various circumstances, including those threatened with displacement due to ending contracts or public housing displacement. The FY2007 year-long CR initially funded tenant protection vouchers at $178 million, which was later reduced to $149 million. The President requested $150 million for FY2008, with the authority to supplement funds with recaptured balances. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 supported this request. P.L. 110-161 allocated $200 million for tenant protection vouchers, directing the Secretary to provide vouchers for all eligible units. The conference agreement provides $200 million for tenant protection vouchers, including new incremental vouchers for additional families. No new incremental vouchers have been funded since FY2002. The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 allocated $30 million for new incremental vouchers for non-elderly disabled families, with potential funds for supportive housing vouchers for homeless veterans. The Senate-passed version allocated $105 million. The conference agreement on H.R. 3074 allocated $135 million for incremental vouchers, including $30 million for Family Unification Program vouchers and $75 million for HUD-VASH vouchers. P.L. 110-161 provided $125 million for similar programs. The law provides $125 million for incremental vouchers, including $30 million for non-elderly disabled families, $75 million for HUD-VASH vouchers, and $20 million for Family Unification Program vouchers. This funding is used to administer and renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private landlords, allowing eligible low-income families to pay only 30% of their incomes toward rent. No new contracts have been entered into since the early 1980s, with monthly payments for landlords coming from old appropriations. The President's budget requested Congress to fund project-based Section 8 contract renewals at a reduced amount in FY2008. Questions were raised about the adequacy of the funding due to issues in the program during FY2007. In July 2007, HUD stopped monthly payments to property owners with expiring contracts, citing insufficient funding. HUD's legal counsel determined that partial funding could no longer be obligated for 12-month contract renewals with property owners. OMB and HUD found funding to resume payments for FY2007, with contracts modified to not set aside funding for the full contract length. A House hearing discussed the need for increased appropriations in FY2009, with a proposed $700 million increase in funding for renewals in H.R. 3074. The committee report expressed concern about HUD's ability to estimate renewal needs and directed the Secretary to report back with a review of future contract renewal needs. The Senate-passed version proposed funding renewals at the President's request and required reporting on project-based contracts. P.L. 110-161 funds project-based renewals above the President's request but below the House-passed level. The joint explanatory statement directs HUD and OMB to determine short-funding contracts. The joint explanatory statement directs HUD and OMB to determine if short-funding contracts violate the Anti-Deficiency Act. HUD aims to transfer all contract administration to subcontractors, with a 96% increase in appropriations requested for contract administrators in the President's FY2008 budget. The appropriations for contract administrators in FY2008 would need to be met through new appropriations as recaptured funds were not available. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 authorized funding for contract administrators at the President's requested level, allowing the Secretary to use the funding for rental assistance or interest reduction payments. The FY2008 appropriations for contract administrators would need new funding as recaptured funds were not available. P.L. 110-161 includes the House proposal for contract administrator funding for Section 8 programs. There has been controversy over unobligated balances in the Housing Certificate Fund (HCF) for rescission. If HUD cannot meet the rescission from the HCF, it can take funds from other accounts. The FY2007 year-long CR rescinded $1.65 billion from the HCF, with the President's FY2008 budget requesting Congress to rescind $1.3 billion. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 included different amounts for rescission from the HCF, with the final agreement rescinding $1.25 billion. HUD can use funds from other accounts to meet the rescission but must notify the Appropriations Committees in advance. Public housing provides rental units for low-income families, with no new developments in recent years. Public housing authorities receive funds from HUD for maintenance and administration of existing units. The Capital Fund supports large projects and modernization. HOPE VI grants aid in redeveloping distressed housing. Funding for the Operating Fund has not met all PHAs' needs. The FY2007 year-long CR provided $3.86 billion for the Operating Fund, resulting in a proration of 83%. The President's FY2008 request of $4 billion is estimated to result in a proration level of just over 80%. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 would have provided $200 million more for the Operating Fund than the President's request. The Senate bill also included authority for HUD to set aside $6 million for technical assistance funds to aid PHAs in transitioning to asset-based management. The House committee report did not provide asset-management set-aside funds for HUD, as they believed HUD should not receive technical assistance funds without providing them to PHAs. P.L. 110-161 funded the Operating Fund at $4.2 billion and included the asset management set-aside requested by the President. Certain small PHAs were exempted from asset management requirements, and HUD was limited in implementing certain asset-management requirements related to costs. The President proposed a $400 million reduction in funding for the Capital Fund in FY2008, with $35 million coming from changes in set-asides. Funding for ROSS grants, Neighborhood Networks technology grants, and emergency funding was eliminated, while there was an increase in technical assistance and assessments. The majority of the reduction would come from formula grants for PHAs to modernize public housing, with a focus on alternative financing and leveraging private investment. The Department is conducting a modernization needs study and developing a protocol to measure PHAs' performance in meeting modernization needs. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 proposed increased funding for the Capital Fund, with the Senate bill providing almost $500 million above the President's request. P.L. 110-161 funds the Capital Fund at the House-passed level. The conference agreement funds the Capital Fund at the House-passed level and directs HUD to perform a CNA by July 31, 2009. The Secretary is also directed to report quarterly on PHAs in receivership. Despite the President's requests to not provide new funds for the HOPE VI program, Congress continues to fund it, citing a backlog of unspent funds. The President has also requested rescinding funds for the program from previous years. Congress continues to fund the HOPE VI program despite the President's request to not provide new funds and to rescind funds from previous years. The FY2008 budget requested Congress to rescind funds provided in FY2007 and not allocate new funding for FY2008. Both House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 proposed funding for the program, with the House bill at $120 million and the Senate bill at $100 million. The final agreement funded the program at $100 million for FY2008 with an additional $2.4 million for technical assistance. The FY2008 budget funds the HOPE VI program at $100 million and allocates $2.4 million for technical assistance. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 reorganized federal housing assistance for Native Americans into a single block grant program, emphasizing Indian self-determination. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) provides block grants to Indian tribes for affordable housing activities. The FY2008 budget requested $627 million for the Native American Block Grant program, with no set-aside for the National American Indian Housing Council (NAIHC). The Senate recommended $630 million for the program. The House bill did not specify a set-aside for NAIHC. The Senate recommended $630 million for the NABG program and $2 million for NAIHC. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $2 million for a national organization representing Native American housing interests. The Administration's budget proposed a bond financing program for NABG recipients to sell tax-exempt bonds backed by NABG funds for housing activities. HOPWA provides housing assistance and supportive services for low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families through formula allocation and competitive grants. In FY2008, Congress appropriated over $300 million for HOPWA, the most ever for the program, supporting housing for around 67,000 households. The Administration proposed changing the method of allocating HOPWA formula grants. The President proposed changing the method of allocating HOPWA formula grants from using cumulative AIDS cases to considering the number of persons living with AIDS and housing costs. The House Appropriations Committee did not recommend a formula change in the appropriations bill. The Administration suggested no funding for the program in FY2008, arguing that activities could be better performed under the CDBG or HOME programs. The House and Senate disagreed on whether Rural Housing and Economic Development activities are best performed under CDBG or HOME programs. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act funded the program at $17 million as recommended by the Senate. The Community Development Fund supports activities through the Community Development Block Grant program, which is a significant source of federal assistance for housing and economic development. The President's FY2008 budget recommended $2.975 billion for the formula portion of CDBG, $736 million less than the previous year. The Administration planned to reform the CDBG program during the 110th Congress, but no formal legislative proposal had been introduced. In the 109th Congress, a proposal to restructure the CDBG distribution formula was unveiled but not formally introduced. The President's FY2008 budget recommended $2.975 billion for the formula portion of CDBG, with plans to reform the program by targeting assistance based on specific factors. This included changes to how funds were allocated to entitlement communities and states, with a shift towards a single pool of funds and a minimum grant threshold requirement. A two-year transition period would have been established for communities to adjust to the new system. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposed reforms to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, including a two-year transition period for communities not meeting grant thresholds. A $200 million bonus grant program was also suggested for improving living conditions in distressed neighborhoods. Additionally, funding cuts were recommended for various community development programs deemed duplicative of CDBG activities. The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 recommended an appropriation of $3.936 billion for CDBG formula grant activities, $225 million above FY2007. The Senate bill provided $6 million less than FY2007 for CDBG formula grants. Both rejected the Administration's consolidation proposal. The conference agreement included $4 billion in Community Development Fund assistance, with $3.790 billion for CDBG activities. This allocation was higher than the Senate's recommendation and the Administration's request, but lower than the House's recommendation. Additionally, the agreement extended CDBG entitlement status to two Illinois communities with populations below the threshold for metropolitan city designation. The provision in H.R. 3074 would allow Alton and Granite City, Illinois to qualify for direct CDBG funding by lowering the population threshold for metropolitan city designation. This would give the two cities control over funds previously awarded to Madison County, creating a precedent for other small metropolitan cities to secure direct funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, H.R. 2764, signed into law as P.L. 110-161, grants entitlement status to Alton and Granite City, Illinois. It appropriates $3.866 billion for CDF activities, with $3.593 billion allocated to CDBG formula grant recipients, a 3.2% decline from FY2007. The FY2008 budget allocated $343 million less than recommended by the House, $112 million less than recommended by the Senate, and $130 million less than recommended by the conference committee on H.R. 3074 for Economic Development Initiatives (EDIs) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NIs). Congress approved $307 million in EDI funds for 1,126 earmarked projects and $49 million in NI funds for 50 projects for FY2006. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2007 specified no funds under the CDF account were to be used for EDI or NI activities. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposal requested no new funding for EDI or NI activities. The House bill for FY2008 recommended $180 million for Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI) earmarks, $108 million less than the Senate bill. Starting in FY2009, recipients of NI and EDI grants will be required to provide 25% in matching funds. The conference agreement allocated $183.5 million for EDI assistance and $26.5 million for NI earmarks. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2008 allocated $206 million for Economic Development Initiatives (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiatives (NI) projects, with funding for CDF increasing by 2.5% and a reduction in funding for the CDBG formula grant program. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to leverage their CDBG allocation for brownfield redevelopment, economic development, and housing projects. The CDBG entitlement communities and states can borrow up to five times their annual allocation for qualifying activities by pledging their CDBG allocation as security. The FY2008 budget did not include funding for the program, but the House-approved bill allocated $4 million, while the Senate-approved bill doubled the commitment to $6 million. The Consolidated Act for 2008 appropriated $4.5 million for loan subsidies to support $205 million in loan commitments. The Economic Development Initiative program provides funds for redevelopment of industrial and commercial facilities with environmental contamination. The President's budget recommended terminating the program, but the House and Senate bills allocated $10 million for HUD's brownfields program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 also appropriated $10 million for Brownfield Redevelopment. The HOME Investment Partnership Program, created in 1990, provides block grant funding for affordable housing initiatives. The program also funds related programs like the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) and housing counseling assistance. HUD provides grants to local housing counseling agencies for various housing-related activities. HUD provides competitive grants for housing counseling, including services for predatory lending, Homeownership Voucher Program, colonias, and Home Equity Conversion Mortgage counseling. The funding increase requested for FY2008 was mainly for formula grants, with HOME consistently receiving high ratings from OMB's PART analysis. The House and Senate bills did not meet the President's requested level for formula grants. The House bill funded the program just above the FY2007 level. The Senate provided higher funding for formula grants in FY2008, but directed the increased funding to set-asides rather than formula grants. The total funding level was above the President's request. The final funding for formula grants was below the House, Senate, and conference agreement levels. The President requested a doubling of ADDI funding, which would have been sufficient to serve over 6,600 households. ADDI was set to expire at the end of FY2007 if not renewed. The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 did not fund ADDI in FY2008. The committee report highlighted that downpayment assistance is an eligible use of HOME formula grant funds. The Senate initially did not allocate funding for ADDI, but later approved $25 million for it during floor debate. The conference agreement proposed $15 million for ADDI promotion, while P.L. 110-161 allocated $10 million without extending the sunset. An amendment in the Senate version of H.R. 3074 aimed to provide up to $100 million for mitigation assistance to prevent mortgage defaults and foreclosures. The final appropriations law did not include funding for mortgages at risk of foreclosure, but provided $180 million to the NRC for foreclosure mitigation counseling services. The President's request for separate funding for housing counseling assistance has been rejected by Congress, with the program funded as a set-aside within the HOME program. The FY2007 CR maintained funding at the FY2006 level of $42 million, while the FY2008 budget requested $50 million for the program in a separate account. The President requested $50 million for housing counseling in the FY2008 budget. The House bill initially funded housing counseling at the FY2007 level within the HOME program, but a floor amendment increased funding by $6.76 million. The Senate proposed a 350% increase in funding for housing counseling, with $100 million allocated for individuals and families in foreclosure. The Secretary would need to advertise the availability of funds within 60 days of enactment under the Senate bill. P.L. 110-161 includes these provisions. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) includes $50 million for housing counseling within the HOME program. Homeless Assistance Grants encompass four programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, with funding increased to $1.586 billion in FY2008. The Emergency Shelter Grants program receives funding through formula allocation to states and local communities. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) includes $25 million for a new rapid re-housing program and $75 million for Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans. The program assists families in finding housing through rental assistance and supportive services. Funding for Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans, known as HUD-VASH vouchers, has been provided through the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. Approximately 2,000 vouchers were initially provided in the early 1990s through a collaboration between HUD and the VA, but no new vouchers have been funded since then. Both the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 recommended funding for additional vouchers for homeless veterans, with the Senate proposing $75 million for an unspecified number of vouchers. The House and Senate agreed on a funding level of $75 million for Homeless Assistance Grants, as recommended in the Administration's FY2008 budget. The budget also proposed $25 million for a Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative, but this was not included in the HUD spending bill. The Administration also suggested consolidating three competitive Homeless Assistance Grants into one grant, including funds for a Samaritan Housing Initiative. The Administration proposed $50 million for a Samaritan Housing Initiative to provide permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals. However, the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3074 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act did not include this set-aside. Separate bills in both chambers aim to consolidate the programs under the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act and the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act. Under the SHOP program, HUD grants funds to organizations for self-help homeownership opportunities. The program involves prospective home buyers and volunteers contributing \"sweat equity\" towards building their homes. The Administration proposed $40 million for SHOP and $30 million for Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing in FY2008. The House bill recommended $10 million less than the Administration's request for these programs. The House and Senate bills recommended funding levels for the Self Help and Assisted Homeownership account, with the Senate bill specifying funding for additional programs not funded in FY2007. Entities like the Housing Assistance Council and National Council of La Raza would have received no funding under the President's budget. The conference agreement would have appropriated the same amount recommended by the Senate for the SHOP program. The conference agreement would have appropriated $26.5 million for the SHOP program and $33.5 million for capacity building grants, with $5 million designated for rural areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 maintained these funding levels for SHOP and capacity building, including $5 million for rural capacity building activities. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $735 million for housing and services for elderly households, slightly more than the previous year. This funding supports programs like Section 811, Section 202, Service Coordinator, and Assisted Living Conversion. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 3074 and the conference agreement proposed funding elderly housing programs at $735 million. The President's FY2008 budget would have reduced funding by almost $160 million to $575 million, impacting new capital grants and project rental assistance in the Section 202 program. Of the $735 million appropriated for Section 202 and related programs, $60 million is allocated for the Service Coordinator program. The House, Senate, and President's budget proposed varying amounts for elderly housing programs in H.R. 3074. Congress allocated $25 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program, the same as in FY2007. The Administration's budget suggested $25 million for a Leveraging Financing Demonstration program for Section 202 housing. HUD proposed a program to increase mixed financing arrangements for Section 202 housing, aiming to leverage outside funding. However, the program did not receive funding in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. In contrast, $237 million was allocated for the Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities program. In FY2008, funding for the Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities program was slightly more than the previous year at $236.6 million. The President's budget proposed a significant cut to $125 million, but P.L. 110-161 eventually appropriated the same level as FY2007. $30 million was allocated for vouchers for non-elderly disabled families through the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. The Administration's budget for Section 811 included funds for a Leveraging Financing Demonstration program, which Congress did not provide funds for. The Office of Policy Development and Research at HUD is responsible for maintaining information on housing needs and market conditions, funded through the Research and Technology account. The President requested $65 million for the Research and Technology account for FY2008. The House and Senate bills recommended slightly less funding for activities related to institutions of higher education. The House bill suggested $22.4 million, while the Senate bill recommended $23 million. The allocation among university-based programs was not specified in the House bill, unlike the Senate bill. The conference agreement included a total appropriation of $61 million for Research and Technology, with $5 million for PATH activities and $23 million for university-based programs. An interagency working group was allocated $500,000 to develop a manual for mixed-income, transit-oriented developments. These provisions were incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which appropriated $51.4 million for research and technology activities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 allocated $51.4 million for research and technology activities, including $23 million for university-based programs and $5 million for PATH activities. An additional $500,000 was designated for a joint project by HUD and the Federal Transit Administration on mixed-income, transit-oriented development projects. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces anti-discrimination laws in housing sales, rentals, and financing. The Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) provides grants to state and local agencies to enforce laws similar to the federal Fair Housing Act. It offers non-competitive grants for public and private fair housing groups to educate the public and housing industry. The Administration requested $45 million for Fair Housing programs in FY2008, with the House and Senate recommending funding increases. The conference agreement allocated $50 million for Fair Housing programs, including funds for assistance programs for individuals with limited English proficiency. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, P.L. 110-161, maintains funding levels for the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program and the Healthy Homes Initiative. The President's budget proposed $116 million for these programs, with the conference agreement settling on $145 million for FY2008. The FHA administers mortgage insurance programs to insure lenders against loan defaults, enabling borrowers to obtain loans for various purposes. The programs are funded through two accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund. The MMI/CMHI fund provides insurance for home mortgages, while the GI/SRI fund covers riskier mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans for hospitals and nursing homes. The FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund and General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund provide insurance for home mortgages and riskier mortgages, respectively. The MMI fund no longer earns \"negative subsidies\" and may require net positive appropriations for FY2008. The President's budget proposed moving accounts from the GI/SRI fund to the MMI fund and included legislative proposals for budget savings. The aggregate limit on Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) would be removed, and the loan limit for HECMs would be set at 100%. The National Housing Act would be amended to increase loan limits for multifamily housing programs. The Ginnie Mae fee for guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities would be raised by six basis points. These proposals aim to generate $362 million in budget savings. The National Housing Act would be amended to increase loan limits for multifamily housing programs and raise the Ginnie Mae fee for guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities by six basis points, aiming to generate $362 million in budget savings. Congress estimates that provisions to increase GNMA's fees and move accounts between funds will generate $520 million in savings. Ginnie Mae guarantees timely payment of principal and interest on securities backed by mortgages insured by FHA, VA, or the Rural Housing Service. The President's budget for FY2008 requested $11 million for administrative expenses and proposed converting a portion of GNMA fees to discretionary funding. The budget also suggested charging issuers an upfront fee to offset program expenses, which was not included in House and Senate bills or P.L. 110-161. OFHEO, under HUD, regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Appropriations for OFHEO are offset by fees from the two entities. The President's FY2008 budget included a $4 million request for HUD oversight, not included in legislative proposals."
