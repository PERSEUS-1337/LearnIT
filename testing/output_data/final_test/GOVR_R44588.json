    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the USDA, FDA, and CFTC. It includes mandatory and discretionary spending, with a focus on discretionary amounts. Jurisdiction lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes both mandatory and discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, while mandatory spending is set in laws such as the farm bill. In FY2017, discretionary appropriations were 14% of the total, with mandatory spending making up the majority at 86%. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes $133 billion in mandatory spending, accounting for 86% of the total. Discretionary spending covers items like WIC, rural development, FDA, and food safety inspection. Mandatory spending includes SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity programs. SNAP requires annual appropriation, while CCC operates on a line of credit. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriations bill was enacted on May 5, 2017, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported their bills in April and May 2016. The last time an Agriculture appropriations bill was enacted as a stand-alone measure was for FY2010. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriations bill was enacted on May 5, 2017, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Committee action for FY2017 was somewhat earlier than in recent years. The Obama Administration released its FY2017 budget request on February 9, 2016, along with detailed budget justifications from USDA, FDA, and CFTC. The Trump Administration released an outline of its FY2018 budget request on March 16, 2017. The FY2018 budget request outlined by the Trump Administration proposed a 21% reduction for USDA, including the elimination of funding for some programs. The FY2017 explanatory statement emphasized Congress's role in determining future appropriations and advised against preemptively redirecting staffing based on funding outcomes. The Agriculture Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee held hearings on FY2017 appropriations with various agencies in the spring of 2016. The House Appropriations Committee incrementally made allocations to subcommittees for markups in the absence of a new budget or affirmation of the limit set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The House Agriculture appropriations subcommittee approved a draft bill in April 2016, with the full committee reporting the bill shortly after. Amendments were adopted, but the bill was not considered on the floor. The Senate Appropriations Committee divided the total discretionary amount for FY2017 into subcommittee allocations on April 18, 2016. The Senate Agriculture appropriations subcommittee approved a draft bill on May 17, 2016, and the full committee reported it on May 19, 2016. The bill was not considered on the floor, but parts of it were incorporated into the omnibus appropriation. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation bill was not considered on the floor but parts were included in the omnibus appropriation. The fiscal year started under a CR that lasted until December 9, 2016, with subsequent CRs extending funding until May 5, 2017. The bill achieved a $623 million reduction in discretionary funding compared to FY2016 through increased budgetary offsets and rescissions of prior appropriations. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation bill saw an increase in budget authority by $462 million, with mandatory spending increasing by $13.5 billion, mainly in farm programs. The increase in farm programs is automatic based on farm bill formulas and does not affect discretionary spending limits. House- and Senate-proposed amounts are compared in Table 2, while Figure 3 illustrates changes in discretionary spending by title over 10 years. Table 3 compares amounts at the agency level. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation bill increased budget authority by $462 million, with discretionary budget changes including Conservation programs receiving +$163 million and Rural development receiving +$119 million. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation bill increased budget authority by $462 million, with increases in programs like rural broadband, rural housing rental assistance, food and nutrition services, animal and plant health inspection, food and drug administration, farm service agency, USDA administration, food safety inspection service, and food for peace grants. In FY2017, the Agriculture appropriation bill allocated additional funds for various programs including rural broadband, housing assistance, food inspection, and disaster assistance. Sequestration is a process of automatic budget reductions triggered when spending exceeds statutory goals. Sequestration is authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011 for discretionary spending through FY2021 and for mandatory spending through FY2025. Despite efforts to raise spending limits in subsequent budget acts, sequestration on non-exempt mandatory accounts continues in FY2017. Congress passed three CRs to fund the fiscal year in the absence of an FY2017 appropriation before October 1, 2016. The Office of Management and Budget prorates funding to agencies on an annualized basis for the duration of a continuing resolution (CR) through apportionment. CRs may provide different amounts through anomalies or make specific administrative changes. The first CR for FY2017 continued FY2016 funding levels with exceptions, including a 0.496% across-the-board reduction and sufficient funding for mandatory program levels, such as nutrition programs. Anomalies also affected the agriculture portion individually, including an increase in funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. The continuing resolution (CR) for FY2017 includes anomalies such as increased funding of about $14 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, an earlier transfer of $13 billion to the Commodity Credit Corporation, and a higher rate of apportionment for the Rural Housing Rental Assistance Program. The FY2017 continuing resolution includes anomalies like an extension of the FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program and a second CR with changes to reduction rates and new anomalies for the agriculture portion. The FY2017 continuing resolution includes anomalies such as flexible apportionment for Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer projects and funding for the National Hunger Clearinghouse. The FY2017 continuing resolution includes funding for the National Hunger Clearinghouse and emergency funding for USDA land rehabilitation programs. Transfer authority within the Rural Utilities Service to support increased subsidy costs of Treasury direct telecommunication loans is also included. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for the FDA Innovation Account and the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) without specific disaster or regional allocations. The bill also includes policy provisions that guide how the executive branch should use the appropriations. The explanatory statement, along with the House and Senate report language, provides policy instructions that are expected to be followed by agencies. These documents do not have the force of law but often explain congressional intent. The committee reports and explanatory statement may need to be read together to capture all congressional intent for the fiscal year. The FY2017 appropriation addresses major policy issues including the GIPSA rule, horse slaughter inspection, poultry imports from China, and SNAP-authorized retailers. The enacted FY2017 appropriation addresses various policy issues related to SNAP-authorized retailers, SNAP households reporting requirements, school meals nutrition standards, and changes in Agriculture appropriations over the past decade. Agriculture appropriations have fluctuated over the past decade, peaking in FY2010 and declining through FY2013 before increasing again. The total budget authority contained in Titles I-VI has surpassed the official discretionary spending limit due to scorekeeping adjustments, with General Provisions mostly negative because of limits on mandatory programs. In FY2017, budget authority for primary agencies increased by $462 million. In FY2017, budget authority for primary agencies in the bill increased by $462 million, despite a decrease in official discretionary spending allocation. The use of CHIMPS and other tools helped offset reductions in discretionary budget authority in FY2011 and succeeding years. Some areas saw sustained real increases, while others declined, with agencies like FDA and CFTC experiencing inflation-adjusted growth since FY2007. Since FY2007, inflation-adjusted discretionary spending has increased for agencies like FDA and CFTC, with some areas experiencing real decreases such as general agricultural programs and domestic nutrition programs. Rural development and conservation also saw a real decrease, but trends were reversed in FY2016 for rural development and FY2017 for conservation. USDA, established in 1862, operates through 17 agencies and numerous administrative offices with almost 100,000 employees. About 95% of its funding is in the Agriculture appropriation. The Agriculture appropriation covers about 95% of USDA funding, with two-thirds of employees funded through this. The Forest Service is funded by the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The FY2017 appropriation increases departmental administration by $30.8 million (+8.2%) over FY2016, with notable exceptions. Buildings and facilities account sees a $20 million increase for renovations. The Agriculture appropriation increases by $20 million (+31%) for renovations to the South Building in the USDA headquarters. Funding also goes towards cybersecurity, digital accountability standards, oversight of information technology upgrades, and data acquisition for the 2018 farm bill. USDA conducts research at federal facilities and supports external research at universities through grants. The USDA conducts research on food and agriculture issues through four agencies: the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Economic Research Service (ERS). ARS conducts long-term research, NIFA distributes grants to land grant colleges, NASS collects agricultural statistics, and ERS provides economic analysis. The Economic Research Service (ERS) provides economic analysis on agriculture, natural resources, and food. The FY2017 appropriation for agricultural research is $2.891 billion, with $67 million more for research programming and $112 million less for buildings and facilities compared to FY2016. The enacted bill allocates more to research programs than the House bill proposed and reduces building and facilities less than the Senate bill proposed. Agricultural research is also funded by state matching contributions, private donations, grants, and mandatory funding from the farm bill. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDA's research agency with 90 laboratories nationwide and 6,600 employees. It focuses on food and fiber production, pest management, and new product development. The FY2017 appropriation for ARS is $1.170 billion, an increase from FY2016. ARS proposed increases for research projects and reductions in funding for existing programs. The enacted appropriation for the ARS in FY2017 rejects reductions in funding for existing programs and directs $99.6 million for ARS buildings and facilities, prioritizing projects like the Foreign Disease and Weed Science Research Unit in Fort Detrick, MD. NIFA provides federal funding for research, education, and extension projects in partnership with various institutions, including land-grant universities. The enacted appropriation for NIFA in FY2017 is $1.363 billion, an increase of $36 million over FY2016. In FY2016, the President requested more discretionary funding for NIFA and an increase in mandatory funding. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) received a $25 million increase for a $375 million appropriation. The requested additional $325 million in mandatory funding for AFRI was not included in the final appropriation. Formula-funded programs in research and extension remained constant under the FY2017 appropriation. The FY2017 appropriation for the Evans-Allen program supports historically black colleges of agriculture. NIFA's competitive grant funding includes research enhancement awards like USDA-EPSCoR. The President's proposal to consolidate STEM education funding was rejected, and additional funds were allocated to Rural Development for increasing STEM education access in rural areas. NASS received a $171 million appropriation for FY2017, with a $2.8 million increase from FY2016. The funding increase is mainly for expanding a feed cost survey nationally. The House report directs NASS to restart surveys for pecans, while the Senate report focuses on chemical use, integrated pest management, and organic production surveys. ERS provides economic and social science analysis on agriculture, rural development, food, commodity markets, and the environment. The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) received a $86.8 million appropriation for FY2017, a $1.4 million increase from FY2016. The increase is intended to support research on groundwater modeling, drought resilience, and organic data analysis. Additionally, three agencies - APHIS, AMS, and GIPSA - carry out USDA's marketing and regulatory programs mission area. APHIS focuses on protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases, while AMS and GIPSA play roles in agricultural marketing and inspection. APHIS is responsible for addressing animal and plant health issues, managing agricultural trade standards, and overseeing various programs such as the Animal Welfare Act and Wildlife Services Program. The FY2017 budget for APHIS is $946.2 million, with an additional $3.2 million allocated for building and facilities. This represents a $51.8 million increase from FY2016. The FY2017 budget for APHIS is $946.2 million, with an additional $3.2 million allocated for building and facilities. This is $51.8 million more than FY2016. The bill provides $55.3 million for avian health and an increase of $400,000 for animal research oversight. A provision prohibits funding for Class B dealers selling dogs and cats for research. An additional $5.5 million is allocated for citrus greening, and audits for international animal health status are required. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers programs for marketing U.S. agricultural products domestically and internationally. AMS receives discretionary appropriations for marketing activities and mandatory spending for supporting agricultural commodities not covered by other programs. User fees also support AMS operations. For FY2017, the enacted appropriation provides $86.2 million for AMS salaries and expenses, including $1.2 million for payments to states for marketing activities. The legislation places a $61.2 million limit on user fees for grading cotton and tobacco. AMS discretionary funds support market news, shell egg surveillance, market protection, and transportation activities. AMS administers various programs such as the pesticide data program, National Organic Program, seed program, country-of-origin labeling program, and commodity research and promotion programs. They also monitor the agriculture transportation system, conduct market analysis, and provide grants to state marketing agencies for exploring new market opportunities. Additionally, AMS collects user fees for product quality verification programs and commodity grading. AMS administers programs for product quality verification, commodity grading, and organic certification. They expect to collect $175 million in FY2017. Congress directs USDA to consider scientific information and stakeholder comments for NOSB sunset review recommendations and to stay within parameters of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard. The National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (P.L. 114-216) is funded by a transfer from Section 32, a program created in 1935 to assist agricultural producers. Section 32 is funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts, with remaining funds used to purchase agricultural commodities for school lunch and other nutrition programs. Section 32 funds have been used for surplus removal, farm economic relief, and disaster relief. The 2008 farm bill capped the annual amount available for AMS at $1.322 billion in FY2017. Congress limited USDA's discretion to increase fruit and vegetable purchases under Section 32 through various programs. P.L. 115-31 authorizes $1.322 billion for AMS in FY2017 as per the 2008 farm bill. Section 32 funds for AMS were capped at $1.322 billion in FY2017 by the 2008 farm bill. After deductions and transfers, $886 million is available for AMS activities. Section 715 of the legislation prohibits the use of Section 32 funds for emergency disaster payments. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) oversees the marketing of U.S. grain, oilseeds, livestock, poultry, meat, and other commodities. GIPSA received $43.5 million for salaries and expenses in FY2017, with authorization to collect up to $55 million in user fees for inspection services. The Packers and Stockyards Program monitors livestock and poultry markets for fair competition and to prevent deceptive trade practices. The enacted appropriation for FY2012 to FY2015 did not include provisions regarding the GIPSA rule or Farmer Fair Practices Rules. USDA reissued parts of the original rule in three separate rules in response to the lack of provisions in the FY2016 appropriations act. The Trump Administration delayed the implementation of these rules in January 2017. The Trump Administration delayed the effective dates of the Farmers Fair Practices Rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The USDA extended comment periods and postponed the interim final rule's effective date to October 19, 2017. The FSIS ensures the safety and labeling of meat, poultry, and egg products through continuous inspections at federal plants. The Egg Products Inspection Program also guarantees the safety of liquid, frozen, and dried egg products. The Egg Products Inspection Program ensures the safety and labeling of liquid, frozen, and dried egg products. FSIS inspects U.S. imports of meat, poultry, and egg products to ensure they meet U.S. standards. The FY2017 appropriations act provides FSIS with $1.03 billion, divided between federal inspection, state inspection, international inspection, Codex Alimentarius, and the Public Health Data Communications Infrastructure System. The appropriation also authorizes FSIS to collect laboratory accreditation fees and mandates a minimum of 148 full-time equivalents for enforcing the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The FY2017 appropriations act provides FSIS with $1.03 billion for the enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and catfish inspection. Congress directs FSIS to re-inspect imported catfish and complete equivalency determinations for foreign countries exporting catfish to the United States within 180 days after September 1, 2017. Additionally, Section 762 prohibits FSIS from using funds to inspect horse slaughter facilities in FY2017. The FY2017 appropriations act prohibits FSIS from funding horse slaughter inspections and purchasing processed poultry meat from China for school lunch programs. The FY2017 appropriations act prohibits FSIS from funding horse slaughter inspections and purchasing processed poultry meat from China for school lunch programs. This provision has been included in appropriations acts since FY2015 due to concerns about China's food safety record. In 2013, FSIS determined that China's processed poultry system is equivalent to the U.S. system, allowing China to export processed poultry to the United States. In 2014, China provided FSIS with a list of processing plants eligible to export processed poultry. FSIS is writing a proposed rule to allow China to export processed poultry to the United States if their slaughter system is deemed equivalent. FSA administers farm subsidy programs and disaster assistance, as well as farm loan and conservation programs. For FY2017, the enacted appropriation provides $1.513 billion to FSA for salaries and expenses, with increases allocated for security at county offices, youth-serving organizations, mentorship for beginning farmers, and training for veteran farmers. The appropriation also includes funding for information technology implementation. The FY2017 appropriation for FSA includes funding for IT implementation, with strong requirements to address concerns about the MIDAS plan. GAO and USDA OIG have noted management and schedule problems. The appropriation prohibits office closures and staff reductions. The FY2017 appropriation for FSA includes funding for IT implementation and addresses concerns about the MIDAS plan. It prohibits office closures and staff reductions, with recent one-year moratoriums surpassing a permanent provision in statute from the 2008 farm bill regarding FSA office closures. The FY2017 appropriation for FSA provides $90 million in loan subsidy to support $8.0 billion in loans for farmers. Loan subsidy covers the federal cost of direct and guaranteed loans, including interest rate subsidies and projected loan losses. The appropriation exceeds the Administration's request and House and Senate proposals due to higher demand for farm loans. The FY2017 appropriation provides $90 million in loan subsidy to support $8.0 billion of loan authority, increasing 29% over FY2016. The farm loan program has grown post-2008 financial crisis to meet farmers' borrowing needs, with recent appropriations sustaining and increasing loan authorities. Low default rates and interest rates have allowed for this growth at lower budgetary costs. In FY2016, USDA used supplemental authority to increase guaranteed farm ownership program loan authority by $500 million to $2.5 billion. The FY2017 appropriation increases the loan authority for farm ownership and operating programs, with the guaranteed farm ownership program loan authority raised by $500 million to $2.5 billion. Additionally, the direct farm operating loan program sees an increase to $1.53 billion (+22%) and the guaranteed farm operating loan program to $1.96 billion (+41%). Administrative expenses in the loan program are also funded. The enacted appropriation increases funding for administrative expenses in the loan program by $2.2 million to support service to veteran farmers. Veteran farmers would benefit from waived loan fees. The CCC funds most agriculture-related mandatory spending programs in the 2014 farm bill. This includes farm subsidy, disaster payments, conservation, trade, food aid, research, rural development, and bioenergy programs. Supplemental spending from the CCC has been used for farm disaster payments, market loss payments, and disease eradication efforts. The CCC is a government corporation that borrows money from the U.S. Treasury to fund agriculture programs. Mandatory outlays for commodity programs fluctuate based on market conditions. The CCC uses a Treasury line of credit due to difficulty in estimating funding needs. The CCC uses a Treasury line of credit for mandatory programs, with appropriations not always reflecting current outlays. The FY2017 appropriation is $21.291 billion, triple the amount in FY2016, to replenish CCC's borrowing authority. This increase follows market conditions, not a spending raise by Congress. The enacted appropriation for FY2017 does not involve Congress raising spending but follows market conditions. It includes a pilot program (Section 772) under the 2014 farm bill to address concerns about the equity of ARC county-level payments. The pilot allows USDA state offices to use alternative calculations for the 2016 crop year if discrepancies are found among adjacent counties, with a $5 million appropriation for this purpose. The enacted appropriation for FY2017 includes a $5 million pilot program under the 2014 farm bill to address ARC county-level payment equity concerns. The Secretary can choose participating states for the program, which aims to adjust the farm bill without reopening it. No changes were made to add cottonseed as an eligible oilseed for the farm commodity program. USDA previously stated it lacked the authority to make this declaration administratively. The joint explanatory statement directs the Secretary to issue a report within 60 days outlining administrative options and recommending legislative action. The House-reported and Senate-reported bills maintain a provision prohibiting the use of CCC funds for emergency disaster payments to farmers. Additionally, neither bill includes a provision from FY2011. The House and Senate bills no longer prevent USDA from providing marketing assistance loans for mohair. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers, with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. Funding for the program comes from discretionary funding for RMA salaries and expenses, and mandatory funding for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund. The enacted FY2017 appropriation for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund (FCIC) remains at $74.8 million for discretionary salaries and expenses of the Risk Management Agency (RMA). Congress did not approve the Administration's request for $20 million of mandatory funding from the crop insurance fund. The mandatory appropriation to the FCIC is estimated at $8.667 billion, an increase of about $800 million from FY2016, but the actual amount needed depends on crop losses and farmer participation rates. The enacted FY2017 appropriation for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund remains at $74.8 million for discretionary salaries and expenses of the Risk Management Agency. The distinction between \"livestock\" and \"livestock products\" supports the development of new insurance products. The authorizing statute only mentions livestock, hindering the availability of policies for products like milk. The act encourages the Risk Management Agency to develop additional policies for milk to provide dairy farmers with more risk management options. The USDA offers programs to help producers recover from natural disasters, with most programs receiving mandatory funding and not requiring annual appropriations. However, agricultural land rehabilitation programs receive discretionary funding on an ad hoc basis. In FY2017, emergency funding was provided for two USDA land rehabilitation programs without being directed to a specific disaster or region. In FY2017, emergency funding of $28.7 million was provided for USDA land rehabilitation programs, not limited to declared disasters. Funding does not require a Stafford Act declaration for assistance, allowing for support in non-Stafford Act emergencies. The USDA provides various programs to assist private landowners with natural resource concerns, including working land programs, land retirement, easement programs, watershed programs, and technical assistance. The two main agricultural conservation agencies are NRCS and FSA, with most funding coming from mandatory CCC funds. Discretionary conservation programs are funded through annual appropriations, with NRCS administering all discretionary programs. The largest program administered by NRCS is Conservation Operations (CO), funded at $864 million in the enacted FY2017 appropriation. This funding also includes $150 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO) to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. The Administration's FY2017 request proposed no funding for the WFPO program, citing inflexibility and a backlog of projects. Congress has directed some CO funds to WFPO activities since FY2014. The enacted FY2017 appropriation includes $12 million for the Watershed Rehabilitation program to repair aging dams. The Obama Administration proposed no funding for this program, arguing that dam maintenance is a local responsibility. The 2014 farm bill provided additional mandatory funding for conservation programs, funded by the CCC without annual appropriations. Congress has reduced funding for these programs through CHIMPS since FY2003, with $235 million in CHIMPS for FY2017. This includes $179 million from EQIP, $54 million from Watershed Rehabilitation, and $2 million from AMA. Savings from these reductions may not be used for other conservation activities. The FY2017 budget includes reductions in funding for mandatory conservation programs, with estimated sequestration and proposed CHIMPS leading to a total reduction of over $500 million. Despite an increase in funding authority for EQIP from $1.35 billion in FY2014 to $1.75 billion in FY2018, only 23% of eligible applications were funded in FY2015. Funding reductions may be contributing to the increasing number of unfunded applications. The FY2017 budget request did not include CHIMPS to EQIP for the first time in over a decade. However, the enacted FY2017 appropriation limited funding to $1.357 billion, $293 million less than the authorized level of $1.65 billion. The stagnant EQIP funding levels may be a factor in the decline of funded applications, with further funding reductions unlikely to reverse this trend. The USDA's rural development mission area is overseen by three agencies: the Rural Housing Service (RHS), the Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). The enacted FY2017 appropriation provides $2.94 billion for rural development programs, an increase of $166.2 million from FY2016. It supports $37.3 billion in loan authorization, $602.2 million more than the previous year. Salaries and expenses total $675.8 million, with $500,000 allocated for increasing access to education in STEM fields in rural communities. The enacted FY2017 appropriation provides $2.1 billion in budget authority for RHS programs, with $28.1 billion in loan authority. The largest housing loan account is the single-family housing loan program, with $25 billion for Section 502 loan guarantees. The FY2017 appropriation for RHS programs includes $1 billion for Section 502 direct loans, $67.7 million for loan subsidies, and $1.40 billion for Rental Assistance Program grants. Section 771 addresses concerns about housing units being removed from the affordable housing program as mortgages mature. The provision directs RHS to modify the pilot program initiated in 2017 to preserve affordable rental housing through nonprofit transfer or acquisition of Section 515 properties with expiring mortgages. The enacted appropriation provides $47.1 million in new budget authority for the Rural Community Facilities program to support a loan authorization level of $2.75 billion in direct and guaranteed loans, with additional funding for other programs like the Rural Community Development Initiative, Economic Impact Initiative Grants, and Tribal College grants. The enacted appropriation provides $102 million to the RBS before the Cushion of Credit rescission and transfers of salaries and expenses. If the Cushion of Credit rescission is incorporated, the net RBS budget authority provided would be -$30 million. For loan authority, the enacted appropriation provides $988 million for various RBS loan programs. The House bill would provide $26.5 million for Rural Cooperative Development Grants in FY2017, with an increase focused on Value Added Product Development grants. Overall, this includes cooperative development grants, Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas, Value-Added Product Development grants, and grants to assist minority producers. The enacted appropriation provides funding for various rural business programs, including loan subsidies and grants for Business and Industry loan guarantees, Rural Business Enterprise grants, and the Delta Regional Authority. It also includes support for the Intermediary Relending Program and the Rural Energy Savings Program. Additionally, funding is allocated for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative for the first time. The Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) was authorized in the 2014 farm bill with $1 million in Section 767. The enacted appropriation provides $673 million in budget authority for RUS, supporting $8.2 billion in loan authorization. Loan subsidies and grants under the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program account for approximately 85% of the budget authority, with $571 million allocated, $49 million more than FY2016. The bill will also support $1.25 billion in direct and guaranteed loans. The appropriation for Rural Utilities Service (RUS) includes various grant accounts such as Water/Waste Disposal grants, Direct Loan Subsidies, Solid Waste Management grants, Individual Well Water grants, Water and Waste Water revolving fund, Circuit Rider program, Technical Assistance, Grants to Colonias and Alaska and Hawaii Natives, and High Energy Cost grants. The loan levels for the electrification program remain at $6.25 billion. The budget authority for distance learning, telemedicine, and broadband account is $65.6 million, with $34.5 million allocated for rural broadband grants. The USDA's budget for FY2016 includes a loan authority increase to $27.0 million, with over two-thirds allocated to domestic food assistance programs. The largest mandatory programs are SNAP and child nutrition programs. Discretionary budget items include WIC, CSFP, and federal nutrition program administration. The FY2017 appropriation for domestic food assistance is over $108 billion, a decrease from FY2016. The FY2017 appropriation for domestic food assistance is over $108 billion, a decrease of approximately $1.7 billion from FY2016, mainly due to SNAP's declining participation. The enacted appropriation includes additional funding, rescissions, and policy changes, with the Under Secretary's office receiving approximately $0.8 million. The appropriation requires coordination of FNS research efforts with USDA's mission area and support for SNAP and nutrition assistance block grants. The enacted FY2017 appropriation for domestic food assistance is approximately $108 billion, with a decrease of $1.7 billion from FY2016 mainly due to declining SNAP participation. The appropriation includes funding for block grants to Puerto Rico and American Samoa, as well as programs like FDPIR and TEFAP. The SNAP contingency reserve fund is set at $3 billion, less than the $5 billion requested by the Administration. The enacted FY2017 appropriation for domestic food assistance is approximately $108 billion, with a decrease of $1.7 billion from FY2016 mainly due to declining SNAP participation. The SNAP account includes mandatory funding for TEFAP commodities, with $297 million provided for TEFAP commodities and an additional $19 million via a general provision. Only SNAP-authorized retailers may accept SNAP benefits, with changes to retailer requirements for authorization implemented in a final rule published by FNS on December 15, 2016. The final rule for the farm bill includes changes to staple food definitions, limitations on hot food sales, and stocking unit requirements. An appropriation policy provision requires USDA to redefine \"variety\" and implement acceptable varieties until regulatory amendments are made. Implementation of the final rule has been delayed by P.L. 115-31. SNAP households under simplified reporting do not need to report when moving out of state. The FY2017 budget proposed amending SNAP's law to require households to report moving out of state. An enacted provision now mandates SNAP households to report this annually. Child nutrition account appropriations fund various programs like the National School Lunch Program and Summer Food Service Program. The enacted appropriation of approximately $22.8 billion for child nutrition programs includes expenses for procurement of commodities, state-federal reviews, \"Team Nutrition\" initiatives, and support activities. This reflects a transfer of over $9.5 billion from the Section 32 account and an increase of $650 million from FY2016. The appropriation also funds certain child nutrition discretionary grants, including School Meals. The law provides funding for child nutrition discretionary grants, including School Meals Equipment Grants and Summer EBT Demonstration Projects. The funding levels for these projects in FY2017 are $25 million and $23 million respectively, with a request to make Summer EBT permanent and nationwide. The Child Nutrition Reauthorization and WIC are currently up for reauthorization. Provisions of the operating law expired in FY2015, but funding continued through FY2017. The appropriations law extends through September 30, 2017, with provisions for an Information Clearinghouse and food safety audits. Legislative activity is discussed in CRS Report R44373. School Meals Nutrition Standards were updated under the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of 2010. The enacted appropriation extends whole grain exemptions and limits enforcement of sodium limits to Target 1 levels. A new provision allows states to grant special exemptions for flavored, low-fat milk. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue plans to amend nutrition standards regulations related to whole grain, sodium, and dairy, similar to FY2017 appropriations. A policy provision prevents processed poultry from China from being included in various meal programs. The enacted appropriation for the WIC program in the late 1990s provides $6.35 billion, with set-asides for breastfeeding peer counselors and infrastructure. It also rescinds $850 million in prior-year WIC funds due to decreasing participation since FY2010. The committee's report from April 26, 2016, indicated that USDA estimates recovery and carryover funds to exceed $600 million, with a sufficient WIC contingency reserve fund. The National WIC Association believes FY2017 funding will be adequate despite a rescission. The Commodity Assistance Program budget supports various programs, including CSFP, TEFAP, FMNP, and Pacific Island assistance. The enacted appropriation allocates over $315 million for this account, primarily for CSFP. The FY2017 budget includes an increase of approximately $19 million compared to FY2016, with most of the increase going towards CSFP (+$14 million). TEFAP administrative costs are also increased by $5 million. States can convert up to 10% of their TEFAP entitlement commodity funding for administrative and distribution costs. WIC FMNP funding remains at the FY2016 level. The budget account funds federal administration of USDA domestic food assistance programs, special projects, and the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. The enacted appropriation provides nearly $171 million for this account. The enacted appropriation provides nearly $171 million for the account, with $17.7 million set aside for relocation and related expenses. $1 million is allocated for an independent study on consolidating reporting requirements under child nutrition programs. $2 million is designated for fellowship programs administered by the Congressional Hunger Center. Additionally, USDA provides commodity foods to child nutrition programs using funds from \"Section 32,\" with $480 million out of $1.1 billion in commodity support in FY2008 coming from outside the Child Nutrition account. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program for selected elementary schools is funded with permanent, mandatory funding from Section 32. The enacted appropriation delays the availability of a portion of funds until October 2017, allocating total annual spending by fiscal year. The Food Service Management Institute, providing technical assistance to child nutrition providers, is funded through a permanent source. The Food Service Management Institute receives $4 million in permanent annual funding for technical assistance to child nutrition providers. The Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition program gets nearly $21 million in mandatory funding each year outside the regular appropriations process. The Foreign Agricultural Service administers market promotion and export credit guarantee programs to enhance U.S. agriculture's global competitiveness. They also share responsibility with USAID for international food aid programs. FAS receives almost $2 billion in discretionary funding annually, making up over three-quarters of their financial resources. Additional budget authority for agricultural export and food aid programs comes from mandatory spending, totaling around $500 million. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) receives $196.6 million for salaries and expenses in FY2017, an increase of $5 million from FY2016. An additional $8.5 million is requested for export credit guarantee programs. The FAS addresses trade policy issues for U.S. agricultural exporters and engages in trade promotion and food security activities in developing countries. The FY2017 appropriation fully funds the $8.5 million request for export credit guarantee programs, which are the largest FAS export assistance program. Credit guarantees operate to facilitate the direct export of U.S. agricultural commodities and products without budgetary outlays unless a default occurs. The 2014 farm bill authorized $5.5 billion of credit guarantees each year, with the Administration proposing $5 billion under GSM-102 and $500 million under the Facility Guarantee Program for FY2017 to enhance agricultural exports and build facilities in emerging markets. The FY2017 appropriation fully funds the $8.5 million request for export credit guarantee programs to enhance agricultural exports and build facilities in emerging markets. Both House and Senate appropriators required the Secretary of Agriculture to outline a plan for reorganizing international trade functions at USDA, including the establishment of the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Affairs. This directive follows a similar one in the FY2016 appropriation act and stems from the 2014 farm bill mandate. The reorganization plan for international trade functions at USDA includes funding for the Borlaug Fellows Program and the Cochran Fellowship Program. The enacted appropriation provides $901,000 for the office, with $2.65 million allocated to the Borlaug Fellows Program and $5.3 million for the Cochran Fellowship Program. The funds for the Borlaug program will remain available until expended, but there is no mention of the availability of funds for the Cochran program. The Senate committee expects FAS to fund the Foreign Agricultural Service programs. The Senate committee report expects FAS to fund the Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program and maintain full mandatory funding for the Market Access Program. The Food for Peace Program includes four areas: economic assistance and food security, emergency and private assistance programs, food for development, and the farmer-to-farmer program. No funding has been requested for Title I or Title III activities since 2002, with the last concessional commodity shipment under Title I occurring in 2006. Title V funding is mandatory and linked to the overall funding pool under the Food for Peace Act. The Food for Peace Act mandates that a minimum of $15 million or 0.6% of funds available be allocated to the Farmer-to-Farmer program, which is distinct from the Title II program that provides in-kind donations of U.S. commodities for humanitarian needs. Title II funding has been a point of contention between Administrations and Congress regarding the use of funds for cash transfers or local procurement. The Food for Peace Act mandates a minimum of $15 million or 0.6% of funds for the Farmer-to-Farmer program. Title II funding allocations are affected by a provision in the 2014 farm bill. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposed $1.35 billion in Title II funding, with 25% available for cash-based food assistance for emergencies. The enacted FY2017 appropriation provides $1.466 billion of base funding, plus a $134 million supplement for ongoing famine crises. The FY2017 appropriation provides $1.466 billion of base funding, with a one-time supplement of $134 million for ongoing famine crises. The total appropriation of $1.6 billion does not include any in-kind purchase exemption. The act also includes a requirement for the U.S. Agency for International Development to notify Congress and the public when reducing non-emergency assistance under the Food for Peace Act. The McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program, administered by FAS, received $201.6 million in funding for FY2017. $5 million is allocated for local and regional procurement projects, where cash grants are awarded to organizations to purchase commodities from nearby markets during food crises and disasters. The Local and Regional Procurement (LRP) program, authorized under the 2014 farm bill, had its funding become discretionary under the 2008 farm bill. No discretionary funding was enacted for LRP during FY2014 and FY2015, but Congress appropriated $5 million for LRP in both FY2016 and FY2017 sourced from the McGovern-Dole program funding. The Obama Administration had proposed additional funding for LRP in FY2016 and FY2017. Industrial hemp, a variety of Cannabis sativa, is cultivated for various goods including foods, cosmetics, fabrics, paper, and more. Industrial hemp, a variety of Cannabis sativa, is subject to U.S. drug laws but can be grown by research institutions and state departments of agriculture under the 2014 farm bill. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation allows for the production of industrial hemp in accordance with the farm bill provision. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation allows for the production of industrial hemp in accordance with the farm bill provision. The Senate committee report urges USDA to clarify the Agency's authority to award Federal funds to research projects compliant with the Agricultural Act of 2014. Members of Congress previously requested clarification on research funds for industrial hemp. The CJS appropriation prohibits the use of funds in contravention of the Agricultural Act of 2014. The FY2017 Agriculture appropriation allows for industrial hemp production in line with the farm bill provision. The CJS appropriation blocks federal law enforcement from interfering with state agencies, hemp growers, and agricultural research. The Agriculture appropriations subcommittees oversee funding for related agencies like the FDA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The FDA regulates food, cosmetics, and radiation safety. The FDA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for regulating the safety of foods, cosmetics, drugs, medical devices, and tobacco products. Its budget is overseen by the Subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration. FDA's total program level includes direct appropriations and user fees set by Congress. The enacted FY2017 appropriation for the FDA includes a total program level of $4.725 billion, with $2.771 billion in direct appropriations and $1.954 billion in user fees. An additional $10 million is provided for FDA to address emerging health threats like Ebola and Zika viruses. The FDA received $20 million in the second CR (P.L. 114-254) for Zika virus response and $30 million from the 21st Century Cures Act. The FY2017 total program level for FDA is $4.725 billion, with $2.771 billion in direct appropriations and $1.954 billion in user fees. The human drugs program receives the largest portion of funding at 28% in FY2017. The FY2017 enacted appropriation provides a $10.9 million increase for medical product safety initiatives, including funding for Precision Medicine, Pediatric Device Consortium Grants, postmarket activities, and foreign high-risk inspections. The bill does not mention the $75 million in mandatory funding for the Cancer Moonshot Initiative requested by the Obama Administration. The House and Senate Appropriations committees express concerns with specific FDA funding in their joint explanatory statement. The joint explanatory statement and committee reports express concerns and provide directives to the FDA, emphasizing the agency's responsibility to handle information professionally and confidentially. Congress urges the FDA to work with them on regulating Laboratory Developed Tests and raises concerns about the agency's draft memorandum of understanding on pharmacy regulations. The FDA's draft memorandum of understanding on pharmacy compounding under FFDCA Section 503A is criticized for potentially overstepping its authority by redefining 'distribution'. A policy rider in the appropriation bill prohibits the FDA from implementing rules that would require electronic provision of drug prescribing information unless a federal law allows it. This restriction was included in both House and Senate bills due to concerns about FDA proposals to distribute prescription drugs without printed prescribing information. The FDA's appropriation bill includes provisions such as prohibiting funds for investigational new drug applications involving genetic modifications in human embryos, allocating $10 million for emerging health threats, and directing regulations for medical gases by July 15, 2017. The bill also addresses concerns about electronic labeling systems for prescription drugs. The FDA's Foods program plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and quality of the nation's food supply. Funding for the program has more than doubled in response to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The program has had to adapt to the increasing complexity of the U.S. food supply, including rising import demand and market factors. The FDA's Foods program budget accounts for roughly one-third of FDA's total appropriation, with additional funding provided for FSMA implementation, including support for the National Integrated Food Safety System and the safety of imported foods. The FY2017 agreement emphasizes the need for sufficient resources for State education and inspection programs to address the additional requirements of FSMA implementation. The Obama Administration requested a $18.4 million increase in budget authority for FY2017 to implement FSMA, supporting state capacity for food safety regulations and inspections. This includes education, technical assistance, compliance support, and oversight for farmers, as well as funding for inspections and overseas presence to ensure food imports meet U.S. standards. The former Administration requested increased funding for FSMA implementation, but the amounts provided by Congress are lower than recommended by states, industry, and consumer groups. Concerns include lack of resources for full implementation, inspections, risk analytics, and technical assistance. NASDA recommended $100 million annually, with additional funding suggested by food industry companies. Congressional appropriations are supplemented by user fees authorized under FSMA. The Obama Administration requested $193.2 million in user fees for FSMA, including new import fees and food facility fees. However, Congress has not approved any new user fees since FSMA was enacted. The House Appropriations Committee has urged the Administration to seek resources for FSMA implementation instead of additional user fees. Industry representatives are actively opposing these fees. User fees are typically established by authorizing committees, not appropriators. The enacted law includes provisions requiring FDA to take additional food safety actions, reflecting concerns about FSMA regulations. Funds cannot be used to implement certain FSMA requirements for dried spent grain byproducts used as animal feed. Concerns were also raised about FSMA regulations on cotton ginning and cottonseed for animal feed. Committees addressed issues on fish and seafood safety, labeling, disease research, and consumer fraud. The enacted law includes provisions regarding the market name of genetically engineered salmon and crab nomenclature. FDA is directed to report on the sampling of olive oil bottles for adulteration. The appropriation bill also includes policy riders on partially hydrogenated oils, sodium restrictions, and exemptions for schools from whole grain requirements. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, including futures exchanges and swaps markets. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded CFTC oversight to include swaps markets, futures industry personnel, and investor protection. Questions remain about CFTC's resources to handle these new responsibilities. The enacted appropriation for FY2017 provides $250 million for the agency's financial services. The FY2017 appropriation for the CFTC remains at $250 million, the same as in previous years. CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad criticized the lack of increase, stating it hinders oversight of derivatives markets. The Farm Credit Administration regulates the Farm Credit System. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) is the federal regulator for the Farm Credit System (FCS), funded by assessments on FCS entities. The FCA budget for FY2017 is limited to $68.6 million, set by the Agriculture appropriations bill. Agriculture appropriations acts in recent years have included over $1 billion in net offsets to reduce costs. The Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2017 included over $1.8 billion in net reductions through rescissions and scorekeeping adjustments, which helped provide more funding to regular discretionary accounts. The Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2017 included over $1.8 billion in net reductions through rescissions and scorekeeping adjustments, resulting in an official reduction in total spending. The enacted appropriation also contained $743 million in savings attributable to CHIMPS, with $380 million from programs authorized in the 2014 farm bill. These reductions affected programs such as conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and some smaller nutrition assistance programs. CHIMPS are reductions or increases in mandatory spending authority, often affecting programs authorized in laws like the 2014 farm bill. Appropriators use CHIMPS to limit mandatory spending without changing the authorizing law, resulting in permanent cancellations of budget authority through rescissions. Appropriators use CHIMPS to limit mandatory spending without changing the authorizing law, usually for one year. Limits on mandatory programs are set in appropriations bills, historically originating from Appropriations Committees. The debate over funding agriculture programs dates back to the 1930s, with mandatory funding through the CCC created to address unpredictable funding issues. The CCC was created to address unpredictable funding issues, with tension arising over funding certain activities. Rescissions can permanently cancel funds provided by previous appropriations laws, resulting in budgetary savings and allowing for more spending in appropriations bills. Unlike CHIMPS, rescissions can prevent unobligated funds. Rescissions in appropriations bills can permanently cancel unobligated funds, preventing reallocation in future appropriations. In FY2017, $854 million was rescinded from programs like WIC. The General Provisions title includes appropriations for activities not part of regular agency appropriations. The FY2017 appropriations bill includes regular agency appropriations, supplemental or disaster appropriations, and scorekeeping adjustments. It contains $206 million for disaster programs, $29 million for disaster programming, and $237 million for various accounts. Scorekeeping adjustments ensure compliance with spending limits. The FY2017 appropriations bill includes regular agency appropriations, supplemental or disaster appropriations, and scorekeeping adjustments. Negative subsidies from USDA loan programs have increased, reaching $534 million in FY2017, offsetting more of the regular appropriation. Historical trends in Agricultural appropriations from FY1997 to FY2017 are provided in an appendix. The FY2017 appropriations bill includes regular agency appropriations, supplemental or disaster appropriations, and scorekeeping adjustments. Historical trends in Agricultural appropriations from FY1997 to FY2017 are provided in an appendix, including comparisons between mandatory versus discretionary spending, nutrition spending, and agriculture appropriations relative to the federal budget, economy, and population. Budget Sequestration is also discussed as a process of automatic, across-the-board reductions triggered when spending exceeds statutory budget goals. The Budget Control Act of 2011 includes sequestration requirements for automatic spending cuts when budget goals are exceeded. Despite efforts to raise spending limits in subsequent budget acts, sequestration still applies to mandatory accounts. The sunset on sequestration has been extended multiple times to avoid cuts in discretionary spending or as a budgetary offset for other bills. Congress has extended the duration of mandatory sequestration multiple times as a budgetary offset for other bills. Sequestration was extended until FY2023, then FY2024 for military retirement benefits, and again until FY2025. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, such as nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Crop insurance is mostly exempt, while farm commodity programs have been subject to sequestration. The 2014 farm bill's first commodity program payments began in October 2015 and were subject to a 6.8% reduction for FY2016 due to budget sequestration. Budget sequestration has been ordered on non-exempt, non-defense discretionary accounts once in FY2013 and on mandatory accounts annually from FY2013 to FY2017."
