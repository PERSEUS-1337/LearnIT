    "content": "The Employee Health Benefits Disclosure Act of 2000 requires employers to notify employees of the cost of providing health coverage. The Employee Health Benefits Disclosure Act of 2000 mandates large employers to inform employees about the employer health plan contribution for the coverage provided. This contribution is defined as the cost of the employer-provided coverage under any health plan, or alternatively, as the applicable premium reduced by the employee's share of the premium. The term \"employee's share\" refers to the cost paid by similarly situated beneficiaries towards the applicable premium for an employee. Each notice under this section must include a statement informing employees that the employer health plan contribution is part of their total compensation, reducing cash wages and other compensation. Employers with 100 or more employees on business days in the previous year are subject to certain regulations. If an employer was not in existence the previous year, the average number of employees expected for the current year is considered. Special rules apply for controlled groups. In the context of regulations for employers with 100 or more employees, controlled groups are treated as a single employer. The term \"employee\" includes former employees and beneficiaries of deceased employees. Notice required under this section can be given through various means. Large employers must provide timely notice to employees about health plan contributions or face a $50 penalty per failure. Notices must be provided by January 31 of the following year to be considered timely. The Secretary of the Treasury has administrative authority in this matter. The Secretary of the Treasury or delegate will create regulations and oversee compliance with this section. The Act will apply to calendar years after 2004."
