    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coastal Zone Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2003\". The findings, purposes, and objectives are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds an increasing need for renewable energy production in US waters, with over 50 proposals for wind farms in State and Federal waters. Existing laws do not address unique issues raised by these proposals. The Act aims to promote the development of renewable energy facilities in the marine environment by establishing licensing and permitting processes. Federal and State policies are needed to address public trust issues and ensure timely development of accessible marine renewable energy resources. The Act directs the Secretary of Commerce to use NOAA's expertise to develop new Federal rules for renewable energy development in the marine environment, ensuring public safety, protection of the environment, conservation of resources, and access to fishing areas. The Act aims to promote renewable energy development in waters under US jurisdiction, encourage coastal states to amend their plans to address issues related to energy facilities, resource allocation, and environmental impacts. The Act aims to promote renewable energy development in US waters and encourage coastal states to address issues related to energy facilities, resource allocation, and environmental impacts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS; EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act defines terms related to renewable energy facilities, including the definition of a renewable energy facility as equipment used in the development, production, and transportation of renewable energy resources. The Act defines a renewable energy facility as equipment used in the development, production, or assembly of renewable energy resources, which are regenerative sources like solar, thermal, and wind energy. It also includes the definition of a wind energy facility as equipment that converts wind kinetic energy into electricity. The amendments made to the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 by this Act shall be effective on the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 101. COASTAL ZONE ENHANCEMENT OBJECTIVES. Section 309 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to include procedures and policies for locating renewable energy facilities in the marine environment, prioritizing locations, ensuring access to fishing areas, and conducting environmental reviews for potential impacts on marine mammals, endangered species, birds, and their habitats. The amended Section 309 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 includes evaluating impacts on marine mammals, endangered species, birds, the marine environment, aesthetic values, and cumulative impacts of multiple renewable energy facilities. It also addresses navigational and public safety concerns, decommissioning funds, energy need assessment, and continued access to traditional recreational boating areas. The amended Section 309 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 evaluates impacts on marine life, aesthetics, and cumulative effects of renewable energy facilities. It also considers national security interests and gives special consideration to proposals in states with pending renewable energy projects. TITLE II--FEDERAL MARINE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROGRAM\n\nSEC. 201. LICENSE FOR THE OPERATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FACILITIES IN WATERS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES SEAWARD OF THE COASTAL ZONE. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to include a new section on renewable energy facilities. No person can build or operate a renewable energy facility in US waters without a license. To apply for a license, the applicant must submit a letter of intent with details about the facility, location, timeframe, and ownership. The Secretary will publish requirements for a license application for a renewable energy facility within 30 days of receiving a letter of intent. Proposals must be submitted within 60 days of the notice in the Federal Register. Energy production, economic impact, and environmental effects will be considered in evaluating applications. The Secretary will evaluate license applications for renewable energy facilities based on national security needs, navigation concerns, state management programs, and fishing access. The Secretary will evaluate license applications for renewable energy facilities based on various criteria, including ensuring no adverse impact on marine environment, aviation safety, and cultural/historical resources. The Secretary evaluates license applications for renewable energy facilities based on criteria such as minimizing adverse impacts on the marine environment, ensuring electricity need, location outside protected areas, payment of required fees, and serving the public interest. License terms and conditions are prescribed to comply with relevant laws. The Secretary evaluates license applications for renewable energy facilities based on criteria such as minimizing adverse impacts on the marine environment, ensuring electricity need, location outside protected areas, payment of required fees, and serving the public interest. Licenses issued under this Act must comply with prescribed conditions and cannot be sold, transferred, or changed without Secretary's approval. Bonding requirements are established to ensure proper disposal of components upon license revocation or transfer. The Secretary evaluates license applications for renewable energy facilities based on criteria such as minimizing adverse impacts on the marine environment, ensuring electricity need, location outside protected areas, payment of required fees, and serving the public interest. Licenses issued under this Act must comply with prescribed conditions and cannot be sold, transferred, or changed without Secretary's approval. Bonding requirements are established to ensure proper disposal of components upon license revocation or transfer. The licensee will dispose of or remove all components of the renewable energy facility as directed by the Secretary, with waivers possible for submerged components not posing a threat to the environment or impeding navigation, fishing, or seabed use. Public notice, comment, and hearings are required before issuing a license, and an application fee is necessary for acceptance. The Secretary establishes an application fee to cover administrative expenses and an annual royalty fee for electricity production under a license. The royalty fee aims to recoup the market value of the site for renewable energy use, considering various factors. The fee may be set below market value at the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary can set royalty fees below market value to encourage small-scale developers, reduce environmental impacts, or promote renewable energy facilities in priority areas. Any fees collected will be deposited in the Coastal Zone Management Fund. The Secretary has the authority to terminate or limit licenses without compensation if necessary to further the purposes of the Act. SEC. 202. PRIORITY SITE IDENTIFICATION AND EVALUATION. To accelerate the development of renewable energy facilities in marine waters, the Secretary will identify and evaluate locations with the greatest potential for producing energy. Consultation with various agencies and experts will be conducted in this process. The Secretary will consult with the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Approval for a renewable energy facility outside designated sites requires meeting specific criteria. SEC. 203. REGULATIONS AND OTHER LAWS. The Secretary will promulgate necessary regulations within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Act does not affect the jurisdiction of any Federal or State agency under other laws."
