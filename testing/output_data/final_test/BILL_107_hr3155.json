    "content": "The Act titled \"Depleted Uranium Munitions Suspension and Study Act of 2001\" includes provisions for the suspension of the use, sale, and export of depleted uranium munitions. It also mandates investigations into plutonium contamination, studies on the health effects of depleted uranium, and environmental contamination by depleted uranium. Additionally, it outlines requirements for environmental mitigation and cleanup. Congress finds that the health and safety of military personnel are of utmost importance. Depleted uranium munitions used in past conflicts burn upon impact, creating inhalable aerosol particles. Significant amounts of depleted uranium were used in the Gulf War and conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Depleted uranium munitions have been used in Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro. The United States and the United Kingdom have provided or used depleted uranium munitions in past conflicts. Claims of health effects from depleted uranium have been made by the Yugoslav and Iraqi Governments, but no definitive cause has been established for illnesses affecting veterans. Depleted uranium munitions have been used in various conflicts, with concerns raised about their health effects on servicemembers and veterans. Multiple nations, including the US, UK, and Canada, are phasing out the use of depleted uranium munitions. The Federal Aviation Administration advises caution when handling depleted uranium in crash investigations due to its potential toxic effects if inhaled or ingested. The 1949 Geneva Convention and 1977 Protocol prohibit causing unnecessary harm to civilians, as depleted uranium can be chemically toxic and irradiate internal tissues. The Department of Defense has confirmed contamination of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements, including plutonium, a highly toxic and carcinogenic material with a long half-life. The purposes of the 1949 Geneva Convention and 1977 Protocol are to prohibit causing unnecessary harm to civilians due to the chemical toxicity and radiation risks of depleted uranium munitions. The Act aims to eliminate health threats from depleted uranium munitions for military personnel, civilian employees, NATO members, and civilian populations in affected regions. It also includes studies on contamination levels, health effects, and environmental impact of depleted uranium munitions. The Act aims to address environmental contamination from depleted uranium at sites of use, development, testing, and production. It requires the EPA to issue regulations for cleanup and mitigation based on studies. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF USE OF DEPLETED URANIUM MUNITIONS. The Secretary of Defense must direct the Department of Defense to suspend the use of depleted uranium munitions within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. This suspension will continue until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that using depleted uranium munitions in future conflicts will not harm military personnel or civilian populations. Future Use Limited to Stocks Free of Transuranic Matter: The Secretary of Defense must limit the use of depleted uranium munitions to stocks certified to be free of plutonium and other transuranic matter. The sale and export of depleted uranium munitions are suspended. Upon enactment of this Act, all government entities responsible for approving foreign sales of munitions must suspend approval for munitions containing depleted uranium. This suspension will last until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that future exports will only come from stocks free of transuranic matter. Upon enactment of this Act, government entities must suspend approval for munitions containing depleted uranium until the Secretary of Defense certifies it is free of plutonium and other transuranic matter. SEC. 6. COMPTROLLER GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF PLUTONIUM CONTAMINATION. The Comptroller General of the United States will investigate the contamination of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements, including plutonium, neptunium, and americium. This investigation will determine when and where the contamination occurred, the quantity of contaminated material, and identify those responsible for monitoring production quality. The investigation by the Comptroller General will focus on the quality of depleted uranium munitions production, the timing of contamination notification to NATO-member nations, and whether any laws or treaties were violated. Upon completion, a report will be submitted to the specified committee. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the health effects of depleted uranium. The Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct a study on the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions on uranium-exposed veterans and their children. This includes veterans who handled depleted uranium munitions or were exposed to smoke from fires involving depleted uranium. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will conduct a public health assessment on individuals with potential exposure to depleted uranium at military installations or production facilities. This includes those who were near depleted uranium fires, structures struck by depleted uranium munitions, or provided medical treatment to affected individuals. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will conduct a public health assessment on individuals with potential exposure to depleted uranium at military installations or production facilities. The Directors will submit a report to Congress on the results of the study and assessment, including a list of diseases or conditions found in the specified populations and their occurrence rates compared to the general population. EPA will conduct studies on environmental contamination by depleted uranium. The Secretary of Defense will provide a list of locations in the United States where depleted uranium munitions have been used or produced to the EPA. The EPA will then conduct environmental studies on each site to assess contamination of soil, air, water, and vegetation by depleted uranium. A report on the findings will be submitted to the Secretary of Defense and relevant congressional committees within two years. The House of Representatives and Senate committees will receive a report on the extent of depleted uranium contamination at studied sites, along with site-specific cleanup recommendations and general recommendations for cleanup on foreign lands. SEC. 9. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS. The Department of Defense must develop a cleanup plan for each site within a year of receiving a report, submit it to relevant committees, and start mitigation and cleanup activities as per the plan. Annual reports must be submitted until the projects are completed. The Department of Defense must follow the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's recommendations for mitigation and cleanup, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
