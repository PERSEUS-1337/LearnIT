    "content": "The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 2005\" establishes Individual Investment Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 2005\" allows individuals to deduct cash contributions to individual investment accounts established for their benefit. An individual investment account is a trust in the U.S. exclusively for an individual's benefit, with specific requirements for contributions and trustee qualifications. The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 2005\" allows individuals to deduct cash contributions to individual investment accounts established for their benefit. Contributions must be made by the last day of the taxable year. Trust assets cannot be invested in collectibles and must not be commingled with other property. Distributions from the trust have specific tax treatment. The \"Individual Investment Account Act of 2005\" allows deductions for cash contributions to individual investment accounts. Distributions are included in gross income unless part of a qualified first-time homebuyer distribution, limited to $15,000. The basis of a principal residence is reduced by any qualified first-time homebuyer distribution. The transfer of an individual's interest in an investment account to a former spouse in a divorce is not considered a taxable transfer. For tax purposes, an individual investment account is exempt from taxation unless the account engages in prohibited transactions. If such transactions occur, the account may lose its tax-exempt status and be subject to taxes imposed by section 511. If an individual investment account engages in prohibited transactions under section 4975, it will lose its tax-exempt status and be treated as distributing all its assets on the first day of the taxable year. Additionally, pledging the account as security during the year can have implications for the account holder. If an individual investment account is used as security for a loan, the portion used is treated as distributed to the account holder. Rollover contributions are allowed if the amount is paid into another account within 60 days. Cost-of-living adjustments increase the $15,000 limit in subsequent years. The dollar amount in subsection (c)(2)(B) increases annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the increased amount is not a multiple of $10, it is rounded to the nearest multiple. Custodial accounts are treated as trusts if held by a bank or another entity meeting specific criteria. The trustee of an individual investment account must report to the Secretary and the account holder on contributions, distributions, and other relevant matters as required by regulations. The custodian of a custodial account treated as a trust is considered the trustee for title purposes. Individual investment accounts are exempt from estate tax under new regulations. Deductions for contributions to these accounts are allowed in arriving at adjusted gross income. The trustee must report on contributions and distributions to the Secretary and account holder as required. Individual investment accounts are excluded from estate tax. Section 1014 does not apply to these accounts. A new section allows for the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence if reinvested in an individual investment account. The tax code allows for the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence if owned and used by the taxpayer for 2 years. The excluded gain cannot exceed the amount paid into an individual investment account within a year of the sale. Ownership and use rules similar to section 121(d) apply. The tax code is amended to exempt individuals with individual investment accounts from certain taxes on transactions concerning the account. The tax code is amended to exempt individuals with individual investment accounts from certain taxes on transactions concerning the account, including failure to provide reports and adjustment of basis for acquired residences.
