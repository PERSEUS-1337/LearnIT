    "content": "The Bureau of Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior, manages dams and water projects in the western states, providing water to farmland and millions of people. They are the largest water supplier in the West and second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Operations can be controversial due to impacts on fish, wildlife, and conflicts among water users. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California is a multipurpose federal water-conveyance system managed by the Bureau of Reclamation. It consists of 20 dams, 11 power plants, and 500 miles of canals, delivering water to farms, municipal users, wildlife refuges, and other fish and wildlife needs. The State Water Project (SWP) in California delivers water primarily to urban users. The State Water Project (SWP) in California delivers about 70% of its water to urban users in the South Bay, Central Valley, and Southern California, with the remaining 30% used for irrigation. Water deliveries from the CVP and SWP are complicated by a complex system of state water rights and prior agreements with water rights holders. Recent drought conditions in California have impacted water supply, but improvements were seen in 2016-2017 due to rain and snowstorms in Northern and Central California. Improved water supply conditions in Northern and Central California in the winter of 2016-2017 led to significant improvements in the state's drought situation by July 2017. Only 1% of the state was classified as suffering from severe drought conditions, a drastic improvement from previous years. Debate continues regarding federal water supply-related authorities and environmental protections, with some arguing for temporary rollbacks during droughts while others advocate for broader reforms. The drought in California highlighted the need for expedited construction of new surface water storage. The coordinated operation of the CVP and SWP is crucial for addressing water shortages. Recent delivery cutbacks have been debated, with factors including drought and environmental restrictions being considered. Recent deliveries to CVP and SWP contractors are shown in Figure 2. Legislation addressing drought in California, including the WIIN Act, has provisions related to Reclamation and CVP operations. H.R. 23, the GROW Act, consolidates multiple proposals from the 115th Congress. Some provisions are set to sunset after five years. The GROW Act, also known as H.R. 23, includes provisions specific to California such as directives for the operation of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and amendments to related acts. It also covers West-wide changes related to water supply development on federal lands and restrictions on federal water rights. Supporters believe these changes will increase water availability for users. The GROW Act, H.R. 23, aims to provide more water to users while safeguarding state water rights. Opponents fear it may roll back environmental protections and harm species and habitats. Some provisions may be controversial, including those preempting state law and altering CVP operations. Congress must weigh the trade-offs in proposed changes. The report focuses on key provisions of H.R. 23, introduced on January 3, 2017, which includes water-related provisions for the CVP and Reclamation policy. Titles I-IV are specific to California, while Titles V-VII have a West-wide application. The bill combines sections from previous congresses, with similarities to H.R. 3964 from the 113th Congress. Title I of H.R. 23 proposes changes to the management of the federal CVP, including amendments to CVPIA to broaden the purposes for which water can be used. There is potential overlap with provisions in the WIIN Act, raising questions on how the two pieces of legislation would be reconciled if H.R. 23 is enacted. Title I of H.R. 23 proposes changes to the management of the federal CVP, including amendments to CVPIA to broaden the purposes for which water can be used. The proposed changes include removing the directive to modify CVP operations to protect fish and wildlife, broadening the purposes for which CVPRF monies can be used, reducing revenues to the CVPRF, and mandating the development of a plan to increase CVP water yield by October 1, 2018. Sections 101 and 102 of H.R. 23 propose amendments to the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Section 101 includes changes to CVPIA's purposes, such as adding replacement water for CVP contractors and expedited water transfers. Section 102 would limit the definition of anadromous fish to those in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers as of October 30, 1992, potentially affecting fish protection and restoration goals. Section 103 would amend limitations on water supply contracts under CVPIA, changing the renewal period from 25 to 40 years. Section 103 of H.R. 23 proposes amendments to water supply contracts under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. It would extend the renewal period from 25 to 40 years and allow for the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts. Contractors who have repaid obligations would have priority access to project water for irrigation, subject to state water rights laws. Section 104 of H.R. 23 proposes amendments to water transfers in the Central Valley Project. It aims to provide long-term certainty for water service contractors and repeal certain authorities for fish and wildlife restoration charges. Contractors would only be charged for water actually delivered, and the Secretary would be directed to facilitate and expedite water transfers in the CVP. Section 104 of H.R. 23 proposes amendments to water transfers in the Central Valley Project, including a provision for determining proposal completeness within 45 days and prohibiting environmental mitigation requirements. It clarifies that pre-CVPIA water transfers can proceed without CVPIA requirements and specifies water use measurement up to surface water commingling. Additionally, it eliminates tiered pricing and revenue streams for fish and wildlife enhancement, reducing CVPRF revenue collections. Section 105 of H.R. 23 addresses fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration under CVPIA by making the modification of CVP operations to provide flows for fish optional, rather than required. It introduces the term \"reasonable water flows\" and specifies that any optional flows must come from the 800,000 acre-feet of water allocated for fish and wildlife purposes. This provision sets a ceiling for water use, removing the need for consultation with the California Department of. Section 105 of H.R. 23 removes the requirement for consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding modification of CVP operations for fish and wildlife, instead requiring consultation with the U.S. Geological Survey. It allows (b)(2) flows to be used for purposes other than fish protection, with fish and wildlife no longer being the primary purpose. The bill also adjusts accounting for (b)(2) water and directs that all water used under that section be credited based on a specified methodology. Additionally, it mandates the reuse of (b)(2) water. Section 105 of H.R. 23 would mandate a 25% reduction of (b)(2) water when Delta Division water supplies are forecasted to be reduced by 25% or more. Pursuit of fish and wildlife programs authorized by Section 3406 would meet the purposes of CVPIA Section 3402. Section 106(a) of H.R. 23 would remove the requirement for a specific percentage of funds in the CVPRF to be allocated for habitat restoration. It would also prohibit donations or payments for environmental restoration as a condition for water storage or conveyance. Additionally, it would eliminate the need to collect payments for mitigation costs under CVPIA Section 3407(c), while still allowing the Secretary to collect and spend payments for other activities. Section 106(d) of H.R. 23 sets a maximum limit of $4 per megawatt hour for payments to the CVPRF by CVP power contractors. It also requires completion of fish, wildlife, and habitat mitigation and restoration actions by 2020, reducing water and power contractor payments into the CVPRF. An advisory board would review and recommend CVPRF expenditures, with primarily water and power contractors as members. Section 107 of H.R. 23 grants the Secretary authority to use CVP facilities for transferring non-project water for beneficial purposes, with charges for this water not going to the CVPRF. It mandates a least-cost plan by FY2017 to increase CVP water supplies and meet all CVP purposes, including fish and wildlife needs. Implementation of the plan, including potential new water storage facilities, must begin by October 1, 2017, in coordination with California. The bill grants the Secretary authority to partner with local joint power authorities for water storage projects, but federal funds cannot be used for financing and construction. Construction of facilities is authorized as long as no federal funds are involved. Other sections of the bill address construction of these facilities in a different manner. Section 108(a) of the bill directs the operation of the CVP and SWP in accordance with the Bay-Delta Accord, which sets restrictions on water exports. The bill preempts any laws conflicting with the accord, but it is unclear how this implementation would interact with the WIIN Act. The bill directs the operation of the CVP and SWP in accordance with the Bay-Delta Accord, potentially conflicting with the WIIN Act. Section 108(b) prohibits restrictions on water rights to protect species affected by CVP or SWP operations. Section 108(c) prohibits imposing costs on CVP contractors for protecting water rights under the Public Trust Doctrine. Section 108(d) preempts state law on catch limits for non-native fish in the Bay-Delta. Section 109 mandates including hatchery fish in determining anadromous fish covered by H.R. 23 under the ESA. Section 110 recognizes compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act for water conveyance. The provision in Section 111 allows projects related to the Central Valley Project (CVP) to use compliance under the California Environmental Quality Act instead of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), potentially speeding up project approval processes. However, this could result in a less thorough assessment of environmental impacts. Section 111 of the WIIN Act allows projects under the Central Valley Project (CVP) to use California Environmental Quality Act compliance instead of NEPA, potentially expediting project approvals. It also reduces ESA-related mitigation requirements for emergency operational adjustments and extends consultation rights to SWP and CVP contractors. Section 113 of the WIIN Act proposes changes to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, potentially leading to a significant restructuring of the current plan of implementation. This could result in either repeal or modifications to the settlement agreement. Section 113 of the WIIN Act proposes amendments to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, requiring a decision on implementation within one year of enactment. If not implemented, a plan for a warm-water fishery downstream of Friant Dam would be developed. If implemented, a new framework with priority restoration projects and conditions would be established. The WIIN Act's Section 113 proposes amendments to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, ensuring mitigation actions are in place to prevent adverse impacts. It also addresses costs for fish barriers, prohibits land acquisition through eminent domain, and sets conditions for termination of the settlement authority. Limited consideration has been given to these provisions compared to other parts of Title I. The WIIN Act's Section 113 proposes amendments to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, with limited consideration given to these provisions. It is unclear how these actions would impact the settlement agreement or stakeholders' reactions. Trade-offs exist in Title I, such as limiting fish stock protections under Section 102, which may benefit some stakeholders but is opposed by others. Changes like broadening water flow usage and expanding funds for restoration under Section 105 could provide more water to users but lower conservation efforts for salmon. Section 108 of H.R. 23 directs the Secretary to operate the CVP and SWP according to principles outlined in the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord, which is no longer in effect. This provision is controversial as it could preempt state law and restrict operational protections for species, potentially altering water deliveries associated with the CVP and SWP. The proposed changes in Section 113 of H.R. 23 could impact the distribution of water deliveries from the CVP and SWP, potentially setting a negative precedent. Supporters argue that the changes are necessary to make more water available to users, while opponents believe it could preempt state law and harm the San Joaquin river fishery. Proponents of the changes argue that the current settlement has not met its goals and has negatively affected water users. The provisions in Title I of H.R. 23 raise questions about the impact on CVP water supplies for users and the environment. Key considerations include the potential weakening of environmental protections and restrictions under existing laws, such as the CVPIA, ESA, and SJRRS. Questions also arise about how these provisions align with previous legislation like the WIIN Act and future plans like the California WaterFix. Specifically, the amount of additional water available to CVP water users under H.R. 23 is a significant concern. H.R. 23 aims to increase water availability for CVP water users and export from the Delta. It also addresses reservoir releases, water availability for contractors in the Sacramento watershed, impact on listed species, water quality, and recreational activities. The bill expedites ongoing surface water storage studies authorized under CALFED, with only one study completed so far. H.R. 23 proposes deadlines for completing CALFED studies and processes for construction. It directs Reclamation to finish feasibility studies for new surface water storage projects in California and authorizes the construction of the Temperance Flat Reservoir pending a positive feasibility report. However, federal funding cannot be used for construction, requiring 100% nonfederal funding. The bill also mandates completing the study for Temperance Flat Reservoir and managing any recommended land on the San Joaquin River. The bill directs the Secretary to manage designated land on the San Joaquin River without impeding project activities. Congress may evaluate proceeding with CALFED surface water storage studies and assess H.R. 23's potential to facilitate their completion. Concerns have been raised about the studies' ability to further the goal of new water storage in California. The Obama Administration raised concerns about provisions in the WIIN Act related to water storage projects, noting dependencies on nonfederal partners and potential impacts on decision-making. It is uncertain if the Trump Administration shares these concerns or if deadlines for ongoing studies could affect completion. The WIIN Act authorized federal funding for these projects at different cost-share levels. The WIIN Act authorized federal funding for water storage projects at different cost-share levels. Section 204 of the act authorizes construction of the Temperance Flat Reservoir with 100% nonfederal financing. It is unclear how this authority would affect funding use. Title III of H.R. 23 includes provisions to protect California water rights priorities and operate the CVP in accordance with state law. Title III of H.R. 23 aims to protect California water rights priorities under state law, including area of origin protections. It stipulates that any changes reducing water supplies to the SWP and increasing supplies to the CVP must be offset, with reduced water supplies made available to the state. The Secretary of the Interior must notify California if salmon and smelt BiOps implementation under the act reduces environmental protections. Title III of H.R. 23 directs the Secretary of the Interior to adhere to California's water rights laws and honor water rights senior to those held by the United States for the Central Valley Project. It includes specific requirements for providing water to agriculture contractors in different water years. The bill, H.R. 23, includes directives for operating the Central Valley Project (CVP) in accordance with state water laws and priorities. Concerns arise regarding potential impacts on water allocations under state and federal law, particularly for junior water users. Questions remain on how these directives will align with other operational requirements in the bill. The bill H.R. 23 includes directives for operating the Central Valley Project (CVP) in accordance with state water laws and priorities. Concerns arise regarding potential impacts on water allocations under state and federal law, particularly for junior water users. Some provisions in Sections 301-304 are similar to those enacted in Section 4005 of the WIIN Act, raising questions on how these provisions would be reconciled if H.R. 23 were enacted. Previous Obama Administration officials raised concerns about the operational requirements of H.R. 23 conflicting with the multiple authorized purposes of the CVP. Title IV includes miscellaneous provisions, such as altering water supply accounting under CVPIA. Section 402 of H.R. 23 would change water supply accounting under CVPIA to include all restrictions on CVP water for environmental purposes. This would limit releases from Lewiston Dam for Trinity River fisheries, as specified in a 2000 environmental impact statement. Section 403 requires an annual report on instream flow releases from CVP and SWP for environmental benefits. Section 404 of H.R. 23 grants Klamath Project contractors consultation rights under ESA Section 7. Section 405 highlights congressional opposition to certain California State Water Resource Control Board proposals. Title V, the Water Supply Permitting Act, establishes new procedures for water storage projects in Reclamation states. H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, was passed by the House. H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, passed by the House on June 22, 2017, establishes Reclamation as the lead agency for coordinating federal approvals for new surface water storage projects on DOI and USDA lands. Provisions in Title V do not change NEPA requirements but require Reclamation to implement procedures similar to DOI and USDA. Sections 503, 504, and 505 outline responsibilities similar to those under NEPA regulations. Title V of H.R. 23 establishes a new coordination process led by Reclamation for federal approvals on DOI and USDA lands, without eliminating existing processes. Section 504 requires Reclamation to implement a new pre-application coordination process, prepare a unified environmental document, ensure timely decisions by cooperating agencies, and appoint a project manager. Title V of H.R. 23 establishes a new coordination process led by Reclamation for federal approvals on DOI and USDA lands. Section 506 allows DOI to accept funds from nonfederal project applicants to expedite permit evaluations. The title does not waive existing NEPA requirements but establishes procedures for Reclamation to complete environmental reviews. Reclamation's interpretation of the directives will determine integration with existing DOI procedures. Title V of H.R. 23 introduces new project coordination procedures under Reclamation for federal approvals on DOI and USDA lands. It includes requirements that could add steps to the project-approval process. Title VI expedites new storage projects and authorizes construction by Congress through a reporting process. It also sets a three-year completion timeline for new studies initiated by the Administration, with a cost limit of $3 million per project study. Additionally, it allows the Secretary to enter agreements with nonfederal sponsors for planning and design support. Title VI of H.R. 23 aims to expedite construction authorizations for Reclamation projects by directing an annual report proposing new projects for congressional authorization. Congress would have discretion over authorizing these projects, which could receive financial support. This process is similar to the one used for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under previous legislation. Title VI of H.R. 23, similar to legislation in the 115th Congress, applies to Reclamation surface water projects. It aims to expedite project completion by accelerating feasibility studies, reports, and environmental reviews. The provisions are modeled after processes established for Corps projects under WRRDA 2014. Section 605 of Title VI in H.R. 23 would codify existing NEPA regulations but could also introduce new provisions that impact agency practices and deadlines. Examples include shorter comment periods on draft EIS, reporting requirements for project tracking, financial penalties for agencies missing deadlines, and a statute of limitations on project study claims. Section 607 clarifies aspects of the WIIN Act related to federal projects. Title VI of H.R. 23 introduces a new reporting process to facilitate the proposal and authorization of water supply projects by Congress. It allows for a stronger nonfederal role in project implementation and provides funding support for new federal and nonfederal storage based on existing Reclamation law. The Obama Administration opposed new storage projects that perpetuated historical federal subsidies, preferring state and locally led projects. H.R. 23 may spark debate on federal vs. nonfederal financing models for new projects. The WIIN Act authorized funding for both federally led and nonfederal projects. H.R. 23 proposes authorization processes for WIIN Act projects and projects under Title VI. It includes provisions for water rights protection similar to H.R. 2939. Both bills address concerns about Forest Service requiring permittees to transfer water rights to the federal government. Title VII of H.R. 23 aims to prevent the Forest Service and DOI from requiring permittees to transfer water rights to the federal government. It also prohibits permit conditions that mandate applying for a water right in the name of the United States. Additionally, it ensures that permit conditions align with state water laws and require federal agencies to coordinate with states for consistency. This is seen as necessary to protect private property rights. Some concerns have been raised about the broad and potentially conflicting provisions in Title VII of H.R. 23, which aims to protect private property rights from federal government encroachment. Questions have been raised about how the bill's directives would be reconciled in practice and the potential for litigation and impacts on established practices. The effects on federal reserved water rights if the bill is enacted in its current form are also unclear. The bill contains conflicting directives, such as Section 705(d) which may impact federal reserved water rights. Supporters argue for clarity in asserting these rights, while concerns exist about potential impacts on DOI agencies' ability to protect water rights associated with their land reservations. The bill may impact federal reserved water rights, potentially hindering DOI agencies' ability to protect groundwater-dependent resources on federal lands. It could also complicate the settlement of future Indian Water Rights claims by limiting state-based rights for tribal water rights. Most new federal policies related to reserved water rights would need to comply with the bill's requirements, potentially leading to delays or alterations in federal actions asserting reserved water rights."
