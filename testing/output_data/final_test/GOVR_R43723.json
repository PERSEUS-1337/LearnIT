    "content": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was established in 1914 to protect consumers from anticompetitive, deceptive, or unfair business practices. The FTC also plays a key role in regulating cybersecurity and protecting sensitive consumer information from data breaches. Data breaches involve unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII), leading to potential compromise of data integrity. The FTC conducts investigations into lax data security as the number of data breaches continues to rise. The FTC conducts investigations into data breaches as they continue to rise across various sectors of the economy. Cybercriminals target businesses, retailers, government agencies, and healthcare entities to obtain personal data for fraudulent transactions. The FTC has taken enforcement actions against companies engaging in unfair practices that put consumer data at risk. The FTC's authority to regulate data security under Section 5 of the FTC Act is being challenged in pending cases involving Wyndham Worldwide Corp. and LabMD. The decisions in these cases are currently being appealed, with the Wyndham case being granted immediate appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to consider the FTC's authority in data security cases. The FTC's authority to regulate data security is being challenged in cases involving LabMD and Wyndham Worldwide Corp. LabMD's administrative action was stayed pending a congressional hearing, while LabMD has asked the Eleventh Circuit to dismiss the action. There is significant interest in these cases from various stakeholders, including Congress, businesses, and legal scholars. There is an ongoing academic debate over the scope of the FTC's authority in data security, with some arguing for specific legislation to give the FTC express authority. The FTC's enforcement has evolved over the past fifteen years, following predictable patterns of common law development. This report discusses the FTC's legal authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act regarding data security and two relevant cases. Initially, the FTC promoted industry self-regulation for consumer privacy but later took legal action against violators, citing deceptive trade practices under Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC proposed legislation to enforce specific privacy regulations in response to companies' inadequate data security practices. This shift in focus led to numerous investigations and legal actions against companies for data breaches involving sensitive personal information. The FTC's recent complaints focus on companies failing to maintain data security for consumers' sensitive personal information, leading to substantial harm. Violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act are alleged. In 2012, the FTC issued a Privacy Report outlining best practices for data collection. Companies collecting non-sensitive data from fewer than 5,000 consumers annually and not sharing it with third parties are exempt from these practices. The FTC emphasizes the importance of reasonable and appropriate data security measures for companies, taking into account the sensitivity of consumer information, business size, and available security tools. They clarify that perfect security is not required, breaches do not automatically mean a violation of the law, and data security is an ongoing risk assessment process. The Commission also offers educational resources to the industry. The FTC emphasizes the importance of reasonable data security measures for companies, providing educational materials on what constitutes \"reasonable\" data security. Companies should know and limit the consumer information they collect, protect it through risk assessments and key protections, dispose of unnecessary information, and have a plan for security incidents. The FTC does not have explicit authority to regulate data security but follows broad principles. The FTC does not have explicit authority to regulate data security but has broad authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair practices that cause substantial harm to consumers. Despite the lack of explicit authorization, the FTC and federal courts have found various acts or practices to be unfair based on established criteria. The FTC is authorized to regulate unfair practices that harm consumers, without specific definitions due to the endless nature of human inventiveness. Failure to protect consumer data is considered an unfair or deceptive act. The FTC can gather information and investigate businesses under the FTC Act. The FTC conducts data security investigations to determine if companies have adequate measures to protect consumer information. If violations are found, the FTC can take enforcement actions through administrative or judicial processes, seeking injunctive relief and consumer redress. The FTC lacks authority to issue civil penalties for data security violations but can fine companies for violating settlement orders, with fines reflecting consumer losses. Companies can settle charges by signing a consent agreement without admitting liability. The FTC can enforce data security requirements through administrative or judicial processes. Companies can settle charges by signing a consent agreement without admitting liability. If the FTC accepts the proposed consent agreement, it places the order on record for public comment. If the respondent contests the charges, an Administrative Law Judge issues an initial decision. The losing party may seek Supreme Court review. The FTC also enforces statutes that impose obligations on businesses to protect consumer data. The FTC enforces data security requirements for non-bank financial institutions under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Other laws like the FCRA and COPPA also mandate protection of consumer information. The FTC has settled 50 data security enforcement actions since 2002 and oversees the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Agreement. The FTC has settled numerous cases challenging companies' claims about consumer data security and has enforced data security requirements for non-bank financial institutions under various acts. In 2006, the FTC took action against ChoicePoint for a data breach, resulting in significant penalties. ChoicePoint agreed to pay $10 million in civil penalties and $5 million in consumer redress to settle FTC charges. The settlement required them to implement new procedures for providing consumer reports, maintain information security, and undergo audits every other year for twenty years. These measures are typical in FTC consent agreements for security failures. In 2014, the FTC pursued its 50th data security enforcement action against GMR Transcription Services for failing to implement reasonable security measures. GMR failed to implement security measures, leading to exposure of 15,000 sensitive files online. FTC's consent order mandates GMR to establish an information security program, undergo biennial evaluations, and prohibits misrepresentation of privacy practices. The settlement lasts 20 years. FTC has taken action against other companies for data security breaches. Target is also under investigation. The FTC filed suit against Wyndham Worldwide Corp. for a data breach involving customer information in 2012. The breach compromised over 619,000 payment card accounts and led to customer data being transferred to Russia. The FTC alleged that Wyndham's security failures caused substantial consumer harm. The FTC alleged that Wyndham's security practices were \"unfair and deceptive\" in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, leading to over $10.6 million in fraud losses. Wyndham contested the allegations, arguing that the FTC had exceeded its statutory authority in asserting an unfairness claim in the data security context, citing a Supreme Court ruling. The FTC alleged that Wyndham's security practices were \"unfair and deceptive\" in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Wyndham argued that the FTC lacked clear statutory authority over data security, similar to the FDA's lack of specific authority over tobacco products. Wyndham argued that the FTC lacked clear statutory authority over data security, citing previous disclaimers by the FTC and Congress's enactment of specific data security legislation. They also questioned Congress's delegation of setting data security standards to the FTC. The FTC responded by arguing that the situation was different from a previous case and pointed to the Obama Administration's cybersecurity framework as evidence that Congress did not provide the FTC with authority to regulate data security. The FTC asserted its authority in data security cases, stating that it aligns with its broad authority under the FTC Act. They argued that specific data security laws do not displace their authority but supplement it, granting additional powers. The FTC claimed they never disclaimed their authority over data security and recent decisions support their position. The FTC's authority in data security cases was affirmed in a recent decision against LabMD. A federal court denied Wyndham's motion to dismiss a case, upholding the FTC's power to regulate data security. The court's opinion focused on the FTC's legal theory of liability, clarifying that it doesn't give the FTC unlimited power to pursue every company that experiences a data breach. The district court ruled that the FTC has authority to enforce data security as an unfair trade practice under the FTC Act, distinguishing Wyndham from previous cases. Wyndham has been granted permission to appeal the ruling, with a decision from the Third Circuit pending. The FTC's authority to regulate data security breaches as unfair trade practices under the FTC Act was challenged in the Matter of LabMD case. Unlike in Wyndham, the administrative hearing resulted in an order compelling the FTC to specify the data security measures expected from the defendant company. The case began in 2013 when the FTC filed a complaint against LabMD, Inc., a Georgia medical cancer diagnostics company. The FTC filed an administrative complaint against LabMD, Inc., alleging failure to protect consumers' personal data, including medical information. LabMD argued that as a HIPAA covered entity, the FTC had no authority over its data security practices. The FTC denied LabMD's motion to dismiss, stating that the prohibition of unfair practices applies to companies' failure to implement reasonable security measures. The FTC denied LabMD's motion, asserting its authority to regulate data security practices as consistent with the FTC Act and legislative history. LabMD's argument that specific data security statutes repealed the FTC's authority was rejected. The commission found no clear intent in HIPAA or other statutes to limit its enforcement of Section 5 of the FTC Act in data security. The FTC rejected LabMD's argument that specific data security statutes limited its authority, stating that there was no clear intent in HIPAA or other statutes to restrict its enforcement of Section 5 of the FTC Act. The commission also ruled that the three-part statutory standard for determining \"unfair\" practices provided sufficient notice of prohibited conduct, despite the lack of specific regulations in the rapidly changing area of data security practices in an online environment. In a rapidly changing area, questions on data security practices in an online environment are suitable for case-by-case development in enforcement proceedings. The focus shifted to whether the FTC must disclose the data security standards used to determine if a company's efforts to protect consumer information are reasonable. LabMD accused the FTC of holding them to non-existent federal data security standards, while the FTC argued against disclosing their standards due to legal privileges. In 2014, the FTC's Chief Administrative Law Judge ruled that the agency can be compelled to disclose the data security standards used to assess a company's practices. The administrative law judge ruled that the FTC must disclose the data security standards it uses for enforcement actions. This will provide companies with more specificity on the standards driving the FTC's data breach enforcement actions. Legislation may enhance the FTC's enforcement authority by allowing them to implement data security standards and assess civil penalties. The FTC is seeking federal legislation to strengthen its authority on data security standards and require companies to notify consumers of breaches. Several bills in Congress aim to give the FTC power to impose civil penalties for non-compliance with data security standards. The FTC is pushing for legislation to enhance its authority on data security standards and breach notifications. Bills like S. 1897, S. 1976, and S. 1995 would grant the FTC the power to enforce cybersecurity regulations and impose civil penalties for violations."
