    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Syria Humanitarian Support and Democratic Transition Assistance Act of 2012\". In March 2011, peaceful demonstrations in Syria began against Bashar al-Assad's rule, leading to violent crackdowns by the regime. The Government of Syria allowed an Arab League observer group in December 2011, but it was ended in January 2012 due to escalating violence. In February 2012, the Friends of the Syrian People group met in Tunis and issued a declaration. In Tunis, a declaration was issued demanding the Syrian regime allow UN and humanitarian agencies access for a needs assessment. On March 16, 2012, Kofi Annan presented a peace plan for Syria, calling for a cessation of violence, military activity around civilian areas, inclusive political process, and timely humanitarian assistance. In March 2012, the UNHCR appealed for $84.1 million to assist Syrian refugees. Panos Moumtzis was appointed Regional Refugee Coordinator for Syria. In April 2012, the Friends of the Syrian People committed to increasing pressure on the Assad regime and providing more humanitarian relief. As of July 2012, over 20,000 people have been killed in Syria due to violence, leading to 1.5 million in need of humanitarian aid for food, water, shelter, and medical care. Basic services like healthcare and education have been disrupted, causing growing food insecurity. In July 2012, Syria faces growing food insecurity with declining wheat harvests due to drought. Aid agencies are expected to provide food aid to 850,000 Syrians, up from 500,000 the previous month. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled the country due to violence, with over 100,000 refugees registered in neighboring countries. The majority of refugees and internally displaced persons are women and children, who are vulnerable to economic and physical insecurity. In June 2012, UNHCR increased its appeal for Syrian refugees to $193,000,000, while the United Nations requested an additional $189,000,000 for humanitarian needs inside Syria. Only 20 percent of these appeals have been funded, with dire warnings of potential fatalities if more funding is not received. UNICEF also issued an urgent appeal for $20,000,000 to assist children and young people affected by the violence in Syria. UNICEF estimates needing support for 90,000 Syrian children from July to December 2012. They have received less than $6,000,000 for aid. An agreement with the Syrian regime has improved access for aid workers, but security concerns and visa refusals for workers from critical countries remain obstacles. In July 2012, Human Rights Watch reported widespread torture and mistreatment of political prisoners in Syrian detention facilities. The United States pledged $52,000,000 in humanitarian aid to Syria. Syria has a long-standing chemical weapons program with stockpiles of CW agents like mustard, sarin, and VX gases. General Martin Dempsey testified that Syria's chemical weapons arsenal is 100 times larger than Libya's. Concerns exist about rebel militias in Syria post-transition. During an international meeting on Syria in Geneva on June 30, 2012, Special Envoy Kofi Annan emphasized the need for a safe transition, stability, and disarmament of armed groups. The statement of policy is outlined in Section 3. The United States strongly condemns violence and human rights violations in Syria, supports civilians, assists with basic needs, and backs democratic political opposition groups for a transition plan. The United States supports Syrian refugees in neighboring countries, assists in disposing of weapons in Syria, and aims to establish a stable transitional government committed to democracy, human rights, and peace with neighbors.
