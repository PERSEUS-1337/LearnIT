    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Geothermal Energy Initiative Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that federal income tax credits exist for renewable energy production, excluding geothermal energy. The last national assessment of geothermal energy sites in the US was in 1978, with significant technological advancements since then. Federal land management agencies are often unaware of geothermal resources, leading to delays in land use planning. The Bureau of Land Management faces delays in geothermal resource development with a backlog of 230 lease applications, some dating back to 1974. There is a lack of focus on geothermal energy efforts, despite its environmentally safe and clean nature. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ELECTRICITY PRODUCED FROM GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes adding geothermal energy as a qualified energy resource and defining a geothermal energy facility as a qualified facility for producing electricity. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes adding geothermal energy as a qualified energy resource and defining a geothermal energy facility as a qualified facility for producing electricity. The amendment also specifies that any facility owned by the taxpayer placed in service before January 1, 2005, will only receive tax credits for incremental production. If a leased facility is operated by the lessee, the lessee will be treated as the owner for tax credit purposes. Incremental production is defined as the additional production from a geothermal facility. The production of electricity from a geothermal facility is calculated as the excess of total kilowatt hours produced over the average annual production for five of the previous seven years, excluding the highest and lowest production years. A facility in operation for seven years or more will have special rules applied. The enactment of this paragraph will gradually reduce the calculated amount each year, not exceeding 30 percent. The amendments will apply to electricity sold after December 31, 2004. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY RESOURCES. The Secretary of Energy must review and assess geothermal energy resources in the US annually, considering market conditions and technologies. A report detailing available resources, terrain, population centers, infrastructure, and cost estimates must be published within a year of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Energy must review geothermal energy resources annually, including cost estimates and barriers to transmission. Recommendations for addressing barriers and providing grid access without disadvantaging renewable energy producers are required. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2005-2007. SEC. 5. ENHANCED ACCESS TO FEDERAL LANDS FOR GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. The Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture are required to expedite geothermal energy development in revising land use plans while protecting resources. This does not affect the issuance of rights-of-way for geothermal projects before plan revisions. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with developing recommendations for Congress on changes to assist in geothermal energy development on Federal land within 24 months. This includes a 5-year plan for environmentally sound development and an analysis of using rights-of-ways versus leasing for geothermal energy projects. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with developing recommendations for Congress on changes to assist in geothermal energy development on Federal land within 24 months. This includes exploring leasing systems, grants, loans, tax credits, and addressing environmental concerns. Additionally, a list of suitable lands for geothermal energy development will be created in consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and Defense. The Secretary of the Interior is developing recommendations for Congress on geothermal energy development, including suitable lands and regulatory mechanisms. SEC. 6. CONSULTATION REGARDING GEOTHERMAL LEASING AND PERMITTING ON PUBLIC LANDS. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must create a memorandum of understanding within 6 months for geothermal development on public lands. This includes identifying geothermal areas and establishing procedures for lease applications. The Secretary concerned must review geothermal lease applications within 14 days to determine if there is sufficient information for processing. If deficiencies are found, the application will be returned with a list of issues preventing processing. The Secretary must review geothermal lease applications within 14 days for processing, identifying deficiencies if present. The lease applicant will receive written notice within 30 days regarding the application status and estimated processing time. An administrative procedure for geothermal development permits must be established, outlining authority, processing steps, and timeframes. A 5-year leasing plan for public land in the National Forest System under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 must be developed and updated regularly. Additionally, a data retrieval system must be implemented as part of the memorandum of understanding. The memorandum of understanding establishes a joint data retrieval system to track lease and permit applications, providing applicants with status updates and estimated processing times within the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture. SEC. 7 of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to include reimbursement for costs of NEPA analyses, documentation, and studies. The Secretary of the Interior may reimburse individuals for costs incurred for NEPA analysis, documentation, or related studies required for leases under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, if adequate funding is not available, costs were paid voluntarily, and records are maintained as per regulations. The Secretary will issue regulations for the amendment within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, applying to leases entered into before or after that date. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of the Interior for the implementation of sections 5 through 7."
