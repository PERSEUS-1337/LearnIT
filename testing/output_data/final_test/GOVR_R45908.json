    "content": "The Trump Administration has cited statutory authorities allowing the construction of border barriers by DHS, DOD, or the Department of the Treasury for emergency purposes. Section 102 of the IIRIRA authorizes DHS to build barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border to deter illegal crossings. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive legal requirements for expedited construction of barriers. The Secretary of Defense can undertake military construction projects to support the armed forces. President Trump plans to repurpose $3.6 billion for border barrier construction. The DOD can support counterdrug activities by constructing fencing to block drug smuggling corridors. President Trump proposed using $2.5 billion from the DOD's Drug Interdiction Account to fund the construction of fencing at the southern border for counterdrug activities. This funding would be transferred using authority from the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act. Additionally, the Treasury Forfeiture Fund could also be used for law enforcement-related expenditures. The President proposed withdrawing $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund for border barrier construction, utilizing unobligated funds for law enforcement activities. The Trump Administration has taken steps to make these funds available for constructing border barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, including declaring a national emergency and directing military construction projects. Additionally, DHS requested DOD assistance in constructing border barriers, which was granted. The Trump Administration utilized DOD funds to construct border barriers, transferring $1 billion initially and an additional $1.5 billion later. This was done through the authority granted in the FY2019 DOD Appropriations Act. The proposed projects included building 131 miles of new barriers, with waivers issued to bypass environmental regulations. The Trump Administration used DOD funds to construct border barriers under IIRIRA \u00a7102's waiver authority, bypassing environmental regulations for fences, roads, and lighting along the southern border. DHS's authority to build barriers comes from this law, directing the installation of physical barriers to deter illegal crossings in high entry areas. The Trump Administration utilized DOD funds to build border barriers under IIRIRA \u00a7102's waiver authority, allowing flexibility in barrier construction along the southwest border. The Secretary of Homeland Security can determine where barriers are most practical and effective, with the ability to waive legal requirements for expedited construction. The Trump Administration used DOD funds to build border barriers under IIRIRA \u00a7102's waiver authority, allowing flexibility in construction. Legal challenges to this waiver authority have been rejected by courts, citing it as an affirmative defense to claims arising from waived laws. The President announced reallocating $3.6 billion from DOD for barrier construction. The Trump Administration used DOD funds to build border barriers under IIRIRA \u00a7102's waiver authority. Legal challenges to this authority have been rejected by courts. President Trump announced reallocating $3.6 billion from DOD for barrier construction, declaring a national emergency under the NEA. DOD identified 127 military construction projects to delay or suspend for this reallocation. The NEA and Section 2808 provide requirements for the exercise of emergency powers by the President. The Supreme Court has stated that the President's authority must come from an act of Congress or the Constitution. The President relies on Congress for authority during national emergencies. Congress has granted the President extensive powers in times of crisis, with no limitations on declaring an emergency or its duration. Concerns in the 1970s led to the enactment of the NEA in 1976 to address the President's crisis powers. The NEA was enacted in 1976 to limit the President's emergency powers by establishing oversight and termination procedures for national emergencies. It requires the President to specify statutory authorities, publish the declaration in the Federal Register, and report to Congress. The National Emergencies Act (NEA) was enacted in 1976 to limit the President's emergency powers by establishing oversight and termination procedures for national emergencies. It requires the President to specify statutory authorities, publish the declaration in the Federal Register, report to Congress, and provide an accounting of expenditures. The NEA outlines conditions for ending a national emergency, including automatic termination after one year, presidential declaration, or Congress enacting a joint resolution. Congress is directed to meet every six months to consider ending a national emergency, but has never done so before this year. The National Emergencies Act (NEA) allows the President to renew emergency declarations, resulting in 34 ongoing national emergencies. These declarations grant the President various emergency authorities, such as the ability to impose sanctions using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Another authority, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2293, could also allow for fund reprogramming during a national emergency. Section 2293 of 33 U.S.C. allows the Secretary of the Army to halt non-essential civil works projects during a national emergency or war, reallocating funds to projects essential for national defense. This authority has never been invoked by a President but could potentially be used in conjunction with President Trump's national emergency declaration at the southern border. Additionally, Section 2808 provides emergency authority for unauthorized military construction in such situations, which President Trump used to redirect $3.6 billion from DOD military construction funds to border barrier construction. President Trump redirected $3.6 billion from DOD military construction funds to border barrier construction under emergency declaration, invoking Section 2808 of title 10, United States Code. This allows the Secretary of Defense to undertake military construction projects necessary to support the use of the armed forces during a national emergency. Section 2808 of title 10, United States Code allows the Secretary of Defense to use military construction funds for projects necessary to support the armed forces during a national emergency. The term \"military construction project\" includes various construction activities related to military installations. The funds available for emergency military construction are limited to the total amount appropriated but not obligated. The legislative history of Section 2808 provides limited guidance on the types of emergencies and projects envisioned. The Trump Administration has invoked DOD's authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 to support DHS in constructing border fencing, funded by money transferred to DOD's Drug Interdiction Account. This authority is not contingent on specific emergency situations. The 2019 DOD Appropriations Act authorizes military support for civilian law enforcement without the need for a national emergency declaration. Section 284 allows the Secretary of Defense to provide equipment and facilities for law enforcement purposes. Additionally, DOD can support counterdrug and organized crime activities of other government agencies or law enforcement entities upon request. Section 284 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide equipment and facilities for law enforcement purposes, including maintenance, repair, training, reconnaissance, and construction projects to block drug smuggling corridors. This support is not subject to usual DOD requirements and allows for congressional oversight. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on small scale construction projects costing up to $750,000 under Section 284 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act. Projects exceeding this amount do not require reporting. Funding for these projects comes from the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities line item in the annual appropriations bill. In FY2019, $1,034,625,000 was allocated to this line item, with $517,171,000 for counter-narcotics support. DHS requested DOD assistance for border barrier construction, which was approved using funds from the Drug Interdiction Account. The DOD sought to transfer funds into the Drug Interdiction Account under Section 8005 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act for military functions. This transfer was deemed necessary in the national interest and required approval from the Office of Management and Budget. The funds could only be used for higher priority items based on unforeseen military requirements. The transfer authority under Section 8005 of the DOD Appropriations Act originated in FY1974 and prohibits the transfer of funds denied by Congress. This was implemented to tighten congressional control over fund reprogramming, as DOD had previously reprogrammed funds deleted in the legislative process with committee consent. The House committee report criticized the practice of transferring funds without congressional approval, declaring it \"untenable.\" The DOD authorized transfers of $1 billion and $1.5 billion using Sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act. Section 9002 allows the Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $2 billion between DOD appropriations, subject to the same terms as Section 8005. The Acting Secretary of Defense informed Congress of transfers subject to the same terms as Section 8005. Congress authorized the confiscation of property used in crimes and established the TFF to hold forfeited proceeds for law enforcement purposes. The TFF holds forfeited proceeds for law enforcement purposes and reserves funds for mandatory and discretionary expenditures. Unobligated balances can be used for law enforcement activities, known as \"Strategic Support.\" In 2018, $601 million was transferred to CBP for border barrier construction from the TFF in response to a request for $681 million for border security. Following the Trump Administration's announcement of funding for border barrier construction, lawsuits were filed by citizens groups, states, and the U.S. House of Representatives in federal district courts in California, the District of Columbia, and Texas. The plaintiffs argue that the funding initiatives are not authorized by relevant statutory authorities, violate constitutional separation of powers principles, and the Appropriations Clause. Some plaintiffs also claim that DHS does not have the authority to waive NEPA requirements for border barrier projects being constructed with DOD's assistance. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Sections 8005 and 9002 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act did not authorize the transfer of funds for border barrier construction, citing violations of Section 8005's prohibition on transferring funds denied by Congress. This decision came after lawsuits were filed challenging the funding initiatives for border barrier construction. The court ruled that the Administration's proposed use of Section 8005 for additional border barrier funding was unlawful as it was not an \"unforeseen military requirement.\" A preliminary injunction was issued in the Sierra Club case, barring the Administration from using Section 8005 for border barrier construction. The court did not issue an injunction in the California case due to the existing injunction in the Sierra Club case. The preliminary injunction applied to the initial transfer of $1 billion for projects in New Mexico and Arizona. The district court ruled that the $1.5 billion transfer for border barrier construction was not authorized by Section 8005 or Section 9002. The Trump Administration appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit, which denied the request to stay the injunction. However, the Supreme Court later issued an order staying the injunction, allowing the Administration to use the funds for now. The Supreme Court's order allows the Trump Administration to use Section 8005 to transfer funds for border barrier construction, despite a permanent injunction against using military construction funds. The Texas lawsuit also resulted in a permanent injunction against using Section 2808 for border barrier construction, as it clashed with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. Various arguments were raised in these litigations. The lawsuits discussed the lawfulness of the Trump Administration's funding initiatives for border barrier construction. The federal court in the District of Columbia dismissed the U.S. House of Representatives' case for lack of standing, currently under appeal. Section 8005 allows fund transfers for \"military functions\" only for higher priority items and not denied by Congress. The Sierra Club v. Trump case concluded on Section 8005. The district court in Sierra Club v. Trump ruled that Section 8005 does not authorize funds transfer for border barrier construction as it was for an \"item\" denied by Congress. The Trump Administration argued that the funds were for DOD's assistance to DHS for \"counterdrug activities,\" not specifically for border barriers. The district court rejected the Trump Administration's argument that funds transfer for border barrier construction was not prohibited by Section 8005. It concluded that Congress denied the $5.7 billion request for border barrier construction, making it the item sought to be funded via the Section 8005 transfer. The court also considered the historical context of the disagreement between the Administration and Congress on funding for border barriers. The court relied on Section 8005's legislative history to support its conclusion that transferring funds for border barrier construction was prohibited. It cited a House report from 1973 that explained Congress adopted the \"denied by Congress\" language to tighten control over reprogramming funds and prevent funding for programs denied by Congress. The court believed allowing the Administration to transfer money for border barriers despite Congress's refusal would undermine Section 8005's purpose. It also found the transfer authority was unavailable as the border barrier construction was not an unforeseen military requirement. The district court rejected the Administration's argument that the proposed border barrier construction was \"unforeseen\" due to the need for DOD support not being known until after Congress had passed the appropriations bill with less funding. The court explained that every request for Section 284 support would be unforeseen, as the need for that authority only arises when another agency requests DOD's assistance. The district court rejected the Administration's argument that border barrier construction funding was 'unforeseen' and cited constitutional concerns with the executive branch's interpretation of Section 8005. The court rejected the Administration's interpretation of Section 8005, citing constitutional concerns and potential pitfalls. It temporarily prohibited the Administration from using $1 billion transferred under Section 8005 for border barrier construction in New Mexico and Arizona. Additional briefing was submitted on the lawfulness of transferring another $1.5 billion for border barriers in California and Arizona. The district court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Trump Administration from constructing a border barrier using Section 8005 transfer authority in California and Arizona. The Ninth Circuit denied the Administration's request for a stay, agreeing with the district court that the construction was not an unforeseen military requirement. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the construction of a border barrier was not an unforeseen military requirement as claimed by the Trump Administration. Congress had denied funds for the border barrier construction, and the court concluded that the requested funds were specifically for a wall along the southern border. The Ninth Circuit ruled that Congress denied funds for a physical barrier along the entire southern border, despite the Trump Administration's request. The Supreme Court stayed the district court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs had no cause of action to review the Acting Secretary of Defense's compliance with Section 8005. The plaintiffs in Sierra Club and California argued that Section 284 does not empower DOD to assist another agency in constructing border barriers, as it only authorizes small-scale construction projects costing up to $75,000. This suggests that Section 284 should not be interpreted to allow assistance with larger-scale projects. The plaintiffs argued that Section 284 should not be interpreted broadly to authorize massive expenditures for border barrier construction, citing a specific and recent judgment by Congress appropriating only $1.375 billion for DHS projects. They also contended that DOD's proposed projects do not align with the intended purpose of Section 284, which is to block drug smuggling corridors, not to create a contiguous border wall. The plaintiffs argued that DOD's use of Section 284 for border wall construction violates reimbursement requirements and mixes funds from different accounts. The plaintiffs argued that executive branch agencies cannot exceed funding limits by mixing funds from different accounts for border barrier construction. The Administration contended that Section 284 allows DOD to assist with projects beyond small-scale construction and that the plaintiffs misconstrued the reimbursement requirement. The Administration argued that Section 284 allows DOD to support border barrier projects beyond small-scale construction and that the reimbursement requirement does not apply to DOD's counterdrug activities. They also claimed that the proposed projects meet the \"drug smuggling corridor\" requirement and dismissed the plaintiffs' argument about violating appropriation principles. The Administration argued that Section 284 allows DOD to support border barrier projects beyond small-scale construction and that the reimbursement requirement does not apply to DOD's counterdrug activities. The district court in Sierra Club and California did not resolve the issue of transferring funds between different agencies. The Ninth Circuit in Sierra Club also did not address this authority. The district court in El Paso County agreed with the plaintiffs that Congress's appropriation of funds for border barrier construction should take precedence over more general statutes. The court found that the use of Section 284 funds for border barrier construction was precluded by Section 739 of the CAA 2019, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds to increase funding for a program beyond what Congress had provided. The court in El Paso declined to enjoin the use of Section 284 for border barrier construction despite it not being eligible for the exception in the CAA 2019. The plaintiffs argued that the Administration's construction of a border barrier must comply with NEPA's environmental assessment requirements and that DHS's waiver authority under IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102 is limited to barriers and roads under that section. The Administration relied on DOD authority and appropriations to construct border barriers, contended by plaintiffs as not meeting statutory requirements. The district court ruled in favor of the Administration, stating that IIRIRA \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0102's waiver authority extends to border projects undertaken by another agency on behalf of DHS, rendering NEPA inapplicable to the challenged projects. The court ruled that DHS's waivers applied to the challenged border projects, rejecting the argument that different NEPA requirements apply when DOD supports DHS in response to a direct request. The state plaintiffs also challenged the Administration's allocation of $601 million from the TFF. The Administration allocated $601 million from the TFF, arguing it was not unauthorized by law. The district court found that while there was some discretion in allocation, there were sufficient standards to determine if funds were transferred improperly. The district court declined to address the state plaintiffs' arguments for a preliminary injunction against the TFF transfer, as the Secretary of the Treasury had already reserved the required amounts. Subsequently, the parties in California voluntarily dismissed the TFF claim. The dismissal of the plaintiffs' TFF claim was based on assurances from the Administration regarding the use of funds for border barriers in specific Texas sectors. Challenges have arisen regarding the reprogramming of military construction funds for border barrier construction, with one challenge questioning the national emergency declaration and the other challenging the authority under Section 2808. The plaintiffs in Sierra Club have not dropped their TFF claim. The plaintiffs in El Paso County v. Trump challenge the lawfulness of President Trump's national emergency declaration to use military construction funds for border barrier construction, arguing that the situation at the border does not constitute an emergency under the NEA. They claim that the NEA violates the nondelegation doctrine by giving the President unfettered discretion without clear guidance from Congress. The government argues that Congress intended to avoid restricting presidential power by not defining \"national emergency\" in the NEA. It also states that historical examples show emergency declarations do not have to address unforeseen circumstances and that courts have deemed presidential declarations of national emergencies as nonjusticiable political questions. The Administration argues that the President's national emergency declaration fulfills key factors for nonjusticiable political questions, as Congress intentionally left the determination of a national emergency to the President with oversight by Congress. The Administration argues that the President's national emergency declaration is a nonjusticiable political question, as Congress intentionally left the determination of a national emergency to the President with oversight by Congress. The district court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that the Administration's funding plan for the border violates the CAA 2019. The Sierra Club plaintiffs did not challenge the legality of the national emergency declaration but argued against the Administration's plan to reallocate military construction funds. The district court expressed doubt that Section 2808 authorizes the construction of border barriers using military construction funds. Section 2808 allows funds to be reprogrammed for military construction in a national emergency, defined as construction related to military installations under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department. The Administration relied on the term \"other activity\" to justify the use of funds for border barriers. The court in Sierra Club rejected the government's broad interpretation of \"military construction\" in Section 2808, emphasizing the importance of the condition \"with respect to a military installation\" over the term \"includes.\" The court also dismissed the Administration's reliance on the term \"other activity,\" stating that it should be interpreted in context. The court in Sierra Club rejected the government's broad interpretation of \"military construction\" in Section 2808, emphasizing the importance of the condition \"with respect to a military installation\" over the term \"includes.\" The court explained that \"other activity\" should be interpreted in context and does not include any activity conducted by a Secretary of a military department that could transform into a 'military installation.' The court did not conclude that Congress intended for 'other activity' in Section 2808 to allow building a barrier on the southern border. The issue was not yet ripe for decision, so military construction funds for border barrier construction were not enjoined. The Ninth Circuit did not address the issue either. However, on December 11, 2019, the district court found the government's plans to allocate military construction funds for border barrier projects made the issue ripe for decision in the California and Sierra Club cases. The court found the question of whether specific projects are \"military construction projects\" suitable for adjudication, despite not addressing the existence of an emergency requiring troop use. It reaffirmed that the projects lack sufficient connection to military installations to be considered permissible military construction projects. The court was not convinced that Congress intended for \"military construction\" to be solely for administrative convenience. The court found that the border barrier construction projects lack sufficient connection to military installations to be considered permissible military construction projects. The aim of the NEA was to narrow executive emergency power, and Section 2808 has rarely been used for projects not funded by Congress. The court found that the 11 barrier projects on the Barry M. Goldwater range are not necessary to support the use of the armed forces, as argued by the government. The projects do not align with the purpose of Section 2808, which specifically requires construction that supports the armed forces' use. The court rejected the government's argument that the 11 proposed border construction projects are necessary to support the armed forces. A permanent injunction was entered against the projects, but it is stayed pending appeal. The district court in El Paso County also rejected the use of Section 2808 for border barrier construction, stating that it cannot be used to circumvent the CAA 2019. The legal challenges against the Trump Administration's funding initiatives involve requirements for maintaining a lawsuit in federal court, including demonstrating a specific injury and having a legal right to enforce federal law. These obstacles have hindered opposition to the funding initiatives. The U.S. District Court ruled that the House of Representatives lacked standing to challenge the Trump Administration's actions. The Supreme Court allowed the Administration to use funds for border barriers despite legal challenges. The U.S. District Court ruled that the House of Representatives lacked standing to challenge the Trump Administration's actions. The Supreme Court allowed the Administration to use funds for border barriers while the Ninth Circuit considers the appeal of the injunction. The Court's order did not address the merits of the statutory authorities at issue in the litigation, emphasizing the importance of establishing standing to sue in federal court. The district court ruled that plaintiffs challenging the Trump Administration's funding initiatives had standing to sue, despite the Administration's argument that the injury did not confer standing. This decision emphasized the importance of establishing standing in federal court. The court ruled that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the Trump Administration's transfer of funds for border barriers, as the injury was directly linked to the construction objective. In a separate case, the court found that reputational and economic injuries from border barrier construction were sufficient for standing. The district court in Mnuchin found that the House's injury related to its Appropriations power did not meet the requirements for Article III standing, similar to the Supreme Court's decision in Raines v. Byrd regarding institutional injury. The court noted that the appropriations power belongs to Congress as a whole, not individually to each chamber. The Mnuchin court, like in Raines, found that the House's injury did not meet Article III standing requirements. The court emphasized the lack of historical examples of federal courts adjudicating lawsuits based on claimed injury of official authority. The U.S. House of Representatives appealed to the D.C. Circuit, which has not yet issued a decision. Additionally, a plaintiff must establish standing and identify a cause of action to sue, which can be included in federal laws or the Administrative Procedure Act. The Mnuchin court found that the House's injury did not meet Article III standing requirements. A plaintiff must establish standing and identify a cause of action to sue, which can be included in federal laws or the Administrative Procedure Act. A plaintiff may challenge agency action in federal court and may still be authorized to sue based on the power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action. The \"zone of interests\" requirement applies to all statutorily created causes of action to ensure that the plaintiff's interests align with the statute's purposes. The district court and Ninth Circuit allowed plaintiffs in Sierra Club cases to challenge executive action for border barrier construction, ruling they met procedural requirements. They found plaintiffs had equitable cause of action and APA claim, doubting zone-of-interests test for equity-based claims. The Circuit expressed doubts about the zone-of-interests test for equity-based claims but found that the plaintiffs satisfied any requirements. The Supreme Court issued an order staying the district court's injunction on the Trump Administration's use of Section 8005. Chief Justice Roberts and several other Justices voted to grant the stay, while Justice Breyer would have granted it partially. The Court's order granted a stay on the injunction against the Trump Administration's use of Section 8005, citing the Government's sufficient showing that the plaintiffs have no cause of action. Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan voted to deny the stay request, while Justice Breyer would have granted it partially. The Supreme Court granted a stay on the injunction against the Trump Administration's use of Section 8005 for border barrier construction. Justice Breyer would have partially granted the stay to allow the government to finalize contracts and take preparatory administrative action. This decision aimed to prevent irreparable harm to both the plaintiffs and the government while allowing the litigation to proceed. The Court's order allows the use of funds under Section 8005 for border barriers during ongoing litigation, but does not address the merits of the statutory authorities. The order is temporary and not binding on the Ninth Circuit, which is considering the Administration's appeal. It does not prevent the Sierra Club plaintiffs from enforcing Section 8005 or the district court from ruling on other funding authorities. The Supreme Court has stated that Congress has the power to control the spending of public funds for border barrier construction, including potentially limiting the Administration's funding sources. The 116th Congress had considered restrictions on using appropriated funds for this purpose during the FY2020 appropriations process. Congress has considered provisions to limit the use of appropriated funds for border barrier construction, but none have been enacted yet. For example, H.R. 2740 would have prohibited the use of funds for constructing border barriers along the southern land border of the United States. This provision could have made the litigation over the Northern District of California's injunction moot. Additionally, H.R. 2740 would have restricted the general transfer authority under Sections 8005 or 9002. The bill would limit transfer authority for funds related to the DOD Drug Interdiction Account and reduce general transfer authority under Section 8005. The Administration requested $5 billion for border barrier funding in FY2020, but the House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for border barriers in their bill. The House Appropriations Committee-reported bill proposed restrictions on using federal funds for border barrier construction in fiscal year 2020. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill for DHS in FY2020 included $5 billion for new pedestrian fencing. Congress later provided $1.375 billion for a barrier system along the southwest border. In 2020, Congress allocated $1.375 billion for the construction of a barrier system along the southwest border. Committees and Members of Congress sought legal opinions from the Comptroller General of the United States regarding appropriations law and executive agencies' compliance. The Comptroller General's legal opinion concluded that the Administration's use of Section 8005 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations was questioned. The Administration's use of Section 8005 of the 2019 DOD Appropriations Act and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 284 to fund border barrier construction was deemed lawful by the Comptroller General's legal opinion. The analysis focused on whether the funds were used for an unforeseen military requirement and if Congress had denied funds for the item being transferred. GAO agreed that the military requirement was the construction of border barriers by DOD under Section 284 authority, which was considered unforeseen as the need for DOD assistance only became known after DHS requested it. The GAO concluded that DHS's request for DOD assistance for border barrier construction constituted an unforeseen military requirement, allowing the use of transfer authority under Section 8005. GAO determined that a denial of funds by Congress required an active refusal, not just a failure to appropriate the full amount, and found no statutory provision prohibiting DOD from using funds for border barriers under Section 284 authority. The GAO agreed with the Administration that Congress had not denied funds for building border barriers under Section 284 authority, allowing DOD to use funds for that purpose."
