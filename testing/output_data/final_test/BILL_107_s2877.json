    "content": "The Act titled \"Rank and File Stock Option Act of 2002\" denies deduction for stock option plans that discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. The \"Rank and File Stock Option Act of 2002\" limits the deduction for stock options granted by applicable taxpayers if they fail to meet concentration tests. The deduction for stock options granted by applicable taxpayers may be reduced if the total number of shares acquired exceeds 50 percent of the aggregate share amount. This reduction is based on a percentage calculation. The deduction for stock options granted by applicable taxpayers may be reduced if the total number of shares acquired exceeds 5 percent of the aggregate share amount for individual concentration tests. No deduction is allowed for options granted to highly compensated employees exceeding this threshold. If the aggregate share amount held by the top group of employees exceeds 15 percent, no deduction is allowed for stock options granted by the applicable taxpayer. An employee is considered part of the top group if they are a covered employee under section 162(m)(3). There is an exception if an equal number of identical options were granted in a taxable year. The taxpayer granted equal options to all employees regardless of compensation level. The aggregate share amount is the total shares from options granted to all employees in a taxable year. Options granted to non-highly compensated employees are considered, with exceptions. The taxpayer's options granted to highly compensated employees must not be more favorable than those granted to other employees. The subsection is applied separately for each class of stock. The term \"applicable taxpayer\" refers to an issuer under the Securities Exchange Act. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 defines the requirements for issuers whose securities are registered under section 12 or required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Act. The Securities Act of 1933 requires securities to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by the end of the fiscal year. An applicable highly compensated employee includes certain highly compensated employees and directors of the taxpayer. Incentive stock options are not considered in this definition. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002. All corporations in an affiliated group filing a consolidated return are treated as 1 taxpayer. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to prevent avoidance through the use of phantom stock or restricted stock. SEC. 3. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Securities and Exchange Commission must finalize rules within a year to require shareholder approval for stock option plans, grants, and other equity acquisition arrangements by public companies. Shareholders must be provided detailed information about these plans before approval. The anticipated distribution of the plan or grant among directors, officers, and employees, the total number of options reserved for each, potential earnings per share dilution, terms for canceling or reissuing stock options, and details of previously approved options. The Commission ensures reliability and accuracy of disclosures to shareholders and investors. Shareholder approval rules may exempt stock option grants to employees under specified conditions, excluding directors or officers, based on business judgment, and with minimal dilution. The Commission may exempt stock option plans and grants for small business issuers or other small issuers burdened by requirements compared to shareholder benefits. Exemptions may be phased in based on issuer size and applicability to plans excluding officers and directors. SEC. 4. HOLDING PERIOD FOR EXECUTIVES.\n\nWithin 1 year of this Act's enactment, the SEC will analyze and recommend new stock holding period rules for senior executives, including minimum holding periods after stock option exercises and limits on stock sales. Analysis will cover sales to company, public markets, and derivative sales."
