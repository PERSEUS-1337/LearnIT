Congress recognizes autism as a national healthcare crisis with a prevalence rate of 0.75 percent. The condition is growing at a rate of ten to 17 percent per year, potentially affecting 4,000,000 Americans in the next decade. Early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes for children with autism. Students with autism should be provided with opportunities according to the National Council on Disability. Students with autism should have opportunities for social competence and independence in life skills. Limited access to evidence-based services is a major obstacle in providing quality education in public schools. Successful interventions are crucial for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) for children with autism. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures education options for students with disabilities, but many educators lack experience with autism. Additional training is needed for effective teaching.
