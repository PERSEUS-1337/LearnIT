Security measures were decentralized before the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, prompting President Clinton to direct the Department of Justice to assess vulnerabilities and establish minimum security standards. The U.S. Marshals Service played a key role in coordinating these efforts. The U.S. Marshals Service, under the Department of Justice, led efforts to establish minimum security standards for federal facilities after President Clinton directed a review of vulnerabilities post the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Working groups identified security measures, conducted inspections at over 1,200 facilities, and issued the Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities report. Agencies were instructed to upgrade their facilities to meet the recommended standards. Following the DOJ recommendations, President Clinton required GSA to establish building security committees for GSA-managed facilities. The federal government's focus on building security activities increased after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the September 2013 Washington Navy Yard shootings, and the April 2014 Fort Hood shootings. This led to heightened security operations at federal facilities and increased scrutiny on how the government secures and protects these facilities and employees. Congressional interest in federal facility security has been evident in past Congresses, with hearings held on the topic. The House Affairs Committee held a hearing on federal facility security, focusing on the Navy Yard Tragedy. While FPS is primarily responsible for security, only 9,000 out of 446,000 federal facilities fall under their jurisdiction. There are 20 other federal law enforcement entities with security missions. Federal facility security is a concern for all government branches and departments. This report addresses common questions about federal building security. Federal facility security focuses on reducing criminal and terrorist threats to facilities, employees, and the public. Each facility has unique security needs based on size and public access. USMS categorizes facilities into security levels based on size and number of employees. Level II\u2014buildings with 2,500 to 80,000 square feet, 11 to 150 federal employees, and moderate public access; Level III\u2014buildings with 80,000 to 150,000 square feet, 151 to 450 federal employees, and moderate to high public access; Level IV\u2014buildings with 150,000 square feet or more, more than 450 federal employees, and a high level of public access; and Level V\u2014buildings critical to national security. Security operations include risk assessments, countermeasures, law enforcement response, training programs, and threat intelligence gathering. According to the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs, there are approximately 20 federal law enforcement entities responsible for facility security, including the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute and Standards and Technology Police, U.S. Department of Defense's Pentagon Force Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health Division of Police, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency Security Branch. Officers from various federal law enforcement entities are responsible for protecting different facilities and personnel, including FEMA, Secret Service, Federal Reserve Board, NASA, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, and Tennessee Valley Authority. The National Zoological Park in Washington, DC; Tennessee Valley Authority Police provide law enforcement and security services for TVA employees and properties; U.S. Postal Inspection Services provide security for postal facilities and assets; U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Hoover Dam Police provide security for the Hoover Dam; U.S. Supreme Court Police provide law enforcement and security services for the Supreme Court facilities; FBI Police provide security for FBI facilities; U.S. Marshals Service provide security for federal judicial facilities and personnel. Marshals provide security for federal judicial facilities and personnel; U.S. Capitol Police provide law enforcement and security services for the U.S. Capitol grounds and buildings; U.S. Government Publishing Office Police provide security for facilities producing government information; Bureau of Engraving and Printing Police secure facilities where official U.S. documents are made; United States Mint Police protect assets at U.S. Mint facilities. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services at over 9,000 federal facilities and monitoring over 15,000 private security guards. They train, inspect, and monitor private security guard companies that provide personnel for security check points and patrol federal facilities. Additionally, FPS responds to criminal and emergency incidents. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) sets security standards for federal facilities to safeguard them from various hazards. Initially chaired by GSA, it is now chaired by DHS following the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The ISC, now chaired by DHS, centralizes efforts to secure federal facilities with over 100 senior executives from 53 federal agencies. They have developed federal facility policies and standards, including guidelines for active shooter response and risk management. The ISC, chaired by DHS, develops federal facility policies and standards, including guidelines for active shooter response and risk management. They have issued various standards and best practices for enhancing federal facility security and resilience. The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) has issued several guides and white papers on physical security resources, implementation of the REAL ID Act, facility security plans, and best practices for federal facility security. These resources cover topics such as armed security officers, violence prevention, occupant emergency programs, and mail screening management. The ISC has issued guides on physical security resources, implementation of the REAL ID Act, and best practices for federal facility security. Federal facilities face threats like assault, weapon possession, sexual assault, robbery, demonstrations, homicide, and arson. A federal contractor shot fellow employees at the Washington Navy Yard facility in 2013, prompting a DOD investigation. The shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013 led to a DOD investigation on the facility's security operations. Federal facility security is complex due to varying security measures based on specific needs and threats. Media sources reported approximately 67 threats or incidents between 2005 and 2017, including bomb threats and shootings. 24 incidents involved evacuations due to suspicious packages or bomb threats. Between 2005 and 2017, there were approximately 67 threats or incidents at federal facilities, including shootings and bomb threats. These incidents involved evacuations and violent crimes such as assault, weapons possession, and arson. The FPS provided crime data reflecting these incidents, which were not included in media reports. The FPS categorizes incidents at federal facilities, including assaults and sexual assaults. FPS secures only a small percentage of federal facilities, so the total number of threats is likely higher. The federal government replaced the Homeland Security Advisory System with the National Terrorism Advisory System in 2009 to communicate terrorism threat information. The Office of Operations Coordination and Planning within DHS is responsible for monitoring the nation's security situation daily through the National Operations Center (NOC) and coordinating activities among various entities. Information on domestic incident management is shared with Emergency Operations Centers at federal, state, and local levels through the Homeland Security Information System (HSIN) and state and local intelligence fusion centers. In addition to established information sharing processes, there are also ad hoc coordination and threat-specific information sharing processes. The FBI testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security about coordinating with other federal agencies on nuclear threats. Liaison relationships have been developed with DHS, DOE, and DOD to coordinate response efforts. Some federal entities have mechanisms for notifying other departments, such as the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Office of Nuclear Security and Incident Response. Threat information relevant to federal facility security is shared between security managers, law enforcement entities, and local law enforcement. Federal law enforcement entities, including local assistance in areas without a large federal presence, rely on state and local law enforcement for securing facilities. Congress reviews threat information communication among federal, state, and local entities for federal facility security. Oversight includes monitoring FPS's training and monitoring of contract security guards, as identified by the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Federal Protective Service (FPS) faces challenges in ensuring proper training and certification of contract security guards for federal facilities. GAO identified issues with active shooter response and screener training, leading to concerns about guards' readiness for such incidents. Additionally, FPS and other federal agencies struggle with assessing risks at federal facilities, with challenges in completing and implementing in-depth risk assessments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that federal agencies, including the Departments of the Interior and Veterans Affairs, FPS, FEMA, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, did not fully assess risks at federal facilities as required by security standards. FPS's risk assessment tool does not consider potential consequences. Challenges in federal facility emergency planning include employee participation, accounting, and updating of contact information. These issues were highlighted after the 1995 bombing incident. Efforts to improve security standards after the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building were prompted by incidents like the September 2001 attacks on the Pentagon. However, issues persist, as seen in shootings at the U.S. Navy Yard and Fort Hood, TX."
