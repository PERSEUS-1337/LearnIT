Congress finds that Public Law 102-215 directed the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of White Clay Creek and its tributaries for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. As part of the study, a watershed management plan was prepared in 1998 to protect the area's values and resources. After a study of White Clay Creek and its tributaries, Chester County, Pennsylvania, New Castle County, Delaware, Newark, Delaware, and 12 Pennsylvania municipalities passed resolutions supporting the White Clay Creek Watershed Management Plan and endorsing the designation of the creek and its tributaries for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. After a study and support from various counties and municipalities, White Clay Creek and its tributaries are designated for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to include White Clay Creek in Delaware and Pennsylvania, totaling 190 miles of river segments to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior. This includes specific segments designated for recreational use. White Clay Creek in Delaware and Pennsylvania is designated as a recreational river, scenic river, and recreational river for various segments totaling 25.8 miles.
