It amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The \"Consistency, Accuracy, Responsibility, and Excellence in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy Act of 2007\" establishes standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy services, focusing on personnel rather than equipment. Expert advisers are selected to provide balanced input from all healthcare sectors involved in these services. The \"Consistency, Accuracy, Responsibility, and Excellence in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy Act of 2007\" sets standards for personnel in medical imaging and radiation therapy services. The Secretary is limited in taking actions that would require state licensure for technical service providers. Exemptions include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must comply with the standards before performing these services. The \"Consistency, Accuracy, Responsibility, and Excellence in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy Act of 2007\" establishes standards for personnel in therapy services. Compliance can be demonstrated through certification, licensure, examination, coursework, experience, or other methods approved by the Secretary. Standards may vary by discipline and reflect expert consensus on excellence in practice. The Act establishes standards for therapy services personnel, which may vary by discipline and allow exemptions based on scope of practice.

The term 'perform' refers to directly exposing a patient to radiation or positioning them for imaging or therapy. The term 'plan' relates to the preparation for medical imaging or therapy. The term 'plan' in medical imaging or radiation therapy involves preparing for a procedure by customizing it for the patient based on specific information.
