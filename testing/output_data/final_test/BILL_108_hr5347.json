    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Methamphetamine Abuse Prevention Act of 2004\". Congress finds that methamphetamine is a dangerous drug distributed throughout the United States, leading to increased crime, environmental damage, hazardous waste, expensive cleanup costs, and broken families. Congress has taken steps to limit the availability of chemicals used in methamphetamine production, with pseudoephedrine being a key precursor chemical obtained from retail and wholesale distributors by manufacturers. The use of pseudoephedrine tablets in blister packs is prevalent in methamphetamine production. Current law allows the sale of blister-packed pseudoephedrine products without a sales limit, unlike bottled pseudoephedrine which has a 9 gram limit. Reducing the threshold to 6 grams would still allow consumers to purchase enough medication. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration recommended legislation to correct the disparity in the law between bottled and blister-packed pseudoephedrine tablets to prevent illicit access to the methamphetamine precursor. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration recommended legislation to reduce the retail sales threshold for pseudoephedrine to 6 grams to prevent illicit access to the methamphetamine precursor. The Controlled Substances Act is amended to reduce the retail sales threshold for pseudoephedrine to 6 grams and specify packaging requirements for nonliquids and liquids. SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF BLISTER PACK EXEMPTION. Amends the Controlled Substances Act to remove the blister pack exemption and redefine certain sections. SEC. 5. NATIONAL UNIFORMITY FOR RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF PSEUDOEPHEDRINE PRODUCTS. Section 708 of the Controlled Substances Act is amended to prohibit any state or local entity from imposing additional requirements on the retail sales of pseudoephedrine drug products beyond those outlined in the Act. State penalties do not prevent states from imposing different or additional penalties. The grandfather clause exempts requirements or restrictions on pseudoephedrine sales enacted before January 1, 2005, except for limits on individual purchases. The Attorney General may exempt a State or political subdivision requirement from paragraph (1)(A) if pseudoephedrine products are being used for illegal drug manufacture, under specified conditions. The Attorney General may exempt a State or political subdivision requirement from restrictions on pseudoephedrine products if it decreases their use in illegal drug manufacture and does not overly burden interstate commerce. Judicial review is available for affected parties within 10 days of the determination. The Attorney General may exempt a State or political subdivision requirement from restrictions on pseudoephedrine products if it decreases their use in illegal drug manufacture. Judicial review can be sought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 20 days of filing a petition. If proper service on the Attorney General is not made within 5 days of filing the petition, the 20-day period for judicial review does not start until service is completed. Any court determination under this provision is final and cannot be appealed. Days are computed excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. The term 'pseudoephedrine drug product' refers to a product containing pseudoephedrine that can be lawfully marketed in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
