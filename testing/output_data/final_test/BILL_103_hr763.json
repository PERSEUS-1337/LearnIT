FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that free trade agreements improve income and prosperity by increasing competition, reducing costs, and promoting economic growth and stability in the Pacific Rim countries. Resolving disputes through agreed-upon mechanisms is more effective than issue-by-issue confrontations under trade laws. Free trade agreements between the United States and Pacific Rim countries will enhance cooperation and ensure mutually beneficial economic and political relations. SEC. 2. PRENEGOTIATION CONSULTATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS. The President shall initiate preliminary consultations with eligible Pacific Rim countries to explore the feasibility of negotiating the elimination of tariffs and barriers in a bilateral free trade agreement. If deemed feasible, ministerial meetings will be held to discuss the conditions for formal negotiations. The President recommends establishing a council of public and private sector officials to review trade practices, customs laws, economic data, and bilateral disputes for the negotiation of a free trade agreement. The council must issue a report on the overall bilateral relationship within one year of its establishment. The President suggests forming a council to assess trade practices, customs laws, economic data, and disputes for a potential free trade agreement. Before formal negotiations with a Pacific Rim country, the President must consider their trade commitments and economic reforms. The country must be actively involved in trade negotiations, demonstrate commitment to success, and have a bilateral relationship with the United States that will benefit from eliminating trade barriers. This extends to agreements with eligible Pacific Rim countries under \"Fast Track\" procedures. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 allows the President to enter into bilateral trade agreements with eligible Pacific Rim countries. The Trade Act of 1974 provisions apply to agreements with these countries. Waiver of negotiation request by eligible Pacific Rim countries is not applicable to trade agreements under this Act. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES. The President shall seek substantial progress in improving bilateral relationships, removing trade barriers, and developing rules in nontraditional areas in negotiations with eligible Pacific Rim countries for a free trade area. The President aims to develop rules in nontraditional areas such as services, trade-related investment, and intellectual property rights, encourage US firms to seize opportunities in Pacific Rim markets, and enhance market access to stabilize trade balances. The term \"eligible Pacific Rim country\" in this Act includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong."
