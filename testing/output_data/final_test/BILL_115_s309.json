    "content": "The \"Community-Based Independence for Seniors Act\" emphasizes the importance of community-based services in maintaining the health and independence of seniors. Without these services, seniors may face negative health outcomes and may have to rely on Medicaid for long-term care expenses. Targeting community-based services to at-risk seniors can help prevent asset depletion and Medicaid dependency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program to prevent institutionalization among low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Up to 5 eligible MA plans can enroll 1,000 beneficiaries each in the program, using rebates to provide certain benefits. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program allows selected MA plans to use rebates to provide supplemental benefits to low-income Medicare beneficiaries, including long-term care services such as homemaker services, home delivered meals, transportation services, respite care, and adult day care services. The eligible MA plan for special needs individuals offers respite care, adult day care services, and non-Medicare-covered equipment. The plan must have experience with nursing home-eligible beneficiaries living in the community, low-income beneficiaries, and a service area with Medicaid data available for evaluation. In this section, an eligible low-income Medicare beneficiary is defined as an individual who is a Medicare Advantage eligible individual, a subsidy eligible individual, not eligible for benefits under title XIX of the Social Security Act, unable to perform two or more activities of daily living, and age 65 or older. An eligible Medicare beneficiary age 65 or older can switch to a Medicare Advantage plan participating in the CBI-SNP demonstration program during a special election period, regardless of the annual election periods. They can also switch from original Medicare to an eligible MA plan in the CBI-SNP program if they reside in the plan's service area. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be implemented by January 1, 2018, for a 5-year period. The Secretary will educate eligible Medicare beneficiaries on the program's availability through various organizations. Budget neutrality will be maintained to ensure payments do not exceed estimated expenses under existing Medicare programs. Expansion of Demonstration Program: The Secretary may expand the CBI-SNP demonstration program nationwide based on evaluation results. Independent Evaluation and Reports: The Secretary will conduct an independent evaluation of the program. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be evaluated by an independent third party using specific criteria to determine its impact on patient care, hospitalizations, Medicaid nursing facility admissions, and spend down of income and assets. The CBI-SNP demonstration program will be evaluated for its impact on patient care, hospitalizations, Medicaid nursing facility admissions, reduced spend down of income and assets for Medicaid eligibility, and improved quality of life for beneficiaries and caregivers. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress by January 1, 2022, using data from at least 3 years of the program. Funding for program administration is also specified. The Secretary will transfer $3,000,000 from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account for evaluation and report purposes. The Secretary will transfer $500,000 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account, with amounts remaining available until expended. The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to the testing and evaluation of the CBI-SNP demonstration program."
