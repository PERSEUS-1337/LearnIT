    "content": "The \"Consumer Mobile Fairness Act of 2011\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that consumer use of mobile services has significantly increased over the last 2 decades, with many relying solely on mobile devices. Disputes over mobile service agreements often involve small amounts, making them suitable for class litigation. Many mobile service contracts include clauses that waive consumers' rights to litigate individually or as a class. The Supreme Court's decision in AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion on April 27, 2011, mandates the enforcement of mandatory binding arbitration clauses, even if they prohibit class litigation. This ruling limits consumers' ability to resolve disputes against mobile service providers. SEC. 3. ARBITRATION OF MOBILE SERVICE DISPUTES. Title 9, United States Code, amended to include CHAPTER 4--ARBITRATION OF COMMERCIAL MOBILE SERVICE DISPUTES.Defines terms and addresses validity and enforceability. In this chapter, definitions are provided for terms such as 'commercial mobile service', 'covered individual', 'mobile broadband Internet access service', 'mobile service', and 'pre-dispute arbitration agreement'. The term 'pre-dispute arbitration agreement' refers to an agreement to arbitrate a dispute that was not yet present at the time of the agreement. SEC. 402. VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY. The text discusses the invalidity and unenforceability of predispute arbitration agreements in the context of mobile service providers. It also addresses the determination of the applicability of this chapter to arbitration agreements under Federal law. Additionally, technical and conforming amendments are made to Title 9 of the United States Code. The text makes technical amendments to Title 9 of the United States Code regarding the application of certain chapters and sections. The text amends the table of sections for chapter 2 of Title 9, United States Code by replacing the item related to section 208. The Act amends the table of sections for chapter 3 of Title 9, US Code by replacing the item related to section 307 and adding a new chapter on arbitration of mobile service disputes. The Act and its amendments will take effect on the date of enactment and apply to disputes or claims arising thereafter."
