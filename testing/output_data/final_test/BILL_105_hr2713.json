    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Learning and Opportunity State Grants Act of 1997\". The Congress recognizes the critical importance of the first 3 years of a child's life for brain development, emotional growth, and overall well-being. Research shows that experiences during this period significantly impact individuals throughout their lives. Alarmingly, one in 3 victims of physical abuse is a baby under 1 year old, and nearly half of infants in the US lack necessary resources for growth. High-quality care from adults is essential for children's growth and development. More than 50 percent of mothers with children under 1 year old work outside the home, leaving five million children under 3 in the care of others. Parents of young children have limited childcare options, with less than 20 percent of services for very young children being of good quality. (10) Families with children under 3 years old are the largest group in poverty, with 25% of these children, totaling 3,000,000, living below the poverty line. They are at higher risk for malnutrition, poor health, and maltreatment, and are less likely to receive proper care for normal growth and development. The purposes of this Act are to improve the quality, availability, and affordability of child care services for children under 3 years old, as well as to enhance services for families nurturing these children. It also aims to enhance the coordination and effectiveness of existing programs for these children and their families. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to eligible States to improve child care services for very young children and support services for their families. Priority will be given to States that minimize administrative costs, coordinate activities with child care providers for children aged 3-6, and family support services. The State must take legislative or executive action to reduce duplication and barriers in providing child care services. Providers will be reimbursed at rates reflecting higher costs for accredited providers and for very young children. ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS: Providers will be reimbursed at rates reflecting higher costs for accredited providers and for very young children. To be eligible for a grant under section 4, a State must submit an application prepared in consultation with child care and family support providers. The application must include a plan to use the grant for improving child care services and licensing standards. To improve child care services, the grant aims to enhance staff qualifications, training, safety measures, and parent/community involvement. It also focuses on enforcing licensing standards, increasing caregiver salaries, and providing advanced training for caregivers, including those working with children with special needs. The grant aims to improve accessibility, quality, and affordability of child care services for very young children. It also focuses on expanding support services for families and coordinating existing Federal and State programs. The grant will cover up to 70% of the plan's cost, must supplement non-Federal funds, require the State to contribute at least 30% of the grant amount, and be administered by the designated lead agency. The application for the grant must be submitted by the agency designated by the State under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. It should include necessary information and assurances as required by the Secretary. The Secretary will develop a model training program for child care providers' employees based on existing requirements. This program will be voluntary and provide technical assistance for implementation. Definitions are also provided. SEC. 7.
