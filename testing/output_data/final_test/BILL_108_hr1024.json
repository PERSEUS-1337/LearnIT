    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES BYCATCH MORTALITY REDUCTION RESEARCH PROGRAM.\" is about a research program aimed at reducing bycatch mortality of highly migratory species. The National Marine Fisheries Service establishes a pelagic longline highly migratory species bycatch and mortality reduction research program. A design team will develop the program and submit recommendations for observer coverage on fishing vessels. The program will test various gear configurations to reduce bycatch effectively. The highly migratory species program focuses on reducing blue and white marlin mortality in the Atlantic Ocean. Research will be conducted to assess the impact of existing time and area closures on longline vessel bycatch, with potential modifications to decrease bycatch. Observers will be placed on pelagic longline fishing vessels for monitoring and research purposes. The National Marine Fisheries Service will provide observers for vessels participating in a research program in the Atlantic Ocean. The Service may grant scientific research permits for vessels to fish in closed areas with 100 percent observer coverage. Access to closed areas will be based on scientific need. Knowledgeable members of fishing sectors will be part of the design team. The Secretary will appoint members from the fishing sector, recreational billfish and tuna sector, conservation community, and associated scientists to a program design team. The team will have up to nine members, with only one being a federal employee, and will select a chairman. Members will be compensated as per Fishery Management Council guidelines. The design team is not an advisory committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and will hold meetings for deliberations. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to include a Mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone for Highly Migratory Species. Pelagic longline fishing is prohibited in specific zones during certain periods of the year. The Mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone for Highly Migratory Species prohibits pelagic longline fishing in the lower mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone from June 15 to September 1 each year, defined by specific coordinates. The upper mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone is defined by specific coordinates, including 38 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, 74 degrees 0 minutes west longitude, and others in succession. The upper mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone is defined by specific coordinates, including 38 degrees 0 minutes north latitude, 74 degrees 0 minutes west longitude. The Secretary of Commerce is required to submit interim and final reports to Congress on research findings within a 4-year period. Authorization of $5,000,000 for research on closures, gear configurations, or fishing techniques under the upper mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone for fiscal years 2004 through 2008."
