    "content": "Bayesian Deep Q-Network (BDQN) is a Thompson sampling based RL Algorithm that introduces uncertainty at the output layer through a Bayesian Linear Regression model. It allows for efficient exploration in high dimensions and outperforms DDQN in Atari Arcade Learning Environments. Achieving an optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation is a key goal in RL. Recent advances in deep RL focus on exploration in high dimensional spaces. The \u03b5-greedy method, commonly used for exploration, scales poorly with the dimensionality of state and action spaces. Alternative approaches like optimism-under-uncertainty and Thompson Sampling (TS) have been considered to address this issue. TS, a Bayesian approach, is a heuristic for multi-arm bandits that starts with a prior distribution. Thompson Sampling (TS) is a Bayesian approach for multi-arm bandits that maximizes expected return by updating beliefs based on data. It offers targeted exploration by balancing uncertainty and expected rewards. Scaling TS to large state spaces has been challenging due to the complexity of sampling from general posterior distributions. Bayesian deep Q-networks (BDQN) is a practical Thompson sampling framework for deep reinforcement learning. It approximates the posterior distribution on Q-functions and incorporates uncertainty at the output layer using a Bayesian linear regression model. BDQN allows for efficient sampling from the Gaussian distribution and generalizes well to state-action pairs, even if they are visited rarely. BDQN is compared to DDQN on Atari games, showing significant gains in learning speed and returns. BDQN can handle higher learning rates, indicating faster learning and better scores. The results suggest BDQN can benefit from additional modifications like Prioritized Experience Replay, Dueling approach, A3C, and safe exploration. BDQN is compared to DDQN on Atari games, showing significant gains in learning speed and returns. BDQN can handle higher learning rates, indicating faster learning and better scores. The complexity of the exploration-exploitation trade-off has been extensively studied in RL literature. Regret guarantees are provided in multi-armed bandit problems and regret analyses in MDPs. In RL, various algorithms like Thompson Sampling and Posterior Sampling RL have shown promising results with high probability regret bounds. These approaches address the exploration-exploitation trade-offs in different settings such as multi-armed bandit problems and Partially Observable MDPs. Despite theoretical advancements, these trade-offs remain a challenge in reinforcement learning. Recent success in video games has led to increased research interest in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applications such as robotics, energy management, and self-driving cars. The \u03b5-greedy strategy is commonly used for exploration in DRL agents, but posterior sampling for policy or value is computationally challenging for large systems. Randomized value functions can be used to approximate posterior samples for the value function in high-dimensional problems. The use of randomized value functions to approximate posterior samples for the value function efficiently is explored. Different methods like Bayesian regression and bootstrapped-ensemble approaches are suggested to address scalability issues in large-scale reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. Various approaches have been proposed to improve DQN performance, but they often come with increased computational costs and only yield modest gains in Atari games. Additionally, Bayesian regression in the last layer of neural networks has been investigated for tasks like object recognition and image caption generation. In this work, a new approach is presented that extends randomized least-squares value iteration to deep neural networks by approximating the posterior with Bayesian linear regression on the last layer. This method offers simplicity, robustness, targeted exploration, and improved sample complexity and final performance compared to previous methods. O'Donoghue et al. also study constructing frequentist confidence of regression on the feature space of neural networks for reinforcement learning problems, while another approach suggests running linear regression on the representation layer of deep networks. In this work, a new approach extends randomized least-squares value iteration to deep neural networks by approximating the posterior with Bayesian linear regression on the last layer. The method offers simplicity, robustness, targeted exploration, and improved sample complexity and final performance compared to previous methods. BID20 proposes drop-out as a randomized exploration method, while BID39 argues about its estimated uncertainty and exploitation difficulty. Most methods are based on \u03b5-exploration, but TS strategies exploit uncertainties and expected returns for randomized exploration, unlike \u03b5-greedy strategies. The TS based agent in deep RL explores actions 5 and 6 by balancing expected returns and uncertainties, unlike the \u03b5\u2212greedy strategy which ignores this trade-off. The agent uses a moving window of replay buffer to update its belief in the low return of these actions over time. The TS agent in deep RL balances expected returns and uncertainties, unlike the \u03b5\u2212greedy strategy. It randomizes over Q-functions with high promising returns and uncertainty, increasing the posterior probability of the true Q-function when selected. The TS agent in deep RL quickly finds the true Q-function by choosing functions that predict accurately. In contrast, the \u03b5-greedy agent takes exponentially longer to reach the target due to randomizing actions. An infinite horizon \u03b3-discounted MDP involves state, action, transition, and reward functions, where the agent must make decisions under its policy at each time step. The agent aims to optimize expected rewards by transitioning to a successor state under a probability distribution. The objective is to maximize overall discounted rewards over a policy mapping states to actions. To find the optimal policy, one can solve a Linear Programming problem or calculate the average discounted reward under a given policy. To find the optimal policy in Reinforcement Learning, one can solve a Linear Programming problem or use the Bellman equation. However, since the transition kernel and reward function are unknown, methods like minimizing the Bellman residual or using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with backpropagation are employed to improve the quality of the Q-function. The setting in DDQN involves introducing a target network Q target to reduce estimator bias. A Bayesian method is proposed to approximate the Q-function and match it to the target value using Bayesian linear regression on the feature representation layer. This method efficiently captures uncertainty over the Q-values in DQN architecture. In DDQN, a Bayesian method is used for Q-function approximation through Bayesian linear regression on the feature representation layer, capturing uncertainty over Q-values in DQN architecture. The Q-functions are approximated as a linear combination of features, with target values determined by a generative model. In DDQN, Bayesian linear regression is used for Q-function approximation, capturing uncertainty over Q-values in DQN architecture. The Q-functions are approximated as a linear combination of features, with target values determined by a generative model. The posterior distribution is calculated for selecting actions and updating the model based on observed rewards and successor states. The posterior distribution over weights and the function Q is approximated in BDQN. The agent interacts with the environment using actions proposed by TS and utilizes experience replay buffer. The agent samples weight vectors and acts optimally based on the sampled means. The BDQN algorithm updates network weights based on drawn weights and uses a replay buffer. The agent samples weight vectors and acts optimally. The network architecture includes convolution layers with specific filters and sizes. The BDQN algorithm updates network weights using drawn weights and a replay buffer. It includes convolution layers with specific filters and sizes. The last convolution layer has 64 filters of size 3 followed by fully connected layers with size 512. A BLR layer is added on top. Training is done using RMSProp with a learning rate of 0.0025 and momentum of 0.95. Weight updates are based on the mean of the posterior distribution over the weights of BLR. The BDQN algorithm updates network weights using a replay buffer containing 32 samples. The posterior distribution of weight set W is updated every T Bayes target using a mini-batch of size B sampled uniformly from the replay buffer. Hyper-parameters for BLR include noise variance \u03c3, variance of prior over weights \u03c3, sample size B, posterior update period T Bayes target, and posterior sampling period T sample. A simple hyper-parameter tuning procedure was used to optimize these parameters, demonstrating the robustness of BDQN. The BDQN algorithm updates network weights using a replay buffer with 32 samples. Hyper-parameter tuning was done to optimize parameters such as noise variance, sample size, and posterior update period. BDQN showed improved performance with efficient TS exploration and closed form BLR, learning a better policy in a shorter time compared to DQN. The proposed hyper-parameter search for BDQN is simple and likely to provide better performance compared to exhaustive search. BDQN uses 16 times fewer samples in its BLR part compared to DDQN, while still achieving larger scores in Deep-RL experiments. For example, DDQN achieves a score of 64.67k in the game Atlantis after 200M samples during evaluation. BDQN outperforms DDQN in the game Atlantis, reaching 3.24M score after 40M samples compared to DDQN's 64.67k score after 200M samples. BDQN saturates for Atlantis after 20M samples but improves after relaxing the max_episode limit. BDQN shows consistent improvements in multiple runs on different games like Amidar. Additional experiments on Pong show promising results. The text chunk discusses potential modifications and strategies to further improve BDQN's performance in reinforcement learning. It mentions exploring Prioritized Experience Replay, Dueling approach, A3C, safe exploration, and combining uncertainty with BDQN. Additionally, it discusses policy gradient as another approach to learn the policy and explores the advantage of TS based exploration over regularizing the policy. The text chunk discusses the sensitivity of DQN and DDQN to learning rates, with higher rates causing performance degradation. It also compares the computational and sample costs of BDQN and DQN, noting that BDQN is cheaper due to having one less layer. The last layer of BDQN sees 16 times fewer samples compared to DQN, giving BDQN a speed advantage of almost 70% over DQN in updating the posterior distribution. This is achieved by drawing B samples from the replay buffer and computing their feature vectors. The choice of Thompson sampling update frequency is crucial for BDQN. If the update frequency is too short, the gradient for backpropagation becomes noisy. If it is too low, it loses randomized exploration property. The current frequency is suitable for Atari games but may need adjustment for RL problems with shorter horizons. For RL problems with shorter horizons, introducing parameters T sample and W is suggested. These parameters are used for making TS actions and backpropagation of feature representation. In the game Assault, using T sample and W did not show much difference, so they were set to default values. However, for RL settings with shorter horizons, it is recommended to use them. In the game Atlantis, removing the maximum episode length limit resulted in BDQN achieving a score of 62M. Despite the long episode length filling half of the replay buffer, the model loses some skill at the beginning of the game. After losing a long episode, the agent forgets some skills but quickly recovers and achieves a score of 30M. To address the issue of losing skills at the beginning of the game despite achieving a score of 30M, one can expand the replay buffer size, stochastically store samples with lower chances, or train new models for later parts of the episode. Various solutions exist for this observation, without altering the BDQN structure compared to DDQN."
