    "content": "Iran has sought Russian assistance due to limited alternatives, not necessarily because of strategic or ideological affinity. The relationship is tempered by a fear of Russian power and intentions, dating back to historical events such as treaties dividing Iran's control, Russian occupation during World War I, and Soviet invasions in 1941. The Soviet Union's refusal to withdraw completely from Iran after World War II and the establishment of autonomous zones in northern Iran heightened Iranian fears. The Islamic revolution in 1979 considered Soviet ideology anathema, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 revived Iranian concerns about Moscow's intentions. The Soviet Union's support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war raised Iranian fears of territorial ambitions. The devastation of Iran's arsenal led to a need for rearmament, providing an opportunity for Iran and the Soviet Union to pursue mutual interests. The U.S. military buildup in the Gulf during the war caused concern in Moscow about American hegemony. Iran's limited options for arms suppliers led to increased Soviet influence in the Gulf through arms sales. Iran and the Soviet Union established arms and technology relationship, including collaboration on nuclear energy and military capacity. The breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 elevated Iran's strategic importance for Russia. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia was concerned about Iran spreading revolutionary Islam into former Soviet Muslim states. Russia linked arms and technology sales to Iran refraining from political meddling in these states. The Persian Gulf crisis in 1990-1991 solidified the US as the primary arms supplier to Gulf monarchies. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia sought new arms clients to compensate for lost markets. Despite US efforts to deter arms sales to Iran due to potential WMD threats, Russia continued its arms and technology relationships with Iran. Iran and Russia also have conflicting claims on Caspian Sea energy resources. The Clinton Administration imposed sanctions on Russian entities for dealing with Iran but avoided sanctioning the Russian government. They focused on promoting economic and political reform in Russia, arms control, and containing the threat posed by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Some observers noted that these objectives sometimes overshadowed calls to link U.S.-Russia relations to other issues. The Bush Administration has been hesitant to criticize Russia for its arms and technology relationship with Iran, despite some Russian entities being sanctioned for selling weapons to state sponsors of terrorism. Russia has been cooperative with the United States in response to the September 11 attacks, allowing the use of bases in Central Asia for the war effort in Afghanistan. In 1991, Soviet arms ordered by Iran began flowing to the Islamic Republic. In the mid-1990s, Russia delivered fewer arms than Iran had ordered, including MiG-29 and Su-24 combat aircraft, T-72 tanks, surface-to-air missile systems, and Kilo-class submarines. The purchases raised concerns about a heightened threat to U.S. naval and international shipping in the Gulf. Iran planned to spend $2 billion per year to rebuild its conventional arsenal. Iran planned to spend $2 billion per year to rebuild its conventional arsenal and become the pre-eminent Persian Gulf power. In response, Congress passed the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, imposing sanctions on foreign firms and countries contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire weapons. The law did not clearly define \"destabilizing numbers and types\" of advanced conventional weapons, giving the President discretion. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 imposed sanctions on foreign firms and countries contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire weapons. The Act did not clearly define \"destabilizing numbers and types\" of advanced conventional weapons, giving the President discretion. The threat of sanctions helped the US extract a pledge from Russia not to enter new arms contracts with Iran in 1995. This pledge was necessary for the US to agree to Russia's membership in the Waasenaar Arrangement. The 1995 Moscow summit resolved outstanding issues with arms sales to Iran, allowing Russia to join the post-COCOM regime. Remaining issues were resolved in June 1995, and Russia provided a list of military items delivered to Iran. However, Russia did not honor the agreement to end all deliveries to Iran by December 31, 1999. A partial text of the U.S.-Russian understandings on arms sales to Iran was printed in the Washington Times. The Aide Memoire from 1995 regarding Russia's arms sales to Iran was published in the Washington Times on October 17, 2000. It stated Russia's obligation to refrain from new arms contracts with Iran and not increase existing arms transfers. The reference to the \"new regime\" likely alluded to the upcoming Wassenaar Arrangement. The Aide Memoire also mentioned an Annex detailing planned Russian transfers to Iran. The 1995 Aide Memoire outlined Russia's commitment to cease arms transfers to Iran by December 31, 1999. It specified weapons such as a submarine, tanks, armored vehicles, mines, cluster bombs, and missiles that Russia had provided to Iran. The United States was prepared to avoid penalties for Russia in light of these commitments. The United States is willing to avoid penalties for Russia regarding arms transfers to Iran as long as Russia complies with commitments. Russia informed the US in November 2000 that it would no longer be bound by the pledge to refrain from new arms deals with Iran, but assured that only \"defensive\" weapons would be sold. Russia assured the United States it would sell only \"defensive\" weapons to Iran, but the Clinton Administration was unsatisfied. In late December 2000, Russia's Defense Minister visited Iran and agreed to train Iranian military personnel. An agreement was signed on October 2, 2001, for Iran to purchase arms from Russia over the next 5 years, including combat aircraft, anti-ship missiles, and the S-300 air defense system. Iran signed arms purchase agreements valued at about $700 million in 2001, potentially including the deal with Russia. The Bush Administration could impose sanctions on Russia for these new sales to Iran. The Clinton Administration did not impose sanctions on Russia for arms sales to Iran as they were part of a contract signed before the 1996 law was enacted. The law imposes sanctions on suppliers of conventional arms to countries on the U.S. \"terrorism list,\" including Iran. The sanctions apply to any arms sales, not just those considered \"destabilizing.\" The Clinton and Bush Administrations did not impose sanctions on Russia for arms sales to Iran, despite the 1996 law. Sanctions were imposed on Russian entities for arms sales to Syria, Libya, Sudan, and Syria, but not on the Russian government. The Clinton and Bush Administrations did not sanction Russia for arms sales to Iran, despite the 1996 law. Sanctions were imposed on Russian entities for arms sales to Syria, Libya, and Sudan, but not on the Russian government. Russia has been a primary supplier of Iran's ballistic missile programs, providing training, testing equipment, components, and technology assistance that frustrated the Clinton Administration and Congress. The Clinton Administration and Congress sought to enlist greater Russian government cooperation in halting technology flow to Iran through engagement and sanctions. Critics in Congress argued for broad sanctions on Russia for insincerity in cracking down on technology exports to Iran. H.R. 2709, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, passed in the 105th Congress but was vetoed by the Administration on June 23, 1998. The Clinton Administration vetoed H.R. 2709 on June 23, 1998, citing improved Russian government cooperation in controlling technology exports to Iran. However, Iran's test of the Shahab-3 missile in July 1998 led to the Administration issuing Executive Order 13094 to prevent congressional action to override the veto. The Clinton Administration issued executive orders in November 1994 to sanction foreign entities assisting WMD programs in Iran. Russian entities were sanctioned for aiding Iran's missile and nuclear programs. In July 1999, the Administration increased quotas for Russian cooperation on export controls. In April 2000, the Clinton Administration praised Russia for reprimanding the rector of BSTU and canceling training for Iranian students. Sanctions were extended to the rector, Yuri Savelyev, while sanctions on other missile-related entities were dropped. This signaled hope for increased cooperation under President Putin compared to his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. The Clinton Administration dropped sanctions on the INOR Scientific Center and Polyus Scientific Production Associates due to the end of their technology relationships with Iran. Despite individual Russian experts still selling expertise to Iran, the U.S. allowed the quota on commercial use of Russian space launches to expire in 2000. Congress pushed for stronger measures to stop missile assistance to Iran, leading to the introduction of the Iran Nonproliferation Act in 1999. H.R. 1883 authorized the President to impose sanctions on Russian entities assisting Iran's missile and WMD programs. The law includes bans on U.S. government procurement, assistance, sales of defense articles, and exports of dual-use items to the entities. It also prohibits U.S. payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency related to the international space station unless certified otherwise. The Iran Nonproliferation Act allows the President to impose sanctions on Russian entities aiding Iran's missile and WMD programs, with exceptions for astronaut safety and space station hardware. NASA testified about continued payments to Russian entities for space station work under the Act's exemption. Russian assistance to Iran's ballistic missile programs persists. Evidence suggests that Russian assistance to Iran's ballistic missile programs continues, with Russian entities supplying goods and know-how to countries like Iran, Libya, India, and China. Concerns have been raised since Iran signed a contract with Russia in 1995 for a nuclear power reactor at Bushehr, with worries about Iran's potential nuclear weapons program. Despite delays, Russia plans for the project to be operational by 2005, with Iranian technicians undergoing training in Russia. Russia began nuclear plant operations training in 2002 and floated a plan to build five reactors in Iran, which was met with US concerns. The Clinton Administration preferred to work with Russia to limit the project scope and waived provisions of foreign aid laws to separate the issue from broader US-Russian relations. The Clinton Administration worked with Russia to limit aid cuts related to Iran's nuclear programs, imposing sanctions on specific entities when necessary. The focus was on engagement rather than punishment, yielding benefits such as Russian pledges to not supply Iran with certain technologies. The Clinton Administration successfully persuaded Russia to block a sale of a laser device to Iran for its nuclear weapons program. In regional diplomacy, the administration dealt a setback to the Bushehr project by convincing Ukraine to drop the sale of turbines for the reactor. Russia later finalized an agreement with Iran to reprocess spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehr project, causing concerns in Congress about indirect support for a project the US opposes. The United States strongly opposes the Bushehr project and has provided about $1.5 million in technical assistance through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). There were efforts in Congress to end the exemption for IAEA funding to Bushehr, but it was ultimately included in an FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill. Some argue that funding IAEA assistance ensures access to information on the project and helps ensure safe operation in the future. The IAEA is assisting in ensuring the safe operation of the Bushehr project in Iran. Recent U.S. reports suggest Iran has sought chemical weapons technology and biotechnical materials from Russia and China. Iran has also recruited Russian scientists for its biological program, with U.S. statements acknowledging the challenges in preventing outside assistance due to the dual-use nature of the materials. The absence of public discussion on the provision of Russian chemical or biological technology to Iran suggests that intense U.S. diplomatic pressure has not been deemed necessary. Iran and China have had fluctuating relations, with China seeing a strong Iran as an obstacle to Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf. Relations between Iran and China thawed in the late 1960s and 1970s, despite Iran cutting diplomatic ties with China after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. During the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, China became a key arms supplier to Iran, providing missile technology agreements and supplying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles. Iran used these missiles against U.S. Navy-escorted oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and Kuwait. In 1988, Iran fired Silkworms at U.S. Navy-escorted oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and Kuwaiti oil terminals. China reportedly helped Iran develop ballistic missiles and extend their ranges. President Ali Khamene'i visited China in 1989 to strengthen defense and political ties. Iran buys arms from China to counter U.S. pressure and build alliances with other major powers. China sees arms sales to Iran as a way to divert U.S. military forces from Taiwan and as retribution for U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. China aims to expand its influence in the Middle East, maintaining good relations with moderate Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt. China's interests in Iran include securing oil supplies and selling weapons and technology. The United States has a broad agenda with China, focusing on nonproliferation, Taiwan dispute, trade relations, and human rights. The Clinton Administration faced decisions on imposing sanctions on China for its relations with Iran, with some critics questioning its willingness to accept China's nonproliferation pledges. The Clinton Administration faced criticism for being too trusting of China's nonproliferation promises. Some in Congress push for sanctions if China aids Iran with WMD technology. Despite efforts by the Clinton Administration to slow cooperation between China and Iran on WMD programs, concerns arose after President Khatemi's visit to China in 2000. The Bush Administration has imposed sanctions on numerous Chinese entities for proliferation activities with Iran, while also seeking China's cooperation in the war on terrorism. Reports indicate that China continues to supply advanced conventional arms. China has been providing advanced conventional arms and WMD-related technology to Iran, including artillery pieces, tanks, missiles, combat aircraft, anti-ship cruise missiles, and fast attack craft. This has raised concerns in the U.S. about Iran's ability to strike American forces and commercial shipping in the Gulf. Iran received 15 Hudong fast attack craft, with five going to the Revolutionary Guard and ten to the regular Navy. The ships are equipped with C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles supplied by China. Iran also tested Chinese-supplied missiles on its F-4 Phantom aircraft, prompting concerns about its threat to U.S. forces. Congressional debate focused on the Chinese missile transfers. The debate over Chinese anti-ship missile transfers in the early 1990s raised concerns about triggering U.S. sanctions under the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992. In 1996, Congress urged sanctions on China for the C-802 transfers, but the Clinton Administration opted to negotiate with China instead. Despite disagreements in Congress, the issue quieted down after China pledged to Secretary of State Albright in September 1997. China pledged to halt sales of C-802's and C-801's to Iran in 1997 and 1998. However, reported sales of modified anti-ship cruise missiles and patrol boats with anti-ship missiles to Iran by China have raised concerns, although they technically do not violate China's pledges. China reportedly supplied missiles to Iran in 2002, with ongoing support for Iran's Shahab missile program. In the mid-1990s, China sold guidance technology and missile equipment to Iran. The Clinton Administration attempted to limit China's missile assistance to Iran through diplomatic means. No entire M-9 or M-11 ballistic missiles have been confirmed to be delivered to Iran. In 1997, the State Department stated that China had not violated its commitment to the MTCR. The Clinton Administration offered China cooperation on commercial space ventures in exchange for ending assistance to Iran's ballistic missile programs. An agreement was reached in 2000 where China pledged not to assist other countries in developing ballistic missiles and adopted a control regime for technology exports. The U.S. dropped the insistence on China joining the MTCR and resumed commercial space cooperation. The U.S. resumed commercial space cooperation with China and Pakistan, while also sanctioning entities in Pakistan and Iran. Reports raised concerns about relying too heavily on bilateral anti-proliferation agreements with China. The Bush Administration sanctioned Chinese firm Norinco for shipping materials to Iran's missile program. The Bush Administration sanctioned entities in China for their involvement in Iran's missile program under various authorities, including the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act and the Iran Nonproliferation Act. The sanctioned entities may be duplicating names or involved in multiple WMD programs in Iran. For the list of sanctioned entities, refer to the Federal Register on January 24, 2002; May 16, 2002; and July 25, 2002. In the nuclear field, the Clinton Administration extracted significant pledges from China to limit its relationship with Iran, including blocking a deal for a uranium conversion facility. Despite a written assurance to end nuclear relations with Iran, two small ongoing projects were allowed to be completed. The Clinton Administration secured pledges from China to restrict nuclear cooperation with Iran. One project involves supplying a zirconium production facility for Iran's civilian nuclear program, while the other is to build a research reactor. The US promised to certify China's cooperation in ending nuclear proliferation in exchange for the pledge. Despite assurances to end nuclear relations with Iran, two small projects were completed. Recent reports suggest China may not be fully complying with the pledge. Since the early 1990s, U.S. officials have identified Chinese firms as suppliers of Iran's chemical weapons program. Sanctions were imposed on two PRC firms and individuals for aiding Iran's chemical weapons programs, with the Clinton Administration stating no evidence of PRC government awareness. The State Department suspended an Exim Bank loan for a U.S. firm's exports to a Chinese firm in Nanjing. China expanded chemical export controls to address U.S. concerns. The Bush Administration imposed sanctions on Chinese chemical firms for assisting Iran's chemical weapons program in multiple cases. The Bush Administration imposed sanctions on Chinese firms, including Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import-Export Corporation, Liyang Chemical Equipment Company, and Zibo Chemical Equipment Plant, for assisting Iran's chemical weapons program. North Korea has aligned itself with countries like Iran, Libya, and Syria to oppose U.S. policy and build alliances against U.S. global influence. Iran and North Korea have a history of supporting each other in their opposition to the United States. They have cooperated in various ways, including sharing missile technology and criticizing US military presence in different regions. Both countries have also faced US economic sanctions and have been labeled as \"rogue states\" by the US. Iran and North Korea, along with Iraq, were labeled as part of an \"axis of evil\" by President Bush in 2002. North Korea distanced itself from Islamic terrorist groups, while Iran has been identified as a state sponsor of terrorism. Despite being part of the axis of evil, the US later shifted towards engagement with North Korea, similar to the Clinton Administration's approach. In 2002, a crisis emerged as North Korea admitted to working on uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons and unfroze its plutonium program. This coincided with revelations of new nuclear sites in Iran. There is no evidence of collaboration between Iran and North Korea on nuclear weapons, but they do have a defense relationship focused on ballistic missiles. During Iran's war with Iraq, North Korea provided Iran with ballistic missiles and other weapons, as well as training for Revolutionary Guard. North Korea also supplied Scud-C missiles to Iran in the 1990s, leading to sanctions by the U.S. in 1992. In March 1992, a North Korean ship believed to be carrying Scud-C missiles was tracked by U.S. Navy ships. In the early 1990s, Iran discussed purchasing Nodong 1 missiles from North Korea. U.S. scrutiny and sanctions on North Korean entities led Iran to develop the Shahab missile based on the Nodong design. In August 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il admitted to selling complete missiles to Iran and Syria, which Iran denied. The Clinton Administration engaged with North Korea in efforts to halt their nuclear program and missile development, including activities with Iran and other countries. In 1997, trade sanctions were imposed on North Korean firms for missile-related activities involving Iran and Pakistan. In 1999, a U.S. envoy offered to lift sanctions on North Korea in exchange for halting missile testing and exports. In July 2000, U.S.-North Korea talks on missile exports faltered when the United States refused North Korea's demand for $1 billion annually for three years. The Clinton Administration was close to a nonproliferation agreement with North Korea before President Clinton left office, but no final agreement was reached. Sanctions were imposed on North Korean entities assisting Iran, and in February 2000, it was confirmed that North Korea had delivered critical engines to Iran. In April 2000, the US imposed sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities for missile technology proliferation activities. The sanctioned entities included Changgwang Sinyong Corporation from North Korea, and Ministry of Defense, Aerospace Industries Organization, Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, and Sannam Industrial Group from Iran. The sanctions included restrictions on exports, government contracts, and imports to the US, but were deemed to have little to no effect. The US sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities for missile technology proliferation have had little to no effect. Despite efforts to stop North Korean exports to the Middle East, North Korean assistance to Iranian weapons programs continues. The CIA report in January 2002 stated that North Korean entities are still supplying crucial ballistic missile-related equipment, technology, and expertise to Iran. Both the Clinton and Bush Administrations have sanctioned Changgwang for missile proliferation to Iran. Iran and North Korea are reportedly cooperating on anti-ship missiles, with Iran sending C-802 missiles to North Korea for upgrades. Iran may also be seeking North Korean help in manufacturing the missiles due to China cutting off supplies. Iran is willing to deal with various suppliers to acquire needed technology, including those with former Soviet-bloc equipment. Iran is acquiring technology from Russia and attempting to approach entities in Western Europe for WMD and missile technology. Major suppliers to Iran include Poland, the U.S., Moldova, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic. The U.S. successfully dissuaded Ukraine from supplying turbines for the Bushehr nuclear reactor project in 1998. In 1999, a Czech firm signed a contract to supply air conditioning technology for the Bushehr reactor, which the U.S. Administration asked the Czech government to ban. The Czech government drafted legislation to prevent Czech firms from supplying technology for the Bushehr reactor in Iran. Past CIA reports mentioned Indian firms supplying Iran's chemical weapons program, but recent reports do not specify India as a supplier. Sanctions against Chinese entities also included an individual of Indian origin, Hans Raj Shiv. The determination in May 2002 imposed sanctions on entities from China, Moldova, and Armenia for chemical and missile proliferation to Iran. The governments of Moldova and Armenia were not sanctioned, and there was no indication of their knowledge of the sanctioned activity."
