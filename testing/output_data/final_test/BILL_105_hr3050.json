SEC. 201 of TITLE II regulates unfair and deceptive acts in connection with slamming. The Commission must create rules to prevent unfair and deceptive practices in advertisements or solicitations for changing a subscriber's telephone service provider. These rules require clear disclosure of the intent to change providers and the associated costs. The rules prohibit changing a subscriber's telephone service provider without following verification procedures set by the FCC. Advertisements offering prizes or services must disclose costs clearly. The rules require disclosure of odds for receiving prizes or services offered at no or reduced cost, and compliance with additional standards to prevent unfair practices. Common carriers must provide contracts and records to the Commission for any solicitation of changes in telephone services. The Commission will require common carriers to disclose odds for prizes or services, comply with standards to prevent unfair practices, and provide contracts and financial information for any solicitation of changes in telephone services. Rules must be issued within 270 days of the Act's enactment in accordance with federal regulations. Enforcement of rules prescribed under the Act will be treated as violations of unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Communications common carriers will be under the jurisdiction of the Commission for enforcement purposes. SEC. 202. ACTIONS BY STATES. Whenever an attorney general of a State believes that residents are being harmed by a violation of a Commission rule, the State can file a civil action in a US district court to stop the violation, enforce compliance, seek damages, or obtain other appropriate relief. The State must notify the Commission and provide a copy of the complaint before taking legal action. The State must provide immediate notice to the Commission when taking legal action against a violation of a Commission rule. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, and file petitions for appeal. Civil actions can be brought in a district court where the violation occurred, and the attorney general has investigatory powers to bring such actions. The attorney general in a State can conduct investigations and administer oaths, but State court proceedings can still proceed based on alleged violations of civil or criminal antifraud statutes. During a civil action by the Commission, no State can initiate a separate civil action against a defendant named in the Commission's complaint for the same violation. Other State officials can also take actions related to violations under this Act. State officials authorized by the Commission can bring actions in State court for consumer protection against violators of Commission rules. Other State officials can also take actions related to violations under this Act. SEC. 203. ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICABILITY OF TITLE.
