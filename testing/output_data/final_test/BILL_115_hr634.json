The termination of the Election Assistance Commission will not affect prior contracts or payments made by the Commission. Recipients of payments can still use unobligated funds after the Commission's termination date. For states receiving requirements payments, the terms and conditions for using the payment will be based on general federal rules and regulations. If general terms and conditions conflict with those specified under specific sections, the latter will apply. The termination of the Commission will not affect pending proceedings, with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget taking over. Orders, appeals, judgments, and payments can still proceed in such cases. Orders, judgments, and payments can continue even after the termination of the Commission, with proceedings being transferred to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Any orders issued will remain in effect until modified or revoked by authorized officials or a court. The discontinuance or modification of proceedings can still occur under the same terms as if the Commission had not been terminated. Regulations for transferring proceedings to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under section 1002 are subject to judicial review. Judicial review applies to orders and actions of the Director as if issued by the Commission, with the same requirements for notice, hearings, and administrative review. \"SEC. 1004 transfers certain functions to the Federal Election Commission from the Election Assistance Commission. SEC. 1005 sets the Commission termination date.\" \"SEC. 1005 establishes the Commission termination date as the first date after a 60-day period from the enactment of the title. The Technical Guidelines Development Committee will be terminated on this date.\" The text chunk outlines the termination of the Commission, transfer of functions to the Office of Management and Budget, savings provisions, return of authority to the Federal Election Commission, and the Commission termination date. Conforming amendments related to the return of certain authority to the Federal Election Commission are also mentioned. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 are amended to transfer duties to the Federal Election Commission. The effective date of these amendments is tied to the Commission termination date outlined in the Help America Vote Act of 2002."
