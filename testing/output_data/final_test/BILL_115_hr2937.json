It also mentions state memoranda of understanding for certain remediation efforts. State programs approved under subsection (d) can enter into memoranda of understanding with relevant agencies to remediate mine drainage on abandoned land and water impacted by mines. The memorandum must establish a strategy to address water pollution from mine drainage at eligible sites. The curr_chunk discusses procedures for reclamation and mine drainage abatement expenditures under section 404, including ensuring improved water quality, monitoring, sampling, reporting of information, operation and maintenance of treatment systems, and other necessary purposes as determined by State or Federal agencies. Public review and comment are required before submitting a memorandum. Before submitting a memorandum for approval, a State must invite public comments and hold a public meeting accessible to those affected. Notice of the meeting must be published at least 15 days in advance through various means. The State must submit a memorandum to the Secretary and the Administrator for approval within 120 days. If approved, the memorandum becomes part of the State's abandoned mine reclamation plan. Additionally, Community Reclaimer Partnerships are established. The Secretary shall approve a Community Reclaimer project to remediate abandoned mine lands within 120 days if certain criteria are met, including the project being conducted by a Community Reclaimer or approved subcontractors, consistency with an approved State memorandum of understanding, and conduction on inventoried sites. The proposed project must meet submission criteria, and the State must assume responsibility for project costs and damages, except for gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the Community Reclaimer or project site owner.
