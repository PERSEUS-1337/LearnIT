The Congress finds that revisions to the new source review regulations under the Clean Air Act have raised concerns about air pollution consequences for 17,000 industrial facilities nationwide.

EPA's final revisions to the regulations require adoption by states, tribes, or municipalities. The final revisions to the new source review program require adoption by states, tribes, or municipalities within a specified timeframe.

The purpose of the Act is to preserve the ability of states, tribes, municipalities, and air pollution control agencies to protect public health and the environment by giving them the discretion to decide whether or not to implement the EPA's August 27, 2003 new source review revisions.
