    "content": "In 1891, Congress authorized the President to establish forest reserves from federal lands. The Forest Service Organic Administration Act in 1897 defined the purposes of the reserves, focusing on improving and protecting forests, ensuring water flows, and providing timber for US citizens. Initially under the General Land Office, the reserves were transferred to the Department of Agriculture in 1905, creating a new agency. The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) was created in 1905 to manage national forests, which expanded to 193 million acres by 2010. The goals of the National Forest System (NFS) include improving and protecting forests, securing water flows, and providing timber for citizens. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 expanded these goals to include outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act (MUSYA) defines multiple-use management of national forest resources, balancing recreation, timber, grazing, water, and wildlife to meet the needs of the American people. National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each unit of the NFS, to be amended as needed and revised periodically. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires interdisciplinary planning every 15 years, combining physical, biological, economic sciences, and public participation. Controversial provisions include ensuring plans comply with NEPA, promoting diversity of plant and animal communities, and limiting timber harvesting to specific areas. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires interdisciplinary planning every 15 years, combining physical, biological, economic sciences, and public participation. Controversial provisions include ensuring plans comply with NEPA, promoting diversity of plant and animal communities, and limiting timber harvesting to specific areas. Section 6(g)(3)(E) and Section 6(k) of the NFMA outline criteria for timber harvesting to protect soil, water, and wildlife habitats, and identify lands unsuitable for timber production for a period of 10 years. The NFMA provisions aim to regulate timber harvesting on specific lands for 10 years, with criteria for soil, water, and wildlife protection. NEPA requirement can delay or prevent timber harvesting, while the biological diversity provision mandates maintaining viable populations of native and desirable non-native species. Litigation over the northern spotted owl led to a significant reduction in timber harvesting in the Pacific Northwest. The Clinton Administration finalized new rules in November 2000 to emphasize planning for the biological sustainability of national forests, but the Bush Administration delayed and replaced these rules in January 2005. The final Bush rules aimed to balance biological and socioeconomic sustainability, reduce regulatory guidelines, and exempt plans from NEPA and ESA. These rules were successfully challenged in 2007. The Bush administration's planning rules were challenged and reissued in 2007 to meet court requirements. The final rules were invalidated in 2009 for non-compliance with NEPA and ESA. In 2009, the Obama administration announced plans to develop new NFMA planning regulations. Congress has altered NFS management guidance for specific areas, emphasizing resources or values like recreation or wildlife. Special management areas have been established by Congress for some NFS lands. The National Wilderness Preservation System and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System are two systems of special management areas that include lands administered by federal land management agencies. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created the National Wilderness Preservation System with 54 areas totaling 9.1 million acres initially, which has now expanded to 759 wilderness areas totaling nearly 110 million acres in 44 states. 441 of these areas with 36.2 million acres are in the NFS. The Wilderness Act established objectives and standards for wilderness areas, defining them as undeveloped federal lands with minimal human impact, preserved to maintain natural conditions and provide solitude. The Wilderness Act set criteria for designated wilderness areas, emphasizing preservation of natural conditions, solitude, and ecological, geological, or historical value. Management guidelines include prohibiting commercial activities, infrastructure development, and motorized access. The Wilderness Act prohibits commercial activities, infrastructure development, and motorized access within designated wilderness areas. This includes banning timber harvesting, motor vehicles, motorized equipment, motorboats, aircraft, and any form of mechanical transport. The Wilderness Act prohibits commercial activities, infrastructure development, and motorized access within designated wilderness areas, including timber harvesting, motor vehicles, motorized equipment, motorboats, and aircraft. Exceptions include continued use of motorboats and aircraft, necessary measures for controlling wildfires and infestations, prospecting for minerals, and authorization of water resource projects by the President. Section 4(d) of the Wilderness Act allows for continued livestock grazing, commercial services, and mineral rights establishment under reasonable regulations. Additionally, it authorizes water resource projects and infrastructure access. Many wilderness statutes have exceptions to the general restrictions, such as access to private land and provisions for wildfire control. Access for livestock grazing and native tribal rights have been addressed in various wilderness statutes, allowing for continued grazing in wilderness areas and providing access for management purposes. These provisions have been reiterated in subsequent statutes to ensure the preservation of these activities in designated wilderness areas. Several wilderness statutes have provided access to designated wilderness areas for native traditional cultural and religious purposes, ensuring cooperation and protection of important tribal use areas. Provisions also allow for low-level military overflights since 1990. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of special airspace units and military flight training routes over designated wilderness areas. It also mentions provisions for installing weather-related equipment and facilities in these areas. Additionally, it touches on exceptions for motorized access for wildlife management, water resource infrastructure maintenance, motorboat access, aircraft use for specific purposes, and the establishment of water infrastructure and telecommunication equipment. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, aims to preserve designated free-flowing rivers and their surroundings. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, aims to preserve designated free-flowing rivers and their immediate environments for the benefit of present and future generations. Rivers can be added to the system by an act of Congress or through state nominations approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The system includes three classes of rivers - wild, scenic, and recreational - with varying levels of development restrictions along the river segments. Management of lands within the designated river corridor depends on the river's classification, with an emphasis on preserving the values that led to the designation. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System aims to preserve designated free-flowing rivers and their environments. Administration emphasizes protecting values that led to designation, with restrictions on uses that harm those values. The USFS manages national forest lands within the system under MUSYA and NFMA, prioritizing protection of esthetic, scenic, historic, archaeologic, and scientific features. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System aims to preserve designated free-flowing rivers and their environments. Congress has designated various special management areas with specific guidelines for each area, including national monuments, recreation areas, scenic areas, game refuges, protection areas, and others. Each special management area has its own management guidelines and restrictions enacted by Congress. There are no significant differences in the guidelines and restrictions for the different types of designations. Table 3 displays the number of areas for each major type of SMAs and the total designated area. The Appendix lists the 97 SMAs designated so far, with key provisions summarized. Common provisions for SMAs include administrative and resource management categories. Administrative provisions like findings are commonly enacted for SMAs in the National Forest System. Many SMA statutes include findings, purpose statements, explicit designation of the area, and directives to manage consistent with NFS laws. These provisions supplement existing governance for National Forest System lands. Many SMA statutes require a management plan for the designated area, often completed with public participation. Advisory committees are established for the area, focusing on public interests or scientific issues. Land acquisition for nonfederal land within the area is authorized by most SMA statutes. The SMA statutes authorize land acquisition for nonfederal land within the designated area. Many SMA statutes withdraw the lands from public land laws, such as the Homestead Act, but newer statutes are less likely to include this provision. Three resource provisions commonly included in SMA statutes address management of minerals, timber, and fish and wildlife, withdrawing the lands from mining and mineral leasing laws. The SMA statutes withdraw designated lands from public land laws and address management of minerals, timber, and fish and wildlife. Mining and mineral leasing laws are restricted, similar to the Wilderness Act. Timber harvesting is limited to fire control and safety measures. Fish and wildlife management provisions are also included in most SMA statutes. The SMA statutes retain state jurisdiction over animal management, focusing federal administration on habitat management. Hunting, fishing, and trapping are allowed, with provisions for seasonal and area closures to protect wildlife needs. Administrative provisions include regulations and inholder access for nonfederal landowners within SMAs. Some SMA statutes parallel the Wilderness Act, allowing \"reasonable\" access. Buffer zones may be prohibited around SMAs, similar to wilderness areas. Governance within SMAs should not affect state or local laws. Some statutes authorize appropriations for SMA administration. Some statutes governing Special Management Areas (SMAs) restrict motorized access and prohibit new road construction, with exceptions for replacement of environmentally damaging roads. Other statutes allow activities for wildfire, insect, and disease control within SMAs. Some SMAs statutes allow activities like controlling fires, insects, and diseases, livestock grazing where it existed prior to designation, and military overflights. Water use and water rights are also addressed in a few statutes designating SMAs. Some SMAs statutes address water use and water rights associated with the area, with provisions ranging from no effect on water rights to explicit reservations or denials. The 97 specially designated areas are grouped into six types: national monuments, recreation areas, scenic areas, game refuges, protection areas, and others, listed chronologically for each type of designation. Each entry includes the statute designating the area and the length of its provisions. National Monuments and volcanic monuments have been established within the National Forest System, varying in size from 55,000 acres to 2.3 million acres. Some were designated by acts of Congress, while others were established by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act of 1906. No general management guidance is provided for these areas.
