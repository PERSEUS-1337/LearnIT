The educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve increases based on the program pursued, with varying percentages for full-time, three-quarter time, half-time, and less than half-time education. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will determine the reduced percentage for less than half-time education. No payment will be made if tuition assistance is available from the military department concerned.

Amendments have been made to increase the educational assistance allowance for Reserve Components supporting contingency operations under section 16162(c)(4) of such title paid for months beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. Nonreduction in pay for federal employees on active duty in a reserve component of the uniformed services. Employees who are members of a reserve component and called to active duty for over 30 days will receive civilian basic pay minus military compensation to ensure no reduction in pay. The military compensation payable to an employee for active duty is allocated to each pay period. This compensation is applicable during active duty, hospitalization, or convalescence from duty-related illness or injury. It does not apply if the employee receives civilian basic pay for that pay period. The employee receives civilian basic pay for annual, military, or other paid leave. The amount payable is paid by the employing agency from the appropriate fund and time as civilian basic pay. Regulations will be prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management in consultation with the Secretary of Defense. The head of each agency must ensure that employee rights under this section are upheld. The Federal Aviation Administration Administrator will also ensure these rights for agency employees. Terms like 'active duty', 'member', and 'reserve component' are defined, and 'civilian basic pay' includes payments under section 5304. The 'employing agency' refers to the government entity responsible for payments to entitled employees. The agency or entity of the Government with reemployment rights under chapter 43 of title 38 is defined as 'military compensation' in section 101(21) of title 37. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code. Section 5538 of title 5, United States Code, ensures no pay reduction for active duty in a reserve component. The amendment applies to pay periods starting after the enactment of the Act. Assistance is provided to state and local governments continuing to pay employees on active duty in a reserve component of the uniformed services. Section 911 of title 37, United States Code, encourages state and local governments to continue paying employees who are also members of a reserve component and are on active duty for more than 30 days. The purpose is to ensure that these employees receive compensation equal to their civilian pay when combined with their military pay. Reimbursement is offered to governments that continue to pay a portion of civilian compensation. The Secretary concerned shall reimburse State or local governments for 50% of civilian compensation paid to employees on active duty, not exceeding the difference between civilian pay and military pay. Reimbursement for civilian compensation during extended pay periods on active duty is at 100 percent after nine consecutive months. The reimbursement covers the difference between civilian pay and military pay for the service period. Reimbursement for civilian compensation during extended pay periods on active duty is provided with respect to each pay period that occurs while the employee serves on active duty for more than 30 days, is hospitalized or convalescing from an illness or injury incurred during active duty, or during the 14-day period after active duty. If an employee fails to return to employment, reimbursement may be affected. If an employee fails to report or apply for employment with the government by the specified time, they must refund the reimbursement received. The obligation to refund is considered a debt to the United States, but the Secretary may waive it if recovery is deemed unfair. Bankruptcy does not discharge the employee from this debt within five years. The section specifies that bankruptcy does not discharge an employee from a debt arising under paragraph (1) in cases commenced under title 11. The Secretaries concerned will prescribe regulations to implement this section, and definitions for terms like 'civilian compensation,' 'local government,' 'military pay,' and 'State' are provided. The section specifies that bankruptcy does not discharge an employee from a debt arising under paragraph (1) in cases commenced under title 11. The United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and other territories or possessions are included. Section 911 of title 37, United States Code provides assistance for State and local governments paying employees on active duty. The amendment applies to pay periods starting after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a new section, 45N, is added to the Internal Revenue Code, allowing for an Active-Duty Reserve Component Employee Credit. The Active-Duty Reserve Component Employee Credit allows employers to claim a credit equal to 50% of compensation paid to an employee who is a member of a reserve component and absent from work for military duty. The credit is limited to 50% of the difference between the employee's regular compensation and military pay during the absence. The Active-Duty Reserve Component Employee Credit applies to employees who are members of a reserve component and are absent from work for military duty. It covers employees serving on active duty for more than 30 days, hospitalized or convalescing from duty-related illness or injury, or during a 14-day period after active duty. No credit is allowed for days when the employee was not scheduled to work for reasons other than military service. The Active-Duty Reserve Component Employee Credit applies to employees who are members of a reserve component and are absent from work for military duty. It covers employees serving on active duty for more than 30 days and defines compensation as remuneration for employment deductible from gross income. The credit is part of the general business credit under section 38 of the tax code. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the tax code is amended to include a new item after section 45M, as determined under section 45N(a). The amendments made by section 45N apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007."
