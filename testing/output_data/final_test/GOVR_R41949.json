    "content": "Since its establishment in 1945, Congress has shown interest in U.N. system development assistance. The U.N. Development System (UNDS) consists of 32 entities conducting development activities in 180 countries with an annual expenditure of $14.7 billion. The United States is a top donor to UNDS entities, contributing $1.306 billion in 2009. Congress appropriates funds to U.N. entities involved in development, demonstrating ongoing interest in UNDS efforts. The ongoing interest in UNDS efforts includes discussions on the role and efficiency of the U.N. system in international development, U.S. funding levels, and the effectiveness of development assistance. This report examines the origins and evolving role of the UNDS, its structure, funding levels, and current reform efforts. Congressional perspectives, Obama Administration policy, and UNDS reform are also discussed. The UNDS lacks a central mechanism for collecting and disseminating information about its activities, leading to coordination issues and duplication. Competition among U.N. entities is debated for its impact on overall UNDS efforts. Some experts believe competition can benefit U.N. development activities by improving services, but concerns exist about decentralized U.N. entities acting in their own interests. Non-core funding, the largest source of UNDS expenditures, raises worries about limited host country involvement, unpredictability impacting long-term planning, and funding mandates and missions. The UNDS comprises 32 U.N. entities, including Secretariat offices, specialized agencies, funds and programs, regional commissions, and other U.N. bodies. It aims to support countries in achieving social and economic progress through various development activities guided by national priorities. The UNDS, consisting of 32 U.N. entities, conducts development activities based on national priorities and international laws. Reforms have been proposed to enhance efficiency, including integrated planning, strengthened coordination, and harmonized agency activities. Recommendations for improvement have been consistent over the years. The Capacity Study highlighted issues with the U.N. development system, recommending steps to address governance, coordination, and administrative barriers. In 2006, a high-level expert panel found U.N. development assistance to be fragmented and weak, leading to inefficiencies and duplication. These challenges in institutional reform persist for the U.N. system and governments, including the United States, as they strive to improve. Despite challenges in institutional reform, efforts have been made to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the UN Development System (UNDS). Initiatives such as the U.N. Development Group (UNDG) and the Delivering as One (DAO) initiative have been established to enhance coordination and coherence among U.N. agencies at the country level. The DAO initiative, supported by the Obama Administration, aims to consolidate U.N. entities into one building with one budget and management structure. The United Nations' role in global development efforts evolved over time, with a focus on technical assistance and overall development activities. The General Assembly recognized the importance of expanding U.N. programs to include technical assistance under the Secretary-General in 1948. The United Nations established the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance (EPTA) in 1949 to provide technical assistance to developing nations. In 1965, U.N. member states merged EPTA and the Special U.N. Fund for Economic Development to create UNDP, which coordinates technical assistance and provides funds for development projects. The General Assembly updated UNDP's organizational structure and functions in 1971. The UNDP updated its organizational structure and functions in the 1970s, introducing country programs and resident representatives. These concepts were further strengthened in the 1990s. Currently, UNDP focuses on development activities, technical assistance, and coordinating with other UN agencies, funds, and programs. It collaborates with governments, NGOs, multilateral organizations, and the private sector in the global development landscape, adapting to new donors and evolving challenges. The emergence of new types of donors and evolving development challenges has led to the need for the UNDS to adapt. Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing countries has increased, with a rise in governmental and intergovernmental aid donors. New bilateral donors like Brazil, China, India, and Russia have challenged traditional foreign assistance structures. Contributions from the private sector, foundations, and NGOs have grown, highlighting the significant role of private foreign investment in development. Donors now often earmark their contributions for specific projects. The UNDS has faced criticism for not meeting its potential, with many development experts and governments pointing out inefficiency, duplication, and fragmentation in U.N. development activities. Most U.N. entities operate independently with distinct rules, membership, and financial resources, reporting to their governing bodies rather than the U.N. Secretary-General. Increased competition among global development organizations has highlighted the need for the UNDS to provide more effective, streamlined, and accountable development services. The expansion of UNDS activities and the creation of new U.N. development organizations have raised concerns about inefficiency, duplication, and fragmentation. Criticism of UNDP's management and oversight mechanisms, including reports of misusing funds in North Korea, has led some policymakers to question the effectiveness of providing financial contributions to UNDP and the UNDS. The UNDS, despite facing criticism, is recognized for its unique role in global development efforts. Experts argue that its decentralized nature can hinder but also strengthen development activities. The array of U.N. agencies allows for issue-specific expertise and efficient responses to development concerns. Supporters highlight the United Nations' neutrality and universal membership as advantages in development cooperation. Developing states have equal voting rights, providing neutrality and legitimacy not found in other organizations. The United Nations Development System (UNDS) has a unique advantage in global development efforts due to its decentralized nature, universal membership, and neutrality. This allows for equal voting rights and legitimacy in decision-making processes, unlike other organizations where financial contributions often dictate influence. UNDS assistance is not tied to specific donor priorities, making recipient countries more receptive to development aid and policy advice. Additionally, the U.N. system's broad mandate and global expertise give it a comparative advantage in key areas of development, particularly in capacity building. The United Nations Development System (UNDS) has a unique advantage in global development efforts due to its decentralized nature, universal membership, and neutrality. In 2009, development-related activities represented almost half of total U.N. system-wide contributions, with UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, and FAO accounting for the bulk of these efforts. UNDS activities focus on sectors like health, gender, science, and social development. Activities of the United Nations Development System (UNDS) have shifted over the last two decades, with a decrease in health and agriculture focus, and an increase in gender and social development. The UNDS has 136 U.N. Country Teams (UNCTs) covering 180 countries to ensure effective coordination and decision-making. UNCTs work with host governments to deliver results aligned with priorities through the U.N. Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). The United Nations Development System (UNDS) has 136 U.N. Country Teams (UNCTs) that oversee program design, implementation, and monitoring under the U.N. Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). UNCTs are led by U.N. Resident Coordinators (RCs) who coordinate all U.N. entities in each country. There are currently 127 RCs globally, with additional RC-type posts in certain regions. The United Nations Development System (UNDS) operates through regional economic commissions and regional offices of various funds, programs, and agencies to promote dialogue, cooperation, and knowledge sharing at the regional level. Regional offices provide technical support to UN Country Teams (UNCTs) for project development and implementation. At the headquarters level, UNDS entities engage in global, regional, and country-specific activities. The U.N. entity headquarters engage in a variety of activities at global, regional, and country levels, including formulating policies, coordinating offices, supporting governance mechanisms, conducting human resources and budget-related activities, and participating in U.N. system coordination mechanisms. The UNDG, comprised of 32 U.N. entities, coordinates operational activities at the country level to support national development priorities. It is based in New York, chaired by the UNDP Administrator, and focuses on improving coherence and managing Resident Coordinators. UNDG is part of the U.N. Chief Executives Board for Coordination, supporting U.N. intergovernmental bodies on social and economic issues. The UN Development Operations Coordination Office (UNDOCO) supports the UNDG and connects headquarters activities with country-level operations. The UNDS is funded by contributions from governments, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, and individuals. In 2009, total government contributions to UN development activities were $14.2 billion, with the top five donors being the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Norway. Funding mechanisms for UNDS entities vary based on governance and structure. The UNDS is funded by contributions from various sources, with some agencies relying on voluntary contributions while others rely on assessed contributions. Overall UNDS expenditures have increased since 2003, with a significant increase in development-related activities spending in 2009. In 2009, UNDS expenditures totaled $14.7 billion, with 53% for country programmable resources, 18% for global and regional programs, and 16% for program support. Africa received the largest share of development-related expenditures, followed by Asia/Pacific, Americas, Western Asia, and Europe. Expenditures to the Americas were mainly funded by local resources. In 2009, UNDS expenditures totaled $14.7 billion, with the largest share going to Africa, followed by Asia/Pacific, Americas, Western Asia, and Europe. Afghanistan, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and India received the most funding for country programmable resources. Non-core funding has increased significantly, raising concerns about host countries' involvement in program selection and design. Some worry that a rise in non-core funding may affect organizations' ability to fund their core mandates. Core resources allow for more efficient long-term development planning, while non-core funding can lead to higher transaction costs. Donors argue that non-core funding aligns with their priorities and increases resources for development. Non-core funding options provide additional resources for development organizations, allowing them to engage in more activities beyond their institutional mandates. The United Nations receives the largest share of multilateral funding from OECD countries, with a total aid of $57.3 billion in 2009. UNDS core and non-core funding accounted for $18.7 billion, representing 33% of the total share. Despite recent increases, concerns exist about the impact of non-core funding on organizations' ability to fund their core mandates. Despite recent increases in overall UNDS share of multilateral aid, there is a concerning drop in core multilateral funding for the United Nations. The UN's share has decreased from 25% to 18% over the past decade, attributed to growth in EC's funding and contributions to the Global Fund and World Bank Group. This decline may indicate a lack of donor confidence in UN development efforts. The Obama Administration has expressed ongoing support for UNDS activities and multilateral cooperation. They emphasized the importance of improving operational cooperation with U.N. agencies, especially in complex emergencies in countries like Afghanistan, Haiti, Pakistan, and Sudan. The Obama Administration supports UNDS activities in countries like Afghanistan, Haiti, Pakistan, and Sudan. They emphasize achieving coherence at the country level, improving transparency and accountability, and enhancing evaluation mechanisms for effectiveness. The Administration supports U.N. entities updating management practices to align with emerging development institutions. It backs U.N. system-wide coherence efforts like the Delivering as One pilot program. Congress authorizes U.S. contributions to UNDS entities to influence U.S. policy within the United Nations for development and foreign policy objectives. During the 111th and 112th Congresses, legislative tools used by Members to influence U.S. participation in the U.N. system include passing resolutions, confirming nominees, conducting oversight, and funding or limiting contributions. U.S. contributions to U.N. entities are made through assessed and voluntary dues, with legislation linking reforms to contributions and hearings on system efficiency and transparency. The U.S. funds its assessed contributions to the U.N. system through the Department of State budget, authorized by Congress. Voluntary contributions, which finance special programs and offices, make up over half of the total funds received by the U.N. system. U.S. voluntary contributions to U.N. entities are financed through foreign assistance legislation, primarily through the International Organizations and Programs account. The United States contributes significant funds to the U.N. system through assessed and voluntary contributions. In 2009, the U.S. made $1.306 billion in development-related contributions to the U.N. system, the highest of any country. In FY2010, the U.S. contributed over $450 million to key U.N. entities. The 112th Congress is considering the impact of limiting U.S. contributions to the U.N. system and the benefits of multilateral versus bilateral assistance. Congress has previously placed limits on funding to U.N. entities it did not approve. Since 1980, the United States has withheld funds from various U.N. entities and programs, such as the U.N. Special Unit on Palestinian Rights and the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), due to concerns about their activities. Congress has also restricted funding to organizations like the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) over issues of politicization and budgetary expansion. There are differing views on the impact of withholding U.S. contributions to the U.N., with some worried about weakening U.S. influence within the organization. Funds are concerned that withholding U.S. contributions to the UNDS may weaken U.S. influence at the United Nations and hinder diplomacy and development objectives. Supporters argue that withholding funds can push for reform and encourage countries to find common ground on divisive issues. Legislation threatening to cut off U.S. funding has led to changes in the past. The impact of withholding funds depends on the origin of the organization or program's funding. If the United States withholds its budget contributions to a U.N. entity funded by member state voluntary contributions, it could have a significant impact as these organizations rely heavily on such funding for their activities. Targeted withholding of regular budget contributions may not achieve the desired effect as these funds are used to finance the budget as a whole and not specific programs. Withholding contributions to a specialized agency where the United States is assessed at a certain amount could significantly impact the entity's operations, potentially leading to loss of membership. U.S. policymakers should weigh the benefits of bilateral versus multilateral foreign assistance, with bilateral aid offering more control over resource allocation. Some donors and experts argue that multilateral institutions lack accountability and evidence of effectiveness, focusing more on short-term results like conferences and reports. Governments find it easier to justify bilateral aid over multilateral aid due to perceived complexities. Despite drawbacks, many donors, including the United States, see the advantages of multilateral aid. Experts argue that multilateral aid benefits the United States by sharing development costs and resources with other governments and organizations, providing assistance at lower costs and with little political risk. It allows engagement in areas or sectors where the U.S. might not otherwise participate and can influence policy direction in multilateral organizations, demonstrating leadership in global development. U.S. financial contributions to multilateral development activities, including the UNDS, can have a significant impact. The United States' participation in multilateral development activities, including the UNDS, can affect its influence and credibility in various international forums. Despite generally supporting and funding U.N. system development activities, U.S. contributions to multilateral organizations are relatively small compared to bilateral efforts. Multilateral assistance accounts for 7% of total U.S. foreign aid, with countries like the UK and Germany allocating a larger portion to multilateral organizations. During the past decade, U.S. contributions to multilateral organizations, including the U.N. system, have remained steady while bilateral ODA has increased significantly. This trend is attributed to increased investment in bilateral programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and PEPFAR, as well as concerns about the effectiveness of multilateral organizations in fulfilling U.S. foreign policy objectives. Reforms to improve the UNDS have been recognized by U.N. member states, including the U.S., with mixed results. During the last decade, reform efforts within the UNDS have shown progress, but additional changes are needed for the system to operate efficiently. Examples of recent reform frameworks include the General Assembly's policy reviews and the Delivering as One initiative. The primary mandates for UNDS reform efforts are found in comprehensive policy reviews. The mandates for current UNDS reform efforts are outlined in comprehensive policy review resolutions adopted by the General Assembly every three years. These resolutions aim to address issues such as operational coherence, data coverage, and coordination within the UNDS. Specific directives include simplification, harmonization of rules and procedures, and operational harmonization at the country level. The 2007 resolution focused on further operational harmonization and evaluating UNDS capacity to support developing countries. In 2007, the General Assembly adopted CPR resolution 62/208 emphasizing national ownership and leadership in the UNDS, flexibility in responding to national development needs, funding guidance, cooperation among developing countries, capacity development, and improved evaluation mechanisms. Member states agreed in 2008 to review CPR resolutions every four years. A new quadrennial comprehensive policy review resolution will be addressed in 2011. Heads of state and government met in 2005 at the U.N. World Summit to review progress on Millennium Summit goals. The U.N. World Summit in 2005 reviewed progress on Millennium Summit goals and commitments. In 2006, a high-level panel was created to improve U.N. system effectiveness in development, humanitarian assistance, and the environment. The panel recommended the concept of Delivering as One (DAO) for U.N. reforms to maintain its position in the multilateral system. The high-level panel recommended Delivering as One (DAO) to promote coherence and consolidation of U.N. offices and agencies at different levels. This includes an overhaul of U.N. business and management practices at the country level to focus on achieving the MDGs. The DAO approach involves U.N. agencies sharing one budget, leader, office, and program with harmonized practices to increase country ownership and effectiveness. A voluntary DAO pilot program was announced in Vietnam in 2006 to address the lack of harmonization among U.N. entities operating in-country. The voluntary DAO initiative was established in seven countries: Albania, Cape Verde, Mozambique, Pakistan, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uruguay. A \"One U.N.\" multi-donor trust fund was created to support DAO. Progress and challenges of the initiative were evaluated through stocktaking reports, meetings, and working groups. A High-Level Tripartite Conference in Hanoi in June 2010 discussed lessons learned and a way forward. Implementation of DAO in pilot countries led to renewed host government leadership, better alignment of national priorities with U.N. efforts, and enhanced coherence and effectiveness of U.N. support. Several pilot evaluations found that Regional Coordinators lack full authority over all U.N. entities in-country, leading to coordination and accountability issues in UNCTs. U.N. agency headquarters are seen as slow in adopting DAO reforms, hindering progress. The lack of predictable core funding limits the U.N.'s ability to plan long-term and provide timely inputs. The future of DAO is uncertain, with member states undecided on expanding beyond pilot countries. Member states are evaluating the expansion of the initiative beyond pilot countries. An independent evaluation of DAO is ongoing, with the hope of completion by mid-to-late 2011 to inform the upcoming policy review. The 112th Congress is considering U.S. participation in UNDS, facing challenges and policy issues related to evolving U.N. member state perspectives and relationships, particularly between developing and developed countries. Developed countries support giving the Secretary-General more authority for UNDS reforms, while developing countries oppose policies that may increase the Secretary-General's power. Some experts suggest that developing countries resist centralized UNDS to protect their interests. In a decentralized UNDS system, developing countries have better control and opportunities. The dynamic between U.N. member states poses challenges for UNDS administration, funding, and operations due to differing political agendas and reform priorities. Some governments exploit U.N. reform for their own interests, causing distrust and hindering coordinated efforts. Competition among U.N. entities can improve services but may prioritize institutional interests over overall development goals. The recent shift in funding within the UNDS and the broader development community has led to increased competition among U.N. entities for scarce funds and resources. This competition may result in duplication of activities, excess expenses, and resentment among some entities feeling they are losing control over development activities. The UNDS lacks a central mechanism for collecting and disseminating information on its activities, leading to a lack of coordination, duplication, and difficulty in identifying gaps and areas for improvement. Efforts are being made to streamline data collection and information-sharing within the U.N. system to improve coverage, availability, and reliability. The General Assembly has called for better financial data reporting and a comprehensive system for UNDS activities. Monitoring and evaluating the development impact of UNDS activities remains a key challenge. Monitoring and evaluating the development impact of activities in the UNDS is challenging due to a lack of baseline data, national statistical capacity in developing countries, and attribution issues. External factors like political changes, natural disasters, and shifts in priorities can also affect the success of development efforts. The lack of harmonized evaluation mechanisms within the UNDS and across the U.N. system further complicates monitoring and evaluation efforts. In the 1990s and early 2000s, U.N. entities adopted results-based frameworks for evaluation, but with varying definitions and criteria. Efforts to harmonize evaluation practices have been made, but there is a need for further improvement. The quality of UNDS staff varies among countries, with the success of UN Country Teams often dependent on the leadership of the Resident Coordinator. Challenges in monitoring and evaluating development impact include lack of baseline data, national statistical capacity, attribution issues, and external factors like political changes and natural disasters. Experts and governments have recognized the challenges associated with the Resident Coordinator (RC) position within the United Nations system. RCs lead UN Country Teams but lack management authority over other UN entities, leading to different objectives and evaluation criteria. Efforts have been made to address this inconsistency, with some entities starting to recognize U.N. system-wide work in their appraisals. In 2008, the UNDG approved a Management and Accountability System to hold UNCT members accountable in areas where they have agreed to lead the Country Team. Some assert that RCs with strong leadership skills can overcome challenges to lead UNCT efforts. RC recruiting should be widened and improved to attract the most qualified people, with a \"talent-management\" initiative implemented in 2009 to align candidate qualifications with post requirements. The UN has implemented marketing tools to attract qualified candidates for Resident Coordinator (RC) positions. The transition between humanitarian relief and development is a longstanding concern within the UN system. During crises, UN operational entities work together to provide assistance, with a Humanitarian Coordinator overseeing the response at the country level. The transition from humanitarian relief to development within the UN system is a key concern. Many believe that coordination between these phases could be improved. There is a debate about the role of Resident Coordinators (RCs) who also serve as Humanitarian Coordinators (HCs). Some experts argue that RCs, especially those from development backgrounds, may lack sufficient knowledge of humanitarian issues. Critics argue that Resident Coordinators (RCs) affiliated with UNDP may be hesitant to address humanitarian issues with host countries, fearing damage to relationships. Effective coordination with development organizations is a challenge for the UNDS, requiring improved communication and collaboration to minimize duplication. Effective coordination among development organizations, particularly at the country level, can lead to more efficient development programs aligned with host country priorities. However, obstacles such as increased competition for resources and reluctance to coordinate funds or activities due to concerns about losing influence or differing strategic interests persist. Donors often earmark funds for specific projects, limiting flexibility in program implementation and coordination for the UNDS and other organizations. Development experts highlight the lack of coordination among U.N. entities and international financial institutions as a significant obstacle to collaboration with other donors. They emphasize the need for greater consistency in strategic frameworks and priorities at the country level to avoid duplication of efforts. In recent years, the UNDS has made efforts to include IFIs in U.N. system activities, with calls for harmonization of strategic frameworks and partnership arrangements. The World Bank and IMF are part of the U.N. system, promoting collaboration and coordination among development-focused NGOs. The UNDS has become more organized and well-funded, increasing its influence on development. It is suggested that the UNDS should collaborate with international NGOs and leverage their expertise. Communication with NGOs and the private sector could lead to more efficient development services. The UNDS and other development organizations are recognizing the contributions of the private sector to development. However, they are not effectively leveraging private sector development activities, which are not always obvious. Experts suggest modifying the approach to aid to better connect the private and public sectors, as private investment is seen as an untapped opportunity with the majority of resources flowing to developing countries coming from private capital. The 112th Congress may debate U.S. participation and funding of the UNDS, focusing on ongoing reform efforts, the U.N.'s role in global development, and improving coordination and accountability. Foreign aid experts have raised concerns about inefficiencies in U.S. foreign aid management, suggesting better leverage of funding for multilateral programs. Congress may need to consider U.S. participation in the UNDS within this broader context. Experts suggest that debates on UNDS reform should consider the changing global development landscape with the rise of middle-income economies and increased role of multilateral donors. The UNDS should also be viewed in the context of the G-20's growing influence on international economic cooperation, raising questions about the U.N.'s future role in development and global governance. Some experts highlight the need for a more focused approach in U.N. development efforts. The UNDS faces challenges due to its lack of focus with over 9,000 mandates, making it hard to prioritize development activities. Suggestions include concentrating on fragile states or merging U.N. entities for streamlined development. However, structural and organizational changes for comprehensive reform are unlikely in the near future. The decentralized nature of the U.N. system and disagreements among member states hinder comprehensive reform. Congress should monitor ongoing UNDS reform activities, including the CPR resolutions and DAO initiative. The future of DAO is uncertain, and policy debates on the U.N. development system's future are ongoing. The global economic crisis and concerns about U.N. system effectiveness have led to new development efforts. In the United States, the role of the United Nations in foreign assistance is a continuous debate for policymakers balancing domestic concerns with foreign policy priorities."
