    "title": "AB 1782",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 31013 of the Corporations Code is amended to define when an offer or sale of a franchise is made in California. It specifies that an offer is made in the state if it originates from or is directed to California and accepted there. An offer to sell is not made in California solely because a publisher circulates a publication with most of its circulation outside the state, or a radio/TV program from outside the state is received. Additionally, a franchisor at a trade show offering information about their products/services is not considered making an offer in California if certain conditions are met. Franchisors must notify the commissioner 30 days before attending a franchise trade show and provide detailed information about their franchise concept, brand name, offering, legal name, key personnel, and contact information. The franchisor must provide detailed information about legal process address, actions against key personnel, proposed information for trade show, and a copy of the franchise disclosure document if already possessed. The franchisor must conspicuously post a notice in their trade show booth stating they are not offering a franchise for sale in California, not legally able to do so, and providing contact information for reporting any unauthorized offers. The notice must also state that it is unlawful to offer or sell a franchise in California without registration with the commissioner. A franchisor or prospective franchisor requesting an exemption from registration fees at a trade show must pay $225 per day. This section is effective until January 1, 2022, and will be repealed after that date. An offer or sale of a franchise in California is considered made when an offer to sell is made in the state, an offer to buy is accepted in the state, or if the franchisee is domiciled in California and the franchised business is or will be operated in the state. An offer to sell in California is made when the offer originates from or is directed to the state and accepted when communicated to the offeror in the state. Circulation of publications or programs in the state does not constitute an offer to sell. Section 31020 of the Corporations Code defines a \"franchise trade show\" as an event in California where multiple franchise brands can showcase their products to the public. This section will be effective until January 1, 2022. Additionally, Section 31115.5 allows the commissioner to issue a stop order denying the effectiveness of an exemption application under certain circumstances. The proposed business model in California is unlawful if key individuals have criminal convictions, civil liabilities for fraud, or violations of franchise laws. Additionally, if the business misleads investors or fails to meet specific requirements, it may be subject to repeal by January 1, 2022. Section 31117 of the Corporations Code in California is being amended. Upon entry of a stop order under Section 31115 or 31115.5, the commissioner notifies the applicant with reasons. A hearing can be requested within 30 days, and if not, the order remains until modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested, the commissioner can modify or vacate the order after a notice and hearing. Section 31117 of the Corporations Code is added and will be in effect until January 1, 2022, after which it will be repealed. Upon entry of a stop order under Section 31115, the commissioner must notify the applicant promptly with reasons. A hearing will be scheduled within 15 business days upon request, or the order will remain until modified or vacated after 30 days. The commissioner can modify or extend the order after a hearing in accordance with the Government Code. Effective January 1, 2022."
