    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Maternity and Obstetric Medicine Act\" or the \"Healthy MOM Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of immediate and affordable care for pregnant women, as demonstrated through the Medicaid program and the essential health benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has increased access to affordable health insurance for women, with over 7,500,000 women now having coverage. The Act prohibits denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions like pregnancy and ensures preventive services like birth control are covered without cost sharing. Comprehensive maternity coverage improves health outcomes for women and newborns while reducing financial costs for consumers and insurers. Employer health plans excluding dependent daughters from maternity coverage is considered sex-based discrimination. Young adults often enrolled in catastrophic coverage lack comprehensive maternity benefits, leading to higher deductibles and restrictions. Timely maternity care is crucial for improving the health of pregnant women, birth outcomes, and babies. Regular maternity care is essential for improving women's health during pregnancy and reducing maternal mortality. It can detect and mitigate serious complications such as preeclampsia, placental abruption, and diabetes. Timely maternity care also reduces preterm births and associated health complications, ultimately lowering healthcare costs. Intensive maternity care can significantly reduce hospital admissions and costs for high-risk pregnancies, saving $1.37 for every $1 invested. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all eligible women have access to maternity care through the Exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act, protecting the health of women and newborns. Pregnant women eligible for health plan coverage can access affordable health coverage. Special enrollment period for pregnant individuals is provided. The Public Health Service Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are amended to include a special enrollment period for pregnant individuals. A special enrollment period for pregnant individuals is added to the Public Health Service Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This allows eligible employees or dependents to enroll in a group health plan upon pregnancy confirmation by a healthcare provider. The Secretary will establish regulations for a special enrollment period for pregnant individuals to enroll in coverage. The amendments made by this section will apply to plan years starting after 2016. SEC. 4 amends the Public Health Service Act to require group health plans to cover maternity care for dependents, including pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. Coverage must include labor and delivery for all pregnant dependents regardless of age. SEC. 5 pertains to Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans. SEC. 5 requires regulations to consider pregnancy a qualifying life event for enrolling in a health benefit plan under chapter 89 title 5, United States Code. The effective date is 12 months after enactment. Section 1902(l)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act is amended to adjust the percentage for medical assistance starting January 1, 2014, ensuring it is not less than specified for certain individuals. The percentage for medical assistance for certain individuals must not be less than the percentage specified in the State plan as of January 1, 2014, or as established under the State's authorizing legislation or appropriations at that time. SEC. 7. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS: This Act does not affect existing Federal or State laws that provide equal or greater protection for individuals in group health plans or health insurance offered by insurance issuers."
