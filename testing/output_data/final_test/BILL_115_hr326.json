    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium Act\". Congress finds that Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neurologic disease leading to blindness and paralysis, affecting an estimated 16,000 to 17,000 people in the United States and a quarter-million worldwide. Women are more affected than men, and Afro-Caribbeans are predisposed to NMO. The average age at diagnosis is between 40 and 50 years, with costs incurred for affected patients and families. The cause of NMO is unknown but is believed to be autoimmune in nature. More than 90 percent of NMO patients experience recurrent disease and neurologic disability. Orphan diseases like NMO often lack attention and research funding due to their low incidence. No single institution has enough patients to conduct comprehensive research on NMO. There has been no thorough study analyzing all aspects of NMO to identify risk factors and biomarkers. Understanding NMO can help in studying other autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and lupus. Congress recognizes the need for a collaborative research effort to study the causes of NMO and identify biomarkers of disease activity. They also aim to gather detailed information on NMO patients to investigate environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors. This will be achieved through the establishment of the National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium. Establishment of the National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium under SEC. 409K of the Public Health Service Act to facilitate collaborative research on NMO causes and biomarkers. The National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium (NNO Consortium) will be established within a year of the enactment of SEC. 409K of the Public Health Service Act. It will provide grants for research on the causes, risk factors, and biomarkers of NMO. The NNO Consortium will assemble a panel of experts to provide ongoing guidance for research on NMO, including developing common study designs and standard protocols for collecting medical history, neurological exams, biospecimens, and radiological data from study participants. The NNO Consortium will establish a central laboratory for collecting and analyzing data from research funded by the consortium. Eligible consortia must demonstrate the capability to enroll participants for the research. The NNO Consortium has the capability to enroll a minimum of 25 individuals with NMO diagnosis from its designated catchment area. The catchment area does not overlap with other consortiums. The Secretary will submit an annual report on research funded by the consortium to Congress. The NNO Consortium can enroll 25 individuals with NMO diagnosis from its catchment area. The Secretary will submit an annual report on funded research to Congress. Authorization of $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2018-2021 is available for this section. The term 'consortium' refers to a partnership of universities, health care organizations, or government agencies serving a designated catchment area."
