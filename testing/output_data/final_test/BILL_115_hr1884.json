    "content": "The \"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017\" allows certain diseases to be presumed as work-related causes of disability or death for federal employees in fire protection activities. The \"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017\" defines an 'employee in fire protection activities' as someone trained in fire suppression, with legal authority to engage in fire suppression, and involved in preventing, controlling, and extinguishing fires or responding to emergencies. The \"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017\" amends Section 8102 of title 5, United States Code to presume that a disease specified in paragraph (3) is caused by the employment of an employee in fire protection activities. This presumption can be rebutted by evidence and applies only if the employee is diagnosed with the specified disease. The \"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017\" presumes that certain diseases are caused by employment in fire protection activities if diagnosed within 10 years of last active employment. Diseases include heart disease, lung disease, brain cancer, blood or lymphatic system cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and bladder cancer. The \"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017\" includes presumptions for diseases related to fire protection activities such as heart disease, lung disease, brain cancer, blood or lymphatic system cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, digestive system cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers determined by the Secretary of Labor. Additionally, uncommon infectious diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, or C, and HIV are also covered. The \"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2017\" covers diseases related to fire protection activities, including heart disease, lung disease, various cancers, and uncommon infectious diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, or C, and HIV. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health will examine the implementation of the Act, analyze injury claims, research on health risks, and provide recommendations to Congress. The Act covers diseases related to firefighting, including heart disease, lung disease, cancers, and infectious diseases. Recommendations for administrative or legislative actions are needed to ensure these diseases are included in the Act's presumption. The amendment applies to injuries or deaths diagnosed after the Act's enactment date."
