    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Eric Paredes Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prevention Act, known as Article 13.5, is added to the Education Code. It defines \"athletic activity\" and \"authorized person\" for the purpose of providing health services to pupil athletes. The Department is required to provide guidelines, videos, and information on sudden cardiac arrest symptoms to educate students, parents, and coaches. Materials may include resources from various organizations like the National Federation of High School Associations and the Eric Paredes Save A Life Foundation. School districts and schools should post required information on their websites for easy access by pupils, parents, and coaches. Before participating in athletic activities, schools must collect sudden cardiac arrest information for students under the California Interscholastic Federation. For activities not governed by the CIF, students and parents must acknowledge receipt of information posted on the department's website. Before the start of each athletic season, schools may hold informational meetings for all competitors on the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest. If a pupil faints during or after an athletic activity, they must be immediately removed from participation by school officials. Meetings may include physicians, cardiologists, athletic trainers, and authorized persons. If a pupil exhibits symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest during an athletic activity, they may be removed from participation by an athletic trainer or authorized person. If no trainer is present, a coach must notify the pupil's parent or guardian for further evaluation and treatment. A pupil removed from play due to sudden cardiac arrest symptoms must be evaluated and cleared by a physician before returning to athletic activities. This rule does not apply to regular school day activities or required physical education courses unless it involves practice or scrimmage. Coaches must undergo sudden cardiac arrest training every two years. On July 1, 2019, coaches must complete required training to be eligible. Violation of this rule can result in suspension from coaching. Sponsors of youth athletic activities are encouraged to follow the guidelines. This article becomes effective on July 1, 2017."
