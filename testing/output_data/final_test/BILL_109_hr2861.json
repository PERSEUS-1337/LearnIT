    "content": "The Act is known as the \"PREEMIE Act\" and aims to expand research and education for mothers who deliver infants early. Premature birth is a serious problem with increasing rates, leading to high mortality and long-term health consequences. It also poses a significant financial burden on healthcare. In 2002, hospital stays for premature/low birthweight infants cost $15 billion. The average lifetime medical costs for a premature baby are $500,000. African-American mothers have a higher rate of preterm births compared to white mothers. Smoking during pregnancy doubles the risk of having a low birthweight baby. The purpose of this Act is to reduce rates of preterm labor and delivery, establish evidence-based care for at-risk pregnant women and preterm infants, and decrease infant mortality and disabilities due to prematurity. More research is needed to understand the causes of preterm birth and develop treatments for prevention and improved outcomes for preterm infants. Expansion and coordination of research related to preterm labor, delivery, and infant mortality is addressed in Section 3 of the Act by amending Part B of the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH will expand research on preterm labor, infant mortality, and care for preterm infants. Networks for research units will be established. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2006-2010. The Health Service Act is amended to expand CDC activities on preterm labor and infant mortality. A study on assisted reproduction technologies and their impact on health is also included. Additionally, a study on the relationship between prematurity and birth defects is mandated. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct a study on the relationship between prematurity, birth defects, and developmental disabilities. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Additionally, a review of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Survey will be conducted to track pregnancy outcomes and reduce preterm birth instances. The Director of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on the health and economic consequences of preterm birth in the United States. The study will focus on reviewing the epidemiology of premature birth, low birthweight, maternal and child health effects, and disparities based on gestational age, plurality, maternal age, and racial or ethnic factors. The study will assess the short and long-term disability and quality of life impacts of premature births on maternal health, family employment, and caregiver issues. It will also analyze the costs associated with premature birth, identify gaps in monitoring economic burdens, and explore implications for national health policy. The Institute of Medicine will provide recommendations on best practices and interventions to prevent premature birth, as well as identify effective community outreach models. They will also consider options for allocating public funds to research and preventive interventions. A report will be submitted to the Director of the National Health Policy within 1 year. The Health Resources and Services Administration will assess current national core performance measures under the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant to include known risk factors of low birthweight and prematurity, such as maternal smoking during pregnancy. The Health Resources and Services Administration will submit a report to Congress on the evaluation of pregnant women who smoked during pregnancy within a year of enacting the Act. SEC. 399O of the Public Health Service Act amends Part P of title III to provide public and health care provider education and support services. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project to improve information on prematurity for health professionals and the public, including programs on preterm labor signs, infection screening and treatment, nutrition counseling, and smoking cessation education. The Secretary will conduct projects to support families with infants in neonatal intensive care units, focusing on emotional and informational needs during the stay, transition home, and in case of newborn death. Activities may include smoking cessation education, stress management, and improving treatment for premature babies. All funded programs must be evidence-based. Activities under projects to support families with infants in neonatal intensive care units may include providing books and videos with information about the NICU experience and offering emotional support within the NICU setting. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2006 through 2010. The Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight is established. The purpose of this section is to promote research and collaboration among agencies to reduce prematurity and low birthweight. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight, composed of members from various agencies and health care organizations. The Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight will include grassroots advocacy organizations, specialty care providers, and researcher organizations. The Council will report annually to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, plan a conference under the Surgeon General's sponsorship, establish a research plan, and report recommendations to Congress. The Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity and Low Birthweight will oversee the coordination of the implementation of this Act, including activities determined appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 2010 is provided to carry out this Act."
