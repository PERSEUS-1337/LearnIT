The Lifetime Income Disclosure Act mandates the Secretary to provide a model disclosure that clarifies the non-guaranteed nature of the lifetime income stream illustration and the potential variability of actual payments based on various factors. Additionally, within one year of the Act's enactment, the Secretary must establish assumptions for administrators of individual account plans to use in converting total income. The Secretary must establish assumptions for converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents, issuing interim final rules as needed. Assumptions may be a single set or ranges of permissible assumptions to facilitate conversions for investments in lifetime income streams. The assumptions prescribed for converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents should allow administrators of individual account plans to use the amounts as a lifetime income stream. There is no liability for plan fiduciaries or sponsors solely due to providing lifetime income stream equivalents derived in accordance with specified assumptions and rules. The model lifetime income disclosure requirements apply regardless of whether lifetime income stream equivalents are mandated. The effective date for pension benefit statements is more than 12 months after the issuance of interim final rules, model disclosure, or assumptions by the Secretary.
