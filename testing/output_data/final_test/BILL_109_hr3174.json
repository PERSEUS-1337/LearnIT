    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The largest and longest US Army court-martial of World War II occurred in 1944 at Fort Lawton in Seattle, Washington. Forty-three African American defendants were charged with rioting and three with the murder of an Italian prisoner of war. The alleged crimes took place in a segregated area of the fort on August 14, 1944. Approximately 200 African American soldiers from a unit at Fort Lawton engaged in a disturbance with the Italian Service Unit, resulting in injuries to members of the Italian unit and American soldiers. 24 men were taken to the hospital for treatment. On August 15, 1944, a lifeless body of an Italian prisoner of war was found lynched at the fort. Brigadier General Elliot D. Cooke's report highlighted flaws in the Army's investigation of a disturbance at Fort Lawton. The commanding officer was relieved, provost marshal reassigned, and two military policemen court-martialed. Despite this, 43 African American soldiers faced trial. During the court-martial of 43 African American soldiers charged after a disturbance at Fort Lawton, they were tried as a group with limited defense preparation time. The Army prosecutor withheld the Cooke Report from the defense, and a key witness was identified as potentially pro-Nazi without this information being disclosed. During the court-martial at Fort Lawton, 28 defendants were found guilty of rioting and two of manslaughter. The prosecution failed to produce a murder weapon or provide evidence linking the defendants to the death of an Italian prisoner of war. Sentences ranged from six months to 25 years, with an average of 7.5 years, and most received a dishonorable discharge. Military policemen who failed to intervene were witnesses for the prosecution, but their upcoming court-martial was not disclosed to the defense. Of the 27 soldiers convicted, some re-enlisted after serving their prison term and received an honorable discharge, while others live with a dishonorable discharge on their military records. SEC. 2. REVIEW OF FORT LAWTON COURT-MARTIAL CASES. The Secretary of the Army will conduct a review of the cases of 28 individuals convicted in a court-martial at Fort Lawton in 1944 to determine the validity of the original findings and sentences, considering racial prejudice or other improper factors. A report on the review results must be submitted to Congress within six months, including findings and actions taken. If necessary, records will be corrected based on the review findings. If a conviction in a reviewed case is found to be in error or unjust, the Secretary will correct the individual's military records to rectify the mistake."
