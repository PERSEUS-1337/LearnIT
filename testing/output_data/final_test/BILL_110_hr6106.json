The Diesel Tax Fairness Act of 2008 temporarily reduces excise tax on kerosene and diesel fuel to match the rate applicable to gasoline. Beginning on the enactment date and ending on December 31, 2010, any reduction in tax rates will result in an equivalent amount being treated as taxes received in the Treasury. The amendment made by this section will take effect on the enactment date of the Act. Additionally, floor stocks refunds are provided for dealers holding untaxed liquid intended for sale before the enactment date of the Act. The Diesel Tax Fairness Act of 2008 temporarily reduces excise tax on kerosene and diesel fuel to match the rate applicable to gasoline. A credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid, with specific time limits for filing claims and dealer requests for refunds. The taxpayer can claim a credit or refund if they repay the amount to the dealer or get written consent. No credit or refund is allowed for fuel held in retail stocks. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are provided, including that a producer is considered a dealer. Rules similar to section 6412 of the Code apply. Floor Stocks Tax is imposed on taxable liquid held on a specific date, with the liability falling on the person holding the liquid. The tax must be paid as prescribed by the Secretary within 6 months of the floor stocks tax date. The section defines terms related to the tax on taxable liquid, including who is considered to hold the liquid, what constitutes taxable liquid, the floor stocks tax date, and the role of the Secretary of the Treasury. An exception is made for taxable liquid held for exempt uses, where a credit or refund may be allowable. The tax on taxable liquid exempts fuel held in vehicle tanks and certain amounts of fuel held on the floor stocks tax date, not exceeding 2,000 gallons. Fuel exempt from the tax under subsection (d) or (e) is also not considered. Controlled groups, including corporations, are subject to specific rules under this section. The section defines controlled groups as persons treated as one entity, with specific rules for corporations and nonincorporated persons under common control. The term \"controlled group\" follows the definition in section 1563 of the Code, with a substitution of \"more than 50 percent\" for \"at least 80 percent.\" Regulations apply to groups under common control where at least one person is not a corporation. The floor stock taxes imposed by subsection (a) are subject to all provisions of law applicable to taxes imposed by chapter 31 or 32 of the Code, including penalties."
