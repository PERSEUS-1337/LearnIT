    "content": "The \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that women have entered the workforce in record numbers but still earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work, leading to wage depression for working families and hindering the optimal use of labor resources. Pay disparities are attributed to intentional discrimination or the effects of past discrimination. Congress finds that labor resources have been spread and perpetuated among workers through commerce, burdening commerce, obstructing the free flow of goods, and leading to unfair competition. It also interferes with marketing goods and may deprive workers of equal protection based on sex. Artificial barriers to wage discrimination based on sex persist despite decades since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Civil Rights Act. Removing these barriers would benefit the economy, reduce reliance on public assistance, promote family stability, and address past discrimination effects. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 aims to address past discrimination and ensure equal protection for workers based on sex. With better information and remedies, women can enforce their rights to equal pay for equal work. Some employers have already made progress in eliminating pay disparities. SEC. 3. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS. Amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires employers to demonstrate a differential in pay based on factors other than sex, such as education or experience, that are job-related or serve a legitimate business purpose. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 amendment requires employers to show a pay differential based on factors other than sex, like education or experience, that are job-related or serve a legitimate business purpose, except when an alternative practice exists that would achieve the same goal without creating a pay difference, and the employer has refused to implement it. The factor must be reasonably applied in light of the justification provided by the employer. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 amendment requires employers to justify pay differentials based on factors other than sex. Employers cannot reduce wages to comply with the law. The amendment also applies to job applicants subject to the Act's provisions upon employment. The requirement for establishments is eliminated. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 amendment eliminates the establishment requirement and includes a nonretaliation provision for discussing wages or participating in investigations. The amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 includes enhanced penalties for employers who violate section 6(d), allowing for compensatory or punitive damages. The United States is exempt from punitive damages. Additionally, no employee, except in class actions related to section 6(d), shall be subject to penalties. The amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 allows for class actions to enforce section 6(d) with compensatory or punitive damages, including expert fees. The Secretary can take action in case of violations. The amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 allows for class actions to enforce section 6(d) with compensatory or punitive damages, including expert fees. The amendment also includes provisions for additional compensatory or punitive damages in case of violations. The amendment allows for class actions to enforce section 6(d) with compensatory or punitive damages, including expert fees, and provisions for additional damages in case of violations. SEC. 4. TRAINING. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs will provide training on discrimination in wage payment. SEC. 5. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH. The Secretary of Labor will conduct studies and provide information to address pay disparities between men and women by promoting research, publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and providing information to interested parties. The Secretary of Labor will address pay disparities by promoting research, recognizing achievements, and convening a national summit to discuss solutions. SEC. 6. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EMPLOYER RECOGNITION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Labor will develop guidelines for employers to evaluate job categories based on objective criteria like educational requirements, skills, independence, working conditions, and responsibility. These guidelines aim to help employers compare wages for different jobs to address unfair pay disparities between occupations traditionally dominated by men or women. The Secretary of Labor will establish guidelines for employers to evaluate job categories based on objective criteria and publish them in the Federal Register within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a program will be created to recognize employers who adjust their wage scales to reflect the real value of women's contributions to the workplace. The Secretary of Labor will promulgate rules and regulations to ensure fair pay for women compared to men, and may provide technical assistance to employers for evaluation purposes. Establishment of the National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace. The Robert Reich National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace is established, with criteria for qualification including submitting an application demonstrating efforts to eliminate pay disparities between men and women. Additional requirements may apply as prescribed by the Secretary of Labor. The Robert Reich National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace is presented annually to businesses meeting specified qualifications determined by the Secretary of Labor. The award is given with appropriate ceremonies as determined by the President or their representative. The term \"business\" includes corporations, partnerships, and nonprofit corporations. Entities eligible for the Robert Reich National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace include corporations, partnerships, professional associations, labor organizations, and similar business entities. Additionally, entities conducting education or training programs, as well as joint programs formed by a combination of eligible entities, are also eligible for the award. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will collect pay information. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will collect pay information by conducting a survey and issuing regulations for the collection of data on employee pay based on sex, race, and national origin. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will consider various factors to enhance the enforcement of Federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination, including burdens on employers, frequency of reports, data confidentiality protections, and effective data collection formats.
