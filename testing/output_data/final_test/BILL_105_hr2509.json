    "content": "The Act of 1997 is known as the \"Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset Act.\" Congress made findings regarding this Act. The Congress condemns injurious dumping and actionable subsidies, aiming to neutralize their impact on domestic industries. Unfair trade laws seek to restore fair trade conditions to prevent job and investment loss in the United States. Continued dumping or subsidization post-antidumping orders can hinder market price normalization, affecting domestic producers' ability to reinvest and maintain benefits. United States trade laws should be strengthened to ensure fair trade conditions and protect pension and health care benefits for workers. AMENDMENTS TO THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930: Title VII is amended by adding section 752 regarding Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset. Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended to include section 752, which establishes the Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset. This section outlines that duties assessed due to continued dumping or subsidization will be distributed to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures. The term 'affected domestic producer' refers to manufacturers, producers, or worker representatives who supported the petition leading to an antidumping duty finding or countervailing duty order. The term 'Commissioner' refers to the Commissioner of the United States Customs Service, while the term 'Commission' refers to the United States International Trade Commission. A 'qualifying expenditure' includes expenditures on plant, equipment, R&D, personnel training, acquisition of technology, and health care benefits for employees. The Commissioner will prescribe procedures for disbursement of dumping or subsidies offset, occurring within sixty days after the beginning of the next fiscal year. The Commission will forward eligible parties for distribution of antidumping and countervailing duties assessed within sixty days of the effective date. The Commissioner will publish a list of petitioners and supporting companies before issuing duty assessments. The list will be based on information obtained from the Department of Commerce and parties involved in administrative reviews. A notice of intention to distribute duty assessments will be published in the Federal Register at least thirty days prior to payments being issued. The Commissioner will distribute funds to eligible companies based on certification of desire to receive distribution, continued eligibility, and qualifying expenditures. Funds will be distributed on a pro rata basis to affected domestic producers. Special accounts will be established for outstanding antidumping orders and findings. The Commissioner will establish special accounts in the Treasury of the United States for outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty orders. All duties assessed under these orders will be deposited into the special accounts and made available for distribution based on actual assessment. The Commissioner will establish special accounts in the Treasury for outstanding antidumping or countervailing duty orders. Regulations will be set for distribution of funds from these accounts. The accounts will remain until all duties are collected, and unclaimed amounts will go to the general Treasury. Effective October 1, 1996, the antidumping or subsidy offset will apply to assessments on these orders."
