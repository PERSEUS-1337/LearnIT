The \"Collaborating for Economic Reintegration of Troops Act\" or the \"CERT Act\" addresses the challenges faced by transitioning members of the Armed Forces and their spouses in finding civilian employment. Veterans often struggle with employment upon separation, with many leaving without a job or being underemployed. Despite military training correlating to numerous civilian professions, veterans often have to duplicate their training to meet state certification guidelines. The \"CERT Act\" aims to help veterans transition into civilian workforce by addressing licensing and certification challenges. A commission will identify gaps between military training and civilian credentials, proposing a \"Blue Star certification\" to recognize military training as equivalent for certain licensed professions. States can adopt Blue Star certifications for entry into specific professions. The Armed Forces aim to ensure members reach Blue Star proficiency for easy transition to civilian employment. Operation Certification allows immediate application of military training to the private sector, attracting talented veterans. Modernizing military training in Blue Star specialties prepares members for any challenge upon separation. The Commission on Veteran Certification Standards is established to ensure veterans are prepared for civilian employment by modernizing military training in Blue Star specialties. The Commission on Veteran Certification Standards is established with 16 members appointed by various leaders in Congress.
