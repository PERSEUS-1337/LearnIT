    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Information Technology Partnerships Act\". The Congress acknowledges a significant shortage of information technology workers, with 200,000 to 400,000 vacancies in various IT jobs. The demand for new computer scientists, engineers, and systems analysts is projected to be over 1.3 million from 1996 to 2005. Systems analysts will see the largest job growth, with a 103 percent increase in new positions. Vacancies exist across industries like manufacturing, service, transportation, health care, education, and government at all levels. The shortage of information technology workers is negatively impacting businesses in the United States. Industry executives cite the lack of skilled workers as a major obstacle to company growth. The mismatch between university education and industry needs contributes to the shortage. Special initiatives are needed to educate and train the workforce for expanding job opportunities. Higher education institutions play a crucial role in providing oversight and technical assistance for a comprehensive education and training program to address the shortage of information technology workers. They must adapt to the digital environment by expanding outreach efforts and on-campus activities to train and certify individuals to fill the gap in the workforce. Partnerships for postsecondary information technology education and employment assistance are essential to address the shortage of IT workers. Higher education institutions need to expand outreach efforts and on-campus activities to train and certify individuals for the workforce. The Secretary may grant funds to higher education institutions to establish projects providing postsecondary IT education and employment assistance to eligible individuals through community-based organizations. Each institution can receive one grant and collaborate with multiple organizations. The provision of payments under a grant shall not exceed 5 fiscal years and is subject to annual approval by the Secretary. A community-based organization can only enter into a contract with one institution of higher education. SEC. 4. COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. Community-based organizations eligible for projects under this Act must be governmental agencies or tax-exempt organizations. They can be local partnerships, religious entities, or providers of school-age child care.

An eligible individual under this Act must have submitted an application for postsecondary IT education assistance and have a high school diploma or equivalent. Institutions of Higher Education receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds to select community-based organizations to provide postsecondary information technology education and employment assistance to eligible individuals. They must also enter into contracts with these organizations to carry out the duties required at each site. The funding for each site includes establishment, operation, site selection, personnel training, program design, equipment oversight, and contractor evaluation. Community-based organizations implementing projects under this Act with higher education institutions are responsible for site selection, hiring a site director, and conducting specified educational activities. The community-based organization implementing projects with higher education institutions must assemble an advisory committee, provide evidence of volunteer support, recruit eligible individuals for enrollment, and maintain waiting lists. The organization implementing projects must maintain waiting lists for eligible individuals, provide career counseling, and offer job placement assistance. Site requirements include having a minimum of 20 functioning computers for the curriculum specified. The site for the organization must have a classroom for 30 students, space for career counseling, a separate office for the director, be under control of the organization for at least 5 years, open for 12 hours daily, and near public transportation. The organization must offer a broad information technology curriculum with courses leading to certification in areas recognized by the National Skill Standards Board. This includes basic computer competence, on-the-job upgrade assistance, and advanced training. Enrollment requirements mandate that at least 50 percent of eligible individuals must meet specific criteria, such as receiving tax credits, state assistance, or participating in food stamp programs. Enrollment requirements specify that at least 50% of eligible individuals must be under 25 years old at the time of enrollment. For those over 50 years old, no prerequisites related to net worth, income, or assets can be applied, except when superseded by other requirements. SEC. 7.
