    "content": "The \"Free Market Energy Act of 2015\" aims to enhance personal freedom and national security by reinforcing sovereignty over personal energy choices and promoting a free market for distributed energy resources. The \"Free Market Energy Act of 2015\" defines a distributed energy resource as a resource on the electricity distribution system that includes various types of generation and storage technologies. It also establishes a general right to neutrality of interconnection. SEC. 5. GENERAL RIGHT TO NEUTRALITY OF INTERCONNECTION. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include this new section. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include a new section granting distributed energy resources a general right of interconnection. Rates and fees for interconnection must be just, reasonable, provide mutual benefits, not exceed actual costs, and not be punitive. Timeframes for interconnection must be clear, prompt, and not unnecessarily prolonged. SEC. 5. ENERGY AND RATE TREATMENTS FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. Section 111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to require State regulatory authorities to consider providing fair energy and rate treatment for distributed energy resources, including time-of-use pricing and real-time pricing for energy transactions with electric utilities. State regulatory authorities must consider fair energy and rate treatment for distributed energy resources, including time-of-use and real-time pricing, along with various benefits such as capacity, energy conservation, demand-side management, peak monthly demand, ancillary services, and societal value. SEC. 6. Qualifying facility; improved interconnection standards for distributed energy resources. Qualifying Facilities under the Federal Power Act are amended to include distributed energy resources in states without established standards. Improved interconnection standards for distributed energy resources are required in states without established standards, as per the amendment to the Qualifying Facilities under the Federal Power Act. Each State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility must consider setting rates that exceed the incremental costs. The amendment requires setting rates for purchases from distributed energy resources at the full retail rate, with fixed monthly charges for residential bills not exceeding $10 per month. Optional reevaluations of the charge amount can be considered periodically. The amendment aims to exempt distributed energy resource projects from filing requirements, ensure no impact on purchase obligations, and set just and reasonable rates for interconnection fees not exceeding actual costs. The amendment aims to set just and reasonable rates for interconnection fees that do not exceed the actual cost of service. SEC. 7 amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act to designate a smart grid coordinator or distribution system operator through a competitive process. SEC. 8 focuses on considering nontransmission alternatives. Section 111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to require State regulatory authorities to consider nontransmission alternatives when regulated utilities propose transmission projects. These alternatives should receive the avoided cost of the transmission upgrade, minus a reasonable discount, to reduce costs for ratepayers. If a nontransmission alternative is chosen, it can obviate the need for a transmission upgrade. The nontransmission alternative proposed can eliminate the need for a reliability-based transmission upgrade, with its cost recovered from the ratebase similar to the transmission upgrade. SEC. 9. COMPLIANCE. Time Limitations for State Regulatory Authorities and Nonregulated Utilities to consider standards established by section 111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Each State regulatory authority and nonregulated utility must commence consideration or set a hearing date within specified timeframes after the enactment of the paragraph. Each State regulatory authority and nonregulated utility must complete consideration and make determinations regarding standards established by specific paragraphs of section 111(d) within specified timeframes after the enactment of the paragraph. Each State regulatory authority and nonregulated utility must complete consideration and make determinations regarding standards established by specific paragraphs of section 111(d) within specified timeframes after the enactment of the paragraph. Failure to comply will result in consequences outlined in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. In the case of standards established by paragraphs (20) through (23) of section 111(d), the reference to the date of enactment of this Act is deemed to be the date of enactment of those paragraphs. Section 112 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to exempt certain electric utilities from standards if the State has already implemented a comparable standard before the enactment of this subsection. The State regulatory authority or relevant electric utility must consider implementing a standard, or the State legislature must vote on it. Amendments to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act exempt certain electric utilities if a comparable standard is already in place at the state level. SEC. 10. EFFECT OF ACT. This Act does not apply to distributed energy resource contracts already in effect."
