Ra\u00fal's assumption of power was initially seen as temporary but became permanent. Fidel's health improved in 2007, but he announced in 2008 that he would not resume his role as head of the Cuban government. Ra\u00fal was expected to be selected as the next President by the legislature. Ra\u00fal Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as the President of Cuba in 2008, following Fidel's temporary step down in 2006 due to poor health. Ra\u00fal had been the designated successor and his position as head of the Revolutionary Armed Forces made him the likely candidate. The selection of Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura as the Council of State's First Vice President was surprising, given his age and role as part of the older generation of the Cuban revolution. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, a hard-line communist party ideologue and close friend of Ra\u00fal Castro, is the official successor to Ra\u00fal according to the Cuban Constitution. Despite expectations for Carlos Lage to be chosen as First Vice President, Machado's position as First Vice President signifies a shift towards the older generation of Cuban leaders. Additionally, key military officers and confidants of Ra\u00fal have joined the Council of State, increasing the military's role in the government. General Julio Casas Regueiro, 72 years old, was appointed as one of the five vice presidents of the Council of State, with a significant role in the Cuban military and as the new Minister of the FAR. Other military figures, including Gen. Alvaro L\u00f3pez Miera and Gen. Leopoldo Cintra Fr\u00edas, also joined the Council, highlighting the military's increasing influence in the government. The political succession from Fidel to Ra\u00fal has been marked by stability, with no apparent internal conflicts threatening Ra\u00fal's leadership. After Fidel initially stepped down in 2006, Ra\u00fal mobilized troops to prevent a potential U.S. invasion and maintained calm in Cuba. Observers predicted Ra\u00fal would be more open to economic reform, possibly following a Chinese or Vietnamese model, but no significant changes have occurred yet. Ra\u00fal has implemented minor economic policy changes in Cuba, such as paying off debts to small farmers, raising prices for producers, relaxing customs regulations, and allowing private taxis to operate freely. In a speech, he acknowledged the insufficiency of Cuban salaries and called for structural changes to increase efficiency and production, including increased foreign investment. These changes hint at potential future economic reforms in Cuba. Ra\u00fal's call for structural changes in Cuba could lead to economic reforms like more private enterprise and less state ownership. He aims to make the government smaller, review the Cuban peso, and eliminate excessive regulations. Public expectations for economic reform have risen, with discussions on low salaries, housing, and transportation issues. Calls for more private businesses have been made, increasing the possibility of economic change in Cuba. Increased public frustration and disillusionment among Cuban youth with the economic situation and repressive environment could push the government to adopt policy changes. However, the presence of Fidel Castro may hinder major initiatives. The Cuban government may face challenges in implementing major policy changes that deviate from Fidel Castro's orthodox policies. Economic growth has been supported by oil subsidies from Venezuela, reducing the urgency for reforms. Fear of sparking political change and the priority of maintaining stability suggest gradual, small-scale economic reforms under Ra\u00fal Castro. The government's tight control over the political system is expected to remain unchanged. The Cuban government maintains tight control over the political system, with a strong security apparatus in place. Despite a slight decrease in the number of political prisoners, dissidents argue that repression has not lessened. The government continues to detain individuals arbitrarily, with many activists still imprisoned. There is speculation that as the new government under Ra\u00fal Castro gains confidence in social stability, there may be a softening of repression in the future. Machado as First Vice President indicates Cuba's tight control over the political system. The peaceful political succession raises questions about future U.S. policy, which currently includes economic sanctions and support for democracy. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 outlines conditions for the embargo's suspension. The Cuban government has released political prisoners and is improving human rights and judiciary. The U.S. faces a dilemma as lifting the embargo requires conditions like a civilian government in power. The Bush Administration has prepared for a political transition in Cuba with reports on supporting a transition government. Critics argue that reports on Cuba's political transition assume a rapid shift to democracy, neglecting the possibility of reform under a communist government. Despite debates in Congress and threats of veto from President Bush, no significant policy changes have occurred. Ra\u00fal's leadership in 2007 dampened calls for major policy shifts towards Cuba. Ra\u00fal Castro has made offers to engage in dialogue with the United States, but U.S. officials maintain that change in Cuba must come first. The U.S. offers to lift economic sanctions if Cuba transitions to democracy. Ra\u00fal Castro has offered to negotiate with the United States, emphasizing the importance of Cuba's independence and principles of equality, reciprocity, non-interference, and mutual respect. The Bush Administration is willing to work with Congress to lift the embargo if Cuba meets certain conditions, including freeing political prisoners and respecting human rights. Castro has reiterated his willingness to engage in dialogue with the United States multiple times. Ra\u00fal Castro has offered to negotiate with the United States, criticizing U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba and urging the next U.S. Administration to reconsider their policies. The U.S. State Department responded by emphasizing the need for dialogue with the Cuban people. Despite Fidel Castro stepping down, U.S. officials maintained their stance on Cuba policy. Ra\u00fal Castro's succession presents two contrasting policy approaches. In the context of Ra\u00fal Castro's succession, there are two policy approaches for dealing with political change in Cuba: maintaining economic sanctions or easing sanctions to influence the Cuban government. Advocates of sanctions argue that Ra\u00fal Castro's regime has not shown willingness to improve conditions. Supporters of current policy believe that easing sanctions would strengthen the communist regime. Advocates for easing sanctions on Cuba argue that the United States should take advantage of Cuba's political succession to abandon its ineffective sanctions-based policy. They believe that maintaining the status quo would only prolong hostility between the two countries and hinder positive change in Cuba. Incremental reforms through engagement and negotiation are seen as a way to spur further change in Cuba."
