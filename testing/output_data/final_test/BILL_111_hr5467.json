The Congress finds that high school graduation rates are low, especially among Black and Hispanic students, leading to negative outcomes such as poverty, crime, and drug use. Dropout prevention is crucial for societal and economic well-being. High school turnaround requires a comprehensive approach addressing instructional improvement and structural changes. Effective organizations partnering with low-performing schools can build capacity for reform. However, there is a shortage of experienced organizations at the high school level. Not all states will qualify for funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to reform low-performing schools, despite having such schools. High school turnaround challenges include the need for alternative strategies beyond charter schools. Not all failing high schools are eligible for improvement grants, requiring external partnership organizations for expertise. The capacity of many local educational agencies is insufficient to address the issue comprehensively. High school turnaround challenges require alternative strategies beyond charter schools, with external partnership organizations needed for expertise. The section aims to improve graduation rates and college readiness for disadvantaged students, enhance teacher quality in high-risk schools, provide support to turnaround partners, and establish new programs. The section aims to establish new programs for high school turnaround that do not involve charter schools, with a focus on research-based models customized to meet the unique needs of schools and local educational agencies.

It also highlights a staffing structure that creates strong, long-term connections between students and teachers, ensuring an engaged and knowledgeable support network that fosters strong relationships for higher student performance. The curr_chunk focuses on standards of professional practice, extended day and school year, and maintaining core subject teachers and guidance counselors throughout high school to support student success with a challenging curriculum. The curr_chunk discusses the expectations for parents to be actively involved in school activities and provide feedback on their child's progress. It also mentions the use of multiple mechanisms to assess a school's effectiveness. The term \"low-income student\" is defined as a student from a low-income family. A \"school district partnership turnaround organization\" is a nonprofit focused on improving graduation rates for low-income students with a successful high school turnaround model. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. The Secretary of Education can award 5-year contracts to school district partnership turnaround organizations for comprehensive high school turnaround models. These contracts aim to implement and sustain education reform services at low-performing high schools by partnering with local educational agencies serving low-income students. The Secretary of Education awards 5-year contracts to school district partnership turnaround organizations to implement comprehensive high school turnaround models. The models aim to reflect local educational agencies' needs, improve teacher quality, develop agency capacity, implement new turnaround sites, and promote awareness of the benefits of personalized and academically rigorous high schools for low-income students. The school district partnership turnaround organization implements a comprehensive high school turnaround model to improve graduation rates and college readiness for low-income students. Activities include designing a customized plan, training school personnel in student support structures, and providing performance data for assessment. The comprehensive high school turnaround model includes offsite and school-based professional development, networking opportunities, guidance on turnaround strategies, customized activities for teacher improvement, parent engagement support, and assistance with staff and student recruitment. Each school assisted under this Act must assign an administrator as a liaison to the school district partnership turnaround organization, ensure necessary policies and resources are in place, schedule common planning time for staff, and provide sufficient teaching staff in core and non-core areas. To implement the comprehensive high school turnaround model, schools must ensure teachers are experts in their areas, assign a full-time counselor, collaborate on student support programs, conduct parent engagement activities, attend professional development, and participate in data collection activities. Administrative costs must be limited. The school district partnership turnaround organization must limit administration costs to 8 percent when carrying out a contract. The Secretary will evaluate student performance at turnaround schools every 3 years using a rigorous research design, comparing indicators with students from similar backgrounds at non-assisted schools. The school district partnership turnaround organization requires partner schools to provide data on student demographics, attendance, grades, suspensions, safety incidents, graduation rates, test scores, teacher retention for implementation reports. An annual report on the high school turnaround model and student achievement is prepared. Copies of evaluations are available. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes necessary funds for fiscal year 2011 and the following 5 years. Evaluations and reports must be provided to the Secretary and Congress."
